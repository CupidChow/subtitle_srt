3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,420
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,650
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,980
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:46,560
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:55,680
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,170
♫  I do not fear  ♫

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  How the world treats me  ♫

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,500
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad  ♫

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,290
♫  There are times when I'm fragile  ♫

14
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,120
♫  Heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,200
♫  My existence  ♫

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,240
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,140
   

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,000
   

19
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,720
 Ye Qingyu. Pianran. 

20
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,160
 Your Highness, please take this bottle of Ruo Water. 

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,020
 All right. 

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,030
 What's special about this bottle of Ruo Water? 

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,620
 I was worried for Your Highness. 

24
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,400
 In case something happens, 

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,570
 I have prepared this special bottle of Ruo Water for you. 

26
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,150
 It can greatly enhance the power of the Puppet Soldiers, 

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,720
 which may save your life. 

28
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,070
 I still have you, don't I? 

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,730
 If our plan still fails, 

30
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,200
 then I will rush into the palace and kill all the people Tantai Jin cares about in front of him. 

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,850
 Fu Yu, you won't die for nothing. 

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,180
 I will return everything I have suffered back to Tantai Jin. 

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,470
 Run! 

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,770
 Run! 

35
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,760
 Run for your life! 

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,460
Dad! Dad!

37
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,830
Dad! Dad!

38
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,340
It's chaos out there.

39
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,160
They said that Tantai Minglang's rebel army have entered the city,

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
and they are killing the civilians.

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,900
Let's run!

42
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,020
Chuntao, pack up some small valuables and money and leave everything else behind.

43
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,610
We have to hurry and run. Go, hurry!

44
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,270
Hurry up!

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,830
Dad.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Dad, what are you doing?

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,900
Doing what I should do.

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,920
But, Dad, this is the Jing capital,

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,750
and what does this kingdom have to do with us?

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,090
Zeyu, I am already in my old age

51
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,100
and my days are numbered.

52
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,130
I was powerless when our Sheng Kingdom suffered defeat and decline.

53
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,750
That made me disloyal.

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,750
I will never forgive myself even till my death.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,670
Now that the kingdoms are unified,

56
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,060
the people of every kingdom are all citizens of the same country.

57
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,890
As someone who practices martial arts,

58
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,750
if I turn a blind eye to the rebels slaughtering innocent people,

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,290
I am unrighteous.

60
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,640
I, Ye Xiao, am not a disloyal and unrighteous person.

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,650
Dad…

62
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,270
Zeyu, take Chuntao with you and escape from the east side as quickly as you can.

63
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,600
No, Dad…

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,130
Dad!

65
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,660
Dad!

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,380
 I'll kill Tantai Jin's beloved woman, 

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,850
 and Fu Yu, 

68
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,480
 I will have avenged you. 

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
Dad!

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,050
I am also a man from the Ye family, so I must go with you!

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Eldest Young Master! Old Master!

72
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,680
Chuntao, have you packed up the money?

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Don't lose it.

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
We may not be able to take care of you in the future.

75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,550
You should take good care of yourself.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,860
Indeed, you are a man of Ye family.

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,080
Dad!

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,420
Tantai Minglang is so despicable.

79
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,110
He actually used sorcery to control the people.

80
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,200
Dad, are you all right?

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,130
I'm fine.

82
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,490
Son, let's protect the people together!

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,770
- Don't kill me! 
 - Where are Ye Bingchang and Ye Xiwu?

84
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,220
I'll show you the way.

85
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't kill me!

86
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,180
 The divine essence has been cultivated. 

87
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,940
Old Master! Old Master!

88
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,780
Eldest Young Master! Old Master!

89
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,130
Old Master!

90
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,510
Old Master died in battle to protect the people.

91
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,640
Your Majesty, there are survivors.

92
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,680
Your Majesty, these people have been infused with Spirit Fire by Tantai Minglang,

93
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,110
and are already dead.

94
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,380
They are here doing this probably to threaten us.

95
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,270
Your Majesty, it's dangerous. Don't go there!

96
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,820
 Third Younger Brother, do you like the surprise I gave you? 

97
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,360
 Hold on. 

98
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,380
 Things are just starting. 

99
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,540
 I will make everything you cherish 

100
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,540
 disappear one by one in front of you. 

101
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,180
Tantai Minglang,

102
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,320
 I will kill you! 

103
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,340
   

104
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,380
Third Brother!

105
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,140
   

106
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,710
What took you so long?

107
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,890
You kept me waiting for a long time.

108
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,140
 Tantai Jin. 

109
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,540
I got you two great presents.

110
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,550
You are really lucky when it comes to love.

111
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,600
I specially dressed them up nicely for you.

112
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,290
 The battle at the southern border almost exhausted my power, 

113
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,270
 I can't expose any flaws. 

114
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,140
Tantai Minglang, I have completely wiped out your subordinates.

115
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,130
You are now undoubtedly defeated.

116
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,260
What's the point of putting up a stiff resistance?

117
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,560
With my current appearance,

118
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,450
what can't I do?

119
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,390
You are right.

120
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,090
I lost to you this time, and I am afraid that I cannot make a comeback.

121
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,880
However, I don't want to go to hell alone.

122
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't, please!

123
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,840
I am reasonable.

124
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,010
Choose one of your beloveds to return to your side,

125
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,000
- and the other will be buried with me. 
 - No!

126
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,780
How is that?

127
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,410
Tantai Minglang, don't go too far!

128
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,220
Ye Xiwu or Ye Bingchang?

129
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,760
Make a choice.

130
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,770
 The Lightning Punishment is getting closer. 

131
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,310
 Ye Xiwu, at such a critical point, 

132
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,860
 don't you even want to take a look at me? 

133
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,900
If you don't choose, I will take both of them.

134
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,420
No!

135
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,550
 I only have one chance to hit. 

136
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,760
So, have you decided?

137
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,420
Your Majesty, please, save me!

138
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,450
 - Ye Xiwu,  
 - I don't want to die!

139
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,270
 - don't you want me to save you?  
 - I don't want to die!

140
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,530
 When two people are wearing the Yin-Yang Bracelets, 

141
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,280
 as long as the one wearing the Yang Bracelet doesn't die, 

142
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,600
 the wearer of the Yin Bracelet won't die. 

143
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,190
 The principle is that the one wearing the Yang Bracelet is using his lifespan 

144
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,610
 to resist the fatal disaster for the wearer of the Yin Bracelet. 

145
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,670
 Ye Xiwu, even if you loathe me, 

146
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,720
 I will do anything to keep you alive. 

147
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,710
Choose!

148
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,870
Or I'll kill both of them!

149
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,840
Save me!

150
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,490
Choose!

151
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,280
Let go of...

152
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,370
Ye Bingchang.

153
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,790
 That's good. 

154
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,710
 This way, I don't owe you anything anymore. 

155
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,770
 Ye Xiwu, don't you even care? 

156
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,340
It looks like you mean very little to him.

157
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,860
Let me relieve you, then.

158
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,080
   

159
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,180
 You can never repay me. 

160
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,420
No, no way…

161
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,030
Ye Xiwu, what are you doing?

162
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,200
Stop it!

163
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,720
 Ye Xiwu, don't you leave me! 

164
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,480
 I will not allow you to leave me again, not like how Sang Jiu did. 

165
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,300
The World-Alluring Jade?

166
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Ye Xiwu, why do you have it?

167
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,680
This World-Alluring Jade

168
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,960
was exchanged with my left eye from you.

169
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,300
♫  I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time  ♫

170
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,740
♫  To forget everything that's occurred  ♫

171
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,430
It was you…

172
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,140
♫  ...I can exchange my tears for your return; My heart's in flames  ♫

173
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,560
This is your eye?

174
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,320
Ye Xiwu, why did you do that?

175
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Because you lost an eye,

176
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,180
and you looked really pitiful.

177
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,400
- You were about to die. 
  -Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin! 

178
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,280
At that time, I thought that you should not bear the curse.

179
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,610
 Tantai Jin, now only one of us can survive, 

180
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,600
 and I choose you. 

181
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,990
 I will bear the curse... 

182
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,360
 of the World-Alluring Jade. 

183
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You see, now the curse is about to be fulfilled on me.

184
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,330
No... it won't.

185
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,160
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart...  ♫

186
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,510
Tantai Jin, stop wasting your strength.

187
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,110
The Lightning Punishment comes after me.

188
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,110
With your mortal body, you can't block it.

189
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,440
Why did you take matters into your own hands and do these things for me?

190
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
Yes,

191
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,900
Tantai Jin,

192
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,820
because you are the Devil Lord.

193
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,200
You were already the greatest curse in this world,

194
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,760
born with the burden of all beings' sins.

195
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,620
What are you talking about? What Devil Lord?

196
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,270
Ye Xiwu, what the hell are you saying?

197
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,670
Tantai Jin, do you know why you were born to suffer loneliness

198
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,470
with weak family ties?

199
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,310
Why were you born without love threads?

200
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,950
Why do demons fear your blood?

201
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,910
Because you are not an ordinary person.

202
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,800
You were born with an evil bone

203
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
and destined to become the new Devil Lord,

204
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,050
destroying Heaven and Earth and overturning the universe.

205
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,080
Impossible.

206
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,480
♫  Did you know even the wisest soul...  ♫

207
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,840
That's not true.

208
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,010
You are lying.

209
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,970
What Devil Lord?

210
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,410
That's ridiculous!

211
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,100
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is  ♫

212
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,540
♫  Like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

213
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,180
♫  If fate is a calamity, it never ends  ♫

214
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,070
Is it ridiculous?

215
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,520
I don't mind telling you.

216
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,930
Actually, I am not Ye Xiwu in the first place.

217
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,940
I was born in the immortal sect.

218
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
The reason why I came to you...

219
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
and became your wife, Ye Xiwu,

220
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,760
was to reverse the fate

221
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,800
and save the world that you destroyed.

222
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,070
 Now, the Four Continents and Three Realms 

223
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,560
 have become a world of devils and demons. 

224
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,480
 Today, I will slaughter all beings in the immortal sect. 

225
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,170
 From now on, there will be not one immortal bone left 

226
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,210
 in these Four Continents and Three Realms. 

227
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,330
 Dad! 

228
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,970
Impossible.

229
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,710
I don't even know them.

230
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,230
I have never killed them.

231
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,830
That's not me, Ye Xiwu.

232
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,100
Who are you?

233
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,980
All these...

234
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,500
have nothing to do with you anymore.

235
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,580
Ye Xiwu, in your mind,

236
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,770
am I really so horrible to the degree

237
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,560
that I am not worthy of your trust?

238
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,010
Trust?

239
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,540
Tantai Jin, why should I gamble the fate of all living beings

240
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,470
on the extremely faint hope that there may still be

241
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,870
a trace of goodness in the heart of the Devil Lord?

242
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,050
I cannot afford to take that risk.

243
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,720
What a high-sounding explanation.

244
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,400
Fine.

245
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,300
You've always been heartless.

246
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,070
I'm not some Devil Lord.

247
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,010
Ye Xiwu,

248
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,580
let me tell you.

249
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,510
I...

250
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,850
will never allow you to leave me.

251
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,530
Even if my soul shatters,

252
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,480
and even if I die under this Lightning Punishment,

253
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,690
I will not let go of you.

254
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,450
Tantai Jin, don't overestimate yourself.

255
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,610
From beginning to end,

256
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,420
you were just a target of my mission.

257
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,490
I shot six Soul-slaying Spikes into you.

258
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,580
I did hurt you,

259
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,640
but I also bore...

260
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,300
the pain from the World-Alluring Jade.

261
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,630
Now I'm taking your evil bone...

262
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,320
and paying you back with the divine essence.

263
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,810
You won't become the Devil Lord anymore.

264
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,760
What did you say?

265
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,930
Now we are even.

266
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,050
You won't be able to keep me.

267
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:55,050
 Tantai Jin, you hate me so much... 

268
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 and I also hate you to the bone. 

269
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,720
 My divine essence for your evil bone. 

270
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
 We don't owe each other anything. 

271
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,420
Ye Xiwu, I don't want your essence.

272
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,890
I'll return it to you.

273
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,950
Stop it now!

274
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,280
I said I wouldn't let you leave me.

275
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,740
Even if I have to live in your hatred forever,

276
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,610
I'm willing to accept that!

277
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,190
You can't do this to me!

278
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,450
Heaven above!

279
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,740
I'm willing to give my body, my soul,

280
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,410
and my all.

281
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,560
In exchange, I only wish that...

282
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,460
you and I...

283
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,980
will never meet again forever.

284
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,920
Ye Xiwu,

285
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,740
are you going to abandon me, too?

286
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
♫  Seeing all the colors of the wind  ♫

287
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,660
♫  Being drowned by the sea of clouds  ♫

288
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,220
 Why did you come back to save me? 

289
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,760
 Because I like you, all right? 

290
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,570
 What is love exactly? 

291
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,220
 Love is... Love is you don't want him to die. 

292
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,960
 You want to stay with him. 

293
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,470
 You'll be worried if you don't see him. 

294
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,360
 And you'll be happy if you do. 

295
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,710
 Tantai Jin, being confined in that little attic all day long, 

296
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,480
 you will become a freak. 

297
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,940
♫  Stranded by a flash of thought in wisdom  ♫

298
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,470
 I don't care...

 whether others like me or not. 

300
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,780
 It's enough... 

301
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,890
 as long as you are willing to like me. 

302

♫  Maybe, the only way to solve a catastrophe  ♫

306
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,640

♫  and break the connection between the sky and the water  ♫

308
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,670
 Don't worry. I will be by your side from now on, 

309
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,520
 and no one will dare to harm you anymore. 

310
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,520
 We can be this happy every year. 

311
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,760
 We still have a chance. 

312
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,630
 Now, in this world, 

313
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,540
 only she hasn't abandoned me. 

314
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,190
 Only she's willing to return to me, 

315
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,150
 Willing to keep me company. Willing to love me. 

316
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,560
 I can ask for nothing more. 

317
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,670
 Ye Xiwu! 

318
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,860
   

319
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,290
Ye Xiwu,

320
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,970
didn't I lock you up in the cold palace

321
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,100
so you can never escape from me again?

322
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,510
What are you doing here?

323
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,990
Wake up, Ye Xiwu!

324
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,690
Don't sleep. Get up. Okay?

325
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes, I still have the bracelets.

326
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,090
Ye Xiwu, as long as I'm alive, you'll be fine.

327
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,930
Nothing's going to happen to you. We still have the bracelets.

328
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,450
Where's your bracelet?

329
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,260
Ye Xiwu, where did your bracelet go?

330
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,740
The bracelet.

331
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,550
Ye Xiwu, I found it.

332
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,280
Ye Xiwu, I found it.

333
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,070
I got your bracelet back. You'll be okay.

334
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,530
You'll wake up soon.

335
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,000
Why?

336
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,280
Why doesn't it work?

337
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,000
Why?

338
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,540
Your Majesty, the rebels have all been destroyed.

339
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,220
Ye Xiwu...

340
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,970
 It's too cold outside. 

341
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,520
 Let me take you home. 

342
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,580
♫  Every pair of stars from the east and the west  ♫

343
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,080
♫  were lonely souls in the beginning  ♫

344
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,140
♫  Tossing and turning, falling hard for you, I was entangled by the thread of love  ♫

345
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,900
♫  Karma is too deep to fathom  ♫

346
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,240
♫  Turning a deaf ear to gathering and dispersing  ♫

347
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,660
♫  Heaven's will is to blame for the sentence of our separation  ♫

348
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,990
 Tantai Jin, come home with me. 

349
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,120
 Let's celebrate it together at home. 

350
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,340
♫   ...who loves the world that you cherish  ♫

351
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,490
 I only thought you'd feel lonely in the palace. 

352
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,280
 This trip was meant to cheer you up. 

353
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,500
♫  You'll only imprison your heart  ♫

354
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,360
♫  The ashes on the moon turned silent  ♫

355
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,960
 I give you this opportunity... to pick a place you like, 

356
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,540
 and decide where you want to be buried. 

357
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,100
 Stop your gloating. I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you? 

358
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,840
 Mother, she is Ye Xiwu. 

359
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,620
 I'm your daughter-in-law. 

360
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,710
 If you saw her for yourself, 

361
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,580
 you'd love her. 

362
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,120
♫  The remaining gentleness  ♫

363
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,900
♫  Thaws out my remaining years for you  ♫

364
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,080
 Are you willing to be with me in the future? 

365
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,500
♫  ...Is the pain from loving you  ♫

366
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,190
 Rest assured. From now on, 

367
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,350
 I'll cling to you every day. 

368
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,470
 You have no way to get rid of me now. 

369
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,140
 All right. 

370
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,810
♫  My body was broken to pieces at the moment of falling flowers  ♫

371
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,770
 Once, I was like a blind man living in the dark. 

372
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,060
 I was trapped in the void for more than 20 years. 

373
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,430
 People say that the sun is bright and warm. 

374
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,030
 But I didn't know what true brightness meant... 

375
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,630
 until I met you. 

376
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:48,040
♫  You alone animated the whole mortal world  ♫

377
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,830
Dad.

378
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,620
Mom.

379
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,680
Chief, the doctor said, His Majesty's heart was gravely injured, to begin with.

380
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,330
Now he suffers from too much grief. It's hard to tell when he'll wake up.

381
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,860
What about other casualties?

382
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,550
Chief Pianran died on her post. General Ye is being treated.

383
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,470
He hasn't woken up yet.

384
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,170
What about the other Ye family members?

385
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:16,800
Ye Xiao and Ye Zeyu died protecting the civilians when the rebels entered the city.

386
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
They have been encoffined.

387
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
Give them a proper funeral.

388
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,770
Also, Ye Bingchang went missing in the chaos.

389
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,080
We've been searching for her. No results yet.

390
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,760
Keep searching.

391
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,360
Dead or alive, she must be found.

392
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,180
Yes.

393
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,320
 This is Ye Xiwu's room. 

394
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,900
 Why would it be like this? 

395
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,240
 Tantai Jin. 

396
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,720
 Tantai Jin, when are you going to be back? 

397
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,530
Ye Xiwu.

398
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,230
Where are you?

399
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,290
 From now on, I'll cling to you every day. 

400
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,110
 You have no way to get rid of me now. 

401
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,570
Ye Xiwu, come out!

402
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,620
Ye Xiwu, where are you hiding?

403
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,270
Come out!

404
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,380
Ye Xiwu, just come out!

405
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,830
Come out!

406
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,630
Why?

407
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,200
 Because she's dead. 

408
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,810
 She got rid of you forever. 

409
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,120
 - In order to leave you,  
 - Come out.

410
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,060
 - she's even willing to die.  
 - Come out.

411
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,050
Nonsense! Come out now!

412
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,270
 She's dead. 

413
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:11,800
 But I won't die. 

414
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Come out!

415
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,120
Just come out!

416
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,510
 Is it because of that woman? 

417
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,220
 What a pity. 

418
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,030
Get away from me!

419
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,520
 She's dead. Everyone around you will leave you. 

420
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,160
That's not true.

421
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,700
 You will only bring disaster to those who stay with you. 

422
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,660
 They all hate you. They'd rather die to get away from you. 

423
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,400
 Look how your hands are stained with her blood. 

424
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,480
 From beginning to end, you can only live alone. 

425
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,470
What a shame.

426
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,830
I will never...

427
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,530
let you have your way.

428
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,530
Ye Xiwu won't leave me!

429
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,130
Why don't you show up now?

430
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,700
Prove it to him now!

431
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Ye Xiwu!

432
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,360
Ye Xiwu!

433
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,770
Ye Xiwu!

434
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,330
Ye Xiwu!

435
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,200
Ye Xiwu!

436
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,760
Your Majesty!

437
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,910
Your Majesty!

438
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,410
Your Majesty, the doctor said you need to rest.

439
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,060
Just take a good rest, Your Majesty.

440
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,780
Where's Ye Xiwu?

441
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,060
I'm asking you where Ye Xiwu is!

442
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,500
I don't know.

443
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,640
- Scram! 
 - Your Majesty!

444
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,320
Ye Xiwu.

445
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,320
There you are.

446
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,900
I've been looking everywhere for you.

447
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,810
No.

448
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,500
Why are you here?

449
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,420
It's so cold here.

450
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,300
Wake up. Come back with me.

451
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,230
Ye Xiwu, wake up!

452
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm talking to you, Ye Xiwu!

453
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,840
 She's dead. 

454
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,390
Ye Xiwu, get up.

455
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,110
 - She abandoned you.  
 - Just get up!

456
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,650
No.

457
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,730
Ye Xiwu, I'm talking to you.

458
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,160
I'm talking to you!

459
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,500
Why don't you answer?

460
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,930
Speak!

461
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,810
Speak!

462
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,840
Didn't you want to kill me?

463
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,510
Weren't you more heartless than me?

464
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,200
I'm right in front of you!

465
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,290
I'm right here!

466
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,140
Get up and keep killing me!

467
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,470
Keep hating me!

468
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,160
Just say one word.

469
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,850
Just one word.

470
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,180
Ye Xiwu.

471
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,260
Ye Xiwu.

472
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,740
I really hate you.

473
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,020
 From beginning to end, 

474
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,500
 you can only live alone. 

475
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,790
 You won't have it your way. 

476
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,670
 If I can't save her, 

477
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,330
 I'll die with her! 

478
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,710
The post-war compensations have all been done.

479
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,140
The hardest times are finally over.

480
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,290
But I'm just wondering when His Majesty will get himself together.

481
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,660
If this goes on, I'm afraid his body will…

482
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,680
Send more hands over there.

483
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,400
Including the hall.

484
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,540
Go ahead now.

485
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,220
General Ye.

486
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,220
Can you walk now?

487
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,080
What about His Majesty?

488
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,930
His Majesty has confined himself in the mourning hall.

489
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,500
General Ye, you're the younger brother of Second Young Miss after all.

490
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,230
Please go talk to him.

491
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,640
You're his only family now.

492
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,430
- I'll go see him. 
 - Hold on.

493
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,070
His Majesty sealed the door with demon power.

494
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,540
Regular people can't get in.

495
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,560
We have to find a way.

496
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,180
It's fine.

497
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,750
I can get in.

498
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,390
Let's go.

499
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,660
What's this?

500
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,900
He melted the original Ruo Water Ice Coffin,

501
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,320
so that he could be sealed with Ye Xiwu forever.

502
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,110
Just like…

503
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,180
Just like amber.

504
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,300
General Ye, one will die of coldness

505
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,350
if he's lying in there for too long.

506
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,560
We must get His Majesty out of it first.

507
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,220
Your Majesty!

508
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,430
Your Majesty!

509
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,270
Your Majesty!

510
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,180
How dare you do this?

511
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,000
Your Majesty.

512
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,390
Get out.

513
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,260
You're courting death.

514
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,060
And you're hindering my sister from leaving the world decently.

515
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,860
Leaving?

516
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,430
She's my wife.

517
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,060
She's my queen!

518
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,740
She can only be with me!

519
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,640
What if I insist on taking her away?

520
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,360
Go ahead if you dare.

521
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,200
Why would she marry you? Don't you know that?

522
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,590
She said she loved me!

523
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,870
Nian Baiyu, stay out of it!

524
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,190
My sister might have loved you, but you?

525
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,670
You used her to kill Xiao Lin with her own hands!

526
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,420
You tortured her so much that she had to kill herself!

527
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,270
 Now you're still trying to trap her and to stop her from leaving. 

528
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,660
Tantai Jin, you hate her so much, huh?

529
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,030
 No. I don't hate her. 

530
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,340
 She's the only one who's good to me. 

531
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,910
 The only one who loved me. 

532
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,040
 Ye Qingyu, do you understand? 

533
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,360
 You! 

534
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,190
Break it off!

535
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,790
Since that's the case, just let my sister go.

536
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,530
No.

537
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,980
   

538
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:30,890

♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

♫  We'll never meet again  ♫

545

♫  I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words  ♫

♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

550

♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

551
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,280
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

552
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:43,240
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

553
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,840
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

554
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,660
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

558
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,460
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

559
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,080
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

560
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,120
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

561
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:27,820
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

562
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:36,660
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
