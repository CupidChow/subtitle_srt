15
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,250
<i>Father. Senior Brother. I'm so useless.</i>

16
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,900
<i>I couldn't save the Four Continents and Three Realms. And I didn't stop Devil Lord from resurging.</i>

17
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,940
<i>This is…</i>

18
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,120
<i>The ancient divine artifact, World-Alluring Jade?</i>

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,270
<i>Martial Uncle once told me, it's an ominous object lost tens of thousands of years ago.</i>

20
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,630
<i>It was forged by a female devil with tens of thousands of immortal bones.</i>

21
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,890
<i>Why is it at the bottom of the Mo River?</i>

22
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,310
<i>And why would it save me?</i>

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,440
<i>Forget it. I'll just keep it and get out of here first.</i>

24
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,680
<i>Congratulations, Your Highness!</i>

25
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,380
This time we wiped out Tantai Jin because of Your Highness's leadership.

26
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,770
I'm willing to die for Your Highness without hesitation!

27
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,280
What's your name?

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Qi Shuang. I used to be the deputy leader of the Moonshadow Guard.

29
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,200
The demon core Tantai Jin consumed was arranged by me.

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,440
Qi Shuang. I will remember this name.

31
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,930
And you just said you're really willing to…

32
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,010
I'm willing to die for Your Highness without hesitation!

33
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,580
Good.

34
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,070
Your Highness, what are you…

35
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,950
Someone, take him away.

36
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,510
Feed him to my pets.

37
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,970
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,580
No, Your Highness!

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,080
Your Highness! At least I worked hard for you, Your Highness!

40
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,050
- I won't raise a dog that bites its master.
<i>- Your Highness!</i>

41
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,730
Wise decision, Your Highness!

42
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,000
Those freshly caught demon creatures are starving right now.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
By the way, you must raise them properly.

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Someday they'll be of great use.

45
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
I shall do my best.

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
If Tantai Jin can manipulate demon power,

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,820
I should be able to, as well.

48
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,190
- Wise decision, Your Highness!
- Wise decision, Your Highness!

49
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,840
Leader, I heard this Tantai Minglang enjoys torturing people.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,830
Just now, Qi Shuang was dragged out.

51
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,040
He's probably been executed.

52
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,130
His Highness needs some Yiyue girls.

53
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

54
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,800
All of you, raise your heads!

55
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,580
It's your blessing to be selected by His Highness.

56
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,710
This one and that one. Take them.

57
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,560
Get up!

58
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,690
- Get up!
- Come on. Faster.

59
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,970
Move!

60
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,630
Move! Come on!

61
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,860
Faster!

62
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,930
Go!

63
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,410
Come on!

64
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,050
Sister.

65
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,620
Baiyu.

66
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,970
You two, go save the other girls.

67
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,960
You go find our weapons.

68
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Go.

69
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,840
Let's go.

70
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,700
We've been running for a night.

71
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,680
Everyone, get some rest.

72
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,440
<i>Go.</i>

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Leader, the high priestess betrayed us and His Highness is missing.

74
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,100
What should we do?

75
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,550
I have sworn to serve His Highness with my life. I will not go back on my word.

76
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm going to find him.

77
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,380
We'll follow you. We'll go wherever you go.

78
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,320
- Yes!
- Yes!

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,940
My good brothers!

80
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,700
Sister, you take them back to Yiyue tribe first.

81
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Leave the rest to the Moonshadow Guard.

82
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,130
I guess there's no other way.

83
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,570
Baiyu, you must stay safe.

84
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,190
- Moonshadow Guard, listen!
- Yes!

85
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,420
You four escort the girls back to the Yiyue tribe.

86
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,470
The rest of you, come with me to find His Highness!

87
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,070
- Yes!
- Yes!

88
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,650
I'm freezing.

89
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,800
Tantai Jin, just wait.

90
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,450
<i>But where should I go next?</i>

91
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,660
<i>Back to the Sheng Kingdom?</i>

92
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
<i>No.</i>

93
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,380
<i>Tantai Jin has clearly gone astray.</i>

94
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>I have to stop him from becoming a devil.</i>

95
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,190
<i>If he goes to the Jing Kingdom, I must follow him there to watch him.</i>

96
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,200
<i>Dear Grandmother and Father, wish you are well.</i>

97
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,510
<i>I am safe.</i>

98
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,500
<i>I have been doing well.</i>

99
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,370
<i>I have enough food and money.</i>

100
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,100
<i>Grandmother, don't worry about me.</i>

101
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,380
<i>Jing Kingdom is a beautiful place.</i>

102
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,800
<i>When I finish sightseeing, I'll go back home.</i>

103
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,940
<i>From Xiwu.</i>

104
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,370
Hi, mister. How long does it take to transport goods to the capital of Sheng?

105
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,840
Less than three days. Rest assured. I'll deliver it personally to your mansion.

106
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,870
Thank you.

107
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,350
My father will reward you when he gets it.

108
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,900
Little girl, why are you hanging around all alone?

109
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,030
Why don't you go home?

110
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,810
There's something important that I must do.

111
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,420
<i>Another hundred miles along the river, and then I'll be in the Jing Kingdom.</i>

112
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,140
<i>The evil bone is still in Tantai Jin's body.</i>

113
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,800
<i>If he degenerates into a devil or dies accidentally, everything will be in vain.</i>

114
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,670
<i>Someone's there.</i>

115
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,550
Hello.

116
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,390
Are you all right?

117
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
Tantai Jin?

118
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,030
Stop playing dead. Don't try and play this trick.

119
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,790
No matter how pitiful you look, I won't fall for it!

120
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,450
Tantai Jin?

121
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,760
Tantai Jin?

122
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,870
He's so cold. Tantai Jin!

123
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,250
Tantai Jin, wake up!

124
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,920
Tantai Jin!

125
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Tantai Jin, wake up!

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,650
You can't die.

127
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,760
Tantai Jin, you mustn't die!

128
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,100
Tantai Jin!

129
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,570
Tantai Jin!

130
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,060
Tantai Jin!

131
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,840
Wake up, Tantai Jin!

132
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,430
Tantai Jin!

133
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,830
Karma comes so quickly.

134
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,170
You were alive and kicking when you tried to capture me.

135
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,220
Only a few hours later, you're in my hands half-dead.

136
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,520
What are you looking at?

137
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,840
If not for the sake of my father and my family, I would just slap you to death and bury you right here.

138
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,420
You'd better move as little as possible.

139
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,050
When pressing water out of you,

140
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,380
I accidentally broke a few of your ribs.

141
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,960
How come it's you?

142
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,250
Why did you save me?

143
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,500
None of your business.

144
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,690
Tantai Jin, I'm telling you. Now you're in my hands.

145
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,890
I can save you and I can also kill you.

146
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,790
If you let yourself die without my permission, I'll tear you to pieces and throw you into the wilderness.

147
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,450
<i>As expected, I can't see.</i>

148
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,440
All right, now it's my turn.

149
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,420
Whether you like it or not, you must answer my questions honestly.

150
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,220
What questions?

151
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,040
We've only been apart for a few hours.

152
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,620
What exactly happened on the ship?

153
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,910
Why have you washed ashore and lost one eye?

154
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,880
Are you going to answer or not?

155
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,210
I was ambushed by Tantai Minglang.

156
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,170
Tantai Minglang?

157
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,100
Your elder brother from the Jing Kingdom?

158
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
Why would he do that?

159
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,790
You should ask him about it.

160
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
Fine, next question.

161
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,620
did only you escape from there?

162
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,200
Where's Jing Lan'an? Isn't she with you?

163
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,620
She's dead.

164
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,760
Tantai Minglang killed her?

165
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,650
I killed her.

166
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,340
Tantai Jin, this punch is for those who died because of you.

167
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,850
This is both for Jing Lan'an and me.

168
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,190
I tried to treat you sincerely, save and protect you, but now I really regret it.

169
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,950
Jing Lan'an saved your life. She brought you up.

170
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,450
You drank her blood and were taught by her. But you killed her!

171
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,190
<i>Auntie,</i>

172
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,310
<i>let me ask you. Do you regret betraying me?</i>

173
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,030
<i>My child,</i>

174
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,510
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

175
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,290
Yes, I killed her.

176
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,030
You've gone insane.

177
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,570
You're right.

178
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,750
She brought me up. She gave me life.

179
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,900
On that New Year's Eve, when she came for me,

180
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,140
I really wished...

181
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,350
she didn't abandon me.

182
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,950
What?

183
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,490
Of all the things she did, she shouldn't have returned after leaving.

184
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,830
She gave me hope but then discarded me like trash.

185
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,100
What did Jing Lan'an do?

186
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,870
Nothing.

187
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,140
It's just betrayal.

188
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,260
She and Yingxin did the same.

189
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,030
She betrayed me.

190
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,940
<i>Turns out she let me go in order to kill Tantai Jin.</i>

191
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,410
<i>Did she collude with Tantai Minglang?</i>

192
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,740
Tantai Jin, I'm going to escort you back to the Sheng Kingdom.

193
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,600
And then put you in prison to keep you from the outside world.

194
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,350
I'll be watching you every second of every day.

195
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,610
As long as I'm alive, don't ever think of devouring demon cores or killing people.

196
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,720
What are you laughing at?

197
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,180
Ye Xiwu, your stupid words were both strange and funny.

198
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,670
Why don't you just kill me?

199
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,820
Why do you try to be bound with me forever?

200
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,800
Your life and death are not up to you now.

201
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,000
What are you doing?

202
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,130
Roasting fish.

203
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,270
Found it!

204
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,200
There's blood!

205
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,140
Tantai Jin really survived.

206
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,690
He's such a pain in my neck, just like that female demon.

207
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:06,210
Your Highness, although Tantai Jin isn't dead, he's already a spent force.

208
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,460
Please let me tie up this loose end.

209
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,830
Your Highness may return to the capital and wait for my good news.

210
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,110
No. I must see Tantai Jin dead with my own eyes.

211
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,000
Search further away.

212
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,080
Even if we have to dig three feet deep, we must find Tantai Jin!

213
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,080
Your Highness, we'll be entering the Jing territory ahead.

214
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,420
Is there still no news about Tantai Jin?

215
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,980
Your Highness, we have a visual on the Jing soldiers.

216
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,630
Are you sure?

217
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,640
From both their clothes and weapons, they're absolutely soldiers from the Jing Kingdom.

218
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,450
But we're not sure why they are here in large numbers.

219
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,390
Lead the way.

220
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,840
Yes, Sir.

221
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,680
I didn't expect you to be a little helpful.

222
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,840
You have so many schemes, but you're a good cook.

223
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,450
I've been doing this since I was little.

224
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,640
Didn't you grow up in the palace?

225
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,150
You roasted fish in the palace?

226
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,850
Red fish from the Taiye Pond.

227
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,150
Sparrows from the imperial woods.

228
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,580
Rats from the imperial gutters.

229
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,640
All these can be my food.

230
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,440
You just need a few grains of rice.

231
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,550
They'll bite the hook and get themselves killed.

232
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,120
<i>This is Tantai Jin. Both pitiable and detestable.</i>

233
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,780
<i>Fate has been cruel to him.</i>

234
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,050
<i>He also fought back with cruelty.</i>

235
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,040
<i>Li Susu, you have to see clearly.</i>

236
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,280
<i>This is the Devil Lord.</i>

237
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,840
Eat.

238
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,410
You eat it. When you finish, we'll hit the road.

239
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,030
We don't have time for you to heal.

240
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,340
It's not poisonous.

241
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,150
I know that. Otherwise, why would I let you eat it?

242
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,030
Ye Xiwu, why are you so persistent in not letting me die?

243
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,270
Don't worry.

244
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,580
One day I will tell you.

245
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,630
You'd better pray that day comes later.

246
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,870
<i>When I destroy the evil bone and kill you, I will tell you.</i>

247
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,910
What's wrong?

248
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,040
<i>Without the antidote, it won't be long till the poison kicks in and kills me.</i>

249
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,950
Nothing.

250
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,290
Tantai Jin.

251
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,080
We have company.

252
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,490
Hurry!

253
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,920
They haven't gone far. Split up and chase!

254
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,580
- Yes!
- Yes!

255
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,410
<i>They can't run far.</i>

256
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,840
<i>Search carefully!</i>

257
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,220
<i>Anyone who captures Tantai Jin will be rewarded!</i>

258
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,730
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

259
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,430
They are Tantai Minglang's men.

260
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,660
Just hand me over to them.

261
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,250
You can both live and get rewards.

262
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,200
Shut up.

263
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,210
Go in the opposite direction. Don't get caught.

264
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,770
Ye Xiwu.

265
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,310
Over there! After them!

266
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,860
After them!

267
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,660
Come on!

268
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,050
<i>Tantai Jin, I really must have owed you in my last life.</i>

269
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,260
<i>I'm surrounded.</i>

270
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,470
<i>No.</i>

271
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,910
<i>I haven't found the way to destroy the evil bone yet.</i>

272
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,040
<i>I can't die here.</i>

273
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,370
- Split up.
- Yes.

274
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,000
Damn. How come it's a woman?

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,780
You must have seen Tantai Jin.

276
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,290
Where is he? Say it!

277
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,690
Oh, that dead man is named Tantai Jin?

278
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,630
He's dead.

279
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,190
Dead?

280
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,180
Then, why were you running?

281
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,620
I stole something from him.

282
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,190
I thought you were here to catch me.

283
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,760
For a damn woman like you, I chased half a day for nothing!

284
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,550
Go die!

285
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,020
This way! After her!

286
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,860
Don't let her get away!

287
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,240
Be quiet.

288
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,250
All of you split up and go search.

289
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,070
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

290
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,880
Didn't I tell you to run in the opposite direction? Are you looking to get killed?

291
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,140
I'm worried that if you get caught, you'll sell me out.

292
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,760
Now, it's perfect. Neither of us can get away now.

293
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,050
What's that noise?

294
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,800
Go now!

295
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,690
If you tell me honestly why you came here, I'll spare your lives.

296
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,530
We're here...

297
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,380
to hunt down Tantai Jin.

298
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,740
By whose order? Is it Tantai Minglang? Where is he?

299
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,240
His…

300
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,480
They're all dead.

301
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,310
Your Highness, since they're here for Tantai Jin, he should be around here.

302
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,840
- Please give orders to Secret Dragon Guards to…
- Go back.

303
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,820
Your Highness, Tantai Jin is…

304
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,530
Get on the horse.

305
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,740
Take these bodies back to the city.

306
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,160
No one saw Tantai Jin today. Understand?

307
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,860
- Understand!
- Understand!

308
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,820
<i>Tantai Jin, this is as far as I can help you.</i>

309
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,780
This place is concealed enough.

310
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,150
Let's spend the night here.

311
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,920
Why didn't you leave just now?

312
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,240
Why did you distract the soldiers and save me?

313
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,440
That's just because…

314
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,630
Better to talk about it when we're safe.

315
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,820
No soldiers are chasing us for now.

316
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,320
Give me back my charms.

317
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,020
If we run into them again, at least I have something to defend us.

318
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,870
You drew so many Sketch Charms?

319
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,150
You only taught me this type.

320
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,750
These are useless for the current situation.

321
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,610
And they were soaked in water for too long.

322
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,860
There's no magic on them.

323
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,190
Meeting you is the unluckiest thing.

324
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,040
Tantai Jin, why is your blood black?

325
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,820
What exactly happened to you?

326
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,080
<i>Once the poison in your left eye spreads throughout your meridians,</i>

327
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,110
<i>you'll spit blood three times and die.</i>

328
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,930
What's going on? Just tell me!

329
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,730
I was poisoned by Tantai Minglang.

330
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,940
Maybe in a bit, it will kick in and I'll be dead.

331
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,350
You scoundrel! Why didn't you tell me earlier?

332
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,530
Would it help if I did?

333
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,180
Are you a doctor? Do you have the antidote?

334
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,650
There must be a way to save you.

335
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,590
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

336
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
Ye Xiwu!

337
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,070
Ye Xiwu! Where are you going?

338
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,570
<i>Report!</i>

339
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,490
The men we sent out to search haven't found Tantai Jin yet.

340
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,550
Useless!

341
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,480
Your Highness, urgent news from the capital.

342
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,960
Something happened in the palace. They need you to handle it, Your Highness.

343
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,830
Please return to the capital first. I'll take care of this.

344
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,330
Fine. I've been out for too long this time.

345
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,710
My third brother, when I find you,

346
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,990
I'll crush the bones of you and Yue Ruanruan into powder.

347
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,540
I'll make you disappear for good.

348
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,950
Let's go.

349
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,950
Tantai Jin, you can't hide much longer.

350
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,970
You must be eliminated.

351
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,550
You're awake.

352
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,450
You're back.

353
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,170
Of course. Did you think I'd leave you alone here?

354
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,860
You're badly injured and slept for hours.

355
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,190
I gave you some simple treatment.

356
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,660
Have some fruit first.

357
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,510
You're in luck. I picked up some herbs and came back. They can stop the poison from spreading.

358
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,660
I'll apply them to you in a second.

359
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,770
You should not try to run around out there. You have so many injuries and almost died.

360
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,070
You really scared me. I must owe you in my previous life.

361
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,230
Ye Xiwu, you don't need to try so hard to save me.

362
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,350
You have to live on.

363
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,010
Are you injured somewhere else, too?

364
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,340
Come on.

365
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,210
What are you doing?

366
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,770
You still mind this when you're dying?

367
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:02,080
What's more, we're already married. There's nothing to be shy about.

368
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,690
Ye Xiwu, you said it on the ship.

369
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,870
From now on, we will have nothing to do with each other.

370
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,980
When we get out of here, I will settle scores with you properly.

371
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,140
But now your life is in my hands.

372
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,530
I will decide whether you live or not.

373
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,090
Understand, Tantai Jin?

374
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,010
Okay.

375
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,860
What is this?

376
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,140
Give it back!

377
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,730
It looks like some kind of treasure.

378
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,720
Why haven't I seen it before?

379
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,420
I found it on the road.

380
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,540
I don't know what it is, either. It's probably worthless.

381
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,240
Give it back to me.

382
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,340
Since you found it, technically, it's not yours.

383
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,660
Since it's in my hand, it's mine now.

384
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,380
No! You can't hold it.

385
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,720
Ye Xiwu, be honest with me.

386
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,860
What exactly is this?

387
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,380
It's a lost divine artifact from ancient times.

388
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,650
It's called World-Alluring Jade.

389
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,240
World-Alluring Jade?

390
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,450
You'd better not have any funny ideas about it!

391
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,790
This jade was forged by a female devil ten thousand years ago.

392
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:06,070
<i>She killed tens of thousands of immortals, and withdrew their immortal bones.</i>

393
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,480
<i>Making this jade was an evil deed.</i>

394
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,260
That's why its users were doomed to end badly.

395
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,710
They'll be short-lived and die violently.

396
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:20,090
Bad endings… Violent death?

397
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Guess you are thinking if you devour it, it'll be more useful than devouring demon cores?

398
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,760
You'd better give up this idea, or you'll die a horrible death.

399
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,460
I'm already deeply poisoned.

400
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,740
The poison might kick in any second.

401
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,860
I can't even keep my life now.

402
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,320
Why would I be afraid of death?

403
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,300
Why would I be afraid of some curse?

404
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,120
There's no difference for me...

405
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,300
whether to die now or later.

406
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,610
I won't let you die here.

407
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,780
Time to apply your medicine.

408
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,810
Don't move. Okay? Otherwise, I might break some more ribs.

409
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,400
Done. Time to sleep.

410
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,740
I'll take you back to the Sheng Kingdom tomorrow morning.

411
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,050
There must be a way to save you.

412
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,960
♫ <i> Mortal desires are like gazing upon</i> ♫

413
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,800
♫ <i> The sudden disappearance of the moon </i> ♫

414
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,760
♫ <i> The mortal world is like three thousand flowers </i> ♫

415
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,520

416

♫ <i> Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain </i> ♫

417
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,630
<i>You saved me because of love?</i>

418
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,090
<i>What is love exactly?</i>

419
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,530
<i>Love is you don't want him to die.</i>

420
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,420
<i>You want to stay with him.</i>

421
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,090
<i>You'll be worried if you don't see him.</i>

422
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,980
<i>You'll be happy if you do.</i>

423
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,320
♫ <i> Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense </i> ♫

424

♫ <i> I believed I have been loved for a moment </i> ♫

428

♫ <i> I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil </i> ♫

429
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,200
♫ <i> And become devout like the flawless moonlight </i> ♫

430
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,990
Almost there. When we go through the woods ahead, we'll find somewhere to rest.

431
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,880
Tantai Jin, you indeed have not died.

432
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,070
Seems like you also made up with Second Young Miss Ye.

433
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,640
- Who's this?
- Tantai Minglang's subordinate.

434
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,060
She's able to use demonic hexes. Be careful.

435
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,950
<i>Tantai Jin is too weak to take any risk.</i>

436
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,690
<i>If he dies, everything will be in vain.</i>

437
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,420
Tantai Jin, her target is you.

438
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,690
Find a good chance to run first. I'll think of a way to stall her.

439
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,490
What? Are you so deeply poisoned that you don't have energy to fight back?

440
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:39,600
Seeing me means you two lovebirds' tragic ending has come.

441
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,130
What are you going to fight her with?

442
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,880
Just leave it to me.

443
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,460
Shatter!

444
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,840
Tantai Jin!

445
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,280
Are you okay?

446
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:44,910
Tantai Jin, you can even kill Jing Lan'an who brought you up, but care so much about this woman?

447
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,490
You're dying anyway.

448
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,220
I'll catch you back alive for His Highness to vent his hatred.

449
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
Ye Xiwu.

450
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,410
Ye Xiwu! Ye Xiwu!

451
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Ye Xiwu!

452
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,600
She was hit by my Heart-Gnawing Curse. She'll be dead in no time.

453
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,520
Undo this curse right now! Or I'm gonna crush your bones into scattered dust!

454
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,460
You can barely keep standing.

455
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,110
You are barely surviving. How can you afford to save her?

456
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,770
You might as well just surrender.

457
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,650
<i>Ye Xiwu, we have a lot of unfinished scores to settle.</i>

458
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,290
<i>I can't just let you die here.</i>

459
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,510
The World-Alluring Jade.

460
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,510
<i>This jade was forged by a female devil ten thousand years ago.</i>

461
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,370
<i>Its users were doomed to end badly.</i>

462
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,220
<i>They'll be short-lived and die violently.</i>

463
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:28,020
<i>As long as I can live now, why should I fear death afterward?</i>

464
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,830
You demon.

465
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,260
I'll eliminate you for His Highness to spare all trouble later!

466
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,600
Tantai Minglang can't kill me.

467
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,600
One day, I'll go to him!

468
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,850
Ye Xiwu!

469
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,250
<i>What happened to me?</i>

470
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,180
<i>Did Tantai Jin save me?</i>

471
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,540
Tantai Jin!

472
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,600
This glow?

473
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,290
It's the World-Alluring Jade!

474
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,080
You scoundrel! You devoured the World-Alluring Jade!

475
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,160
You'll die violently! Don't you know?

476
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:11,880
<i>Chongyu Harp, help me. I must take the jade out.</i>

477
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,670
Come out!

478
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,080
<i>Do you want to save this man...</i>

479
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,650
<i>who tried to possess the World-Alluring Jade?</i>

480
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,500
<i>Who are you?</i>

481
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,190
<i>You're the female devil who forged this jade?</i>

482
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,460
<i>Do you want to save this man?</i>

483
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,300
<i>I have to save him. He can't die!</i>

484
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,090
<i>But the World-Alluring Jade has chosen him.</i>

485
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,340
<i>Misfortune will fall upon him very soon.</i>

486
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,750
<i>He will have a violent death in a foreign land.</i>

487
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,110
<i>No!</i>

488
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,180
<i>I'll help him get the jade out. Whatever method I must use!</i>

489
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,020
<i>Well, there is one.</i>

490
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,610
<i>But is this man worth it?</i>

491
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,620
<i>Take a good look at what kind of person he is.</i>

492
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,880
<i>You are a monster.</i>

493
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,910
<i>You will bring disaster to anyone close to you.</i>

494
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,440
<i>Look! This kind of person…</i>

495
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,910
<i>You were born unworthy of the most common human emotions.</i>

496
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,950
<i>He isn't worth your sacrifice.</i>

497
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:07,430
<i>If someone had to die, I'm sure anyone would choose you.</i>

498
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,860
That's not true!

499
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:34,430
<i>He can't die. If there must be someone to carry his curse, let it be me!</i>

500
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:43,440
<i>But before the curse lands upon me, there's one task I must complete.</i>

501
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,470
<i>Do you know how to destroy the evil bone?</i>

502
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,820
<i>I know what you are after.</i>

503
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,230
<i>Maybe you can find the answer in Barren Abyss.</i>

504
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:03,090
<i>But now the power of the World-Alluring Jade has condensed into his eye.</i>

505
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:09,390
<i>If you want to take it back, you have to trade it with one of your eyes.</i>

506
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,540
<i>Fine.</i>

507
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,580
<i>I'll do it.</i>

508
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,240
<i>How ridiculous.</i>

509
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,800
<i>In this world, someone's actually willing to die for others.</i>

510
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,980
Tantai Jin,

511
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,840
you won't die.

512
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,010
Only if you're alive,

513
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,460
more people will be able to live.

514
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,880
You two, go check over there!

515
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,010
<i>It's Nian Baiyu.</i>

516
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,530
Your Highness!

517
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,040
Your Highness!

518
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,010
He's still breathing.

519
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,900
<i>They're indeed theMoonshadow Guard. It seems like they won't hurt him.</i>

520
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,330
Someone! Take His Highness to the camp for treatment!

521
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,940
Yes, Sir!

522
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,980
<i>I couldn't go to Barren Abyss with Tantai Jin heavily injured.</i>

523
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,490
<i>I can only leave Young Devil Lord to you.</i>

524
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,330
<i>Tantai Jin, when I find the way to destroy the evil bone, I'll be back for you.</i>

525
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,980
<i>[Till The End of The Moon]</i>

526
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:35,180
<i>[Black Moonlight - Zhang Bichen and Mao Buyi]</i>

527
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:42,940
♫ <i> Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon </i> ♫

528
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:50,640
♫ <i> The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm </i> ♫

529
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:58,460
♫ <i> Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain </i> ♫

530
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,940
♫ <i> Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain </i> ♫

531
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,240
♫ <i> We'll never meet again </i> ♫

532
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,700
♫ <i> I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words </i> ♫

533
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,540
♫ <i> Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense </i> ♫

534
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,820
♫ <i> Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof </i> ♫

535
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,840
♫ <i> Embracing the endless lingering fear </i> ♫

536
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,280
♫ <i> I've admired you through the myriad of years </i> ♫

537
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,460
♫ <i> I believed I have been loved for a moment </i> ♫

538
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,960
♫ <i> I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil </i> ♫

539
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:44,120
♫ <i> And become devout like the flawless moonlight </i> ♫

540
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,520
♫ <i> Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

541
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,340
♫ <i> and how they are just like any other creature </i> ♫

542
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,600
♫ <i> No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars </i> ♫

543
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,500
♫ <i> The moonlight is my armor </i> ♫

544
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,020
♫ <i> I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars </i> ♫

545
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,080
♫ <i> And willingness to live a life in peace </i> ♫

546
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,760
♫ <i> You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil </i> ♫

547
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:19,900
♫ <i> And learned to love what you used to resent </i> ♫

548
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:27,500
♫ <i> Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky </i> ♫

549
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:35,440
♫ <i> And we'll make it something to remember us by </i> ♫
