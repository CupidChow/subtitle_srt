17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,710
What? You want to quit practicing the Heartless Path?

18
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,500
It's not that I don't want to, Dad.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,270
It's just that I'm still romantically attached to him.

20
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,830
I don't think I'll ever make a breakthrough in the Heartless Path this life.

21
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,070
I'm not fated to attain godhood.

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm sorry that I let you down, Dad.

23
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,550
Get up.

24
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,330
Susu, are you sure Cang Jiumin is the one?

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,310
Would that be fine with you, Dad?

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, silly girl, my opinion doesn't matter.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,230
You know better than anyone if Jiumin is a decent man.

28
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,210
Besides, he was able to refine the Heart-Guarding Scale.

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,800
It's enough to prove that he has the kindest and purest heart.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,910
He's a reliable man you can count on.

31
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,830
Dad…

32
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,400
It doesn't matter if you can ascend godhood.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,140
Whatever your decision may be,

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,740
I just want you to stay safe and happy.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,470
If you ever find yourself on the wrong path, do not be afraid.

36
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,100
Just turn around.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,250
I will always be there to support you.

38
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,400
Thank you, Dad.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,730
And… don't worry about the evil bone.

40
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,690
I'll think of something for you.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,090
Susu.

42
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,400
So you do have the evil bone.

43
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,510
Why didn't you tell me?

44
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,400
Do you have any idea how many people crave its power?

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Was it Cang Jiumin's idea to keep us in the dark?

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,340
He must be seeking a chance to retrieve the evil bone.

47
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,940
That's why he's sticking around.

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,840
That's not it.

49
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,710
Actually, Cang Jiumin just found out recently.

50
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,480
I didn't want to tell anyone because I thought

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,970
the evil bone would cause catastrophic havoc.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,170
How could you have been so careless?

53
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,330
You don't understand the scale of its power.

54
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,440
You may be of a pure-spirit body with the ability to keep out regular demonic energy,

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,430
but it's the evil bone we're talking about. Even the Heavenly Pillar failed to contain it.

56
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,530
What makes you think you can?

57
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,420
I didn't have a choice.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,790
After I removed his evil bone using my divine essence,

59
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,700
only to realize the evil bone was indestructible.

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,730
So I had to seal it in me.

61
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>It was the Devil-Sound Spell, again.</i>

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,820
Nian Baiyu, I ask for you today

63
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,800
because I need you to complete a task.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
What exactly do you want?

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,700
Everyone knows he no longer has the evil bone.

66
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,800
If anything, he has no value to you anymore.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,500
That is none of your concern.

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,350
Just bring me the demon fetus

69
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,760
and leave the rest to me.

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,460
- But…
- Nian Baiyu,

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,840
don't forget why you're here.

72
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Unless you want all of them to die,

73
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,100
you will do as you're told.

74
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,580
Understood.

75
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,820
Siying and Jingmie want to catch the demon fetus.

76
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,710
<i>They haven't found out where the evil bone is, or have they?</i>

77
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,220
<i>I'd better act quickly. Time is of the essence.</i>

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,470
Susu, after a lengthy discussion, your father and I

79
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,040
decided to combine our power to cast the Yin-Yang Array

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,300
for you at midnight the day after tomorrow.

81
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,500
We will have peace of mind after we nullify the evil bone's power.

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,050
Well, Dad, I know you two have been chewing it over for the last 24 hours.

83
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,190
I can't describe how thankful I am.

84
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,510
Not to forget Uncle Zhaoyou.

85
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,620
He's been rushing around making arrangements for my marriage proposal.

86
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,360
This is a peaceful time for all Three Realms.

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,340
Among immortal sects, nothing is more important than your wedding with Jiumin.

88
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,140
Just know that we are really happy for you.

89
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,900
For now, put everything else behind you.

90
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,410
Speaking of which,

91
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,530
we owe a debt of gratitude to your dad.

92
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,950
We all blamed him wrongly.

93
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,090
Since the incident at Devil-Subduing Peak, he's been feeling guilty for wrongly accusing Jiumin.

94
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,040
But being naturally unexpressive, he left it unsaid.

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,870
When he heard the good news, he offered to suppress the evil bone for you

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,290
at the risk of exhausting all his lifetime cultivation.

97
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,630
He said that would be the only way

98
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,820
you and Jiumin could live a carefree life.

99
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,160
"Call it a token of apology for Jiumin," he said.

100
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,760
It's about time you showed her the tiger.

101
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,770
Is this is… a rooster-shaped stone?

102
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,740
It is a tiger.

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,240
He made it out of lava from the Barren Abyss for you.

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,620
He always wanted to give it to you in person.

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,940
At the Barren Abyss, I thought about what to give you every day.

106
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,400
In most cases, giving kids tigers made of fabrics is a more popular option.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,030
There was nothing there but stones.

108
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,790
The lava rocks were hard and I was weak.

109
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,620
I had to strike the rock a little at a time day by day.

110
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,190
Then one day, it finally looked like the shape I desired.

111
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,740
And you, my daughter, whom I haven't seen in years,

112
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,140
are all grown up. I did not do enough for you.

113
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,260
Now I just want to do whatever I can to make amends.

114
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,210
Father,

115
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,630
I'll take good care of the little tiger.

116
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,350
I have good news.

117
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,080
Both my fathers have found a way to negate the evil bone.

118
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,040
They're going to cast an array for that in three days.

119
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,160
How did your birth father know the bone was in your body?

120
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,520
He heard me talking to my dad about it.

121
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,220
Besides, he isn't an outsider anyway.

122
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,900
And this may surprise you. He's actually a very gentle man.

123
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,100
Relax. As long as the evil bone's power is dampened,

124
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,240
you and I will live a long and peaceful life together.

125
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,430
Don't you want to have a full wedding ceremony this time?

126
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,920
Right. Once you've completed your retreat,

127
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,230
I'll come and pick you up with the betrothal gifts.

128
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,050
We'll get married again.

129
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,960
What makes you think I'll say yes?

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,310
Well, Sect Leader Qu already gave me his blessing.

131
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,170
I have his permission to be by your side forever.

132
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,120
It is too late to back out now.

133
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,420
Aren't you worried I'll shoot nails into your body again?

134
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,240
So…

135
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,690
that's a yes?

136
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,950
Oh, you.

137
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,980
You only hear what you want to hear.

138
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,100
Now,

139
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,620
according to Mount Changze's tradition,

140
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,010
we're not allowed to see each other before the wedding.

141
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,600
You better make sure you plan and prepare it well.

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Because my fathers just might call off the wedding if you fail to meet their standards.

143
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,730
Okay. I'll wait for you.

144
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,120
I'll bring enough betrothal gifts and pick you up at the pass.

145
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,080
It's your turn.

146
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>[Cloud Peak]</i>

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,070
You old geezer, what's wrong with you?

148
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,770
You don't play chess nor drink.

149
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,210
Your mind has wandered beyond the horizon.

150
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,850
This is something big.

151
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,320
Here.

152
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
Have a cup of tea first.

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,820
What do you think of the matter that I mentioned to you last time?

154
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,050
Last time?

155
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,900
<i>[Marriage Proposal]</i>

156
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,550
Don't make me look bad.

157
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,670
After your beloved disciple joins the Hengyang Sect,

158
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,820
will it be difficult for you to let him go?

159
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,970
Old Qu, thank you for saving Jiumin.

160
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,840
Even though he is a demon fetus, he faintly showed a figure of a god

161
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,530
when he refined the Heart-guarding Scale.

162
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,400
This proves that he has a firm mind in cultivation.

163
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Given time, he'll be able to take on the responsibility

164
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,340
of protecting the people.

165
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,330
You become serious when we talk about your dear disciple.

166
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,450
That is true.

167
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,140
Sect Leader Qu, I'll trouble you then.

168
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,340
See you in three days.

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,830
<i>Planning a wedding is a lot of work.</i>

170
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,040
<i>But has Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal remembere to go to the lake to meditate every day?</i>

171
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,560
<i>What about Junior Brother Cang?</i>

172
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,050
<i>Besides coming to Hengyang Sect to peep at Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal every day,</i>

173
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,960
<i>does he practice hard?</i>

174
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,070
Little Martial Aunt.

175
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,950
You ask her.

176
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,410
Little Martial Aunt, have you noticed that there are always some strange people around?

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>Cang Jiumin, just wait a little longer.</i>

178
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,340
<i>We'll be together forever after tomorrow.</i>

179
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,570
Our classes in the morning and evening are canceled tomorrow.

180
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,260
Sect Leader will have a retreat tomorrow.

181
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,340
What's happening? Why?

182
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,320
Do you think something big is going to happen in the sect?

183
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,220
Something big?

184
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,240
The demon fetus's power is ruined. What can happen?

185
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,300
I think it is mostly related to something joyous.

186
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,510
Yeah. But Cang Jiumin isn't worthy of our Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal.

187
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,490
He is a million-year-old devil god.

188
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,650
I don't know what Sect Leader is thinking.

189
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,970
Keep your voice down. That evil cultivator, Nian Baiyu, is staying somewhere near here.

190
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,780
What do you call this?

191
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,940
Demon King, evil cultivator, and Devil Lord. Mount Changze has all of them here.

192
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,850
Knock it off. Keep silent.

193
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,390
Susu, you'll lose all senses later.

194
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,100
But don't be afraid.

195
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,700
You just have to trust us.

196
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,190
Thank you, Father and Dad.

197
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,640
Silly girl, no need to thank me.

198
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,770
Uncle Zhaoyou will come to propose a marriage with betrothal gifts for Jiumin tomorrow.

199
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,160
We'll have two happy events to celebrate then.

200
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,010
Let's get started.

201
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,420
Sister, what are you thinking?

202
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,270
You look happy. Is anything good happening?

203
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,960
We've found the entrance to the Devil Palace.

204
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,630
We only need one thing from Hengyang Sect and His Lordship will be resurrected soon.

205
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a make-or-break attempt.

206
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,070
Siying, I've been thinking a lot lately after coming round.

207
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,740
Whether a god, a devil, a demon, or a human, we all exist only for a short time.

208
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,500
So the most important thing is to be good to yourself

209
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,740
and go after what you want.

210
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
You've dedicated everything you have to the Devil Lord.

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,320
Have you thought about what you want?

212
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,910
Sister,

213
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,370
I want whatever His Lordship wants.

214
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,800
Sister, don't be silly.

215
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,830
You've given so much for the Devil Lord.

216
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,570
But what did he do for you?

217
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,230
His Lordship doesn't need to do anything for me.

218
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,300
I did everything willingly.

219
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,560
Sister, I shall take my leave.

220
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,250
If all goes well, the next time we meet

221
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,200
will be in the Devil Lord's presence.

222
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,030
Susu.

223
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,860
Susu?

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,460
It's the hour of the Rat and the array has ended.

225
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,230
Why hasn't Susu woken up?

226
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,200
She looks bad. Could something have gone wrong?

227
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,670
What would go wrong?

228
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,260
Look.

229
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,440
Isn't the evil bone coming out?

230
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,920
What's going on?

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,230
No, why is this happening?

232
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,090
What's going on?

233
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,440
Isn't the array supposed to suppress the backlash of evil bone?

234
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,690
Sky-Slashing Sword.

235
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,690
If only you could judge a man's character as accurately as you judge an artifact.

236
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,890
That's right. It's Sky-Slashing Sword,

237
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,340
the third devil artifact.

238
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,740
Ten thousand years ago, I stabbed the Devil Lord with it.

239
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,580
That's why he sealed me in the Barren Abyss.

240
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,070
Everyone thinks that the Sky-Slashing Sword is missing like other devil artifacts.

241
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,950
Actually, it's always been with me.

242
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,230
I misjudged you.

243
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,510
Unexpectedly, you've been after the evil bone

244
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,670
from the very beginning.

245
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:03,180
Sect Leader Qu, in fact, I admire an upright man like you very much.

246
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,760
After meeting Chuhuang,

247
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,230
I wanted to be a faithful and good lover.

248
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,270
Unfortunately, the Devil Lord's power is too tempting.

249
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,010
In order to obtain that power,

250
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,790
I had no choice but to betray Chuhuang and take sides with the Devil Lord.

251
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,020
Until I met this child...

252
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,600
After I reunited with Susu,

253
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,000
I was determined to make it up to her and be a good father.

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
However, fate plays tricks on us.

255
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,340
You can only blame this child

256
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,920
for having such a close connection with the devil bone.

257
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,400
No! Don't hurt Susu!

258
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,220
No!

259
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,160
Susu.

260
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,470
No!

261
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,730
She is my biological daughter.

262
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,230
How could I kill her?

263
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,980
After I take out the evil bone,

264
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,560
she only needs to get through the injury to lead a peaceful life.

265
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,830
As her adoptive father,

266
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,920
you've worked hard for so many years to bring her up.

267
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,490
Now, you can rest in peace.

268
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,550
Susu!

269
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,800
You've made me wait for ten thousand years.

270
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,410
Finally, it's my time to take control of the Devil Lord's power.

271
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,590
Your spiritual power is almost exhausted

272
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,880
and you were stabbed by the Sky-Slashing Sword.

273
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,530
Why bother to struggle?

274
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,510
You greedy man.

275
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,300
You covet the power of the Devil Lord.

276
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,100
You have no right to talk about karma with me.

277
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,810
Even if I have to use up my prowess and let my divine form disperse,

278
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,930
I won't let you take the evil bone away.

279
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,980
Extremely stupid!

280
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,270
<i>Whatever your decision may be,</i>

281
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,450
<i>I just want you to stay safe and happy.</i>

282
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,870
<i>If you ever find yourself on the wrong path, do not be afraid.</i>

283
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,840
<i>Just turn around. I will always be there</i>

284
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,820
<i>to support you.</i>

285
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,550
<i>Father, thank you.</i>

286
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,780
Susu.

287
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,550
I…

289
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,480
can't be there for you anymore.

290
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,320
Elder Sister, something bad happened.

291
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,930
Let's go.

292
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,060
<i>Something bad has happened.</i>

293
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,590
<i>I need to get His Majesty out of here.</i>

294
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,450
<i>Where am I?</i>

295
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,410
<i>Tantai Jin, how is it?</i>

296
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,170
<i>You said when the time comes, you will return to the Barren Abyss.</i>

297
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>I've found the entrance to the Devil Palace for you.</i>

298
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,930
<i>There's no better time than now.</i>

299
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,340
<i>Why am I here?</i>

300
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,690
<i>What exactly is going on?</i>

301
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,370
<i>Your Majesty, I've bid farewell to Sect Leader.</i>

302
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>Before leaving, I want to catch up with you.</i>

303
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,170
<i>Baiyu, why are you leaving suddenly?</i>

304
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,700
<i>I'm worried about my family.</i>

305
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,610
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

306
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,650
<i>your situation hasn't improved even if the two sect leaders defended you fiercely at the Devil-Subduing Peak.</i>

307
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,910
<i>Have you thought about leaving here and going back to the Yiyue Tribe with me?</i>

308
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,940
<i>Baiyu, I'm not a saint.</i>

309
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,930
<i>Honestly, I don't like being subjected to criticism.</i>

310
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,210
<i>Furthermore, I don't like my life to be dictated by others.</i>

311
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,860
<i>But...</i>

312
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,380
<i>as long as I can be with Susu, I can bear with all these.</i>

313
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,210
<i>Your Majesty, I heard that you're</i>

314
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,310
<i>going to marry the Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal and stay here forever.</i>

315
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,840
<i>But do you not care about the Yiyue Tribe anymore?</i>

316
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,340
<i>My maternal tribe.</i>

317
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,330
<i>Speaking of which, I'm ill-fated.</i>

318
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,400
<i>Whoever is related to me will be struck by disasters.</i>

319
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,650
<i>Perhaps staying away from me means staying away from trouble.</i>

320
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,980
<i>This is the best way to protect my maternal tribe.</i>

321
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,840
<i>Your Majesty, do you ever miss the days when you could rally multitudes with just one call as the ruler?</i>

322
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,310
<i>When you were king of Jing,</i>

323
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,700
<i>with your governance, things were in good order and people lived in peace.</i>

324
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,240
<i>Don't you want to be back in that position to protect your maternal tribe?</i>

325
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,700
<i>I don't know if I miss it.</i>

326
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,760
<i>It's been 500 years.</i>

327
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,480
<i>Many things are like dreamy illusions.</i>

328
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,370
<i>Perhaps only this bright moon is eternal and unchanging.</i>

329
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,960
<i>Surprisingly, your sidekick has some skills.</i>

330
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,150
<i>He really brought you back without anyone knowing.</i>

331
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,300
<i>It's Nian Baiyu.</i>

332
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,140
<i>Why?</i>

333
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,430
<i>No, it is not the time to think about these things now.</i>

334
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,120
<i>Susu is waiting for me.</i>

335
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,830
<i>I need to find a way to escape.</i>

336
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,590
Cang Jiumin, you're finally back here.

337
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,350
Do you feel familiar?

338
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,160
I've never been here before. Why would I feel familiar?

339
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,020
This is the gate to the Devil Realm. The residence of the Devil Lord's true form.

340
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,530
You were born with evil bone.

341
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,250
How could you not recognize this gate?

342
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,920
What are you hesitating about?

343
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,530
You are afraid.

344
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,680
You're afraid that everything will be proven true.

345
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,630
<i>Since they can bring me here, they must be well-prepared.</i>

346
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,620
<i>It won't work if I force my way out.</i>

347
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,040
<i>Or I'll comply with them first and find a chance to escape.</i>

348
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,580
<i>Is this your home? It's so big.</i>

349
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,110
<i>Home?</i>

350
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,270
<i>What is that?</i>

351
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,650
<i>It's like an animal's den.</i>

352
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,410
<i>Mo Nv and I used to call a cave by the Chi River home.</i>

353
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,590
<i>But the immortals in the Divine Realm took us back for cultivation.</i>

354
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,760
<i>We had no home since then.</i>

355
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,910
<i>This will be your home from now on.</i>

356
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,730
Siying.

357
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,380
He is really the Devil Lord.

358
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,430
He's the Devil Lord we've been painstakingly looking for.

359
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

360
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,170
If he is not the Devil Lord, how could he lift the interdict placed on the gate of the Devil Realm?

361
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,920
Forget it. You won't understand.

362
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,730
In short,

363
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,010
there is no Cang Jiumin...

364
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,590
or Tantai Jin.

365
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,340
He can only be the Devil Lord.

366
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,960
<i>Come quickly.</i>

367
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>Come to see me now.</i>

368
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,250
<i>You'll have the answers to all the riddles.</i>

369
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,090
Who exactly are you?

370
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,270
Who exactly are you?

371
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,420
I'm asking you now.

372
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm asking you now.

373
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,140
I'll ask you again.

374
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,070
Who exactly are you?

375
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:16,020
Or just let me tell you who you should be,

376
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,060
and how I was born.

377
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,170
<i>I was born out of natural disasters,</i>

378
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,500
Thank you, doctor.
<i>[Kindness Hospital]</i>

379
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,050
Be careful when you get home. Do you need treatment?

380
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,630
Come in, please.

381
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,140
- <i>diseases,</i>
- My chest hurts.

382
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,960
- Please, sir, give me some medicine.
- We're not doing charity.

383
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,850
So you don't have any money. Leave!

384
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,100
<i>poverty,</i>

385
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,130
What are you looking at? Aren't you broke, too?

386
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,210
Going to the hospital like others, huh?

387
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,700
Get lost!

388
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,820
All right, there you go.

389
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,810
<i>- starvation,</i> <b> - Stop running, you thief!</b>

390
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,930
I'm gonna beat you to death!

391
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,730

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,160
- Are you blind or what?

- <i>violence,</i>
- What are you doing?

394
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,050
- Behave yourself!
- You! You!

395
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,970
Don't you know who I am?

396
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,430
<i>killing,</i>

397
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,040
<i>sadness,</i>

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,290
<i>death,</i>

399
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,170
<i>and war.</i>

400
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:18,030
- Welcome back, My Lord!
- Welcome back, My Lord!

401
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,860
Welcome back, My Lord!

402
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,020
I am in charge of sins.

403
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,310
Gods are the light of this world.

404
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,950
But I am the shadow of this world.

405
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:37,010
That's why I can't leave this world.

406
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,580
I've been alone in the devil realm for god knows how long.

407
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,960
Suddenly one day, I figured out something.

408
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,130
There are sins in this world because there's too much pain and happiness,

409
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,560
starvation and satiety, and chaos and order.

410
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,810
All these are born relative to each other.

411
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,130
It's been like this since the beginning of time.

412
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,180
If this is the case, the pain won't be eliminated.

413
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:18,280
Why can't I go the other way around and get rid of purity and brightness in this world?

414
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,310
All lives...

415
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,810
will be indulged in pain due to the foul energy.

416
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:04,730
To create a peaceful world without happiness or sadness, I've created the All-in-Distress Path.

417
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,240
When the world no longer has a difference between pure and foul energy, there won't be any sins anymore.

418
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,370
When I achieve this goal, Three Realms will return to the chaos from which I was born,

419
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,090
and I will also be free.

420
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,740
In your dreams.

421
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,280
Little Martial Aunt, you're awake.

422
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,330
Little Yue Ya.

423
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,960
What happened to me?

424
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,810
Cang Jiumin stole your evil bone.

425
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,410
That's why you're critically injured and in a coma.

426
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,380
Slowly. Are you trying to get up?

427
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,530
Be careful.

428
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,160
What do you mean by this?

429
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,350
Little Martial Aunt, Cang Jiumin killed Sect Leader Qu,

430
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,340
seriously injured Lord of Monsters, and took away the evil bone.

431
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,640
Nobody knows where he went.

432
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,710
<i>You'll lose all senses later. But don't be afraid.</i>

433
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,260
<i>You just have to trust us.</i>

434
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,130
<i>Thank you, Father and Dad.</i>

435
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,880
<i>Silly girl, no need to thank me.</i>

436
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,300
Impossible.

437
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,660
Little Martial Aunt.

438
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,940
<i>[Memorial Tablet of the Sect Chief Qu Xuan Zi]</i>

439
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,950
Dad,

440
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,830
how can you be…

441
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,820
- Dad!
- Susu!

442
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,100
- Dad!
- Susu!

443
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,590
Tantai Jin did this.

444
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,560
No way. He wouldn't.

445
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,480
Dad!

446
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:15,010
Whatever your decision may be, I just want you to stay safe and happy.

447
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,600
Dad!

448
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,560
<i>Little Martial Aunt</i>

449
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,090
<i>Cang Jiumin killed Sect Leader Qu, seriously injured Lord of Monsters, and took away the evil bone.</i>

450
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,390
<i>Nobody knows where he went.</i>

451
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,010
What are you...

452
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,040
planning to do to Tantai Jin?

453
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,500
All immortal sects will hunt him down.

454
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,230
If he resists, they'll kill him on the spot.

455
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,940
Don't kill him. He wouldn't do such things.

456
00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:01,360
Li Susu, Master has just been killed, but you're begging for mercy for the murderer?

457
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,660
Shouldn't he pay with his life for killing him?

458
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,950
No. There must be some misunderstanding.

459
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,950
Eldest Senior Brother, I know Tantai Jin the best.

460
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,940
I beg you to give him a chance to tell the truth before he is killed.

461
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,400
Enough!

462
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,930
The facts are right there.

463
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,910
You just don't want to believe them.

464
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,880
You were like this on the Devil-Subduing Peak.

465
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,250
To protect Tantai Jin, you actually hid the evil bone's whereabouts.

466
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,300
If not so, Master wouldn't be dead.

467
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,000
Hengyang Sect wouldn't be in disgrace.

468
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,330
I'm ordering you as the Sect Leader of the Hengyang Sect.

469
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,550
From today on, you're grounded in your room.

470
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,440
Eldest Senior Brother…

471
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,190
<i>I'm still in the Devil Palace.</i>

472
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,400
My mark is in the shape of a phoenix feather. It's very beautiful.

473
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,880
<i>Susu's phoenix-feather mark awoke me.</i>

474
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,220
My Lord, you're awake.

475
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,450
Please eat something.

476
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,310
Baiyu, answer me. Why are you helping them?

477
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:23,930
My Lord, I don't understand why you refuse to be the Devil Lord.

478
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,570
You used to crave power so much.

479
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,460
Baiyu, I am no longer that king in the mortal realm, Tantai Jin.

480
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,850
Now, I'm Cang Jiumin from an immortal sect.

481
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,330
What if this is for the Yiyue Tribe?

482
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,450
What does this have to do with the Yiyue Tribe?

483
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:48,980
Five hundred years ago, soon after you entered the Nether River,

484
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,480
Siying and Jingmie went to the Yiyue Tribe.

485
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,320
They said that the Yiyue Tribe had signed a contract with the Devil Lord to give birth to and raise the demon fetus.

486
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,230
They would have violated the contract if they refused to hand over the demon fetus.

487
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,210
Only by finding you can they be free from the fate of annihilation.

488
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,660
That's why I was forced to work for them.

489
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,720
I wish that some day,

490
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,590
I can help my people regain their freedom.

491
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,300
Now there's only one way to save them.

492
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,020
That is for you to...

493
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,110
become the Devil Lord.

494
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,070
Please, My Lord.

495
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,050
Please save them.

496
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,060
In these people, there's my mom and the Moonshadow Guards who once served you!

497
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,930
I'm begging you, My Lord! Please save our people!

498
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,800
Just be the Devil Lord like they wanted, My Lord!

499
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,330
Please, My Lord!

500
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,210
I know you want to save them as soon as possible.

501
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,510
But if I did what they asked, the Devil Lord would be revived.

502
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,340
What about the lives in the four Continents and three Realms?

503
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:36,160
People of Yiyue Tribe do matter, but the lives of the four continents and three realms are just as important.

504
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,940
What a righteous speech.

505
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,990
Cang Jiumin, you're truly something else.

506
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,340
Who'd ever thought...

507
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,500
the one who least wants to revive the Devil Lord is actually his demon fetus.

508
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,030
You promised me you wouldn't hurt My Lord.

509
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,000
Why are you getting worked up?

510
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,420
Take a look at your lord.

511
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,970
Does he look like he's worried for his life?

512
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:20,960
You'd better not lose yours before you can save anyone else.

513
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,070
Get out.

514
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:29,030
I'm going to have a chat with our Devil Lord.

515
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:48,540
Siying, aren't you afraid that I'll kill you first after I become the Devil Lord?

516
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,100
As long as Your Highness can resurrect,

517
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,080
my life...

518
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,440
is worth nothing.

519
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,610
Take your hand away.

520
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,220
Cang Jiumin, this body of yours is the Devil Lord's shell.

521
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,070
I wouldn't damage it for no reason.

522
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,490
After ten thousand years, I've finally seen this face again.

523
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,630
I'm in a good mood today. Let me tell you a story.

524
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,300
Have you seen this yellow-red umbrella?

525
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,700
She's not an artifact spirit, but my elder sister.

526
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,570
Elder sister?

527
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,620
She's called Mo Nv. And I'm called Siying.

528
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,210
We were born by the Chi River, and we depended on each other for a living.

529
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,260
We lived our life without worries.

530
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,230
<i>Wait for me.</i>

531
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,490
Until one day,

532
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,960
the God of War, Tian Hao, from the immortal realm, took us away.

533
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,080
He put my sister into the Sun Quadripod.

534
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,160
Later, it was His Lordship who killed Tian Hao and saved me.

535
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,160
My sister's primordial soul was damaged.

536
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,100
His Lordship sent her soul to the mortal realm.

537
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:32,130
Her body was fused with this red umbrella and has always been by my side.

538
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,230
From then on, His Lordship had become my benefactor forever.

539
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,730
But ten thousand years have passed.

540
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,960
Even my sister's primordial soul has returned.

541
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,080
His Lordship hasn't resurrected yet.

542
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,610
I feel guilty towards His Lordship.

543
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,040
Guilty?

544
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,190
Is this the reason for you to do evil for him?

545
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,110
That's not the whole truth.

546
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:05,240
Although we do bring drought and eat travelers passing by, that's just our nature.

547
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,210
Everything is for survival.

548
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,320
Just like beasts will hunt, we are observing the laws of nature.

549
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,800
Why were the two of us alone getting punished by the immortal realm?

550
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,930
Was it truly right with what the gods did to my sister and me?

551
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,000
I want the orders of the world to collapse completely!

552
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,410
Only His Lordship's All-in-Distress Path can rule the world.

553
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,000
How stupid.

554
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,970
Do you know relationships like parents or siblings and ethics based on seniority

555
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,930
are the foundation of the order of the world.

556
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:41,450
Your deceptive narrative is just to cover up your hatred for this world.

557
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,300
It is your futile attempt to confuse the original order of the world.

558
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,160
Your hatred towards this world originated from your love for your sister.

559
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,910
The world didn't fail you.

560
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:58,950
If you do this, how are you different from Tian Hao who hurt you and your sister?

561
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,050
You keep looking for a shell that's not for the Devil Lord because you can't let go of your obsession.

562
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,490
What you want is but an illusion after all.

563
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,060
Your reasoning is contradictory.

564
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,630
After living ten thousand years, you're still so foolish.

565
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,590
How pathetic.

566
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:19,560
Shut up!

567
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:28,170
You are still useful to His Lordship. Otherwise, I would have pulled your tongue out.

568
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,450
Are you going to kill me?

569
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,530
How can I kill My Lord?

570
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,090
You're the demon fetus we've been waiting for ten thousand years.

571
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,720
Why don't you let me serve you?

572
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,300
Just accept your destiny.

573
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:47,930
I knew you wouldn't give up the idea of returning to your immortal sect so easily.

574
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,900
How about I show you something good?

575
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,650
While you were sleeping just now, your subordinates didn't slack.

576
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:04,220
Jingmie already sent the good news that you had returned to the devil realm to the immortal sects.

577
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
What's wrong with him?

578
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,900
He doesn't look right.

579
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,670
I'm presenting a gift to you on behalf of the two guards of the Devil Lord.

580
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,710
What's going on?

581
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,260
Yeah, what happened to him?

582
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,780
Trying to play tricks?

583
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,330
My thanks to the Hengyang Sect for keeping the demon fetus alive for us.

584
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,960
Now Cang Jiumin has returned to Barren Abyss.

585
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,660
The Devil Palace is reopened.

586
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,480
The Devil Lord will soon be revived!

587
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,360
The Devil Lord is really coming?

588
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,130
So Cang Jiumin did harbor evil designs!

589
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,810
What should we do now?

590
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,050
What should we do?

591
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,960
<i>[Till The End of The Moon]</i>

592
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:27,440
