18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,050
<i>Why did you come back?</i>

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,630
<i>Interesting. The sweetness from his blood has arrived.</i>

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,740
Are you here to kill me?

21
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,273
No.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,560
I am here to listen to you tell me the reason behind your actions.

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,700
Back then you swore to me that you would not become the Devil Lord.

24
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,000
I believed it without a doubt.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,930
But why have things become like this now?

26
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,080
Tell me!

27
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,780
Because I hate you.

28
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,010
Five hundred years ago,

29
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,460
I married you...

30
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,210
and was willing to share the world with you,

31
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,240
but you betrayed me on our wedding day and wanted to kill me…

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,540
Later, I searched for you in the Nether River for 500 years.

33
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,550
Day after day, my body was eroded beyond recognition and I felt pain all over my body.

34
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,743
But what were you doing?

35
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:47,320
You became an immortal in the Heaven Lake on Mount Changze,

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,600
indifferent to the affairs of the world.

37
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,443
In the end,

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,360
you just said lightly that you deceived me, concealed from me, hurt me, and tried to kill me,

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,120
all for the sake of the people of the world.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,750
Do you think I can forgive you just like that?

41
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,240
Do you think this is fair?

42
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,830
Didn't you say you wanted to reverse destiny

43
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,720
and prevent the Devil Lord from destroying the three realms?

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,970
Look at all this now.

45
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,700
These are all your retributions,

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,970
as well as Ye Xiwu's.

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,290
You once said that...

48
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,920
I was born as the Devil Lord.

49
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,460
In my heart,

50
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,650
hatred is always deeper than love.

51
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,730
Tantai Jin, you are lying.

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
Li Susu,

53
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,720
stop acting smart.

54
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,680
<i>Kill her!</i>

55
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,981
<i>Kill her! And then you can end this damned destiny.</i>

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,770
<i>Kill her! And then you can truly become me!</i>

57
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,830
<i>Tantai Jin, do it!</i>

58
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,360
<i>It's the Devil Lord…</i>

59
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,310
<i>My hand!</i>

60
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,620
<i>She is the daughter of Dimian and Chuhuang.</i>

61
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,020
<i>A stupid woman and a traitor...</i>

62
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,950
<i>wouldn't make a good breed.</i>

63
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,730
<i>Tantai Jin, she used the Mirror of the Past to come to your side in order to kill you.</i>

64
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,430
She's here to save me.

65
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,670
<i>You are already the Devil Lord, why do you need salvation?</i>

66
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,170
<i>Kill her!</i>

67
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,260
<i>Kill her and you won't feel any pain anymore.</i>

68
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,650
<i>Kill her! Do it!</i>

69
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,890
<i>What are you hesitating for?</i>

70
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>Kill her! Kill her!</i>

71
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,330
<i>She's about to die, but you are still trapped here by me,</i>

72
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,650
<i>not able to do anything.</i>

73
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,160
<i>Jin,</i>

74
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,460
<i>since your birth,</i>

75
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,460
<i>anyone who had anything to do with you became unfortunate.</i>

76
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,330
<i>What were their names again?</i>

77
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,140
<i>I don't quite remember.</i>

78
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,680
<i>The Yiyue woman that gave birth to you,</i>

79
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,130
<i>your father that hated your guts,</i>

80
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>the lowly maids that served you,</i>

81
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,290
<i>and that friend of yours.</i>

82
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,750
<i>Of course, there was also that white-haired old man who taught you boring principles.</i>

83
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,400
<i>I think he was the most interesting.</i>

84
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,340
<i>Do you know what's so interesting about him?</i>

85
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,960
<i>His donkey. It was the most interesting, and I wanted to ride it.</i>

86
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
<i>They were all tiny ants.</i>

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,170
<i>How could they compare with me and be worthy of your high regard?</i>

88
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,260
<i>Their misfortune was destined.</i>

89
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,380
<i>The world never really loved you.</i>

90
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,290
<i>Only suffering and misfortune are your eternal destination.</i>

91
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
<i>Come here, Tantai Jin.</i>

92
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,030
<i>Come to me, and then you can rule everything.</i>

93
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,233
No.

94
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,233
Susu, wait for me for a little longer.

95
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,570
You are wrong.

96
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,940
My mother was beautiful and kind,

97
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,330
but unfortunately, you chose her and she gave birth to the demon fetus.

98
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,370
But she loved me selflessly, even more than her own life.

99
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,100
My father gave me flesh and blood.

100
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,530
Although he had abused me because of my mother's death,

101
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,490
I still believe that he must have sincerely looked forward to my birth

102
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,520
when I was in my mother's womb.

103
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,970
All his life, he deeply loved my mother.

104
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,160
Jing Lan'an and Yingxin did their best to protect me

105
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,050
and take care of me while I was growing up...

106
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,920
under the most difficult circumstances.

107
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,990
Xiao Lin was my enemy in political affairs,

108
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,290
but as a friend, he never let me down.

109
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,840
I had always owed him.

110
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,340
My master...

111
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,600
Immortal Zhaoyou saved me from the Ruo Water.

112
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,730
Knowing my unfortunate background, he still taught me day and night,

113
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,120
giving me a new chance at life.

114
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,220
Regarding Susu, I need not say more.

115
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,010
She risked her life to save me and pull me out of hell.

116
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:45,540
It was she who taught me how to love and feel all emotions.

117
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,690
It was she who broke through the darkness again and again and helped me to see the light.

118
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,933
You see, although I did not receive much love, it was better than nothing.

119
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,160
The only one who pities himself, resents himself and wants to destroy everything,

120
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,300
had always been you and only you.

121
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,170
<i>Tantai Jin,</i>

122
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,610
<i>you are so ridiculous.</i>

123
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,740
<i>You have already ascended to the top,</i>

124
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,350
<i>yet you are still lingering in the dust and weeds of the mortal world.</i>

125
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,813
<i>Since you are so unwilling to become the Devil Lord,</i>

126
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,383
<i>then...</i>

127
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>I have to do it myself.</i>

128
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,100
<i>You are me.</i>

129
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>This is your only destiny.</i>

130
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,420
Is the Devil Lord getting stronger again?

131
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,060
I… I think so.

132
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,460
This oppression, I can barely breathe.

133
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,510
<i>Looks like he is about to become the Devil Lord.</i>

134
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,120
♫ <i> The roar of star-like fireballs </i> ♫

135

142

<i>They are my heart, my bones, and my eyes.</i>

147

but you, you are stuck in the karma of the past.

153
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,020
There will always be one Devil Lord in this world.

154
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,000
Now,

155
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,950
I am the Devil Lord.

156
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,160
<i>Tantai Jin, </i>

157
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,990
<i>no matter if it's you becoming me or I becoming you, </i>

158
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,960
<i>the result will be the same.</i>

159
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,540
<i>You are the only Devil Lord now.</i>

160
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,960
<i>Only a true god can destroy the Devil Lord.</i>

161
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,030
<i>And the true god…</i>

162
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,430
<i>My wife is Chuhuang, the last god of the Phoenix Clan.</i>

163
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,710
<i>The Phoenix clan is naturally suitable for cultivating the Heartless Path, which is a shortcut to becoming a god.</i>

164
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,263
<i>Susu… The Heartless Path…</i>

165
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,970
I understand now.

166
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,763
So,

167
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,450
this is the only way out.

168
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,790
Announce to the four continents. Three days later,

169
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,620
I will marry the purest and most flawless Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal from Mount Changze.

170
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,460
Tell the various immortal sects that if they want to come and congratulate me,

171
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,780
I will open the gate of the Devil Realm and let them in.

172
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:27,420
<i>- Congratulations, Devil Lord!
- Congratulations, Devil Lord!</i>

173
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>Congratulations, Devil Lord!</i>

174
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,140
<i>- Congratulations, Devil Lord!
- Congratulations, Devil Lord!</i>

175
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,540
<i>[Groom: Cang Jiumin, Bride: Li Susu]</i>

176
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,420
The Devil Lord is forcibly marrying Junior Sister clearly to humiliate our Hengyang Sect and the immortal sects.

177
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,310
However, at that time, the gate of the Devil Realm will be open.

178
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,350
We can take advantage of the Devil Lord's arrogance and join forces to kill him.

179
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,060
Yes!

180
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,920
We cannot stand by and watch the Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal be so insulted.

181
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Sect Leader Gongye, we, the Xiaoyao Sect, will fully support you in organizing immortal sects.

182
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,280
That's right, Senior Brother Sect Leader. The elders of the immortal sects have all been murdered.

183
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,480
Only you can reunite the immortal sects.

184
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,420
We have no time to hesitate any longer.

185
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,030
If we miss this opportunity to go deep into the Barren Abyss and kill the devil,

186
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,860
<i>[Calm The Mind, Cleanse The Soul]</i>

187
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,780
there will be no chance to redeem the situation in the future.
<i>[Calm The Mind, Cleanse The Soul]</i>

188
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,630
<i>There are only three days before Tantai Jin forcibly marries Junior Sister.</i>

189
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,040
<i>With my current strength, I am no match for him at all.</i>

190
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,830
<i>Master, is this the Demon-Sealing Cliff?</i>

191
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,110
<i>Since the founding of the Hengyang Sect,</i>

192
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,650
<i>the ancestors have laid out formations here to imitate the Barren Abyss and seal and refine demons.</i>

193
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,310
<i>Master, will it work if we use the evil path to counter it?</i>

194
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,220
<i>The power of evil destroys your mind and soul. We must not be contaminated by it.</i>

195
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,300
<i>Even if the original intention is to use evil to fight evil,</i>

196
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,580
<i>after going awry and down the path of the devil, one will not be able to distinguish between an enemy and an ally.</i>

197
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,750
<i>In this way, one will be bewitched by the devil energy and become a puppet of the devil.</i>

198
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,070
<i>I can't care so much anymore.</i>

199
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,703
<i>Tantai Jin, you are my sworn enemy.</i>

200
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:50,310
<i>Even if I die, I will drag you to hell!</i>

201
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,850
Susu, when you wake up, you will surely hate me to the bone.

202
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,660
I promised you that I would not let your nightmares happen again.

203
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,510
But now...

204
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,900
I have no choice.

205
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:02,950
At that wedding 500 years ago, you pierced soul-slaying spikes into my heart with your own hands.

206
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,490
This time I hope you can be as resolute as you were back then.

207
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,223
<i>Nian Baiyu, I once promised you to save the Yiyue tribe.</i>

208
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:33,060
<i>Now I can finally fulfill my promise to you and the tribe.</i>

209
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:50,210
<i>As the chief of the Yiyue tribe, this is the only and the last thing I can do for you.</i>

210
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,383
Lord!

211
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,500
<i>Judging from the situation outside the barrier, the foul energy has become heavier again.</i>

212
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,223
<i>This is… Lord's messenger crow.</i>

213
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,283
Come out!

214
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,850
Now that the Devil Lord is revived, do you have any way to help me kill the Devil Lord?

215
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,210
Someone asked me to give you this Great Celestial Punishment Array.

216
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,690
<i>Great Celestial Punishment Array?</i>

217
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,760
<i>Everything is well prepared.</i>

218
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,140
Stop struggling.

219
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,870
Where are you?

220
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,100
I am already the Devil Lord, so everywhere, of course.

221
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,490
Congrats, Li Susu.

222
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,680
Tomorrow, you will ride this Dragon Chariot and become the Devil Lord's wife.

223
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
The Devil Lord's wife?

224
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,833
Yes.

225
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,030
Five hundred years ago,

226
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,170
we got married twice.

227
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,390
In Enlightened Life, Mingye married Sang Jiu, too.

228
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,940
But this time, it will be different.

229
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,450
The one who marries you is the Devil Lord himself.

230
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,240
To marry you, this treacherous and traitorous devil, would be the shame of my eternal life.

231
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,100
I would rather die now.

232
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,210
I am the Devil Lord.

233
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:16,660
Li Susu, as long as your soul lives on, the entanglement between us will never end.

234
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,930
<i>Li Susu, why don't you just save your strength?</i>

235
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,853
<i>Never mind.</i>

236
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,610
The wedding is near.

237
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,690
From now on, you will no longer have your freedom.

238
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:35,080
Before this, is there anywhere that you want to go?

239
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,070
Let me think.

240
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,880
Is it this place?

241
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,930
Why do you bring me to the Mo River?

242
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,210
No reason.

243
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,150
It was a momentary thought so we came here.

244
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,640
Sit with me for a while.

245
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,900
Do you still remember Sang Jiu and Mingye?

246
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,520
I've been thinking lately.

247
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,110
The war of gods and demons was so grand.

248
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:41,800
Compared with it, the love between the two of them was so tiny.

249
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,850
If not for the Enlightened Life,

250
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:50,390
I'm afraid no one in the coming generations will remember this forgotten memory.

251
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,540
Such heart-wrenching love perished so easily in the sands of time.

252
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,373
This shows...

253
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:11,920
how insignificant and ridiculous love is.

254
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,833
But... I'm different from Mingye.

255
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,600
I'll be at the highest peak soon.

256
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,650
You must stay by my side.

257
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,180
Stop boasting about yourself.

258
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,820
Mingye is a legitimate God of War in the Shangqing God Realm.

259
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,440
Although he did fail Sang Jiu, he countered the ancient Devil Lord.

260
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,880
He acted with a clear conscience for the world and everyone in it.

261
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,510
Compared with him, you're too greedy and indifferent to others' lives.

262
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,330
A person like you doesn't get to comment on their love at all.

263
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,350
Never mind. Now that we're here,

264
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,950
I'll take you to see another thing.

265
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,170
This is…

266
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,580
Ye Mansion in the capital of Sheng.

267
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,913
That's right. It's been 500 years.

268
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:45,780
Now in the ruins of the capital of Sheng, this mansion hasn't existed since long ago.

269
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,560
You can take it as my Enlightened Life.

270
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,590
A barrier created by me.

271
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,620
A place that doesn't exist.

272
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:02,010
Tantai Jin, if you really have nothing to hold dear to and truly decided to be the Devil Lord,

273
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,590
- then why do you…
- I just think it's interesting.

274
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,343
Look.

275
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:13,140
The Mo River flows on and on.

276
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,060
It seems to be changing all the time.

277
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,580
But it seems to have never changed, either.

278
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,213
When love fades, hatred dissipates,

279
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:25,880
and our physical bodies perish, how can we prove

280
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,760
that these emotions existed once?

281
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,700
Will our story be known by posterity?

282
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,610
You're already the invincible Devil Lord.

283
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,310
Why do you fear perishing anyway?

284
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,790
Of course, I don't.

285
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,740
I'm just curious.

286
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,180
If others become you and me in Enlightened Life, how would they feel?

287
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,820
For Ye Xiwu and Tantai Jin from 500 years ago,

288
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,600
the Devil Lord and Li Susu have already become your so-called others.

289
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,210
Really?

290
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,280
Seems to make sense.

291
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,753
Come and watch it with me.

292
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,080
Miss, there you are! I've been looking for you.

293
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,780
- Chuntao, I…
- Miss, you're wearing so little on such a cold day.

294
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,020
If Grandmother finds out she'll definitely scold me.

295
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,980
- Take this thermal jug to warm your hand.
- Second Sister!

296
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,130
Second Sister!

297
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,220
Eldest Brother, where are you going like this?

298
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,510
I'm going hunting with Cui Shisan and others.

299
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,150
If Father asks about me, tell him I went to school.

300
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,250
The rabbit fur is the softest in this season. I'll make fur gloves for you and Grandma.

301
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,670
They're going to be super warm.

302
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,110
Go ahead. Be careful.

303
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,643
Got it!

304
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,280
<i>Father.</i>

305
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,360
<i>Qingyu.</i>

306
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,260
Great spear moves! Of course. You're still too young.

307
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,410
When you can undertake a military task alone…

308
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,460
- Sister.
- Little One.

309
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,700
- Father.
- Why are you so late?

310
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,330
- Grandmother...
- Grandmother's been waiting for you.

311
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,210
Nobody's words worked on her. She won't eat without you.

312
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,050
Do you know how many times we warmed the dishes?

313
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,000
Look at you.

314
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,390
Little One! Little One!

315
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,453
Grandmother.

316
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:52,600
Look at you. You didn't eat your meals properly.

317
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,860
And you're still wearing so little.

318
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,800
It's going to snow outside, but you're still running around out there.

319
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,840
Mr. Tantai, you're to blame, too.

320
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,090
He can't just let you do whatever you like.

321
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,590
You've been like this all year round.

322
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,300
Yes, Grandmother. I'll definitely take good care of Xiwu.

323
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,110
That's more like it.

324
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,960
This is my most precious daughter. I've doted on her since she was young.

325
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,590
You have to take good care of her.

326
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,100
Don't let her suffer a tiny bit at all.

327
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,750
Understood. General Ye,

328
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,460
after I marry Xiwu,

329
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,730
I'll definitely see her as my precious and I will never let her feel wronged.

330
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,400
That's what I'm talking about.

331
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,190
- No, I'm just…
- Look at you.

332
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,030
Stop scaring him like this all day long.

333
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,560
- No, I'm just teasing him.
- You...

334
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,700
Come on. You two, come inside and have dinner.

335
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,490
- Come on.
- Come.

336
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,460
Let's go.

337
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,780
Come on. Let's eat.

338
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,860
What exactly are you up to?

339
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,660
In this Ye Mansion, there's no evil bone nor Devil Lord.

340
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,350
I'm just your husband.

341
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,490
How do you like it?

342
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,070
This is the Enlightened Life in your mind?

343
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,493
What?

344
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,560
You don't like it?

345
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,050
You're the Devil Lord. Why do you yearn for this happy mortal life?

346
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,590
You're not me.

347
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,630
How do you know what life the Devil Lord likes?

348
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,160
These are the poor-quality firecrackers from New Year's Eve of that year.

349
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,090
Did you know?

350
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,350
I once made a wish to the fireworks, hoping that you wouldn't become the Devil Lord.

351
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,660
But now I regret loving you.

352
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,340
I even regret wasting that sketch charm.

353
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,240
<i>A Sketch Charm?</i>

354
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,220
<i>It's the New Year. It's worth wasting one.</i>

355
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,190
I was being naive.

356
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,930
I actually believed a stone-like person could grow a heart.

357
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,490
It's just a charm.

358
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,860
With the power I have now, I can show you any wonderful scenery in this world.

359
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:12,173
<i>Ye Xiwu, do you have so much fun every Spring Festival Eve?</i>

360
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:15,400
<i>This year is not quite the same. But it's still fun.</i>

361
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,550
<i>Don't worry, I will be by your side from now on, and no one will dare to harm you anymore.</i>

362
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,350
<i>We can be this happy every year.</i>

363
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:29,533
Li Susu, back then I was the one who was fooled.

364
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,340
When you taught me to draw the sketch, you knew it clearly.

365
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,930
<i>I keep my word. I'm here to fulfill my promise, of course.</i>

366
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,070
<i>What should I teach you…</i>

367
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,450
<i>The one you used to repel the crows at Xiao Lin's that day.</i>

368
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,380
<i>Not that one.</i>

369
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,740
<i>You're just an amateur,</i>

370
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,550
<i>and if you mess the charm up, you might blow up the house.</i>

371
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,230
No matter what I did, I wasn't able to draw it.

372
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,110
What the sketch spell reveals

373
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,040
is the purest and most beautiful thing.

374
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,110
Your body, heart, and mind are the three keys.

375
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,240
When the three unite, you form your core.

376
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,910
<i>Empty thy heart to unite soul and character,</i>

377
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,150
<i>Calm thy body to silence energy and emotions,</i>

378
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,230
<i>Steady thy mind then all three merge into one.</i>

379
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,840
You can only succeed if you are free of evil intentions.

380
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,180
I knew this was very difficult for you.

381
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,510
But I did hope that...

382
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,480
you could make it.

383
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:48,940
♫ <i>I looked into the far distance all my life in the hopes of meeting you</i> ♫

384
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,330
Does it look pretty?

385
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:58,430
What a shame. The beautiful sceneries are just like this firework show.

386
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,300
Splendid but short.

387
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,120
♫ <i>Coming back and forth in one thought</i> ♫

388
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,760
♫ <i>Life is short yet a dream is long</i> ♫

389
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:16,570
♫ <i>I looked into the far distance all my life in the hopes of meeting you</i> ♫

390
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,150
After tomorrow's wedding, will you kill me?

391
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,860
♫ <i>I became the light traveling in darkness</i> ♫

392
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,440
♫ <i>One drop of tears yet a dream is long</i> ♫

393
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,130
That depends on my mood.

394
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,863
There is really no turning back, is there?

395
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,830
We're already at this point.

396
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,630
How do you want me to go back?

397
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,260
Then tonight,

398
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,660
I should bid farewell to you.

399
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,080
♫ <i>Letter to people in my hometown, the spring of the twelfth year has passed</i> ♫

400
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,460
♫ <i>Everything streamed by, sometimes well, other times wasted</i> ♫

401
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,373
<i>Sang Jiu, you have something you want to say to me?</i>

402
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:30,200
♫ <i>Roads are longer than time, nobody to share my thoughts</i> ♫

403
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,280
<i>Before I go, </i>

404
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,380
<i>I just want to get...</i>

405
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,600
<i>what you owe me.</i>

406
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,970
<i>What is that?</i>

407
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,680
<i>You owe me a wedding night.</i>

408
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,760
♫ <i>I understood the most was the moment in the dream</i> ♫

409
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,080
♫ <i>Living long to wander, to awaken, repeat, to sojourn</i> ♫

410

♫ <i>Living separately from the beginning to the end of the year</i> ♫

411
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,540
♫ <i>So what about everywhere in the world, what about springtime</i> ♫

412
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,580
♫ <i>I cannot ask for any of them </i> ♫

413
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,840
♫ <i>"Fortunately" is nothing but all ordinary human affairs</i> ♫

414

♫ <i>Compose an ordinary song</i> ♫

415
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,260
♫ <i>I could only know that there are things we never understand</i> ♫

416
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,900
♫ <i>Destitute and homeless but stay calm and collected</i> ♫

417

♫ <i>Therefore, how many people cheer in a full house</i> ♫

418
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,460
♫ <i>But gaze at the wine glasses silently?</i> ♫

419
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,820
♫ <i>So what about everywhere in the world, what about springtime</i> ♫

420
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,660
♫ <i>I cannot ask for any of them </i> ♫

421
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,140
♫ <i>"Fortunately" is nothing but all ordinary human affairs</i> ♫

422
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,000
♫ <i>Compose an ordinary song</i> ♫

423
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,930
I know.

424
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,470
What I'm going to do next will be extremely cruel to you.

425
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,000
But, Susu, don't blame me.

426
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,780
When all of this ends,

427
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,150
at least you still have the dream in the pearl...

428
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,150
for you to keep as a memento.

429
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,090
<i>The day's about to break.</i>

430
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,990
<i>There's still time to do something useless.</i>

431
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,793
Tantai Jin?

432
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,530
<i>Stop running!</i>

433
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,840
Why do you come here?

434
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,390
Are you here to take me back to the devil realm?

435
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,820
Why are you crying?

436
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,010
I just suddenly realized...

437
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,110
from the first time I saw you to when I left the Sheng Kingdom,

438
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,310
it was actually always winter.

439
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,500
And there's only winter in this memory barrier.

440
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,030
What a shame.

441
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:12,160
Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal, there's no time for you to pity the season.

442
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,720
Let's go. The hour of the wedding is arriving.

443
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,033
Everyone,

444
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,100
since Tantai Jin is so arrogant

445
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,930
as to open the gate of the devil realm on the day of his wedding,

446
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,580
then we can't waste this chance.

447
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,510
Has anyone heard of the Celestial Punishment Array?

448
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,480
Is it the array the gods used to injure the Devil Lord

449
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,320
in the war of celestial pillars from ten thousand years ago?

450
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,060
But this array has long been lost.

451
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,630
It's only been used once in the war of gods and demons.

452
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,830
But, Sect Leader Gongye, how did you get it?

453
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,430
Yeah, Sect Leader Gongye.

454
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,080
Please don't forget Hengyang Sect is the No. 1 sect.

455
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,840
There is nothing surprising about us having secret books.

456
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,530
Back then, the twelve gods had to fall to activate it.

457
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,900
How can we do the same?

458
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,880
This won't be a problem.

459
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,180
As long as you're willing to join hands,

460
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,500
I'll have a way to activate the array.

461
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,810
Sect Leader Gongye, whatever the outcome,

462
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,180
Xiaoyao Sect is willing to work with you to activate the array.

463
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:47,010
Great. Then please inform the other sects about what we discussed today.

464
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,470
It's purely up to them as to whether they're willing to participate in the rehearsal.

465
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,610
When tomorrow comes, I will go to the devil realm with you all...

466
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,220
and put up one last desperate fight against the Devil Lord!
