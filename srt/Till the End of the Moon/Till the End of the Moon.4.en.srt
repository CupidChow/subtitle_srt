00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,619
♫ <i>Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

16

<i>Princess Yue Ruanruan, known for her gentleness and virtues, is hereby granted the title of Consort Rou.</i>

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,830
<i>She will be welcomed and greeted with a grand wedding ceremony.</i>

18
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,430
<i>A nationwide celebration.</i>

19
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,730
<i>May Your Majesty and Her Highness love each other forever, and may your descendants thrive on and on!</i>

20

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,459
Congrats, Your Majesty! Consort Rou is pregnant!

25
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,090
Auntie.

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,680
<i>Can you sew?</i>

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,430
<i>Of course.</i>

28
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,340
<i>These are our child's clothes.</i>

29
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,210
<i>I must sew them with my own hands.</i>

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,760
<i>You were born with high hopes.</i>

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,590
<i>They loved each other so much.</i>

32
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,699
<i>How could King Jing agree to let him be a hostage prince in Sheng Kingdom?</i>

33
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,489
<i>Your Majesty, Consort Rou has been in difficult labor for three days.</i>

34
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,999
<i>The imperial doctor has tried all methods.</i>

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,909
<i>I'm afraid you can only save one of them.</i>

36
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,629
<i>Your Majesty, please decide soon.</i>

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,679
<i>What's there to decide? Of course, you should save Consort Rou.</i>

38
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,039
<i>I just want her to live. Everything else doesn't matter. Go now!</i>

39
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,399
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Princess. Princess, hang in there.

40
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,399
<i>His Majesty's order: keep Consort Rou alive is the top priority.</i>

41
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,030
Princess.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,360
<i>Lan'an, you must save this child.</i>

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,530
<i>Don't let him die because of me.</i>

44
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,780
<i>He will be a kind-hearted child.</i>

45
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,800
<i>Please.</i>

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,850
Monster!

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,749
Princess!

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,839
- Someone!
- Princess!

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,940
Someone, please help!

50
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,309
<i>He shouldn't have been born into this world.</i>

51
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,720
<i>He's responsible for Consort Rou's death.</i>

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,330
<i>He killed the woman I loved the most.</i>

53
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,490
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:24,690
Your Majesty, the little prince hasn't had any milk since he was born.

55
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,879
If you banish him to a deserted palace, he won't be able to survive. Your Majesty!

56
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,109
Please have mercy! Please have mercy!

57
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,499
He's not my son!

58
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,160
He's a monster!

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,830
Your Majesty!

60
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,370
The little prince is Her Highness' only bloodline.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,629
Your Majesty!

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,560
If the little prince dies, Her Highness will really be gone for good, Your Majesty!

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,200
Please have mercy!

64
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,030
If you insist on protecting him, you shall be his guardian.

65
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,450
You shall fend for yourselves in the palace.

66
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,090
Thanks, Your Majesty!

67
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,569
- Thanks, Your Majesty!
- Thanks, Your Majesty!

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,290
Let's go quickly!

69
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,699
Your Majesty, these are all lucky names provided by the Ministry of Rites for the little prince.

70
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,070
Please decide which one it shall be.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
I understand.

72
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,890
<i>The names of all children bear the expectations of parents.</i>
<i>[Jin] (Jin means ashes.)</i>

73
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,010
<i>But Tantai Jin's name was a curse.</i>

74
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,800
<i>Why is someone awake?</i>

75
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,330
Watch out!

76
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,590
Tantai Jin? Tantai Jin?

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,630
I only left for a short while, and you two broke free.

78
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
You're quite something.

79
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,060
I was wondering why you didn't have nightmares.

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Turns out you don't have any love threads.

81
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,120
What don't I have?

82
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,209
You were born without love threads.

83
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,300
That's why you can't feel emotions.

84
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,189
You won't feel happy or sad.

85
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,800
You won't feel scared, either.

86
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,189
How can a loveless one have nightmares?

87
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,030
What a waste of all your miserable memories.

88
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,920
However, I finally found your weakness just now.

89
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,039
Something you do care about in this world.

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,679
Even if it's only a little.

91
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,460
But that will suffice.

92
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,410
Enjoy your nightmares!

93
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,270
Where is this place?

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,050
How can a baby live here?

95
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,430
He will be frozen to death!

96
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,929
Go find him now.

97
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,480
Find him now!

98
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,150
<i>It seems that Tantai Jin and I entered different timelines.</i>

99
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,239
<i>No.</i>

100
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,500
<i>I must find Young Devil Lord soon.</i>

101
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,479
The divine mirror shines, see through all illusions.

102
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,030
Shatter!

103
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,629
<i>Without Chongyu Harp,</i>

104
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,940
<i>my power isn't enough to break the barrier.</i>

105
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,379
<i>Only after Yingxin's memories end, I can get out.</i>

106
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,500
- Your Highness.
- <i>I hope Young Devil Lord is fine.</i>

107
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,020
Your Highness!

108
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Your Highness!

109
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,340
Your Highness! No!

110
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,250
What should we do, Sister Lan'an? He's not breathing.

111
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,120
Don't speak nonsense!

112
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,550
Your Highness! Your Highness!

113
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,100
Why would he wake up after sucking blood?

114
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,420
He's a monster!

115
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,079
Why was he born with teeth?

116
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,430
Don't say anything like this again.

117
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,080
We can't let others know this.

118
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,120
<i>As expected from Young Devil Lord.</i>

119
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,800
<i>But the war of God and Devil happened ten thousand years ago,</i>

120
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,390
<i>why would he be born at this very time and place?</i>

121
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,670
Here it is.

122
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,049
Your Highness, don't cry.

123
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,049
- Don't cry. Here comes the yummy food.
- Don't cry.

124
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,490
Come on.

125
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,320
- Don't cry.
- <i>Although he led a hard life, at least some tried their best to take care of him.</i>

126
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,720
<i>But how long could they keep living like this?</i>

127
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,690
Here you are.

128
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,379
It's edible.

129
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,930
See?

130
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,280
Stop crying.

131
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,060
It is fine.

132
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,420
Don't cry.

133
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,569
Kneel!

134
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:03,689
Just kneel!

135
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,719
Today, I'm going to let him be our puppy. How about that?

136
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,139
<i>Yeah!</i>

137
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,169
- Bark!
<i>- Bark!</i>

138
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,300
<i>- Come on.
- Bark!</i>

139
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,590
<i>- Come on.
- Bark!</i>

140
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,569
<i>Do it!</i>

141
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,340
<i>Bark!</i>

142
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,909
Come on and bark!

143
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,540
<i>- Bark!</i>
- Come on!

144
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,380
<i>Puppy!</i>

145
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,419
- These little brats!
- Come on!

146
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,280
Give it to him.

147
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,149
You can't kneel to those servants.

148
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,350
Let alone bark like a dog, understand?

149
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,859
They said if I barked, they wouldn't beat me.

150
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,930
And even gave me food.

151
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,920
Don't you know what dignity is?

152
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,650
Were you born without a sense of shame?

153
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,079
<i>As a prince, you're bullied by servants.</i>

154
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,149
<i>Do you have no sense of shame at all?</i>

155
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,840
<i>Sense of shame?</i>

156
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,750
<i>That means nothing to me.</i>

157
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,620
<i>Food is clearly more important.</i>

158
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,839
They keep bullying you like this.

159
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,169
Don't you feel sad?

160
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,859
What's a sense of shame?

161
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,900
What's feeling sad?

162
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,090
They're making fun of you.

163
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,210
Did they not mean to give me food?

164
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,150
No.

165
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,540
I see.

166
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,000
Then, can I kill them?

167
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,040
<i>So this is the nature of a devil god?</i>

168
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,849
I can't take this anymore. His Highness isn't normal at all!

169
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:35,929
He's a monster!

170
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:36,999
What nonsense are you talking about?

171
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,859
He's only six. He's still a child.

172
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:44,629
You think he's abnormal simply because he has been living in the deserted palace and is constantly bullied.

173
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:45,869
Understand?

174
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,170
But…

175
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,830
We're running out of money and jewelry.

176
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,379
We can't sustain like this.

177
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,359
Here's an idea.

178
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,149
A few days from now is the palace maids' off-day.

179
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,570
I'll try to slip out and ask for help from the Yiyue Tribe.

180
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,330
What about me?

181
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,040
Yingxin, I need you to take care of him alone for a while.

182
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,589
His Highness inherited the ability to communicate with animals.

183
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,379
He's the hope of the Yiyue Tribe.

184
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,400
We must save him!

185
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,450
<i>Don't worry.</i>

186
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,470
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

187
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,969
<i>I'll do my best to bring you and His Highness to the Yiyue Tribe soon.</i>

188
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,910
<i>Trust me.</i>

189
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,150
Does it hurt?

190
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,060
Thanks for caring, Your Highness.

191
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm used to it.

192
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,970
<i>Where is Tantai Jin?</i>

193
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,460
Come quickly to hear your edict!

194
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,020
It must be Lan'an coming to save us!

195
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,010
His Highness is here!

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,629
Edict from His Majesty:

197
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,909
"Tantai Jin is to set off immediately to be a Sheng hostage."

198
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,669
What do you mean a Sheng hostage?

199
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,599
Do you even have to ask?

200
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,439
We lost the battle with Sheng Kingdom.

201
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,139
To make peace, His Majesty ordered Tantai Jin to be a hostage prince in the Sheng Kingdom.

202
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,269
He shall set off today.

203
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,020
Understand?

204
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,170
You two help them pack things up.

205
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

206
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,859
Jing Lan'an, you liar!

207
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,239
You escaped to the outside and left me here to die!

208
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,140
Liar!

209
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,740
Liar!

210
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,780
Liar!

211
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,530
<i>We're in the Sheng Kingdom now.</i>

212
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,379
Steward Wu.

213
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,549
You're called Yue Yingxin?

214
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,360
You're the maid who came along with the hostage prince of Jing Kingdom?

215
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,710
Are you taking snacks to him?

216
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,269
I'm not going to eat you.

217
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,789
Get in there.

218
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,460
Yes.

219
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,130
<i>This old turtle is so disgusting!</i>

220
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,970
Your Highness!

221
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,660
Hold down this lowly maid, too!

222
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,669
What are you doing?

223
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,869
Let go of me! Your Highness!

224
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:41,810
Your Highness! Your Highness!

225
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,499
They say you're a freak.

226
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,440
You don't shed tears.

227
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,650
I don't believe there's someone who doesn't shed tears.

228
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,719
Cry for me now. And I'll let you go.

229
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,250
I really can't.

230
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,700
Your Highness!

231
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,500
How's that? Does it hurt?

232
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,510
The hostage prince still isn't crying.

233
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,829
Don't stop!

234
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,749
Go ahead and break his other arm off!

235
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,450
Yes.

236
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,120
Stop!

237
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,960
<i>[Reciting in spring, playing music in summer]</i>

238
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,930
<i>Greetings, Sixth Prince.</i>

239
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,450
You may all rise.

240
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,959
Fifth Brother, Prince Tantai left his home country to be a guest in our kingdom.

241
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,719
He did it for the peace of the two kingdoms.

242
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,079
And also for keeping the civilians free from the pains of war.

243
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,959
We should treat him politely.

244
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,020
How can you bully him without any scruples?

245
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,570
Such a bummer.

246
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,100
Let's go!

247
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,890
Your Highness.

248
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,170
Thank you, Sixth Prince, for saving us.

249
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,130
No need. My fifth brother was being rude.

250
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,789
Prince Tantai looks pale.

251
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,199
Why don't you go back and rest?

252
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,780
I'll explain it to the teacher for you.

253
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,020
Come on. Thank you, Sixth Prince!

254
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,959
Why would that Sixth Prince tell his brother to stop?

255
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,190
And how could he make them fear him?

256
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,349
I heard that Sixth Prince's mother is the queen.

257
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:40,100
She's also His Majesty's favorite in the inner court.

258
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,239
People in the palace are mostly superficial.

259
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
So naturally they dare not offend him.

260
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,639
Mother?

261
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,069
If he didn't have a mother anymore, would he be the same as me?

262
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,829
Actually, what I said isn't necessarily right.

263
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,740
Besides his mother is important and favored,

264
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,879
Six Prince is also gentle and intelligent.

265
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,970
Who wouldn't like him?

266
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,630
Really?

267
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,039
If I behaved like him, will others like me as well and stop bullying me?

268
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,139
<i>[Geography of Four Continents]</i>

269
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,050
"Geography of Four Continents"?

270
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,600
Your Highness, why are you reading this?

271
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,079
It is said that Xiao Lin just went to Mount Buzhao, where he'll cultivate for three years.

272
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,350
I don't know that place. So I wanted to find it in books.

273
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,909
Someone can't even get out of the palace, but is still dreaming about some immortal mountain.

274
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:40,580
Trying to learn spells to fly out of here?

275
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,590
Fifth Prince.

276
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,589
Take this!

277
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,200
Your Highness!

278
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,339
Are you all right?

279
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:04,310
Fifth Prince, why did you hit me?

280
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,370
Why?

281
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,729
Because your smile looks disgusting.

282
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,679
I tell you what, I've had enough of a freak like you!

283
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,849
Now that Xiao Lin's not around, let's see who will protect you in the palace!

284
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,920
Get him!

285
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Your Highness!

286
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,910
Stop it!

287
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,850
Stop!

288
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,260
Your Highness!

289
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,940
I thought they stopped bullying me all these years because

290
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,639
because I acted like Xiao Lin and learned to be a normal person like Lan'an said before she left.

291
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,370
But I didn't know they were just scared of Xiao Lin.

292
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,890
Sixth Prince, congrats for completing your training and moving into your new mansion!

293
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,159
Good things come in pairs!

294
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,380
Congrats! Congrats!

295
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,310
Prince Tantai?

296
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,100
We haven't met for three years. Thank you for coming today.

297
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,479
Congratulations.

298
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Look! Eldest Miss Ye is here!

299
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,210
Who is this lady?

300
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,830
She's the daughter of the Pillar of the State Great General.

301
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,060
Miss Ye.

302
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,590
Your Highness.

303
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,500
It's getting chilly.

304
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,550
Be careful not to catch a cold.

305
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

306
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,110
This…

307
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,610
Prince Tantai, why are you here?

308
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,380
Miss Ye.

309
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,620
The weather is chilly. Be careful not to catch a cold.

310
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Your Highness, I don't feel cold.

311
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,640
Please keep the cloak for yourself.

312
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,709
<i>Could Tantai Jin like Ye Bingchang because he was imitating Xiao Lin?</i>

313
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,070
Yingxin, is it because my cloak is worn out?

314
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,670
Tantai Jin!

315
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,610
Who are you trying to disgust this time?

316
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,999
Fifth Prince, so many people pass by this corridor.

317
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,039
If you plan on beating me up here, I'm afraid…

318
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,730
You haven't heard?

319
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,069
Now, the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms are at war.

320
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,480
If I beat you like a Jing dog, who's gonna stop me?

321
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,340
Get him!

322
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,549
Your Highness!

323
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,549
Take that!

324
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,100
Your Highness!

325
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,679
Stop it!

326
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,790
<i>He's been getting beaten so frequently.</i>

327
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,040
<i>When does this ever end?</i>

328
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,900
Yingxin,

329
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,580
what does it feel like to be liked?

330
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,510
You're not answering.

331
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,210
Is it because you don't like me, either?

332
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,539
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

333
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:40,720
I didn't mean that.

334
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:50,130
When I was little, I couldn't understand what the looks on people's faces meant.

335
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,100
But now,

336
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,900
I sort of understand a little.

337
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,810
Actually, you've always resented me.

338
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,200
It's because of me that you're trapped in this dark and remote palace.

339
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,430
Yingxin, I don't blame you.

340
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,220
I resent myself, too.

341
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,399
I know people out there don't like me.

342
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,820
Normally speaking,

343
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,980
I should feel sad inside.

344
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,989
If it were Xiao Lin, he'd be ridden with such guilt that he couldn't eat.

345
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,380
Later on, I started imitating Xiao Lin.

346
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,300
I imitated everything he did,

347
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,260
hoping that I could gradually become him.

348
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,500
To be someone likable just like Xiao Lin.

349
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,510
But Yingxin, I still can't feel a thing.

350
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,980
I was faking it when I smiled like him.

351
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,590
I was faking it when I was being magnanimous.

352
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,550
I was even...

353
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,290
faking it when I cared about others.

354
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,980
Fake things...

355
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,170
deserve to be detested,

356
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,070
to be loathed,

357
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,020
and to be abandoned.

358
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Forget it.

359
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,149
- For someone like me, being alive is a blessing enough.
- Your Highness.

360
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:29,070
- Why bother asking too much for being loved?
- Your Highness!

361
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,890
<i>Born with an evil bone…</i>

362
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,210
<i>Having no emotions or love…</i>

363
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,780
<i>None of it was what he wanted.</i>

364
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,900
<i>Nor was it his fault.</i>

365
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,210
<i>But once he became Devil Lord,</i>

366
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,790
<i>all those victims were indeed slain by him.</i>

367
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,579
I was ordered to send a verbal message from the Jing Kingdom.

368
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,540
Jing Kingdom?

369
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,799
The hostage prince will soon marry and leave the Palace of Sheng.

370
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,069
But once he does, he might return to the Jing Kingdom.

371
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,220
Once he returns, he'll probably grasp power, and then he'll become untouchable.

372
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,029
That's why Prince Minglang said

373
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,490
the hostage prince should better not leave this palace forever.

374
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,490
<i>Tantai Minglang?</i>

375
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,169
<i>Young Devil Lord's elder brother.</i>

376
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,480
Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?

377
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,890
Then, what's in it for me?

378
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,420
Even displaced horses and birds miss their home.

379
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,269
Prince Minglang knows that you're getting older.

380
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,309
As long as you're willing to help us,

381
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:53,349
we'll think of a way to help you get out of the palace and return to your hometown.

382
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,630
Really?

383
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,189
You've sacrificed your best years and ruined most of your life just for Tantai Jin.

384
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:05,919
Are you really willing to follow this monster until you die in a foreign land?

385
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,199
Yingxin, don't be tempted!

386
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,029
You watched Tantai Jin growing up.

387
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,209
Although he's weird, he never once hurt you.

388
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,410
Do you really have the heart to do this?

389
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,789
He has no family or friends in Sheng Kingdom.

390
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,269
You're the only person he can trust.

391
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:20,070
You can't betray him!

392
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,490
Yingxin! Yingxin!

393
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,550
Okay, I'll do it.

394
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,990
Very well, then. I'll leave for now.

395
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,540
Even you betrayed him.

396
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:43,570
<i>In Tantai Jin's whole life, if only there was someone who truly loved him and held his reins,</i>

397
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,510
<i>maybe… he wouldn't have been forced to become a devil.</i>

398
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,860
It's finally over.

399
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,580
We finally found it.

400
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,460
The demon's den is protected by a barrier.

401
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,550
Bingchang's probably here.

402
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,420
I feel that Tantai Jin and Second Young Miss Ye are imprisoned here, too.

403
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,190
We have to rescue them fast.

404
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,489
Go check the border of this barrier.

405
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,180
Have someone guard the roads.

406
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,969
Yes.

407
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:43,859
Let's go.

408
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,280
Hurry!

409
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,140
Now, we must lure the demon out.

410
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,310
I'll do it.

411
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,410
<i>Demon! We've found your den!</i>

412
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,849
<i>Stop hiding! Otherwise, I'll set your woods on fire!</i>

413
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,440
Free delivery to my doorstep?

414
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,310
<i>I wonder how Yingxin went crazy after.</i>

415
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,410
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

416
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,580
Tantai Jin!

417
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,750
Tantai Jin!

418
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,959
Tantai Jin, wake up!

419
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Tantai Jin!

420
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,830
You said you couldn't dream.

421
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,350
But why is there a nightmare blossom sprouting from you?

422
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,789
Tantai Jin!

423
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,600
Tantai Jin, wake up!

424
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,410
Tantai Jin!

425
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,200
<i>Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin!</i>

426
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,590
<i>Tantai Jin, wake up!</i>

427
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:35,189
I heard Jin is one of the best among the outer disciples of Xiaoyao Sect.

428
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:38,510
And his talents are extraordinary.

429
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,109
He's just doing it for fun.

430
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,480
What? Do you really want Jin to be an immortal?

431
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,510
Let me look at you, dear.

432
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,410
You've really gotten thinner after you left the palace.

433
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,480
Mother.

434
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,950
- Here.
- I have something to tell you, my son.

435
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,889
While you were away cultivating, I've arranged you a marriage.

436
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,480
Thank you, Father.

437
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,729
The bride is the daughter of Sheng Kingdom's General Ye Xiao.

438
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,810
Conflicts can never seem to cease between the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms.

439
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:28,279
After we form a marriage alliance this time, we will be more like friends than enemies.

440
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,610
I'll do what as you wish, Father and Mother.

441
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:40,909
Jin, while you were cultivating in Xiaoyao Sect, did you meet any promising young talents?

442
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,210
The Sixth Prince Xiao Lin of Sheng Kingdom got along well with me.

443
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,379
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

444
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:51,099
<i>Xiao Lin happens to be the one escorting the bride to the Jing Kingdom.</i>

445
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,589
<i>You can spend time with him and get to know him better.</i>

446
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,379
<i>Yes.</i>

447
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:56,650
Congratulations, Your Highness!

448
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,829
<i>I didn't want to choose your wife so hastily.</i>

449
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:03,710
Congratulations, Your Highness!

450
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,000
<i>But now that you have become the crown prince,</i>

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,539
<i>your marriage concerns the kingdom's future.</i>

452
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,880
Congratulations, Your Highness.

453
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,099
<i> Eldest Young Miss Ye is well-educated.</i>

454
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,780
<i>She's also a stunning beauty.</i>

455
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,590
<i>I think you'll like her, my son.</i>

456
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,400
Ye Xiwu?

457
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,280
Why is it you?

458
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,140
Who else?

459
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,700
Who did you think it was?

460
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,030
Mother?

461
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,380
Mother!

462
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,569
Father.

463
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,100
You matricidal bastard!

464
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,680
No.

465
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,060
Father, I didn't kill mother!

466
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,020
Lan'an,

467
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,870
don't go.

468
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,280
<i>You're a monster.</i>

469
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,230
Don't go.

470
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,400
In your yellow-millet dream, you had such a perfect family.
<i>(A yellow millet dream refers to an unfeasible hope.)</i>

471
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,090
How did it feel to be loved by everybody?

472
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,560
Xiao Lin, save me!

473
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,900
But that's all fake.

474
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:42,060
Once you wake up from these dreams, no one will care about you, nor will anyone love you.

475
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,340
All this time, you've been imitating me,

476
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,100
hoping you could be like me, to be acknowledged by others.

477
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,459
But in your dream just now, you got everything you ever wanted.

478
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,210
Love from your parents.

479
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,700
Easily ascending to the throne.

480
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,800
Even I'd envy that kind of life.

481
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,800
But can you really feel happiness?

482
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,699
I cannot feel anything.

483
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:23,299
I felt nothing.

484
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:28,200
If not for you, your mother wouldn't have died.

485
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,180
Your father wouldn't have suffered the loss of his beloved.

486
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,630
Lan'an wouldn't have wasted away in that dark palace.

487
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,760
Yingxin wouldn't have been insulted time and time again.

488
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,970
They were all your nearest and dearest.

489
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,760
But they all hate you.

490
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,900
I never intended to do them harm.

491
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,230
Never.

492
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,540
See?

493
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,030
All emotions, affections, and desires mean nothing to you.

494
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,580
All you have ever known was to protect yourself.

495
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,219
You don't understand or care about other people's pain at all.

496
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,690
I understand.

497
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,780
I understand it all.

498
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,489
I just can't feel it.

499
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,000
Tantai Jin, you are really pathetic.

500
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,400
You're alive, but you can't feel the slightest beauty of this mortal world.

501
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,320
You can't even feel the pain of this mortal world.

502
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,789
The only point of your existence is to bring torment to others.

503
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,240
No!

504
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,000
To be despised and hated by others.

505
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,060
Why… are you even alive?

506
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,659
No! That's not true!

507
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:52,690
But at least, your mother never hated you!

508
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,720
She loved you till the very end.

509
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,530
If you could see her and hear her say how much she loved you,

510
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,870
you could break free from this fate.

511
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,320
Do you want to see her?

512
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,170
The chance is right before your eyes.

513
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,380
What are you waiting for?

514
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,119
<i>You must experience all pain in the world and draw endless hatred.</i>

515
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,549
<i>You're carrying the curse of your fate.</i>

516
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,709
<i>You're destined to have a bitter end.</i>

517
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,159
<i>When your pain reaches its peak, when your life reaches the end,</i>

518
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,860
<i>I will come and accept your offering.</i>

519
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,530
I'm done waiting.

520
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,510
I do not want to wait any longer.

521
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,410
Tantai Jin! You can't die!

522
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,200
<i>Why is my power weakening?</i>

523
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,480
Xiao Lin!

524
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,160
Hurry, Junior Martial Uncle.

525
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,090
Ah, whatever. This will do!

526
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,450
We did it!

527
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,320
Where did she go?

528
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,100
So you ruined my vines.

529
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,060
I should've swallowed you and let your soul disperse!

530
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,380
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

531
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,709
<i>Why not have a taste of this demon?</i>

532
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,319
What are you talking about?

533
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,710
<i>Your blood restrains all demons in this world.</i>

534
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,310
<i>Your body can bear their demonic powers.</i>

535
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:18,920
<i>As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power.</i>

536
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,680
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

537
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,000
<i>This power is what your body craves.</i>

538
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,730
<i>Isn't it more fun than emotions and desires?</i>

539
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,010
Don't try to fool me again!

540
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,829
<i>With the whip of power in your hands, you'll be the highest ruler of this world.</i>

541
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:06,460
<i>This is the taste of power!</i>

542
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,680
<i>I promise you this, once you've tasted it,</i>

543
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,110
<i>you'll never want to lose it again.</i>

544
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,010
Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin!

545
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,250
Your Highness, Eldest Young Miss Ye is over here.

546
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,730
Bingchang!

547
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,630
Where's that demon?

548
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,340
Was she blasted to ashes by the spell I used?

549
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,600
Let's save the people first.

550
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,220
Bingchang!

551
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,100
Bingchang!

552
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,490
No…

553
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,240
No…

554
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,990
Tantai Jin!

555
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,450
<i>Am I back again?</i>

556
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,380
Miss!

557
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,229
Miss, you're finally awake!

558
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,129
I was worried sick! I thought you were going to die.

559
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,059
Where's Tantai Jin? Is he dead?

560
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:19,609
Mr. Tantai was placed in the east-wing chamber.

561
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:23,229
He hasn't woken up yet, but he's probably not gonna die.

562
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,810
Chuntao, how did we get back?

563
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,659
I can't remember.

564
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,029
It was Sixth Prince who brought you back.

565
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,579
The imperial doctor said you passed out just because you were too weak.

566
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:44,129
Her Ladyship and Old Master sat by your bed for a whole night and just left to rest.

567
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,179
What about my sister? Is she all right?

568
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:49,509
Eldest Young Miss is okay now.

569
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,880
Sixth Prince is looking after her.

570
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,379
<i>The damage in the nightmares were real.</i>

571
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,540
<i>Thank god I stopped him from slitting his throat.</i>

572
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,570
<i>Tantai Jin can't die.</i>

573
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:16,430
<i>But who can withstand such a painful life?</i>

574
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,770
<i>If I can give him a hand,</i>

575
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:24,499
<i>would he be able to live normally and not turn into Devil Lord?</i>

576
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,049
<i>Li Susu, you're actually sympathizing with him.</i>

577
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,649
<i>He destroyed Hengyang Sect. He killed so many people.</i>

578
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,779
<i>He plagued the three realms and four continents.</i>

579
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:37,710
<i>He must pay for all these debts.</i>

580
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,670
<i>Even if he's suffering so terribly now, it's his fate.</i>

581
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,109
<i>But it's now five hundred years ago.</i>

582
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,699
<i>He hasn't yet killed anyone, nor is he capable of causing harm.</i>

583
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,239
<i>Being constantly bullied is simply cruelty for doing no wrong.</i>

584
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,989
<i>Since I was little, Father taught me to be upright and be true to my heart.</i>

585
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:02,930
<i>Now that I know all this, and if I'm secretly happy for it, I'll be confusing right from wrong.</i>

586
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,359
Second Young Miss, please have some rest before you see her.

587
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,839
Even if you are hurried to see Sixth Prince…

588
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,160
- Wait till you can stand properly…
- I'm going to see Tantai Jin.

589
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:27,630
<i>As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power.</i>

590
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,810
Power.

591
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,050
So,

592
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,900
this is...

593
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:02,060
what power feels like.

594
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,700

00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:25,640
