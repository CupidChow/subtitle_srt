♫  I do not fear   ♫

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,980
   

19
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,510
Fortunately, you weren't hurt.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,080
General Ye, what are you doing?

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,170
His Majesty has gone crazy. Have you gone crazy, too?

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,870
If my sister sees what you've become now,

23
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,390
she will only be disgusted.

24
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,620
That's nonsense.

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,550
Why would she marry me...

26
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,270
if she found me disgusting?

27
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,510
And why would she treat me well?

28
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,500
In this world, only she treated me well.

29
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,920
Only she did…

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,370
I…

31
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,060
I…

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,290
Tantai Jin, I plead with you and with you on her behalf.

33
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,230
Please spare her and let her rest in peace with dignity.

34
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,950
What you gave her, she didn't want. And what she wanted from you, you always failed to fulfill.

35
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,590
She just wanted to leave you.

36
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,220
She was even willing to die for it.

37
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,570
Don't you understand?

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,500
 Heaven above! 

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,580
 I'm willing to give my body, my soul, 

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,480
 and my all. 

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,870
 In exchange, I only wish that you and I...  

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,920
 will never meet again forever. 

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,370
No…

44
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,000
No!

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
I don't want to…

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,010
I don't want to torture her.

47
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,830
I just want to be nice to her,

48
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,950
just like how she protected

49
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,540
and guarded me.

50
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,510
 It's awfully dirty. It'll make you sick. 

51
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,190
 I'm going to beat you up right now! 

52
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,740
 Why are you getting violent? 

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,460
 Love lingers even after only being married for a day. 

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,450
 Saving you is what I'm supposed to do, huh? 

55
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,580
♫  Forget everything that's occurred  ♫

56
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,420
♫  I want to suspend a dream where I can exchange my tears for your return  ♫

57
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,870
♫  My heart's in flames  ♫

58
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,330
 Yes, 

59
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,470
 she wanted to leave me. 

60
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,540
 She wanted to leave so desperately... 

61
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,760
 that she would risk everything. 

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,050
♫  The saltiness of my tears  ♫

63
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,220
♫  be your repayment and my debt  ♫

64
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,540
She did it.

65
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,920
Tantai Jin, your wife,

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,940
my sister, this woman called Ye Xiwu, is dead.

67
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,400
The deceased has passed. It's time to let her rest in peace.

68
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,700
I hope that you know how to do the right thing.

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,370
♫  If fate is a calamity, I cannot help   ♫

70
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,660
♫  But want to resolve it  ♫

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,580
General Ye, wait.

72
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,360
General!

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,710
His Majesty doesn't have many close confidants.

74
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,020
You are the only one who can advise him. You cannot leave like this.

75
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,620
My persuasion will be useless if he is stubbornly trapped in his own delusions.

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,050
I envy him, for he can be so crazy.

77
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,010
I also want to mourn my loved ones as he does.

78
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,440
But how many generals and civilians have died

79
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,340
in this war-torn country?

80
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,070
Jing is now in dire need of someone to revive the country,

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,360
but he is indulging in his own sorrow

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,670
and is unwilling to wake up.

83
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,970
Did my second sister, my father,

84
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,950
my eldest brother,

85
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,260
and Pianran all die in vain?

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,920
He wants to die with my second sister,

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,430
but what about me?

88
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,650
Why would I want to live miserably alone?

89
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,500
But I cannot let them die in vain.

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,840
The broken country and its people

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,270
need someone to carry it forward.

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,270
Can you understand how I feel?

93
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,210
Yes.

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,500
I may never be able to

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,950
be as crazy as His Majesty.

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,550
This is the consequence of those who have been through the horrors of war.

97
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,150
The first thing that comes to my mind is what to do with those who lived,

98
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,940
and who caused them...

99
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,520
to reach this point today.

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,360
The culprit, Tantai Minglang, was killed by His Majesty himself.

101
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,850
General Ye, who are you referring to?

102
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,890
Leader, they have found Ye Bingchang.

103
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,320
She wanted to leave the city in disguise but was recognized by the guards.

104
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Should…

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
Should we lock her back up?

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,970
Leader Nian, can you bring Ye Bingchang here?

107
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,060
I have questions for her.

108
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,870
Why did you escape?

109
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,610
Qingyu, save me.

110
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,270
I don't want to be locked up again.

111
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,540
The dungeon is an abyss of darkness and I have had enough.

112
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
I also understand that I was wrong.

113
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,870
That day in the dungeon,

114
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,440
why did you try to kill my second sister?

115
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,250
If we were one moment late, she would have died there.

116
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,640
I told you, I was taking revenge.

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,380
Ye Xiwu caused Xiao Lin's death.

118
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,460
You're lying!

119
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,280
Ye Bingchang, later on, I thought about it over and over again.

120
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,070
You are her own sister.

121
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,830
If you wanted to kill her, you had many opportunities to do so.

122
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,180
There was no need to wait until she was thrown into prison.

123
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,810
Ye Qingyu, you are indeed the only smart person

124
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,850
in the entire Ye family, besides me.

125
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,240
I am also your sister.

126
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,910
Are you really going to give me no way out

127
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,110
just because of Ye Xiwu?

128
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,310
Don't compare yourself with Second Sister.

129
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,920
What you've been doing has made you disqualified from being a member of the Ye family since long ago.

130
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,950
Is that so, Ye Qingyu?

131
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,310
What right do you have to criticize me from a high and mighty position?

132
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,340
Throughout history, the winners have always took it all.

133
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,540
If Xiao Lin had conquered the world,

134
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,000
it would be Ye Xiwu who would be kneeling here today, being spurned by you.

135
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,310
All right, since you want to know the truth so badly,

136
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,890
I will tell you.

137
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,210
I tried to kill Ye Xiwu

138
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,460
because I didn't want the truth

139
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,640
about the poisoned porridge to be exposed one day.

140
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,940
Poisoned porridge?

141
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,240
Yes. Ye Xiwu wanted to please Tantai Jin.

142
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,560
She couldn't cook but insisted on making porridge.

143
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
So I decided to

144
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,260
put some poison in the porridge.

145
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,940
What did you say?

146
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,550
What about Grandmother?

147
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,010
You knew the porridge was poisoned, and yet you still gave it to Grandmother!

148
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,890
That's right.

149
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,440
I wanted her to die with Tantai Jin

150
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
and Ye Xiwu.

151
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,110
Ye Bingchang,

152
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,590
you are out of your mind!

153
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,820
Not at all!

154
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,380
I was very clear-headed. I just didn't want to tolerate this anymore.

155
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,180
The old lady sided with Ye Xiwu and only loved her.

156
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,300
Since she liked Ye Xiwu so much,

157
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,000
I could just fulfill her wish.

158
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,100
Then, why did you want to fatally poison Tantai Jin?

159
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Tantai Jin!

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,990
It's all because of him that Xiao Lin was nothing.

161
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,870
I lost everything.

162
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,890
Later,

163
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,310
he even took away the love threads.

164
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,310
Yet he still wanted me to live,

165
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,070
but I could not accept it.

166
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,480
I wouldn't have fallen to this point if it weren't for him.

167
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,540
I see.

168
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,310
If it weren't for you, Xiao Lin wouldn't have died.

169
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,100
I thought Ye Xiwu wanted to kill me for Xiao Lin,

170
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
so that was why everything happened afterward.

171
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,830
 Open your mouth. 

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,900
You wanted to kill me,

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,240
but you had Xiao Lin killed.

174
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,240
Since then, Ye Xiwu hated me to the bone,

175
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,800
which led to where we are today.

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,780
Nonsense!

177
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,970
It wasn't me!

178
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,200
It was you!

179
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,680
You and Ye Xiwu had Xiao Lin killed!

180
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Ye Bingchang,

181
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,600
Xiao Lin entrusted me to spare your life before his death,

182
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,660
so what should I do now?

183
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,970
I never liked this world,

184
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,220
but Ye Xiwu is different.

185
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,600
She loved this world.

186
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,420
She wanted to give love

187
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,790
even to widows and orphans,

188
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,160
to refugees and the common people.

189
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,920
That's why I wanted to try...

190
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,010
to love this world like she did.

191
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,530
But now that...

192
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,490
Ye Xiwu is dead,

193
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,260
my heart is dead, too.

194
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,030
I want to hate everything,

195
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,620
but Ye Xiwu won't be happy about it.

196
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480
Ye Bingchang,

197
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,560
If you like porridge so much,

198
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,760
I'll let you have enough of it.

199
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,430
Yes!

200
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,980
Let me out!

201
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,770
Let me out!

202
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,650
 Tantai Jin. 

203
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,180
 Tantai Jin! 

204
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,120
You're awake!

205
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,180
Don't sleep here. You'll catch a cold.

206
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,200
I know what I'm doing.

207
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,830
What are you doing?

208
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,020
Once you start reading memorials, you never take a break.

209
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,480
Even if you want to become a good king who works hard for the people,

210
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,230
you cannot harm your own body.

211
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

212
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,030
I won't run away all of a sudden.

213
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,410
Ye Xiwu,

214
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,620
what do you really want to do by coming to my side?

215
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Yes,

216
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,540
I should have left.

217
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,860
Ye Xiwu!

218
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,660
Ye Xiwu!

219
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,630
Ye Xiwu!

220
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,720
Ye Xiwu!

221
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,060
Ye Xiwu!

222
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,710
 Xiao Lin, why did you die? 

223
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,080
 Why didn't you come and save me? 

224
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,980
 The one I wanted to kill was Tantai Jin! 

225
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,030
 Now you are dead. 

226
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,660
 What is the use of your dying wish? 

227
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,700
 Tantai Jin still wants to kill me. 

228
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,550
Pang Yizhi?

229
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,350
Ye Bingchang.

230
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,460
Why are you here?

231
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,510
Are you here to save me?

232
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,690
You deserve your punishment,

233
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,190
so I won't save you.

234
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,240
However, Xiao Lin left something with me

235
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,370
before his death

236
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,520
and asked me to find an opportunity to give it to you.

237
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,560
It's a letter from him.

238
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,210
Wife…

239
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,740
He still acknowledged me as his wife.

240
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,740
But it's a little late.

241
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,260
Xiao Lin was upright and loyal,

242
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,700
but how did you treat him?

243
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,570
Upright

244
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,650
and loyal…

245
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,140
What does that have to do with me?

246
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,210
That's all I can say.

247
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,560
   

248
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,960
 Bingchang, things have come to this point. 

249
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,170
 I no longer care about the letter you wrote asking me to save you 

250
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,740
 or whether you ever plotted against me. 

251
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,890
 We are a married couple, 

252
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,890
 and there are some things I still want you to know. 

253
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,210
 It is said that the closest people can sometimes be the least close. 

254
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,520
 In the past, I was constantly distressed, 

255
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,710
 feeling that no matter how hard I tried, 

256
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,190
 I could not win your complete trust. 

257
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,400
 It was not until the day I learned about the Love Threads incident 

258
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,420
 that I finally understood 

259
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,210
 why you always seemed so uneasy. 

260
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,200
 You were worried that the love you received was all false, weren't you? 

261
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,260
 Bingchang, actually, 

262
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,650
 whether you had that strand of Love Threads or not, 

263
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,930
 there would still be people who loved you. 

264
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,270
 Perhaps you don't remember this: 

265
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,370
 In the late spring of that year, 

266
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,390
 you and the women of the Ye family went outside the city to worship ancestors, 

267
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,740
 and you got off the carriage alone to take a walk. 

268
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,060
 I still remember how happy you were 

269
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,170
 because of a cluster of blackberry roses... 

270
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,660
 and how beautiful your smile was. 

271
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,060
 Blackberry roses do not compete with other flowers during springtime 

272
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,190
 and bloom the latest in loneliness. 

273
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,560
 I will remember your look... 

274
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,740
 with flowers in your hair and your smile in spring for the rest of my life. 

275
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,680
 Later on, when you distributed porridge to the people in the city, 

276
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,080
 I secretly went to watch as well. 

277
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,690
 I liked you not because of that strand of Love Threads, 

278
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,150
 but because of who you are. 

279
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,120
 Unfortunately, I never got the chance to tell you these things, 

280
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,910
 and our fate has come to an end. 

281
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,210
 Bingchang, I hope that your wishes may come true. 

282
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,680
♫  Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave  ♫

♫  I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish  ♫

287
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,510
 I always thought that 

288
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,850
 it was the love threads that made me receive favoritism. 

289
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,800
 As it turns out, 

290
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,070
 I'm the one who's been wrong this entire time. 

291
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,110
 I'm sorry. 

292
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,510
 It's my fault. 

293

299
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,080
Aren't you going to see her for one last time?

300
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,540
No need.

301
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,210
Leader Nian,

302
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,210
thank you for previously taking care

303
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,700
of the burial of my father and elder brother.

304
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,340
Your father and elder brother sacrificed to protect the people.

305
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,580
Chief Pianran did the same.

306
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,770
Their acts of righteousness are truly admirable.

307
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,650
How is His Majesty?

308
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,880
He went to the royal tomb early this morning,

309
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,050
and he promised to bury Xiwu with the ceremony of a queen in a few days.

310
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,160
In a few days?

311
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,670
What's wrong?

312
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,370
Nothing.

313
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,720
I hope he doesn't go back on his words.

314
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,420
The courtiers were initially worried

315
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,290
that His Majesty would abandon the country for one person,

316
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,410
but now they are all relieved.

317
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,560
♫  After all, I cannot ask for love, no matter how much  ♫

318
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,160
 Tides are outlined by the waxes and wanes of the moon  ♫

319
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
General Ye, to be honest,

320
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,150
I wish His Majesty weren't the king anymore,

321
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,110
so that he could leave this sad place.

322
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,740
Sad place?

323
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,290
Yes.

324
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,640
His queen died here.

325
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,500
When he sees her,

326
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,680
how can he be happy again?

327
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,320

 Hurry! 

380
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,060
Sir, we have searched through the ruins, but found nothing.

381
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,720
His Majesty must have had a plan and left the letter in the study in advance.

382
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,790
A country cannot be without a ruler for even a day.

383
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,500
His Majesty entrusted in the letter,

384
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,330
instructing you to find a capable member

385
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,020
from a branch of the Tantai family

386
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,860
to inherit the throne.

387
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,700
For the stability of the kingdom,

388
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,580
you must complete His Majesty's request.

389
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,930
Yes.

390
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,590
Too many people have died.

391
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,630
I can't believe it has been ten thousand years already.

392
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,370
I never thought that you and I

393
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,800
would have a chance to meet again.

394
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,700
Siying?

395
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,360
That's right.

396
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,050
We both lived.

397
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,510
But we never got to meet His Lordship.

398
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,070
Don't be sad. It has been ten thousand years.

399
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,300
It's time...

400
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,940
to welcome the new Devil Lord.

401
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,430
True.

402
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,800
As long as the evil bone remains,

403
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,900
His Lordship will never disappear.

404
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,310
Now that the Barren Abyss Barrier is unsealed,

405
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,880
from today onwards,

406
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,770
even if I have to travel across the Four Continents and Three Realms,

407
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,330
I will find a trail of the new Devil Lord.

408
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,530
But with such boundless crowds,

409
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,350
where should I start my search?

410
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,460
The bank of Ruo River.

411
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,950
I heard the bank of the Ruo River

412
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,900
is where the spirits of the dead gather.

413
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,320
But His Lordship is a devil god.

414
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,690
Would his spirit be there?

415
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,820
His Lordship certainly would not mingle with the ordinary.

416
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,970
However, I heard that back then,

417
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,520
His Lordship made a special agreement

418
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,000
with the Yiyue tribe at the bank of the Ruo River.

419
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Why don't we start our search from there?

420
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,560
Good idea.

421
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,080
Now that we have been revived,

422
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,390
it's time for us to reunite and restore

423
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,980
the Devil Realm for His Lordship.

424
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,550
It's been ten thousand years. Do you still recognize us?

425
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,560
I am the Demon of Drought, Siying.

426
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,140
Today, under the command of the Devil Lord, I order you

427
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,690
to find the Devil Lord and restore Barren Abyss.

428
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,650
Those who refuse to obey shall be killed!

429
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,860
 Devil Lord! 

430
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,870
 Devil Lord! 

431
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,000
 Devil Lord! 

432
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,420
 Devil Lord! 

433
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,520
 Devil Lord! 

434
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,950
 The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe, is also the Nether River. 

435
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,530
 When the moon turns into an underworld moon, 

436
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,250
 the Yiyue tribe can use their secret spells to open the Gate of Underworld Moon 

437
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,880
 and enter the place where souls gather. 

438
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,960
 Your Majesty! 

439
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,990
 Your Majesty! 

440
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,010
 Your Majesty! 

441
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,540
 Ye Xiwu. 

442
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,590
 Go away! 

443
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,430
 Your Majesty! You can't stay here. 

444
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,340
 Let go! 

445
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,300
 Your Majesty, I know that rescuing you is against your will. 

446
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,060
 However, I know of a way for you to see Ye Xiwu again. 

447
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,760
 Ye Xiwu is right here. 

448
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,670
 I'm not going anywhere. Go away! 

449
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,480
 - Your Majesty!  
  - Nian Baiyu! 

450
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,700
 The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe, is also the Nether River. 

451
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,510
 I can tell you where to find Ye Xiwu's soul. 

452
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,630
 What did you say? 

453
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,130
 But, Lord, are you sure you want to go in? 

454
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,860
 The Gate of Underworld Moon has been opened a few times, 

455
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,940
 but the people who entered never came back. 

456
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,220
Brother, will you come back?

457
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,420
Lord, there is no end or way out in there.

458
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,530
How will you come back?

459
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,650
Nian Baiyu, thank you for your helping me this whole time.

460
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,530
 Ye Xiwu, 

461
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,100
 where are you? 

462
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,460
 Ye Xiwu, 

463
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
 where are you? 

464
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,670
Lord…

465
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,950
Here, freshly boiled milk tea.

466
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,870
Thanks, Sister.

467
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,180
Baiyu, stop feeling sad.

468
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,230
Every man has his destiny. You have done everything you can.

469
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,020
Sister. Mom.

470
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,110
Do you think the Lord can find who he wants to meet?

471
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,140
This type of thing is up to how sincere one's heart is.

472
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,680
Who knows? There are thousands of souls in there.

473
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Even if he can resist the erosion of the Ruo Water,

474
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,350
how long will it take for him to recognize each soul one by one?

475
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,980
 Ye Xiwu, where are you? 

476
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,390
 Look. It's him again. He has been here for several months. 

477
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,980
 Who is he looking for? 

478
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,000
 I don't know. 

479
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,390
 Let's ask him. Who are you looking for? 

480
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,850
 Ye Xiwu. I'm looking for her. 

481
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,260
 Can you help me find Ye Xiwu? 

482
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,780
 Ye Xiwu? Is the one you are looking for called Ye Xiwu? 

483
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,880
 Yes. Ye Xiwu. 

484
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
 There are so many souls here, and we don't know them all. 

485
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,800
 But perhaps the one you're looking for is in the depths of the Nether River. 

486
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,160
 However… 

487
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,140
Ye Xiwu, where is she?

488
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,140
 Tantai Jin, you are here. 

489
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,380
 Ye Xiwu! 

490
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,480
 Tantai Jin, long time no see. 

491
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,720
Ye Xiwu, you are really here!

492
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,180
 You finally came. 

493
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,280
It's really you!

494
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,900
Ye Xiwu!

495
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,840
Where did you go? No!

496
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,830
Ye Xiwu!

497
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,700
Ye Xiwu!

498
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,140
Ye Xiwu!

499
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,830
Ye Xiwu!

500
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,530
Mortal bodies will be tempted by the Ruo Water and see illusions,

501
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,970
and in the end, they will be devoured.

502
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,520
Ye Xiwu, you must be in the Nether River.

503
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,310
I will find you!

504
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,340
Instead of letting you perish, let us take you to find her.

505
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,610
Get on the boat. You won't be hurt as long as you don't touch the water.

506
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,200
♫  Every pair of stars from the east and the west  ♫

507
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,760
♫  were lonely souls in the beginning  ♫

508
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,860
♫  Tossing and turning, falling hard for you. I was entangled by the thread of love  ♫

509
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,460
♫  Karma is too deep to fathom  ♫

510
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,900
♫  turning a deaf ear to gathering and dispersing  ♫

511
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,860
 Ye Xiwu, you died because of me. 

512
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,760
 No matter what price I have to pay, I will take you home. 

513
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,730
♫  ...who loves the world that you cherish  ♫

514
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,540
♫  Don't ask about the rights and wrongs  ♫

515
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,830
♫  You'll only imprison your heart  ♫

516
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,120
Ye Xiwu!

517
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,060
♫  Ridicule a fool deeply in love  ♫

518
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:11,100
♫  I searched all over for the remnants of your soul by myself  ♫

519
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,440
Ye Xiwu!

520
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,600
Oh no, he seems to be seeing illusions again.

521
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,060
♫  The engraving on my heart is the pain from loving you  ♫

522
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,300
♫  Wholeheartedly, also  ♫

523
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,740
♫  For you, I subverted my shape and soul  ♫

524
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,180
♫  Falling snow left no trace, I am mottled and reborn  ♫

525
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,720
♫  My body was broken to pieces at the moment of falling flowers  ♫

526
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,560
♫  My dreams wouldn't leave me alone  ♫

527
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,700
♫  Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, evil, desire, and hatred  ♫

528
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,080
Is it worth it to do all this for a deceased person?

529
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,980
 Yes. 

530
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,070
♫  Being sober is too cruel  ♫

531
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,620
 I will... 

532
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,140
 keep looking, 

533
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
 and keep doing this, 

534
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,760
 until my life is over. 

535
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,000
♫  You alone animated the whole mortal world  ♫

536
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,500
Baiyu,

537
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,820
where did you go?

538
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,320
Mom,

539
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,140
I just went to the bank of the Ruo River to check if Lord was back or not.

540
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,800
You know very well that

541
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,980
the Gate of Underworld Moon only opens once every 500 years.

542
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,120
Your lord entered it

543
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,980
and there's no way he will come back.

544
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,520
Baiyu, since you are already back here, just let go of the past,

545
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,700
and live your life well.

546
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,640
Yes, Baiyu.

547
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,000
The girl I talked to you about last time,

548
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,500
do you really not want to meet her?

549
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,360
Maybe I should really forget about His Lordship.

550
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,040
Yes, live your own life.

551
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,680
Mom and Sister, go home. I will go and check it out.

552
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,180
 - Run!  
 - Be careful!

553
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,360
 Hurry up! 

554
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,960
It's not fun to kill him.

555
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,080
Why don't we just keep him alive,

556
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,420
in case he might come in handy in the future?

557
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,140
Let's go.

558
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,040
Let's look for the demonic fetus.

559
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,340
I don't know how long it will take

560
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,480
to look through them one by one.

561
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,280
 Lord, 

562
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,420
 I won't be able to wait for your return. 

563
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,180
 I found two dandelions in your precious Royal Garden. 

564
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,180
 Surprisingly, they have not been removed by the gardeners. 

565
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,140
 They are really fortunate. 

566
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,860
 I heard that you could make wishes on dandelions, 

567
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,120
 so I dug them up. 

568
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,040
 My hands… 

569
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,480
 Why? 

570
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,380
 Now I'm taking your evil bone... 

571
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,100
 and paying you back with the divine essence. 

572
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,780
 You won't become the Devil Lord anymore. 

573
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,900
Ye Xiwu,

574
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,740
is the divine essence you gave me healing me?

575
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,440
 You let me live, 

576
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,820
but also made me suffer...

577
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,100
the pain of shredding me in pieces again and again.

578
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,060
Is this your revenge on me?

579
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,280
 It doesn't matter. 

580
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,000
 As long as it's from you, 

581
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,680
 I will accept it. 

582
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,140
 Why are you still not giving up? 

583
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,960
 No… 

584
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,020
 She is still somewhere in here. 

585
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,460
 I will definitely find her. 

586
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,820
 Who is he? 

587
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,160
 A pitiful person. 

588
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,260
 In order to find his deceased lover, 

589
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,320
 he has been searching in the Nether River for a hundred years, 

590
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,200
 but still hasn't found her. 

591
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,280
 World-Alluring Jade… 

592
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,400
 Can it help me find Ye Xiwu's soul? 

593
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,580
 She bore the curse of a violent death for me. 

594
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,420
 Please give me a chance to repay her. 

595
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,320
 Ye Xiwu, when can I find you? 

596
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,720
   

597
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,620
Today, I will tell you a secret story.

598
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,020
It is said that five hundred years ago,

599
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,740
the king was named Tantai Jin.

600
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,040
Legend has it that he was born by killing his mother,

601
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,460
which was extremely ominous,

602
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,560
but he unified Jing and Sheng and achieved greatness.

603
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,040
Nobody knows that he once burned down the Palace of Jing

604
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,500
for a woman,

605
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,540
and was burned so badly that his face was destroyed.

606
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,320
To commemorate him,

607
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,540
the Tantai family's generations of kings

608
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,160
have all worn masks

609
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,640
-  Tantai Jin…  
 - to cover their faces.

610
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,300
There is another secret story

611
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,240
that said the Devil Lord would appear in the world again

612
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,220
in 500 years, which is now.

613
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,960
There are too many rumors about the world ending.

614
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,160
Someone also said that Devil Lord would end the world last year, but what happened?

615
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,700
Nothing.

616
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,220
 The healing power of divine essence is getting weaker and weaker. 

617
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,680
 I'm afraid my body has reached its limit. 

618
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,560
 Ye Xiwu, 

619
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,220
 even if I were to die today, 

620
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,840
 I will still search for you for another day. 

621
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,620
 After I die, 

622
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,660
 my soul can merge with this Nether Water, 

623
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,040
 and I will continue to seek you. 

624
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,940
 Are you still not giving up? 

625
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,900
 Sir, why are you still not giving up? 

626
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,600
 Don't waste your breath with him. 

627
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,980
 After being washed by the Ruo Water for 500 years, 

628
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,280
 he can no longer hear anything. 

629
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,180
 Tantai Jin. 

630
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,800
  Tantai Jin, go back with me. 

631
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,420
 Don't you get too carried away. 

632
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,640
 I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you. 

633
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,140
 Ye Xiwu, I'm coming for you. 

634
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,920

650
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,980
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

651
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,800
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

652
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,060
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

653
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,060
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

654
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,380
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

655
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,340
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

656
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,220
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

657
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:05,160
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

658
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:12,960
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

659
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:22,000
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
