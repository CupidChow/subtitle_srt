3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,500
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,360
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:39,020
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:47,200
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,920
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,260
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,140
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,540
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,060
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,140
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:31,240
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,120
   

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,150
Lin'er, this time, you checked the national treasury and warned the local tycoons.

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,070
Well done. You didn't let me down.

18
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,070
But I still let Tantai Jin get away.

19
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,130
Since you're already back, I'll have Ye Xiao released.

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,810
Thanks for your generosity, Imperial Father.

21
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,670
The Ye family lost Tantai Jin, but whoever the new King of the Jing Kingdom is,

22
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,820
with the Ye's reputation in the army, they can still be useful to me.

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,910
Father,

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,160
His Majesty has given orders to let me return to Jia Pass immediately.

25
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,400
We couldn't find Tantai Jin, but His Majesty still let me go.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,780
Qingyu, this is not as simple as it seems.

27
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,220
I understand. The rabbit hasn't been caught.

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,750
How can you kill the hound first?

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,470
Let's not talk about this. Where's your grandma?

30
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,500
I didn't dare tell her what happened to you.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,930
I just said you went out on a business trip.

32
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,270
You did right. Let's go home.

33
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,620
Lords, please hold on.

34
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,500
I ran into a young lady in the north.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,900
She asked me to give this family letter to the Ye family in the capital.

36
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,920
   

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,910
Thanks a lot!

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,220
That's my Xiwu. I told you!

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,110
She'll definitely be safe.

40
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,480
It is great that Miss is fine.

41
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,010
God bless.

42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,890
Thank goodness, our little one is fine.

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,110
 I've only read in the Geography of Four Continents about the rough direction of theBarren Abyss. 

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,980
 But I don't know where the entrance is. 

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,670
 When can I finally get there? 

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,350
 Why do I feel familiar with this smell? 

47
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,160
Vixen!

48
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,750
What a small world, huh?

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,400
You're a powerful demon with seven tails.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,290
How come you look so weak now?

51
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,050
This is all thanks to you!

52
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,730
Tantai Jin's blood is truly harmful.

53
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,470
My vitality was badly damaged. I haven't been able to recover for days.

54
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,270
It's your own fault anyway. You tried to get my second younger brother's spirit.

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,610
 After all, this is a crime committed by Young Devil Lord. 

56
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:27,180
 If World-alluring Jade can undo my spell, it should be able to cure her, too. 

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,200
All right, I'll treat your injury.

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,120
Your magic is pretty good.

59
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
Thanks.

60
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,380
I've never suffered like this since I got out of Barren Abyss.

61
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,260
Did you come from Barren Abyss?

62
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,140
What's the fuss about?

63
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,810
My parents are both mighty demons who followed the demon god.

64
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,870
Naturally, I was born in the abyss.

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,750
But hasn't the abyss been sealed? How did you get out?

66
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,860
I remember when I was little, the barrier of Barren Abyss was indeed something impenetrable.

67
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:40,080
But the power of the guardian has faded after being there for ten thousand years.

68
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,510
Many demons seized the chance to get out.

69
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,310
I've always longed for the outside world.

70
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,660
So I took my chance and escaped.

71
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,220
Who's the guardian of Barren Abyss?

72
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,960
I haven't seen him.

73
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,290
He seems to be called Jize.

74
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,620
 Jize, the God of Cosmos, who rules the time. 

75
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,230
 The Mirror of the Past was transformed from Jize's divine eye. 

76
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,730
 His power can travel through time. 

77
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,820
 If we use this array to return to the past and kill Tantai Jin before he became the devil, 

78
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,510
 we'll be able to stop the destined arrival of the Devil Lord. 

79
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,080
 All gods should have long fallen in the battle of gods and devils. 

80
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,510
 He's actually in Barren Abyss. 

81
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,650
 No wonder the female devil told me I could find the answer there. 

82
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,940
Why are you so excited?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,140
Do you know where Barren Abyss is?

84
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,170
Why should I tell you?

85
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,380
Why are you like this? I just helped you.

86
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,730
Aren't demons said to be the most grateful?

87
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,920
I won't need you to devote your life to me.

88
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,560
If you just help lead the way, we'll be even. Sound fair?

89
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,330
All right then. I'll be kind for once to lead the way for you.

90
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,580
Thanks, little vixen. Let's go.

91
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,220
Who are you calling a little vixen?

92
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,260
Sister Fox.

93
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,860
Good girl.

94
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,550
That way.

95
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,380
 Tantai Jin, you must stay alive. 

96
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,390
 Wait for me to come back. 

97
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,880
 Tantai Jin, 

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,230
 you're so useless! 

99
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,590
 No need to agitate me. 

100
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,010
 Something is odd. Am I dead? 

101
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,920
 Where's Ye Xiwu? 

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,910
 You're not dead. 

103
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,510
 You were just abandoned once again. 

104
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,570
What exactly do you mean? Where on earth is Ye Xiwu?

105
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,970
 You're pathetic. She already abandoned you. 

106
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,930
 You're still thinking about her. 

107
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:03,320
 Tantai Jin, how does it feel to be abandoned over and over again? 

108
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,470
 Who did this to you? 

109
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,820
 Don't you want to revenge yourself on them? 

110
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,340
 Your enemies are all over the Jing palace. 

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,800
 You were abandoned and hurt, but they are unharmed and live in luxury. 

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,090
They do deserve to die. But there's nothing I can do.

113
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,710
 Nothing you can do? 

114
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,260
 You were just accepting everything passively from the beginning to the end. 

115
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,620
 Over the last twenty years, have you ever asked yourself what your inner desires are? 

116
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,580
 Inner desires? 

117
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:46,370
 Your sufferings in life and humiliation by others were just helping you to walk toward your destiny. 

118
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,390
 Why can't you be the Emperor of Jing Kingdom? 

119
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,000
 Why can't it be you to tread on them? 

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,980
 Haven't you ever thought that the throne of Jing belongs to you? 

121
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,100
 Fate has never wanted you to live in this shabby house. 

122
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,200
 It will not leave you alone in the darkness. 

123
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,370
 Can't you see where your fate should belong? 

124
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,620
 Rather than live on in degradation, why not put up a fight? 

125
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,190
 All your enemies who should've been skinned by you and that highest throne… 

126
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,180
 Think about it. 

127
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,420
 What is it that you should do and that you deserve to own? 

128
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,810
What's wrong with your eye?

129
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,210
Nothing. Just a little dust.

130
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,270
Hey, Little Fox.

131
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,590
I told you several times, call me sister.

132
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Sister Fox, we've been out for days.

133
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,020
If we keep hanging around like this, when can we get to Barren Abyss?

134
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,260
What's the hurry?

135
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm badly injured. I need to rest.

136
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,810
When you were flirting with someone just now, your complexion looked great.

137
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,080
For the sake of our friendship, here's a piece of advice.

138
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,990
You'd better not absorb mortals' vitality to improve your cultivation.

139
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,460
When you become a demonic cultivator, you'll eventually be struck dead by lightning.

140
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,650
I didn't do that for my cultivation.

141
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,330
I simply thought those men were funny. They can't take a little flirting.

142
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,810
Funny?

143
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,670
Is that how you think of my second younger brother?

144
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,750
But I think he's serious about you.

145
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,650
Playing with people's emotions seems fun, but what if they take it seriously or you take it seriously?

146
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,290
Love is something that often goes out of control.

147
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,500
Little girl, do you know what love threads are?

148
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,690
All intelligent beings have love threads.

149
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,390
Only with love threads can you love someone.

150
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,170
But my love threads are lost.

151
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,600
Without them, I can no longer love anyone.

152
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,390
How did you lose your love threads?

153
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,770
Why would I tell you?

154
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,850
How long exactly can we get to Barren Abyss?

155
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,320
Going in or getting out of the abyss isn't easy.

156
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,370
I used to be a nine-tailed fox spirit. I cut off two tails to get out.

157
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,680
I had to abandon thousands of years of cultivation.

158
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,200
It's so difficult, even for a demon. Much less a mere mortal like you.

159
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,210
Even if you get there, you'll die in vain.

160
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,910
Why must you go there?

161
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,220
I'll go even if it might kill me.

162
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,710
Maybe only in there can I find the way to save them.

163
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,650
Who are you saving?

164
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,510
A lot of people.

165
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,860
Quite a lot of people.

166
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,100
You won't necessarily save them even if you make it there.

167
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,190
You could probably lose your life for nothing.

168
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,940
Do think twice.

169
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,970
If I could save them all, my life would mean nothing.

170
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,670
Either by your help or any other way, I must get there.

171
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,620
Fine.

172
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,640
I wanted to stop you because you saved my life, but since you're so stubborn,

173
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,370
let's hit the road when the day breaks.

174
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,180
   

175
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,240
   

176
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,910
Queen Mother,

177
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,440
you gave up your life for Imperial Father.

178
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,990
But I won't do the same.

179
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,900
Those who laughed at me and insulted me, I've killed every last one of them.

180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,430
Queen Mother, you should be happy for me. 
    

181
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,530
Your son has become the Emperor of Great Jing!

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,730
No one in this kingdom can hurt me anymore.

183
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,830
Everybody respects and fears me.

184
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,650
Guards!

185
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,410
 All you big rats, don't eat my millet. 

186
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,490
 Go drink the king's blood and eat the king's flesh. 

187
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,420
 All you big rats, don't eat my millet. 

188
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,340
 Go drink the king's blood and eat the king's flesh. 

189
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,540
 All you big rats, don't eat my millet. 

190
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,740
 Go drink the king's blood and eat the king's flesh. 

191
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,750
 All you big rats, don't eat my millet. 

192
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,880
 Go drink the king's blood and eat the king's flesh. 

193
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,150
What nonsense are you singing about? Where did you learn that?

194
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,330
Go home!

195
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,880
 This is the payback for tyranny.  
    

196
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,350
 A cruel monarch has lost his territory. 

197
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,700
 His lack of virtue has angered the gods. 

198
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,650
 Hence the punishment. 

199
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,910
It's you!

200
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,680
These are your demonic hexes!

201
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,400
It's me. I told you, from that day on,

202
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,620
you'll never have a day of peace.

203
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,320
 But a king's consequences of misconduct are often suffered by his people. 

204
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,540
 Alas, how sad! 

205
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,440
 Sir, is there a way to end this heavenly punishment? 

206
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,060
Tantai Jin!

207
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,040
I will haunt you even when I'm dead!

208
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,810
Some day, I'll crush you and that female demon into dust!

209
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,470
Tantai Minglang, your soul dissipates with your body when you die.

210
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,140
Just rest in peace.

211
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,870
This divination represents a hidden dragon.

212
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,850
The kingdom will be saved from the crisis if the new king ascends the throne.

213
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,070
   

214
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,950
 But the Tantais have no male descendants. 

215
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,280
 Who else can ascend the throne? 

216
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,740
 Fate doesn't lie. 

217
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,070
 Maybe in a few days, that chosen one will appear. 

218
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,890
 So is this our new king? 

219
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,330
 Have you heard? This morning, thousands of snakes and rats went out of the city gates 

220
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,340
 without hurting anyone. Does he really have some magic power? 

221
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,990
 Don't you know it yet? Everybody's talking about it! 

222
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,070
 This new king is the late king's youngest and favorite son. 

223
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,500
 He's also the son of the Princess of the Yiyue tribe. 

224
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,910
 It's just that he's been a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom, exchanging peace for us with his very life! 

225
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,200
 What great contributions to the country! 

226
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,250
 The chosen one. 

227
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,550
 The new king inherits the throne. 

228
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,960
 Please enter the sacred hall and listen to the sacred order from Heaven. 

229
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,750
 The ancestors in this ancient relic have once again blessed us 

230
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,980
 by sending us a saint from above. He shall end tyranny and relieve disasters. 

231
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,490
 Now the tyrant is dead. The new king shall rule. 

232
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,540
 May this wise king benefit us on and on! 

233
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,350
 May this diligent king shine on and on! 

234
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,180
 Jing Kingdom, I have returned after all. 

235
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,590
You killed your mother the moment you were born.

236
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,090
You left the capital at six years old. Now you're back for no reason at all.

237
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,990
You don't deserve to be our king!

238
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,520
 You don't deserve it! 

239
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,610
You're the son of a demonic Yiyue woman who could control demonic creatures.

240
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,250
Now you're back to the Jing Kingdom.

241
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,820
- You must have an evil plan! 
  - That's right! 

242
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,150
 Evil plan! 

243
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,850
If we surrender to you, how will the history books describe us?

244
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,190
 - Yeah! 
 - Exactly! 

245
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,570
How will the history books write about us? Answer us!

246
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,750
Have you said enough?

247
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
Kill us if you want!

248
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,760
Even if we die here today, we won't take you as our new king!

249
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,690
 - Yeah! 
 - That's right! You're not our new king! 

250
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,730
 - Kill us! 
 - Yeah! 

251
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,790
Come on! Just kill us!

252
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,350
 - Kill me! 
 - Come kill us! Come on, kill us! 

253
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,890
Ministers, please calm down.

254
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,350
What should I kill you for?

255
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,110
Serve it.

256
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,730
Could it be some demonic creature?

257
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,000
This is…

258
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,730
Soup?

259
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,490
Are we having meals?

260
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,300
After talking for quite a while, you must be hungry.

261
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,220
I specially prepared meals for you.

262
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,420
Let's talk while dining.

263
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,510
- Guards. Treat them properly for me. 
 - Yes.

264
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,480
Is this even the time to have soup?

265
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,020
All of you are so loyal to the late king.

266
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,180
I'm so touched.

267
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,120
Certainly, I should treat you to the best cuisine.

268
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,590
Make sure you drink it all in one gulp, so as not to let my admiration for you go in vain.

269
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
Why are you not eating?

270
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
Does my food not suit your taste?

271
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,270
I have to admit that the meat soup from Yiyue Tribe tastes great!

272
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,100
This…

273
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,740
This soup could be poisonous!

274
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,340
- Poisonous! 
 - You!

275
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,880
You're so wicked!

276
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,600
What now?

277
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,730
Spit it out!

278
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,340
I'm not into the idea of poisoning.

279
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,870
Your old king is already dead.

280
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,560
You're all patriotic ministers.

281
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,050
I returned as the new king timely to save the people of the Jing Kingdom from disasters.

282
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,070
Shouldn't you all be delighted about it?

283
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,760
Guards, another bowl for those who haven't had enough.

284
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,330
Whoever is willing to share this soup with me, I will treat you well.

285
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,500
I won't force you to stay if you still don't change your mind.

286
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,880
I'll grant your wish to be the tomb keepers of the late king until you think you've missed him enough.

287
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,930
 What should we do? 

288
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,820
 Forget it. 

289
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,000
He's the only Tantai left.

290
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,610
The kingdom cannot live without a king.

291
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,290
Everyone,

292
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,310
are you satisfied with my hospitality today?

293
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm satisfied.

294
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,860
I'm willing to eat together with Your Majesty.

295
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,650
 - I'm satisfied. 
 

296
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,580
- Thanks, Your Majesty! 
 - Thanks, Your Majesty!

297
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,270
Escort my ministers back to rest.

298
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,420
Yes.

299
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,550
 Thanks, Your Majesty! 

300
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,420
 Let's go, come on. 

301
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,520
Tantai Minglang is dead.

302
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,770
The new king of Jing is Tantai Jin?

303
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,680
Tantai Jin has been a hostage here for years.

304
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,250
A helpless prince like him inherited the throne just days after returning?

305
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,440
What a big joke!

306
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,990
This shows the end of the Jing Kingdom is near.

307
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,000
Now he hasn't established his authority.

308
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,430
This is our perfect chance to attack Jing.

309
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,060
War wastes of manpower and resources.

310
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,500
Yeah.

311
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,790
There's a flood in the south. People are starving.

312
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,180
We haven't had disaster relief food yet.

313
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,850
Our national treasury is empty.

314
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,290
Father, I think we'd better not go to war.

315
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,800
We just fought for three months in Jia Pass. Now our soldiers are tired. Our provisions are running low.

316
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,590
Conserving our strength is better than rushing to war.

317
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,790
Also, if he can seize the throne as a hostage prince,

318
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,220
he's probably capable of more. We can't underestimate Tantai Jin.

319
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,690
Yes, Sixth Prince's words make sense.

320
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,940
Back then, when General Ye crushed Jing Kingdom, we took Tantai Jin as our hostage.

321
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,870
So that Jing bowed its head to us.

322
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,510
Now Jing made him their king, isn't it god's will for us to defeat them again?

323
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,750
Only if I cut off Tantai Jin's head, will I not fail god's good plan.

324
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,860
Imperial Father, please think again.

325
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,940
What? Do you doubt my judgment?

326
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,810
Then, why don't you replace me now and sit upon my throne?

327
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,450
I dare not.

328
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,070
No more discussion.

329
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,170
I've decided.

330
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,640
Pass down my order:

331
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,890
Send troops to Jing Kingdom!

332
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

333
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,080
Your Majesty, Tantai Minglang's remnants are still out there. 
    

334
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,420
Now, the Sheng Kingdom is invading our borders.

335
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,930
They're trying to destroy us while you have less control over the country.

336
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,920
Yes.

337
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,140
Your Majesty just came to power, your ministers still have concerns and your people still have doubts.

338
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,380
This is when we're the weakest.

339
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,770
That's right.

340
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,120
The Sheng Kingdom is known for its strong troops and battle-wise generals.

341
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,760
We can hardly have the upper hand against them.

342
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,490
Why don't we retreat first to a natural barrier that's easy to defend?

343
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,020
This is the best strategy.

344
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,000
Minister Zhang's right!

345
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,970
He's absolutely right!

346
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,290
 Jing Kingdom is my homeland. 

347
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,240
 It's also where my mother's tribe lives. 

348
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,250
 This throne decides my fate. 

349
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,190
 As long as Jing Kingdom thrives under my rule, 

350
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,420
 it is no doubt that my power will be unparalleled. 

351
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,020
 And I can say goodbye to the fate of being slavishly dependent on others for good. 

352
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,600
I understand.

353
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,830
Your Majesty, then where should we retreat to?

354
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,870
Now our kingdom is so weak.

355
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,190
How much territory can we defend?

356
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,800
Yeah.

357
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,500
If it wer the late king, we'd be retreating to guard only the capital.

358
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,740
Retreating isn't a good strategy.

359
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,870
Now, Emperor Sheng wants to start this war.

360
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,720
Let's fight him with everything we got.

361
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,750
I will personally go lead on the borders.

362
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,240
This is not for defending our land, nor for taking cities southward.

363
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,190
What I want is to take him by surprise and defeat him with one blow.

364
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,900
- Please reconsider! 
 - Please reconsider!

365
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,620
We've arrived.

366
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,410
Further ahead is the barrier of Barren Abyss.

367
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,760
I don't want to get near it.

368
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,120
Thanks for walking me here.

369
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,420
All right, I've done what I promised you.

370
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,080
It's up to you whether you can get in.

371
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,850
We'll go our separate ways from here.

372
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,190
Sister Fox, thank you.

373
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,390
You can thank me after you get out of there alive.

374
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,670
 I finally made it here. 

375
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:57,090
 Li Susu, if you see the God of Cosmos, you may be able to save the Four Continents and Three Realms. 

376
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,860
 Report! 

377
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,410
Your Majesty, as for what you've ordered previously, the scouts have returned.

378
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,790
What have they found?

379
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,220
They haven't found the girl you described along the road.

380
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,600
But farther south is the territory of the Sheng Kingdom.

381
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,960
Keep searching.

382
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,830
She must be found, dead or alive.

383
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,970
How are we doing on the frontline?

384
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,470
Ye Xiao is quite valiant. Their morale is high.

385
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,450
We have been defeated.

386
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,030
Call all generals here for a meeting.

387
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,480
Yes.

388
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,270
 Ye Xiao's elite soldiers are brave and skillful in battle. 

389
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,440
 If I form a Firewing Army consisting of demon creatures, I may be able to fight against heavy odds 

390
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,150
 and reduce casualties at the same time. 

391
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,420
 Ye Xiwu, you'd better not die. 

392
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,980
 Wait for me to catch and bring you back. 

393
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,240
 This is the Barren Abyss Barrier. 

394
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,870
 With my mortal body now, I'm afraid I can't take the barrier's power. 

395
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,580
 Oh, right! 

396
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,490
 Maybe I can try to control Chongyu with the power of the World-alluring Jade. 

397
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,280
Chongyu.

398
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,900
I can only take my chances.

399
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,670
 This feels exactly like in the time array. 

400
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,520
 Susu. 

401
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,370
 Susu. 

402
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,150
Who are you?

403
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,770
Come to me.

404
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,380
Why do you know my name?

405
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,900
 Why is there a child here? 

406
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,710
- Get away! 
 - She's mine!

407
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,540
 They're too close to the child. 

408
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,160
 Using a charm may hurt the child as well. 

409
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,520
Get away!

410
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,440
Another human!

411
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,360
We're so lucky today.

412
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,240
Come on, catch me if you can!

413
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,130
After her!

414
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,990
Go now!

415
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,770
After her!

416
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,770
 Li Susu. 

417
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,740
 This voice sounds like that immortal lord in the Mirror of the Past. 

418
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,990
Greetings, Senior.

419
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,400
Li Susu, we meet again.

420
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,950
Were you waiting for me to come?

421
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,780
I am Jize, the God of the Cosmos.

422
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,690
The Light-breaking Array and the Mirror of the Past were both left by me.

423
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,100
I stayed here and held on for ten thousand years...

424
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,430
just to wait for your arrival.

425
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,680
I've found that demon fetus.

426
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,540
But I still can't find a way to destroy the evil bone.

427
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,940
Please enlighten me.

428
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,270
I can tell you how.

429
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,310
To destroy the evil bone, you'll need three keys

430
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,220
to unlock the rules of karma, stop what is destined to happen, and change everything.

431
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,640
What keys?

432
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,380
A dream.

433
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,620
A teardrop.

434
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,430
And a thread.

435
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,540
What dream?

436
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,340
This dream should be coming soon.

437
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,830
The teardrop is the first drop of tears the Devil Lord will shed for love.

438
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,460
It's called Soul-slaying Teardrop.

439
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,860
And what does "a thread" refer to?

440
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,720
The thread is connected to the teardrop.

441
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,180
If Devil Lord's heart is open to you, the Soul-slaying teardrop will turn into nine spikes.

442
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,500
When you stab them into his heart, you'll be able to destroy the evil bone.

443
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,020
But I'm barehanded.

444
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,890
I can only try my best.

445
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,020
I know it's difficult, too.

446
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,100
Sorry for putting you through this.

447
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,180
The time has come.

448
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,490
I'm about to fall.

449
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,280
Senior!

450
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,500
After I fall, the Barren Abyss Barrier can still hold for 300 days.

451
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,040
Within 300 days, if you can't destroy the evil bone of the devil god,

452
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,590
the abyss will break and the demons will come out.

453
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,590
Everything will be irrecoverable.

454
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,760
I understand.

455
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,080
 I... 

456
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,440
 can finally join my comrades. 

457
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,310
The Mirror of the Past.

458
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,640
 The Mirror of the Past was transformed from Jize's divine eye. 

459
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,460
So he waited here just for this.

460
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,690
 A dream, a teardrop, and a thread. 

461
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,960
Luckily, protected by divine power, the foul energy didn't invade her deep.

462
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,810
Little girl. Little girl.

463
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,810
You're awake. Come.

464
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,630
 Could she be Jing Lan'an's daughter? 

465
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,810
Who… Who are you?

466
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,960
I'm Ye Xiwu.

467
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,810
Just now...

468
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,740
I ran into you down the cliff.

469
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,610
How are you feeling?

470
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,040
I remember I fell into a hole that's very, very deep.

471
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,030
How did I get out?

472
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,760
Do you still remember who brought you here?

473
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,230
It's a man with scars on his face.

474
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,630
He's quite mean.

475
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,050
 Come. 

476
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,520
 Scars on his face? 

477
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,790
 He should be Tantai Minglang. 

478
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,480
Come, let's go down the mountain first.

479
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,820
Little girl, what's your name?

480
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,510
My name is Yue Fuya.

481
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,070
I'll take you downhill first. Then we'll see what to do, all right?

482
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,490
Let's go.

483
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,460
Why is it suddenly so hot?

484
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,490
 I entered Barren Abyss in winter. 

485
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,800
 Why does the grass turn green so quickly? 

486
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,110
Hi, mister.

487
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,780
Could you tell me what month it is now?

488
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,340
What month?

489
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
It's already April, after Tomb Sweeping Day.

490
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,550
Miss, how come you forgot which month you're in?

491
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,950
My younger sister and I went into the mountain to pick herbs but were lost in the woods.

492
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,180
We spent quite some time there.

493
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,850
Miss, you'd better not pick any herbs.

494
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,710
Just go home as soon as possible. The world is in chaos now.

495
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,950
What happened?

496
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,330
Haven't you heard?

497
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,880
Since the new king ascended the throne, Sheng and Jing Kingdoms have been at war for three to four months.

498
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,410
The new Emperor of Jing?

499
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,490
Who is he?

500
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,230
I heard it's the youngest son of the old king.

501
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,640
The one back from Sheng Kingdom.

502
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,830
 Tantai Jin. 

503
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,980
 He fought on the battlefield personally by commanding demon creatures. 

504
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,860
 The Sheng Army suffered defeat one after another. 

505
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,250
 Their casualties are heavy. 

506
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,140
 - Welcome back, Your Majesty! 
 - Welcome back, Your Majesty! 

507
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,920
I heard General Ye fell off his horse and still hasn't woken up.

508
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,110
Now, General Ye's son is leading the army to defend the Jia Pass.

509
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,100
   

510
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,340
 Dad's condition is not clear. 

511
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,900
 Qingyu is also at risk. 

512
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,990
 Tantai Jin actually became the Emperor of Jing. 

513
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,700
Your Majesty, none of the scouts sent out recently have found the whereabouts of Second Young Miss Ye.

514
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,750
According to the Sheng prisoners, Second Young Miss Ye hasn't returned to the Sheng Kingdom.

515
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,190
It is like she vanished from this world.

516
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,110
It's my fault for failing to finish the job.

517
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,090
Keep searching.

518
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,180
Continue to find her even if you leave no stone unturned.

519
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,710
Yes.

520
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,640
Baiyu, how are we doing in Jia Pass?

521
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,390
I heard their provisions are running low.

522
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,490
Your Majesty, according to spies, Emperor Sheng is prone to suspicion.

523
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,890
He's not satisfied with Ye Xiao being injured.

524
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,880
This time, Ye Qingyu is only allowed to attack and charge but not retreat.

525
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,130
Their soldier's pay and provisions are barely enough.

526
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,180
Deputy Liu, how many provisions do we have?

527
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,240
We can't sustain three days, General.

528
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,630
The Jing invaders attack us every day.

529
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,480
We are running out of provisions and medicine very quickly.

530
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,080
A lot of our brothers can't hold much longer.

531
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,180
 Your father lost three cities and disgraced us all. 

532
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,710
 Too many provisions have been consumed. 

533
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,850
 Now the national treasury is empty. You're responsible for your own provisions. 

534
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:22,340
 If you lose the Jia Pass, I shall execute your whole clan. 

535
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,440
- Give out the food to our men. I'll think of a way tomorrow. 
 - Yes.

536
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,470
Ye Qingyu is just struggling to fight.

537
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,230
The foolish Emperor Sheng actually has such a good general to lead the army.

538
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,590
Have you hunted any powerful demon creatures?

539
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,780
I heard there's a Heptatail Fox Demon in the nearby mountains.

540
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,110
I've sent hands to hunt but have not yet caught it.

541
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,110
Sorry to disappoint you.

542
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,800
 Seem like an acquaintance. 

543
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,840
It's fine.

544
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,190
I'll go personally.

545
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:59,400
How can you catch me with these small tricks?

546
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,770
Oh no! She's getting away!

547
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,770
What a surprise for today's demon hunt.

548
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,880
What a coincidence to meet an acquaintance.

549
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,880
Move again and I'll cut off your tail.

550
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,750
Tantai Jin, where's Ye Xiwu who is used to be with you?

551
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,610
You've seen her?

552
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,230
So you care for her.

553
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,020
I don't know where she went.

554
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,300
That's why I asked you.

555
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,440
I don't feel like killing you today.

556
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,450
You may be of some other use.

557
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,610
This is a secret drug of the Yiyue tribe.

558
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,680
Eat it.

559
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,160
Be loyal to me. Work for me. And you'll be safe.

560
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:45,040
But if you ever betray me, you will endure the pain of getting bitten by thousands of bugs.

561
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,370
Then you will explode and die.

562
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,390
So?

563
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,850
Are you going to eat it

564
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,630
or…

565
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,040
Am I going to have another fox-fur robe?

566
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,090
Hold on.

567
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,860
I'll do it.

568
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,160
General, there's a woman outside who wants to see you.

569
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,110
She said she's your acquaintance.

570
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,740
Let her in.

571
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,190
Pianran?

572
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,280
Pianran.

573
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,930
It's been a long time.

574
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,860
I thought you already forgot me.

575
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,140
I thought back then you were already…

576
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,770
Why are you here?

577
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,080
You should go. Tantai Jin is hunting demon creatures outside.

578
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,040
Be careful not to get caught.

579
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,980
It's too late.

580
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,650
By order of Emperor of Jing, I'm here to ask you to surrender.

581
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,150
Just go.

582
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,590
I knew it would be like this.

583
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,880
Don't drive me away so fast.

584
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,060
Take this as catching up with me.

585
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,480
"Jia Pass needs provisions urgently.

586
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,880
We can only sustain three days.

587
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,760
Please allocate provisions to us.

588
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,470
I shall do everything I can to defend Jia Pass."

589
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,820
How many of these letters have you sent?

590
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,810
Has any provisions come?

591
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,350
Emperor Sheng is such a shrewd person.

592
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,540
He wants you to defend the city without provisions.

593
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,320
Or shall I say, he doesn't care about your lives at all?

594
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,440
He only cares...

595
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
if this city is his or not.

596
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,650
Do you know how many men Tantai Jin has in the Firewing Army?

597
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,880
Before I got out of there, he gave his men an order.

598
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,880
If Jia Pass can't be conquered in three days,

599
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,940
he'll lead the Firewing Army and fight by himself.

600
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,520
By then,

601
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,440
how many people will die?

602
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,380
In this case, go persuade Tantai Jin to kill less!

603
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,660
It's only because he didn't start the war that I came to persuade you.

604
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,070
Ye Qingyu, will there be peace if Tantai Jin stops killing?

605
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,930
How naïve of you.

606
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,490
This war was started by Emperor Sheng simply because he's angry

607
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,620
seeing a hostage prince who once begged for his mercy now becoming a king.

608
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,480
You're not a foolish one.

609
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,910
You also know your entire army will perish with you if this goes on.

610
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:29,420
Emperor Sheng is too stupid to even see this.

611
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,900
Instead of working for a stupid king, why don't you follow a wise one

612
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,920
to keep your soldiers alive?

613
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,940
My family guards the border and protects the Sheng Kingdom.

614
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,200
If I surrender, how can I face my ancestors?

615
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:57,500
Ye Qingyu, do you actually think your reputation

616
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,230
is more important than the lives of thousands of soldiers?

617
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,510
Enough talking. Leave!

618
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm just a fox.

619
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,000
How can I understand state affairs?

620
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,910
Tantai Jin is willing to see you alone tomorrow.

621
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:32,180
If you really don't want to surrender, just kill him to end the war. 
    

622
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,180
It's a great opportunity.

623
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,050
You actually came by yourself with one sword.

624
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,590
You have some courage.

625
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,440
You're wrong about it.

626
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,190
I didn't carry a sword.

627
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,780
Just a few days apart, you have become a king.

628
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,650
That's impressive.

629
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,940
The last time I saw you, you were still a powerful Junior General Ye.

630
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,210
Just a few days later, you look worn out.

631
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:08,400
If I kill you now or take you back alive, my family will have another military merit.

632
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,350
Then go ahead and try.

633
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:16,510
See if you'll get a promotion or if your king will dread you for being a threat to his throne.

634
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,180
That's irrelevant for now.

635
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,680
If I kill you today, I would be killing a malicious man for the world!

636
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,390
Ye Qingyu, I've been a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom for years.

637
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,110
We both know how paranoid Emperor Sheng is.

638
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,010
The Ye family is already at stake.

639
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,200
Be it punishment or reward, I'll thank my king. Our Ye family is and will be Sheng people.

640
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,340
I won't be incited by a few words from you.

641
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,980
   

642

644
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:16,180
♫   Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon   ♫

645
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:23,980
♫   The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm   ♫

646
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:31,800
♫   Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain   ♫

647
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,380
♫   Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain   ♫

648
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,080
♫   We'll never meet again   ♫

649
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,140
♫   I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words   ♫

650
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,880
♫   Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense   ♫

651
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,060
♫   Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof   ♫

652
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,980
♫   Embracing the endless lingering fear   ♫

653
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,520
♫   I've admired you through the myriad of years   ♫

654
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,700
♫   I believed I have been loved for a moment   ♫

655
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,300
♫   I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil   ♫

656
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:17,260
♫   And become devout like the flawless moonlight   ♫

657
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,860
♫   Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

658
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,580
♫   and how they are just like any other creature   ♫

659
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,940
♫   No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars   ♫

660
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,740
♫   The moonlight is my armor   ♫

661
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,260
♫   I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars   ♫

662
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,420
♫   And willingness to live a life in peace   ♫

663
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,100
♫   You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil   ♫

664
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:53,040
♫   And learned to love what you used to resent   ♫

665
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:00,740
♫   Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky   ♫

666
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:09,480
♫   And we'll make it something to remember us by   ♫
