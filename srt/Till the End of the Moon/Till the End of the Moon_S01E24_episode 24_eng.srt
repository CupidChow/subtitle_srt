19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,430
Your Majesty, since I returned from the Sheng Kingdom,

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,850
Xiao Lin and I have already broken off our relationship completely.

21
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,790
Eldest Sister, you…

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,590
But your husband has deep feelings for you.

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,760
Xiao Lin risked his life to come and assassinate me tonight,

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,920
luring all the guards to me in order to help you escape.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,500
Even I couldn't help but be moved by such affection.

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,040
I wonder, Mrs. Xuancheng, what are your thoughts on this?

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,880
No matter what Xiao Lin does,

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,830
I have nothing to do with it.

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,740
My heart is only devoted to you, Your Majesty,

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,850
and will remain unchanged throughout my life.

31
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,420
- Really? 
 - I swear on my life.

32
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,810
Haven't you been well with Eldest Sister?

33
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,050
Why did she say such words?

34
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,140
All right, you may stand up.

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,590
You are the heroine today, and I should reward you.

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,040
What's General Ye doing here?

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,290
To be a good guy?

38
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,520
Qingyu, speak.

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,730
When I was at the Vermilion Bird Gate, I saw Eldest Sister and Pianran

40
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,600
and heard them arguing.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,060
I stopped Pianran before she hit Eldest Sister.

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Arguing for what?

43
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,760
About love threads.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,800
Pianran, what are love threads?

45
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,400
 All intelligent beings have love threads. 

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,770
 Only with love threads can you love someone. 

47
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,000
 But my love threads are lost. 

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,140
 How did you lose your love threads? 

49
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,160
 Why would I tell you? 

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,100
Fine.

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,050
Then... you tell me.

52
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,810
I…

53
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,960
I don't know what they are talking about.

54
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,940
Is that so?

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Baiyu, I heard

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,960
recently, the Moonshadow Guards have developed a new demonic poison.

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,170
It can cause a person to

58
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,200
die a painful death within ten days,

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,070
but it also makes them speak without reservation.

60
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,030
I heard that it is quite effective.

61
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,860
- Your Majesty. 
 - Mrs. Xuancheng, if you don't want to speak,

63
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
you shall try the new poison for me.

64
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,060
Your Majesty, you just gave me credit and wanted to reward me.

65
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,980
They are not the same thing.

66
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,770
You can use the credit to offset your mistakes.

67
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,870
After you try the poison, I can consider keeping you alive.

68
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,460
Are you going to speak now,

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,060
or take the poison and then speak?

70
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,800
I will tell the truth.

71
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,980
It happened seven years ago.

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,260
At that time, I had just turned 16 years old

73
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,500
and was proud and arrogant.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,600
 Jiahui, am I similar to this wildflower? 

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,650
 So weak and invisible… 

76
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,310
 In the Pillar of the State General's flourishing mansion, 

77
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,900
 who would notice such an unremarkable wildflower? 

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,340
 Miss, don't say that. 

79
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,280
 You are beautiful and talented, 

80
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,020
 and you will surely marry the perfect man someday. 

81
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,730
 How could someone like me ever deserve a perfect husband? 

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,930
 Jiahui, go to the temple and ask for a safety charm on my behalf. 

83
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,010
 Hand it over to Grandma for me. 

84
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,320
 How about you, Miss? 

85
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,830
 It's not far from the city gate here. 

86
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,750
 I will walk back, considering it an excursion. 

87
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,190
 Miss, please hold on for a second. 

88
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,020
 Are you okay? 

89
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,380
 I'm going to die soon. 

90
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,750
 Miss, could you do me a favor? 

91
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,530
 Are you from the capital of Sheng? 

92
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,660
 The girl I love is also in the capital. 

93
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,900
 I want to see her one last time. 

94
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,090
 - Thanks. 
 - I want to return what belongs to her. 

95
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,150
 Unfortunately… 

96
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,540
 She lives in the innermost house of 

97
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,550
 Orchid Alley in the city. 

98
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,570
 Please tell Pianran that 

99
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,490
 I, Jiang Rao, am just an ordinary man. 

100
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,070
 I'm not lucky enough to grow old with her. 

101
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,410
 Receiving her love threads 

102
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,720
 was already a great fortune in my life. I now return them 

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,570
 and hope that she will find happiness and a wonderful relationship. 

104
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,900
 I wish her a life full of joy and happiness. 

105
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,430
 I'm sorry that I couldn't keep my promise. 

106
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,520
She looked so gorgeous

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,580
and had a lover who was so devoted to her,

108
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,770
yet I had nothing.

109
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,670
At that time, a wonderful power shrouded me,

110
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,500
and it felt amazing,

111
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,820
making me confused.

112
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,950
 Who is it? Who's out there? 

113
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,570
 Jiang Rao. 

114
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,240
 Was that you? 

115
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,340
I didn't know if it was because of the love threads.

116
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,040
Later on, my looks became more and more beautiful.

117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,470
Men of all ages in the capital

118
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,860
were all captivated by me.

119
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,420
I only knew that those things were called love threads,

120
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,220
but I didn't know what they were.

121
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,150
Back then, I was greedy and foolish

122
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,700
and accidentally kept them for me.

123
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
You didn't even know what they were,

124
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,580
and you took them for your own.

125
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,530
You knew that Jiang Rao died with a heart full of regret,

126
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,450
but you were not even willing to tell Pianran about his death.

127
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,140
I never thought that

128
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,450
Eldest Sister was such a person.

129
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,020
 It wasn't an illusion. 

130
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,550
 What grew in my heart were love threads. 

131
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,800
Even wanting to take someone else's love threads for yourself.

132
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,790
You're truly despicable, Ye Bingchang.

133
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,840
Tantai Jin, don't kill her!

134
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,580
Second Elder Sister! Second Elder Sister!

135
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,390
She stole these, so she should give them back.

136
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,140
 So these are love threads. 

137
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,560
You said that women's misfortunes often come from their loved ones.

138
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,670
I did possess this female demon's love threads,

139
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,500
but I only received a little bit of attention and admiration from others.

140
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,300
The promises of eternal love and devotion that you gave me

141
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,570
were just because of the love threads.

142
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,340
Ye Qingyu and Ye Xiwu,

143
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,690
you were born with everything you wanted.

144
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,550
What did I own?

145
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,720
Now you are even taking these from me.

146
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,830
I have nothing left.

147
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,930
Are you satisfied?

148
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,360
 If it wasn't for Ye Xiwu enabling me to have love threads 

149
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,080
 and know the feeling of love, 

150
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,170
 I'm afraid I would never have been able to experience it. 

151
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,400
Keep what belongs to you.

152
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,450
Take Xiao Lin to the prison, strip Ye Bingchang of her title as Mrs. Xuancheng,

153
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,230
and from tomorrow, make her a slave in the palace prison.

154
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes.

155
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,540
   

156
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,950
Are you here to persuade me or pity me?

157
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,480
When I was sad that day, you had dinner with me,

158
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,300
and today, when you are sad,

159
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,380
I can accompany you for a drink.

160
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,290
The river your elder sister mentioned,

161
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,450
back then,

162
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,720
I met Jiang Rao there.

163
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,440
He was watering his horse by the river,

164
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,710
but I thought he was a creep spying on me taking a bath.

165
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,430
Without allowing him to explain,

166
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,290
I slapped him many times,

167
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,670
and he was stunned.

168
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
That river is very close to the capital of Sheng.

169
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,520
It's so close that...

170
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,810
the slowest person...

171
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,750
can even walk home, although 30 minutes late.

172
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,020
He was so close,

173
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
just a little bit,

174
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,480
and he could go home.

175
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,530
I'd waited for him for so long.

176
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,310
Every day at home, I counted the days on my fingers.

177
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,260
I waited for him for more than a thousand days.

178
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,640
I know.

179
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,450
You must have waited for a long, long time.

180
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,520
♫  For a short rendezvous  ♫

181
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,610
♫  All dreams fall gracefully  ♫

182
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:16,270
Later, I went to the Jia Pass to look for his corpse.

183
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,750
I looked for him for years, but I heard nothing.

184
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,210
I had no idea that he just died like that,

185
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,240
outside the city, with no one knowing.

186
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,110
♫  I wish I never disappointed you the moment we met  ♫

187
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,670
How ridiculous.

188
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,940
♫  I have loved and suffered. Do not ridicule me for my infatuation  ♫

189
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,820
♫  I have wept and smiled, living for one person  ♫

190
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,380
♫  If I cannot entrust myself to you without regret in this life  ♫

191
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,500
♫  Even if my heart follows the prosperity, it will be difficult to walk away  ♫

192
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,600
♫  Thank the heavens for not looking down on God's will  ♫

193
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,560
♫  I'm grateful that you never gave up our time together  ♫

194
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,840
♫  I'm thankful for all your joy and sorrow, and for bestowing me with memories of you  ♫

195
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,380
♫  Even if there is no return date, I am content  ♫

196
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Can you stop moving, all right?

197
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,660
Or the bed will fall apart.

198
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,660
I thought you wanted to comfort me,

199
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,210
but why are you having a hard time going to sleep?

200
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,780
Tantai Jin, do you think if my eldest sister wasn't a daughter of a concubine

201
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,050
and was treated with more love and care at home,

202
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,430
would she have ended up differently?

203
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,830
Why aren't you thinking about sleeping but her this late at night?

204
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,290
Why are you asking me? Aren't you the same?

205
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,150
What are you thinking about?

206
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,130
I'm thinking...

207
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,550
perhaps the reason why I used to be emotionless and heartless...

208
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,370
was that I didn't have any love threads.

209
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,060
 Young Devil Lord guessed it right. 

210
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,720
Ye Xiwu,

211
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,690
what would it feel like

212
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,200
to have love threads?

213
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,140
It's probably this feeling.

214
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,620
Go to sleep.

215
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,330
 Fuyu, 

216
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,310
 how many more days until this formation is completed? 

217
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,310
 Your Highness, three days will do. 

218
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,540
 In three days,  

219
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,060
 there will be no living creature left within the southern border. 

220
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,640
 How is the preparation for the Puppet Soldiers going? 

221
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,810
Your Highness,

222
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,050
the warlocks have been working day and night to refine them,

223
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,250
and now there are more than ten thousand Nether Puppet Soldiers for you to command.

224
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,040
Too few.

225
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,170
From today on, ask them to accelerate the refining of the demon soldiers.

226
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,160
I can't wait too long.

227
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,880
I will think of some solutions.

228
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,300
   

229
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,110
That's all. It's all done.

230
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,450
By the way, I want to go out to relax in a few days.

231
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,370
Approved.

232
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,780
Tantai Jin, you've got a conscience now.

233
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,540
If you keep babbling, no more days off.

234
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,580
All right, all right.

235
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,350
What is it?

236
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,780
Your Majesty, I want to take a day off.

237
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,940
General Ye, since you became a court official, you have never rested for a day.

238
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,380
You can take a break.

239
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,610
It is right and proper that officials have a day off every five days.

240
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,010
Thanks. You can put the food there.

241
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,690
Second Young Miss, what are you doing here?

242
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,740
Take this.

243
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm not short of food and clothing here.

244
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,840
Tantai Jin does not mistreat me.

245
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,530
Dad and Grandma asked me to bring you this.

246
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,810
They care about you, so just take it.

247
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,650
Thanks.

248
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,930
Does Tantai Jin know that you are here?

249
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,370
I will leave quickly after visiting you, so I don't need to tell him.

250
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,860
I have nothing to do here all day,

251
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,180
and it's even more comfortable than being in the barracks.

252
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,830
Go back quickly.

253
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,380
What are you planning to do?

254
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,000
What do you mean?

255
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,340
Where is Pang Yizhi?

256
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,550
Where are Sheng's remaining troops?

257
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,780
I knew something was up with you.

258
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,080
Xiao Lin, you can trust me.

259
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,630
What do you really want to do? I can definitely help you.

260
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,480
You don't need to help.

261
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,540
At this point, I can only resign myself to my fate and await death.

262
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,170
Tantai Jin won't kill you.

263
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,890
I know he won't.

264
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,930
But he will never release me from the Jing prison, either.

265
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,680
What on earth do you want?

266
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,120
Pang Yizhi will take at least six days to return to the remaining troops.

267
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,190
If I could escape after the assassination,

268
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,910
I would lead the remaining troops to recapture Jing's prisoners of war

269
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,000
and take them south across the sea in six days.

270
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,060
If I can't escape,

271
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,320
Pang Yizhi will lead the remnant troops and refugees to leave.

272
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,900
No need to wait for me.

273
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,540
What about you?

274
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,450
Sheng Kingdom can have generals who die in battles but not a crown prince who defects.

275
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,730
When Sheng was breached,

276
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,510
I should have been buried with the kingdom.

277
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,350
Come back here!

278
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,420
How can you be so stubborn?

279
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Second Young Miss, as long as I'm alive,

280
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,060
this last elite army will fight to the death for me.

281
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,690
But now,

282
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Sheng is nearing its end.

283
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,170
Tantai Jin is a great leader.

284
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,200
With him, the people of Sheng can still enjoy peace.

285
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,270
Only when I am dead,

286
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,600
and the hope of Sheng Kingdom's revival is shattered,

287
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,980
can this war truly end

288
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,350
and the bloodshed stop.

289
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,250
So this time, you came

290
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,820
with the intention to die.

291
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,190
Yeah. We all have our own aspirations.

292
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,690
Don't feel sad for me, Second Young Miss.

293
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,250
Just wait here.

294
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,670
Within six days, I'll figure out a way

295
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,410
to let you leave with the Sheng Army.

296
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,740
This is too risky. Please don't take any chances.

297
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,440
Wait for my news.

298
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
Second Young Miss.

299
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,740
Actually,

300
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,870
you're not Ye Xiwu. Right?

301
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,780
Why do you say that?

302
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,090
I've known Ye Xiwu since little.

303
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,350
She wouldn't fight for others

304
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,530
or go on a mission alone.

305
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,990
Not to mention risking her life to save me.

306
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,840
After Enlightened Life,

307
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,780
when we were parting by the Mo River,

308
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,680
I was already certain of it.

309
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,200
Sixth Prince, I…

310
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,380
No need to explain.

311
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,580
This must be a most mysterious thing

312
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,090
not to be told to others.

313
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,480
Rest assured. I won't mention it to anyone,

314
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,850
whether I live or die this time.

315
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,640
Just go.

316
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,270
Wait for me to save you.

317
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,220
For how long?

318
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,640
A quarter of an hour at most.

319
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,850
What did they talk about?

320
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,300
I was too far away to hear clearly.

321
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,650
At least you could see clearly.

322
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,350
They…

323
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,660
What? Was it so hard to describe?

324
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,390
First, Xiao Lin put his hand on Miss Ye's face.

325
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,510
Miss Ye dragged his clothes vigorously.

326
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,120
And then Miss Ye left.

327
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,700
That's all.

328
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,040
Nian Baiyu, if this happens again,

329
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,100
send someone more articulated to shadow.

330
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,830
You're dismissed.

331
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,490
Yes.

332
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,470
Ye Xiwu, you bitch.

333
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,690
Who's Ye Bingchang?

334
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,290
I am.

335
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,170
Your family is here. Come with me.

336
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,720
   

337
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,180
Grandma?

338
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,850
Grandma.

339
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,900
Bingchang, you've suffered.

340
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,680
Grandma, how can you come here to see me?

341
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,500
I asked Xiwu for help.

342
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,360
She is quite favored by His Majesty, Tantai Jin.

343
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,580
That's why I can come to see you.

344
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,660
We've all heard about what you did.

345
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,300
It's fair to be punished for your mistakes.

346
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,620
But blood is thicker than water.

347
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,100
You're one of our family, after all.

348
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,350
We won't abandon you.

349
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,300
Don't worry.

350
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,940
Grandma.

351
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,930
Actually, I shouldn't have gotten greedy for the love threads.

352
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,670
These days in the palace prison,

353
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,080
I've finally come around.

354
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,860
To correct a mistake is the greatest good.

355
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,970
All right, enough of these.

356
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,870
Come, look.

357
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,490
Take the food and clothes.

358
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,820
Thanks, Grandma.

359
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Oh… I almost forgot.

360
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,150
Come, take this.

361
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,860
It's a hand ointment.

362
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,390
Xiwu told me to bring it to you.

363
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,640
She said that it's cold in Jing Kingdom.

364
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,790
So Tantai Jin told the imperial doctors

365
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,130
to make up this ointment

366
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,120
for treating chilblains.

367
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,470
You can't buy this anywhere else.

368
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,100
She specially spared some and told me to bring it to you.

369
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,980
Remember to apply it often every day.

370
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,550
Xiwu, that child,

371
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,280
still cares about her elder sister.

372
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,100
Yeah.

373
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,980
That's why they all say she's got a kind heart.

374
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,950
The palace gate is about to be closed.

375
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,650
We will head home.

376
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,210
Grandma, I just remembered that

377
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,330
it's my mother's death anniversary in a few days.

378
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,080
Although I've failed to be filial,

379
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,580
I still wish to go home to pay respects to her.

380
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,330
Grandma, could you discuss this with Second Younger Sister?

381
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,990
See if she can beg for mercy from His Majesty.

382
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,780
Begging for mercy?

383
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,080
Second Young Miss can't help you with everything.

384
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,930
Grandma, I really regret what I did.

385
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,100
Bingchang, I'll talk to Xiwu about it.

386
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,070
We'll try to beg for His Majesty's mercy.

387
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,010
Thanks, Grandma.

388
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,580
   

389
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,770
Ye Qingyu asked for leave again.

390
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,510
He has gone outside behind my back quite frequently these days.

391
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,350
And he tried to hide it from me.

392
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,370
Was he secretly doing something behind my back?

393
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,240
This is the road to the Sheng Kingdom.

394
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Ye Qingyu, what exactly are you up to?

395
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,900
Although we were born in the same kingdom, and we're both soldiers,

396
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,220
we didn't have the chance to see each other.

397
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,440
You're a good son of Sheng. 
    

398
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,890
You died here,

399
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,770
but you died for your kingdom.

400
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,250
This cup is me paying my respect.

401
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,500
The second cup...

402
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,280
is my envy for you.

403
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,680
Though you were killed in the war,

404
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,770
your soul lives on.

405
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,020
Not just in your homeland...

406
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,490
but also in people's hearts.

407
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,260
In her heart, she will always love you,

408
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,840
think of you, and miss you.

409
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,090
She'll be sad and happy for you.

410
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,900
Whatever happens in the future,

411
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,100
she'll never be able to forget you in her life.

412
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,730
That's why I admire her, too.

413
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,230
Although she's a demon with a very long life,

414
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,880
she's willing to love a mortal

415
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,700
and not change her feelings for him ever.

416
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,770
Sometimes I'll think,

417
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,080
if someday I also died in battle,

418
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,500
I could be like you.

419
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,840
I'd always have a place in her heart.

420
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,760
But...

421
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,800
that was just a thought.

422
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,910
I wouldn't want her to be alone.

423
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,230
I want to be alive

424
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,550
and stay by her side

425
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,930
to love her

426
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,610
and protect her.

427
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,870
I want to spend this short life with her.

428
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,880
If your soul's down there, please don't worry.

429
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,760
I'll take good care of her.

430
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,980
I, Ye Qingyu, will only love this woman in my entire life.

431
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,880
I will never fail her.

432
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,680
♫  For a short rendezvous  ♫

433
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,550
♫  All dreams fall gracefully  ♫

434
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,880
Why didn't you give me this sweet talk to my face?

435
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,440
Pianran.

436
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,600
♫  Don't talk about it, don't get entangled  ♫

437
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,890
Thank you..

438
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,180
for finding him.

439
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,980
I've also tried to look for him outside of the city

440
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,520
but I missed the right spot.

441
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,770
I thought after so many years,

442
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,490
his bones were long gone.

443
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,860
I'm familiar with Sheng's warfare.

444
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,450
When soldiers came back from the front,

445
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,890
they always took these few paths.

446
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,050
That's why I…

447
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,800
That's why...

448
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,010
you kept coming back to see him behind my back.

449
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:55,320
♫  If I cannot entrust myself to you without regret in this life  ♫

450
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,520
♫  Even if my heart follows the prosperity, it will be difficult to walk away  ♫

451
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,030
   

452
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,110
Jiang Rao, this man wasn't lying to you.

453
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,740
I live pretty well now.

454
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,380
And I'm happy.

455
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:33,960
♫  Thank the heavens for not looking down on God's will  ♫

456
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,040
I found the one to spend a lifetime with.

457
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,960
♫  I'm thankful for all your joy and sorrow, and for bestowing me with memories of you  ♫

458
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,300
♫  Even if there is no return date, I am content  ♫

459
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,240
♫  The first time I love you  ♫

460
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:07,020
♫  Will already be the end  ♫

461
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,540
What? Got something on your mind?

462
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,410
Nothing.

463
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,350
By the way, you told me that Ye Bingchang wanted to take leave for two days

464
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,470
to go home and pay respects to her mother.

465
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,030
I've approved that.

466
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,880
But you must watch her closely.

467
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,440
She's now a slave in the palace prison.

468
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,860
Don't let her escape again.

469
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,710
Understood.

470
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,190
You…

471
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,980
Don't you have anything to say to me?

472
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,060
No.

473
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,800
Then I'm leaving.

474
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,540
Go ahead.

475
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,430
 Today is the sixth day for Xiao Lin. 

476
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,320
 I can't wait any longer. 

477
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,060
Safe journey, Second Young Miss.

478
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,720
What are you waiting for? Move!

479
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,110
Who'd have thought a slave from the palace prison could still go home?

480
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,760
Move it.

481
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,790
   

482
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,330
Miss, Eldest Young Miss just came back.

483
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,850
Don't you want to see her?

484
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,860
Wasn't I just back from the palace, too?

485
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,380
I don't have time to chat with her today.

486
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,790
Miss, what exactly are you doing?

487
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,920
Chuntao, do me a favor.

488
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,930
I want to cook sweet porridge for Tantai Jin.

489
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,490
Porridge is supposed to be a simple one.

490
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,740
I guess I won't mess it up, right?

491
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,530
It's hard to tell.

492
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,040
 What a perfect chance. It's really effortless. 

493
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,800
This time... it literally tastes good.

494
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,820
 Eldest Young Miss! These medicinal ingredients are for Her Ladyship! 

495
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,560
Eldest Young Miss!

496
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,810
Eldest Young Miss, these medicinal ingredients are for Her Ladyship! Eldest Young Miss.

497
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,500
What's going on?

498
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,580
Second Young Miss,

499
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,950
I need these medicinal ingredients to concoct a medicine for Her Ladyship later.

500
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,080
But Eldest Young Miss just knocked them over.

501
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,550
What should I do later?

502
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,400
Let go of my eldest sister. Don't be rude.

503
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,800
- But these medicinal ingredients… 
 - Let go.

504
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,880
We must not ruin Grandma's medicine.

505
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,780
I'll help you clean up this mess.

506
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,980
Elder Sister, you must be tired as you got up early.

507
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,800
Go back to rest.

508
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,250
Second Young Miss, why do you always tolerate her?

509
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,830
Think about the things she did.

510
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,080
Besides, she's a slave in the palace prison now.

511
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,560
Shame on her!

512
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,770
That's enough. Let's clean it up.

513
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,460
Come on, eat more of this.

514
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,610
 What a coincidence. 

515
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:00,460
 Ye Xiwu, I thought you loved Tantai Jin deeply. 

516
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,690
 But you actually have evil plans, huh? 

517
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,390
 Tantai Jin, I'm sorry. 

518
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,010
 You'll only be sleeping for a few hours after drinking the knockout drops. 

519
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,660
 I'll apologize to you when I'm back. 

520
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,020
 You can punish me however you like. 

521
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,610
Why are you still up?

522
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,710
I'm waiting for you.

523
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,880
What have you cooked today?

524
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,800
Sweet porridge.

525
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,300
I didn't mess up this time.

526
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,380
You can have a taste.

527
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,090
You eat first.

528
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,420
I'll eat it after reading these reports.

529
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm not hungry.

530
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,570
I'm going to lie down for a while.

531
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,380
Remember to eat it when finishing reading.

532
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,770
Okay.

533
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,380
 What trick is she playing again? 

534
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,660
Bingchang, why are you still up?

535
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,250
I'm here to deliver a supper for you.

536
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,940
Did you cook this?

537
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,010
I'm not so dutiful as to

538
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,330
do such a good thing.

539
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,510
It's cooked by your good granddaughter Ye Xiwu.

540
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,650
Bingchang, why are you talking like this?

541
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,600
She told me to let you finish it all,

542
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,630
so don't waste her efforts.

543
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,610
All right.

544
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,900
   

545
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,160
 I'm not hungry. 

546
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,820
I'm going to lie down for a while.

547
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,550
Remember to eat it when you finish reading.

548
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,760

♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫
