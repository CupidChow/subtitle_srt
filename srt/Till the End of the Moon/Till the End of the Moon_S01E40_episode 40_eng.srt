3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,700
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,100
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,700
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,160
♫  I am not afraid of how the world treats me  ♫

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,160
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,580
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad  ♫

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,240
♫  There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,260
♫  My existence  ♫

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:31,380
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,160
   

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,080
   

17
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,760
Li Susu, pick up your cup.

18
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,550
Do you demons and devils also make toasts to Heaven and Earth?

19
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,530
No.

20
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,400
This cup of wine...

21
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,950
is for all the sins in the world.

22
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,600
This one is for all the death.

23
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,610
Indeed worthy of respect.

24
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,590
This last cup of cross-cupped wine

25
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,600
is to wish us to be together forever.

26
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,650
Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal, today is our wedding day.

27
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,560
Are you dissatisfied with it?

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,210
Should I be overjoyed to stay in this dark and sunless hellhole?

29
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,520
That was negligent of me.

30
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,930
Mount Changze has towering terrain,

31
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,000
and this Devil Palace is gloomy and dark.

32
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,840
You would certainly not get used to living here.

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,370
However...

34
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,360
it's easy to fix this problem.

35
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,790
It's time to restore this Devil Palace to its former appearance.

36
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,750
 Return of the Devil Lord, chaos to Heaven and Earth! Return of the Devil Lord, chaos to Heaven and Earth! 

37
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,170
The moment that I became the Devil Lord,

38
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,270
all kinds of karma appeared before my eyes.

39
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,990
I only understood that right and wrong or good and evil are all caused by karma.

40
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,110
As long as the sins in the world do not stop,

41
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,580
the Devil Lord...

42
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,950
will never perish.

43
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,630
Only when the All-in-Distress Path is opened,

44
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,580
the world is in chaos,

45
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,770
and all living beings

46
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,960
can truly return to where they belong.

47
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,510
What's that?

48
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,820
- It's the Devil Palace! It's in the air! 
 - What?

49
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,600
- Hurry up, everybody. 
 - Yes. 
 - Okay.

50
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

51
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,970
Hurry.

52
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,700
My wife,

53
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,920
are you satisfied with the gift I have given you?

54
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,480
It seems that the Four Continents and Three Realms all belong to you now.

55
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,230
Exactly.

56
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,700
When the All-in-Distress Path completely swallows the world,

57
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,940
the Four Continents and Three Realms will all belong to me.

58
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,820
And you will be my caged bird in this life,

59
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,580
and the most interesting decoration in this Devil Palace.

60
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,970
Indeed, you gave me a generous gift.

61
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,870
I should give you a big gift in return.

62
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
Chongyu Harp.

63
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,560
Li Susu, you should know that with your current spiritual cultivation,

64
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
you can't hurt me in the slightest.

65
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,460
Although I can't deal with you,

66
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,150
the Chongyu Harp is a divine instrument with divine power contained in it.

67
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,100
You want to burn the Chongyu Harp and release the divine power?

68
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,630
Yes. It has accompanied me for many years.

69
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,290
When the divine power is exhausted, it's time to say goodbye.

70
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,600
You are quite generous with this.

71
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,610
I won't need to use it anyway.

72
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,040
The Devil Lord is in the air. What's that red light?

73
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,660
It's the Great Self-Sacrifice Array.

74
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,520
Susu initiated the Great Self-Sacrifice Array.

75
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,770
The Great Self-Sacrifice Array?

76
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,120
You know it?

77
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,410
Li Susu, would you rather die

78
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,390
than be my wife?

79
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,710
No, if it's possible, I will take you to die with me.

80
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,900
Senior Brother Gongye, what should we do?

81
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,270
Li Susu has trapped the Devil Lord. It's a great time for us to start the array.

82
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,340
Susu can't escape from the array.

83
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,440
Today, all sects are throwing caution to the wind

84
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,020
in order to eliminate devils at all costs, not to save Li Susu.

85
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,440
Fine, what a statement to take me to die with you.

86
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Li Susu, you should indeed hate me,

87
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,990
but you should hate yourself more.

88
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,770
If you could have awakened earlier that love to me was nothing but a delusion.

89
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,100
How could the Four Continents and Three Realms become like this today?

90
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,140
- Yes. 
 - All immortal sects,

91
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,740
- It was too foolish of me. 
 - follow my orders! Get in formation!

92
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,600
 - Yes!  
 - It was my vain attempt to lead you into the light

93
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,200
that brought such heavy darkness to the Three Realms.

94
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,450
Now I can only make up for it with my life

95
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,040
and try my best to remedy it.

96
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,390
Even if you start the Great Self-Sacrifice Array, you cannot kill me.

97
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,920
Whatever you do will be in vain.

98
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,880
Back then, the twelve gods sacrificed themselves.

99
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,500
Although they failed to kill the Devil Lord in one fell swoop, they severely injured him.

100
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,420
Only then did the God of War execute the devils and purify the Three Realms.

101
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,480
I am a disciple of Hengyang Sect and the daughter of Qu Xuanzi.

102
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,890
Sacrificing my life to eliminate the devil is my duty.

103
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,810
Even if I die today, my fellow immortals

104
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,740
will do the same until you are killed someday.

105
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,870
Tantai Jin, farewell forever.

106
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,800
Go, stop them.

107
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,850
Guard the array!

108
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,850
 Looks like everything has started. 

109
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,770
 Please, hurry up! 

110
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,220
Li Susu, your fellow immortals are all here.

111
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,790
Since you are so persistent,

112
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,650
then...

113
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,820
I will send you and them to be buried together for the All-in-Distress Path.

114
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,690
Li Susu, come here.

115
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,350
Let's witness the destruction of the immortal sects.

116
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,730
Senior Brother, all sects are ready.

117
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,040
 Tantai Jin, today is your date to perish. 

118
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,540
Celestial Punishment Array, open!

119
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,470
It's the Celestial Punishment.

120
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,800
Looks like your fellows from the immortal sects

121
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,590
are giving up on you.

122
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,100
As long as the Devil Lord can be killed, I will die for a just cause.

123
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,050
In this Celestial Punishment, there are eighty-one thunderbolts.

124
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,660
Even with my Devil Lord's body,

125
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,010
it is difficult to retreat unscathed.

126
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,200
Abandoning you in exchange for severely injuring me,

127
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,170
your immortal sects are really calculating.

128
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,120
But you? You still want to trap me for them

129
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,990
and perish with me.

130
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,270
Being hit by the Celestial Punishment hurts greatly. I don't want to take it.

131
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,110
Since you are bent on dying,

132
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,420
take it for me.

133
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
Tantai Jin!

134
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Li Susu, goodbye.

135
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,600
 These eighty-one thunderbolts are what you deserve. 

136
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,550
Enjoy them, and regard them as your compensation to me!

137
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,630
What? Tantai Jin escaped!

138
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,100
- What should we do, Sect Leader Gongye? 
 - Yeah.

139
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,590
Tantai Jin!

140
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,510
Sect Leader Gongye,

141
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,010
you really don't care about details or old feelings when you started the array.

142
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,240
You even have the heart to harm Susu.

143
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,990
As long as we get rid of you, Susu's death is worth it.

144
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,800
 Xiaoyao Swordplay, break! 

145
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,200
Who are these kids?

146
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,680
 We are disciples of Immortal Zhaoyou 

147
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,200
 in the Xiaoyao Sect! 

148
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,000
Gongye Jiwu, with your power,

149
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
you wouldn't have such abilities.

150
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,280
What have you done?

151
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,720
Everything I did...

152
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,270
is just to kill you.

153
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,620
Gongye Jiwu, you used a forbidden spell to absorb the power of your fellow disciples.

154
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,810
Now you have completely changed.

155
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,060
Do you even know who you are now?

156
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,020
So what?

157
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,900
As long as I can kill you,

158
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,900
what's wrong with borrowing a little of their power?

159
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,290
 Once he is devilized, 

160
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,060
 he will be completely beyond salvation. 

161
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,960
Gongye Jiwu, stop it.

162
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Gongye Jiwu, you have gone awry.

163
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,250
That was how you treated me, too.

164
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,270
Gongye Jiwu, you shouldn't be like this,

165
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,570
not violent, filthy,

166
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,200
nor twisted.

167
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,830
I will repay...

168
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,820
all my various debts to you.

169
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,410
Gongye Jiwu, don't fall into evilness anymore.

170
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,690
Jiwu, don't let evil thoughts control you.

171
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,770
This is the sin that has accumulated since the beginning of the world,

172
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,720
and also the reason why you want to destroy the Four Continents and Three Realms.

173
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,950
I am the Devil Lord. My life and death are connected with you,

174
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,850
as well as my prosperity and decline.

175
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,340
 The evil bone has left my body... 

176
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,510
 and empowered the All-in-Distress Path. 

177
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,800
 It is only one step away, 

178
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,350
 just like the great battle between gods and devils. 

179
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,060
 Run quickly! 

180
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,090
 Get out of here quickly! 

181
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,090
 Li Susu, hate me from the bottom of your heart. 

182
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,350
 Tantai Jin, what are you doing? 

183
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,110
The God-Slaying Crossbow?

184
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,400
How can we give up without fighting till the end?

185
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,080
Yeah. Our immortal sects lasted 10,000 years.

186
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,100
Today, we'd rather die than retreat in the Barren Abyss!

187
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,990
Everyone, Flying-Sword Formation!

188
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,350
We do need to finish this.

189
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,100
 Is this 10,000 years ago 

190
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,580
 or later? 

191
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,900
 If it's before the war of gods, 

192
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,830
 why is there already the Heaven Lake? 

193
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
 If it's after the war, 

194
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,150
 why are the celestial pillars still here? 

195
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,510
 I never knew that there was such a world in my heart. 

196
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,400
 That's because... 

197
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,430
 it only exists when you look at it. 

198
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,060
 Mother. 

199
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,480
 We've been waiting for you for too long… 

200
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,510
 Too long… 

201
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,310
Li Susu.

202
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,690
Come with me.

203
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,820
Where is this place?

204
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,720
I don't know.

205
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,290
But this is the last place that hasn't been devoured by All-in-Distress Path.

206
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,860
It's going to disappear soon.

207
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,160
Tantai Jin, the reason why it hasn't been devoured

208
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,640
is because it's the place farthest from All-in-Distress Path.

209
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Farthest from the Devil Palace and killing.

210
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,820
Farthest from the devil realm where there's bloodshed.

211
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,810
Li Susu, what are you trying to say?

212
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,120
So... in the last moment,

213
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,650
we still have some time to talk.

214
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:58,150
Li Susu, you've broke through the Heartless Path and immortalized.

215
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,380
Now, you're the only god in this world...

216
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,680
and the only one who can kill the Devil Lord.

217
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,740
Do you actually have time to talk with me?

218
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,520
So,

219
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,100
this is what you want.

220
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,690
To let me kill you?

221
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
You figured it out.

222
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,370
Yeah, Tantai Jin.

223
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,900
So, you don't have to wear this false shell anymore.

224
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,570
The moment when I broke through the Heartless Path,

225
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,900
I saw every corner of this world

226
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,700
and heard every sound between Heaven and Earth.

227
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,180
I can sense everything in the world,

228
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,490
including your heart.

229
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,610
You've absorbed the power of the Devil Lord,

230
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,270
but you were never controlled by him.

231
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,110
But you still chose to show up in front of me as the Devil Lord.

232
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,480
You forced me to sever my love and desire,

233
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,750
go through tribulations, and achieve nirvana.

234
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,870
You wanted to watch me end all this.

235
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,750
I'm sorry.

236
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,710
This is the only way.

237
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,480
It should also be the end of the Devil Lord.

238
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,220
♫  Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave  ♫

239
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,340
♫  Flip through the fabulous years written in books  ♫

240
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,760
♫  Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret  ♫

241
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,660
♫  I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish  ♫

242
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Tantai Jin,

243
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,740
I wanted to protect you,

244
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,240
but I fooled you time after time.

245
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,890
I wanted to save you,

246
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,940
but I shot six Soul-slaying Spikes

247
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,490
into your heart.

248
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,900
I used to...

249
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,090
wish to live a full life with you...

250
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,930
until we grew old.

251
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,890
But now we can't grow old anyway.

252
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,580
♫  I only wish to exchange this life with eternity  ♫

253
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,650
I didn't expect that

254
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,660
the my existence was destined...

255
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,210
for your death.

256
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,540
♫  Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed  ♫

257
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,580
♫  But this time, who will be the one  ♫

258
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,400
It's fine.

259
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,510
Susu,

260
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,670
this life of mine was full of hardship.

261
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,120
I'll let you end it for me.

262
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,600
♫  My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

263
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,600
♫  Why need alcohol when one can get oneself drunk?  ♫

00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,630
♫  I only ask if the world won't change  ♫

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,360
Let me take you somewhere.

266
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,180
♫  I don't want to change the world, only your heart  ♫

267
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,960
♫  The longing never ends  ♫

268
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,330
Why do you bring me here?

269
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,410
I just wanted to show you the views here.

270
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,340
This world looks so small.

271
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,710
But what a shame.

272
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,380
Only you and I can see such views.

273
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeah. Look.

274
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,650
The mountains are like peas.

275
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,980
The rivers are like lines.

276
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,050
Even the All-in-Distress Path looks just like a tiny speck of stain.

277
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,430
Every living soul is too small to be visible.

278
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,100
This is what the gods see.

279
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,800
The mortals living in it

280
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,080
will never see such scenery

281
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,690
even after exhausting their whole lives.

282
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,600
That's why they can never see through.

283
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,510
That's why they can never break free.

284
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,140
You are different.

285
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,920
You can.

286
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,180
You can save all from disasters.

287
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,030
You can change the fate of the Four Continents and Three Realms.

288
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,910
The purpose of the Devil Lord...

289
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,380
was never uniting the Three Realms.

290
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,730
What he truly wanted to do was destroy everything

291
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,480
and let it return to chaos.

292
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,710
Susu, I've connected myself with the All-in-Distress Path.

293
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,320
The All-in-Distress Path and the Devil Lord...

294
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,130
live and die together.

295
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,730
Kill me, and the All-in-Distress Path will be destroyed, too.

296
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,980
The conflicts and fate of the 10,000 years will eventually come to an end.

297
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,740
Tantai Jin,

298
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,630
I still have a lot…

299
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,610
a lot of words…

300
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,910
that I want to say to you.

301
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,980
Tell me.

302
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,860
♫  Searching your direction and flying all the way  ♫

303

But you're too bad.

309
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,240
I am not happy to tell you now.

310
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,020
♫  Destroy, reconstruct  ♫

311

316

♫  One drop of tears, one inch of ash. Coming back and forth in one thought  ♫

318
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,610
I'll say these words to you...

319

00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,990
Okay.

323
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,750
♫  Traveling in darkness  ♫

324
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,580
♫  One drop of tears  ♫

325
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,000
♫  A dream is long  ♫

326
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,570
Susu,

327
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
let it go.

328
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,340
No.

329
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,900
Just this time, let me hold you tight.

330
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,490
Without the Devil Lord existing in this world,

331
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,380
there is no need for a god.

332
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,380
Okay.

333
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,640
Look! The All-in-Distress Path disappeared!

334
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,550
 The All-in-Distress Path. 

335
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,630
 I'm sorry, Susu. 

336
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,950
 I'm going to lie to you again. 

337
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,130
This will be the ending of you and me.

338
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,000
 Look! That thing is gone! 

339
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,630
 - That's right. 
 - It's true! 

340
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,780
 This is great! 

341
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,420
 We're saved! 

342
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,960
 - This is great! 
 - We're saved! 

343
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,390
The All-in-Distress Path is gone!

344
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,580
Look! The All-in-Distress Path is gone!

345
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,010
This is the royal tomb of the Jing Kingdom.

346
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,810
 I give you this opportunity... 

347
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,580
 to pick a place you like 

348
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:13,500
 and decide where you want to be buried. 

349
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,140
 Stop your gloating. 

350
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,450
 I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you. 

351
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,420
   

352
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,300
 Answer me. Do you have feelings for me?  
    

353
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,040
 One day together, deep love forever. 

354
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,550
 Of course, I surely love you. 

355
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,130
 No. 

356
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,160
 I don't mean the marital duty. 

357
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,950
 I want your true love. 

358
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:53,300
   

359
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,500
   

360
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,800

364

♫  Seeing all the colors of the wind, being drowned by the sea of clouds  ♫

365
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:08,310
♫  After all, I cannot ask for love, no matter how much  ♫

366
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:15,000
♫  Tides are outlined by the waxes and wanes of the moon. I cannot touch memories  ♫

♫  Actually, the sun and moon can be side by side. Light and darkness can overlap  ♫

375
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,790
 Tantai Jin, are you leaving? 

376
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,400
 Yeah, I am. 

377
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,880
 All right. Then I'll be here waiting for your return. 

378
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,900
 You must come back early. 

379
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,380
 Okay. 

380
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,610
 I'll be back soon. 

381
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,050
 Tantai Jin, don't be sad. 

382
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:24,820
 You're not the Devil Lord. You're not a murderer nor a monster that brings disasters. 

383
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,760
 Your name is Tantai Jin. 

384
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,990
 You're the one whom I love the most. 

385

♫  It shines so brightly that I am not able to touch  ♫

395
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:30,350
 Ye Xiwu, the one I love is you. 

396
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,700
♫  To love bravely and then bid farewell courageously  ♫

397
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,380
 I am able to love someone... 

398
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,960
 only because that person is you, not anyone else. 

399
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:51,550
   

400
00:51:54,860 --> 00:52:01,770
 Susu, even if we're stuck here forever in Hengyang Sect, I'll stay here... 

401
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,820
 and enjoy the mountain and rivers as well as sunsets and mornings with you. 

402
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,830
 No scenery is better than being with you for all eternity. 

403
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,740
Tantai Jin,

404
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,800
you lied to me again.

405
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,430
 If I, Tantai Jin, break my promise, 

406
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,280
 may Heaven and Earth kill me. 

407
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,050
 May my soul perish with my body. 

408
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:45,550
♫  To love bravely and then bid farewell courageously  ♫

409
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,940
   
   

410
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,580
 This world finally has peace now. 

411
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,790
 Mortals, immortals, and devils can live in peace. 

412
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,600
 Lord Immortal Jize, now I finally understand. 

413
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,860
   

414
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:42,580
Mom, come on.

415
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,950
Where else is it fun to play in the mortal realm?

416
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,450
There's one place that's quite pretty.

417
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:57,950
Mom, look! So many little fish in the water.

418
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,660
 The Mo River flows on and on. 

419
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,520
 It seems to be changing all the time. 

420
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,080
 But it seems to have never changed, either. 

421
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,830
 When love fades, hatred dissipates, 

422
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,360
 and our physical bodies perish 

423
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:23,030
 how can we prove that these emotions existed once? 

424
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:32,850
 Will our story be known by posterity? 

425
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,000
Mom! Mom!

426
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,650
What's this place called?

427
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,960
Well, this river is called the Mo River.

428
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,600
Long ago, on the banks of the river are the Sheng Kingdom and the Jing Kingdom.

429
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,570
And long, long ago, there were a lot of little clams living in it.

430
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:01,850
Deep at the bottom of the river, there was also a clam princess.

431
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,580
What happened next?

432
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,170
What did the clam princess look like?

433
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:14,460
Later, one day, the clam princess saw

434
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,960
the dashing appearance of the invincible God of War.

435
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,490
God of War?

436
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,710
Was he as awesome as my dad?

437
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,530
Yeah. Just like your dad.

438
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,990
Brave, resolute, and loving everyone in the world.
