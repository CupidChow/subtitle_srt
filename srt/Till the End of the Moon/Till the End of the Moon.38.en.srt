<i>Another one to be sacrificed.</i>

26

The All-in-Distress Path.

30
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,810
What's that?

31
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,820
It's the All-in-Distress Path.

32
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,260
Tantai Jin has initiated the All-in-Distress Path.

33
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,330
<i>It's the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

34
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,210
<i>How come?</i>

35
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,090
<i>Look at the sky!</i>

36
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,470
<i>- What's that?
- I have no idea.</i>

37
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,980
<i>- What's that?
- I don't know.</i>

38
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,710
<i>- Look!
- What's that?</i>

39
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,281
Gosh! The All-in-Distress Path is opened.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,370
<i>The All-in-Distress Path. What to do?</i>

41
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,620
Since the All-in-Distress Path is opened, disciples of Chixiao Sect, stop the search

42
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,790
and return to the sect with me right away to build a protective barrier and preserve our powers.

43
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,950
Go.

44
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,120
- We need to hurry back and cast the Sect-Protection Array.
- Yes.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,901
- The All-in-Distress Path is opened.
- Nowhere is safe in the world now.

46
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,480
Exactly. You have somewhere to hide.

47
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,630
What about the others?

48
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,930
Dimian, stop!

49
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,850
Who else has a death wish?

50
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,170
<i>Dimian has been completely controlled by the Devil Lord.</i>

51
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,870
<i>He stopped at nothing to open the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

52
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,190
<i>I must first try to awaken Dimian.</i>

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,133
<i>Run quickly!</i>

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,270
<i>Hurry up!</i>

55
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,263
<i>Run quickly!</i>

56
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,693
Everyone, now, the Devil Lord has come back to life, and the All-in-Distress Path has been opened.

57
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,280
The Four Continents are doomed to be destroyed.

58
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Whether we fight or not, we'll die.

59
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,410
Will anyone here enter the Barren Abyss with me and fight the Devil Lord to the end?

60
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,530
I will go with you.

61
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,850
I will.

62
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,620
- I will too.
- We will.

63
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,900
I will fight the Devil Lord to the end.

64
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
I will also go with you.

65
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,900
Tantai Jin is cunning.

66
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,530
Now, he's become the Devil Lord.

67
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,900
He's extremely dangerous.

68
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,230
Once you find any traces of Tantai Jin, immediately write to your companions to request support.

69
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,820
We'll work together to kill him.

70
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,430
You must never act rashly or be fooled by him.

71
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,600
<i>Devil Lord, you failed to ruin my disciple.</i>

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,720
<i>Now, you're controlling Dimian to initiate the All-in-Distress Path by force.</i>

73
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,280
<i>I'll destroy your devil cave before you get any stronger!</i>

74
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,250
<i>Dimian, stop him!</i>

75
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,000
<i>Do you want to destroy the All-in-Distress Path?</i>

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,290
<i>I'll let you two perish together with it!</i>

77
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,720
<i>What happened? Just now, I was controlled by the Devil Lord.</i>

78
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,300
<i>The Devil Lord has disappeared.</i>

79
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,850
<i>And the demon energy backfired on me.</i>

80
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,500
The All-in-Distress Path is actually opened.

81
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
What I look for is right under my nose.

82
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,290
It's been 10,000 years.

83
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,820
At last, it's my turn!

84
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,050
I'll become the new Devil Lord.

85
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,900
<i>How come the power of the All-in-Distress Path is so weak?</i>

86
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,000
<i>The All-in-Distress Path opened by the Devil Lord 10,000 years ago wasn't like this.</i>

87
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,780
<i>Could it be that there is not enough resentment?</i>

88
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,670
<i>Resentment.</i>

89
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,670
<i>I need to collect more sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred.</i>

90
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,660
<i>Sure enough, without the Devil Lord connected to the All-in-Distress Path, it can't unleash its maximum power.</i>

91
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,460
<i>I see. This is how everything fits together according to fate.</i>

92
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,243
<i>Zhaoyou, you can't possibly escape!</i>

93
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:16,530
<i>Since the All-in-Distress Path is opened, no one can close it.</i>

94
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,030
<i>Once I collect enough resentment and hatred and continue to stimulate the All-in-Distress Path, </i>

95
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,890
<i>I'll rule the Four Continents and Three Realms!</i>

96
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,363
Mo Nv?

97
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,363
Mo Nv.

98
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,973
You… What are you doing here?

99
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
The Devil Lord has come back to life.

100
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,670
It's extremely dangerous here.

101
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,130
Leave quickly.

102
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
<i>I've finally found it.</i>

103
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,090
<i>This place should be the center of the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

104
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,020
<i>It is my destiny to stop the Devil Lord from being resurrected.</i>

105
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,710
<i>Now the All-in-Distress Path is opened.</i>

106
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,960
<i>No matter who the Devil Lord is, I must fight with him to the death.</i>

107
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,330
<i>Mother.</i>

108
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,263
<i>Dad.</i>

109
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:47,640
<i>Please protect me.</i>

110
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,040
Susu, I'm so happy you are here.

111
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,190
Thanks to you, my father, I did not lose my life.

112
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:37,533
Susu, whether you believe me or hate me, I had my bitter reasons.

113
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:43,110
Apart from sealing the evil bone, I have never deceived you or intended to harm your life.

114
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,500
Then I'll have to thank you.

115
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,270
Now, everything is well.

116
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,630
The All-in-Distress Path has started, and now, I own the power of the Devil Lord.

117
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,250
As long as enough sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred are offered to it,

118
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,460
I can become the one and only god in the world.

119
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,513
Susu, your father is the master of the world,

120
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,750
and you are my most beloved daughter.

121
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,770
That's exactly what I've been hoping for.

122
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,270
You are doing something silly.

123
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,340
I have done something sillier, which was trusting you.

124
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,630
Because of that, Dad died!

125
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,510
I am your real father! I gave you life!

126
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,120
Then I will give you my life back!

127
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,240
We shall perish together today!

128
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,670
You dared to attack your own biological father for an outsider.

129
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,603
Shut up!

130
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,060
Dad searched the Four Continents to find me.

131
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,940
He protected me when I was born, raised me to adulthood,

132
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,700
taught me to differentiate right from wrong,

133
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,520
and love all people.

134
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,760
His whole heart was devoted to me.

135
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,830
He risked his life to protect mine!

136
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,370
In this life and this world, I only have one father!

137
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,460
And you,

138
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,750
you are the enemy who killed my father!

139
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,260
You truly take after your mother.

140
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,990
Both of you are straightforward and stubborn.

141
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm sure she regretted her decision that she didn't kill you back then.

142
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,010
I have endured endless humiliation and suffering for the past 10,000 years.

143
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,290
And now, I finally succeeded.

144
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,000
Not only did you not congratulate me,

145
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,070
but you are also being rebellious.

146
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,700
I am sad

147
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,840
and disappointed.

148
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,723
Dimian,

149
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,570
you are so pathetic.

150
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,270
In that case,

151
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,150
I have no choice but to put you out of your misery.

152
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,280
Your sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred will be offered to the All-in-Distress Path.

153
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,320
This way, you have repaid me for the grace of your birth.

337
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:33,410
<i>and the Devil Lord.</i>

338
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,540
<i>All three of you live and die together.</i>

339
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,440
<i>I know it's unfair to you.</i>

340
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,950
<i>But this is the only chance to stop the Devil Lord from destroying the world.</i>

341
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,483
<i>Master, I understand.</i>

342
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,593
<i>Since this is the only path,</i>

343
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>I shall take it.</i>

344
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,750
<i>No matter what I'll turn into,</i>

345
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,340
<i>I will always be both Tantai Jin and Cang Jiumin.</i>

346
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,430
<i>Master!</i>

347
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,090
<i>Cang Jiumin! You beast!</i>

348
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,623
<i>That's right.</i>

349
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,600
<i>I ended him personally.</i>

350
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,783
<i>Now,</i>

351
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,100
<i>it's a battle between us.</i>

352
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,340
♫ <i>Tear open the wounds of the clouds and sky</i> ♫

353
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,053
<i>I will...</i>

354
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,550
<i>take everything away.</i>

355
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,410
♫ <i> Life or death is as common as a smile </i> ♫

356
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,170
♫ <i>Even if there's only a glimmer of hope</i> ♫

357
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,600
♫ <i>Even if there's only a beam of light</i> ♫

358
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,270
♫ <i>The long winds will never forget</i> ♫

359
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,900
<i>Mo Nv, what are you talking about? I don't get what you mean.</i>

360
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,900
<i>I was a devil originally. It's natural for me to travel across the world freely.</i>

361
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,880
<i>There's nothing strange about coming to the Devil Realm.</i>

362
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,100
<i>This can't be. How could it be?</i>

363
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,710
<i>- How could you be…
- Immortal Gongye,</i>

364
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,920
<i>let me tell you a story.</i>

365
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:26,470
<i>500 years ago, the Demon of Drought was sent to the Mortal Realm to undergo tribulations and restore her soul.</i>

366
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,030
<i>She became the eldest daughter of a state great general.</i>

367
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,370
<i>Her name was Ye Bingchang.</i>

368
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,160
<i>Then, she got married to</i>

369
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,970
<i>Prince Xuancheng, also known as Xiao Lin. They were in love.</i>

370
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,113
<i>Xiao Lin?</i>

371
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:48,650
<i>However, good times didn't last long.</i>

372
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>Ye Bingchang betrayed Xiao Lin and led him to his death.</i>

373
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,020
<i>Even so, Xiao Lin...</i>

374
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,520
<i>still loved her, tolerated her,</i>

375
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,540
<i>and protected her...</i>

376
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,070
<i>until his very last breath.</i>

377
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,690
<i>Ye Bingchang was remorseful about it until her death.</i>

378
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,980
<i>This regret is also engraved deeply in the heart of the Demon of Drought.</i>

379
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,770
<i>What happened after that?</i>

380
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,750
<i>After that, the Demon of Drought was awakened.</i>

381
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,550
<i>She was reluctant to part with the Mortal Realm.</i>

382
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,090
<i>So she returned to the mortal realm and set up an embroidery workshop.</i>

383
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,180
<i>However, fortune plays tricks on people.</i>

384
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,300
<i>She met a fool who looked exactly like Xiao Lin.</i>

385
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,570
<i>So she decided to deceive him just for fun. Am I right?</i>

386
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,330
<i>I thought I could make it up</i>

387
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,400
<i>to Xiao Lin by treating you nicely.</i>

388
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,780
<i>However, Gongye Jiwu, I have to thank you for letting me understand...</i>

389
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,720
<i>that Xiao Lin will never come back.</i>

390
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,280
<i>I used to hate it when people deceived me.</i>

391
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,990
<i>However, just now, I'd rather you deceive me.</i>

392
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,750
<i>I'd rather you deceive me for my entire life.</i>

393
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,360
<i>Why didn't you do so?</i>

394
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,610
<i>Gongye Jiwu, you resemble Xiao Lin too much.</i>

395
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>You're just like him.</i>

396
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,950
<i>You're a good person, just like him.</i>

397
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,400
<i>It's a shame that you will never be him.</i>

398
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,080
<i>I've tried every way.</i>

399
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,100
<i>I still can't shut down the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

400
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Now, the All-in-Distress Path is spreading day and night.

401
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,510
<i>I don't have much time left.</i>

402
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,480
<i>Tantai Jin, you need to figure out a solution soon.</i>

403
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,690
<i>In Enlightened Life, the Devil Lord removed the evil bone</i>

404
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,420
<i>with the help of the three devil artifacts and the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

405
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,430
<i>If I gather all three devil artifacts, I'll be able to imitate what he did</i>

406
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,940
<i>and remove the evil bone.</i>

407
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,950
<i>If everything goes well,</i>

408
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,350
<i>I can be killed, just like the Devil Lord back then.</i>

409
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,480
<i>Since the All-in-distress Path lives and dies with me,</i>

410
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,090
<i>it will be shut down together with my death.</i>

411
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,750
Thank you, Devil Lord. Thank you for avenging Siying.

412
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,850
Ye Bingchang?

413
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,100
I see.

414
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,000
Even after 500-year vicissitudes, in the end,

415
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,090
no one can escape from fate.

416
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,040
I thought losing Xiao Lin was just like losing my life.

417
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,120
In return, having a younger sister who truly loved me

418
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,980
was a blessing from heaven.

419
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,740
Who would've known that meeting her here would end up losing her again?

420
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,880
Why are you here?

421
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,600
The Devil Lord also saved my life 10,000 years ago.

422
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,150
Moreover, what Siying wanted the most was to follow the Devil Lord

423
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,850
and witness his return with her own eyes.

424
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,020
Now, she can't fulfill this wish.

425
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,130
As her elder sister, I'll witness this until the end on her behalf.

426
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:12,230
Tell me. How can we make you the ruler of the Three Realms, just like 10,000 years ago?

427
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,800
As far as I know, the three devil artifacts haven't been retrieved yet.

428
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,530
The God-Slaying Crossbow and the Bone-Refining Seal are possessed by the immortal sects.

429
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,110
However, this is my business.

430
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,510
There's no grudge between us now.

431
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,380
Mo Nv, you can live your own life

432
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,540
even without Xiao Lin and Siying.

433
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:43,990
Tantai Jin, you seem different from the Devil Lord I know.

434
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,820
The world is vast. I'm sure you'll find a place you like.

435
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,630
Qu Xuanzi is dead.

436
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,520
Zhaoyou is dead, too. This is great!

437
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,820
Now, only my seal is on the God-Slaying Crossbow.

438
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,020
If it's the heavens' plan to take my son's life and deliver the God-Slaying Crossbow to me,

439
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,730
how can I give this treasure to those children from Hengyang Sect?

440
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,620
I must put your power to good use.

441
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:50,480
From now on, I am the ruler of all immortal sects!

442
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,950
I'm returning the Devil Lord's eye to you.

443
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,230
Sect Leader Cen was murdered. The God-Slaying Crossbow was stolen.

444
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,990
Now all the sect leaders of the three major sects are dead.

445
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,160
Out of the three devil artifacts, only the Bone-Refining Seal remains in Hengyang Sect.

446
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,280
But who knows for how long we can keep it?

447
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,490
Tantai Jin really went too far.

448
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,300
Who exactly killed Sect Leader Cen?

449
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,850
According to disciples of the Chixiao Sect, it was done by a female demon in red.

450
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:59,890
She did resemble Siying, the Demon of Drought.

451
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,450
<i>You changed me completely.</i>

452
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,753
<i>You gave me a second chance in life.</i>

453
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:18,800
<i>Never again will I taint myself with the Devil Lord's power.</i>

454
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,630
<i>For you,</i>

455
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,240
<i>I'll make good on this promise.</i>

456
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,520
<i>Tantai Jin! What are you doing?</i>

457
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,930
<i>Tantai Jin has gone berserk! He killed Master Zhaoyou!</i>

458
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,930
<i>Now, everything you have done</i>

459
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,070
<i>is in vain.</i>

460
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,580
<i>Whatever my destiny is,</i>

461
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,690
<i>I will choose to be righteous or evil on my own.</i>

462
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,363
<i>I...</i>

463
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,060
<i>will never become the Devil Lord!</i>

464
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:57,000
<i>Only by getting rid of the Devil Lord can they feel at ease.</i>

465
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,200
<i>And only then</i>

466
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,940
<i>can I live with you in peace.</i>

467
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,463
Susu, come back with me.

468
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:51,510
It's no longer safe outside the sect ever since the All-in-Distress Path was opened.

469
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,920
Eldest Senior Brother, just leave me alone.

470
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,050
Now that I've left the sect, I'll be responsible for my own life.

471
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,730
What are you going to do?

472
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,050
Will you look for Tantai Jin?

473
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,130
What's the point of it now?

474
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,180
He killed his own master,

475
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,500
murdered the disciples of Chixiao Sect to snatch the crossbow.

476
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,610
He was probably in cahoots with Dimian.

477
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,930
He's a devil with his hands full of blood.

478
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,180
You're still not willing to believe it?

479
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,540
Li Susu, calm down.

480
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,040
You'll get yourself killed if you go there now!

481
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,850
Eldest Senior Brother, let go of me.

482
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,200
What if he had bitter reasons?

483
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,260
No matter what, I have to be there.

484
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,520
I must get an explanation from him.

485
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,900
If I have to live in the dark like this, I'd rather die.

486
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,160
At least I must know whom I should hate.

487
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,850
Fine. Since you're so determined,

488
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,600
I'll let you go.

489
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,080
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

490
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,760
<i>But from now on,</i>

491
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,020
<i>you will no longer be a disciple of Hengyang Sect.</i>

492
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,070
<i>And you will no longer be my junior sister.</i>

493
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,410
<i>I'm sorry, Eldest Senior Brother.</i>

494
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,820
<i>God-Slaying Crossbow?</i>

495
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,900
<i>Mo Nv still meddled in my affairs.</i>

496
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,583
<i>Never mind. I'll play my part as the Devil Lord.</i>

497
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,620
<i>This way, Susu can give up on me completely,</i>

498
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,340
<i>and the immortal sects will hunt me down without mercy.</i>

499
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,613
<i>Stop!</i>

500
00:46:08,613 --> 00:46:10,400
<i>Over there. After her!</i>

501
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,400
<i>Welcome back, My Lord!</i>

502
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,230
<i>Welcome back, My Lord!</i>

503
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,730
<i>Welcome back, My Lord!</i>

504
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,690
I've kept all of you waiting.

505
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,720
From today onward, I am your master.

506
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,790
I want chaos to the world and distress for ages.

507
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:57,250
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

508
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,460
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

509
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,240
<i>I've obtained the Sky-Slashing Sword and the God-Slaying Crossbow.</i>

510
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,660
<i>The Bone-Refining Seal is still in the hands of Hengyang Sect.</i>

511
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,550
<i>Distress for ages!</i>

512
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,650
<i>Once I gather the three devil artifacts together,</i>

513
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,150
<i>the All-in-Distress Path will be able to unleash its maximum power.</i>

514
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:25,800
I heard that they cast spells layer upon layer around the Bone-Refining Seal.

515
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,430
They wish to seriously injure me with the power of Heaven and Earth.

516
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,240
They can keep on dreaming.

517
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,060
<i>Kill them! Take the Bone-Refining Seal back!</i>

518
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,650
<i>Kill them! Take the Bone-Refining Seal back!</i>

519
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,030
I'm in a good mood today. There's no need to kill anyone.

520
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,600
Let me play a trick on them.

521
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,020
Bone-Refining Seal.

522
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,240
Cang Jiumin actually activated the array to summon the devil artifact.

523
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,650
Sect Leader, what should we do?

524
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,500
He has already retrieved two devil artifacts.

525
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,300
We can't afford to let him retrieve the last one.

526
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,020
Everyone, stand back!

527
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,880
<i>You are merely like ants. Stop wasting your energy.</i>

528
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,820
What's that sound?

529
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,110
It's the Devil Lord.

530
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,480
Tantai Jin!

531
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,900
How savage you are to take the Bone-Refining Seal without even showing up?

532
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,420
Gongye Jiwu, do you still intend to resist me?
<i>[The Way is High Above]</i>

533
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,740
<i>Take my advice. Bow to me.
[The Way is High Above]</i>

534
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,360
<i>Bow to absolute power.</i>

535
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,371
In your dreams!

536
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:23,060
<i>[The Way is High Above]</i>

537
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,030
- Eldest Senior Brother!
- Senior Brother!

538
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,210
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

539
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,380
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

540
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,980
<i>So, this is the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

541
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,400
<i>This feeling exceeds the limits of senses.</i>

542
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:47,620
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

543
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,290
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

544
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,270
<i>So, this is the power of the All-in-Distress Way.</i>

545
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,450
<i>Evil</i>

546
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,640
<i>Chaos to the world! Distress for ages!</i>

547
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,020
<i> [Till The End of The Moon]</i>

548
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:58,730
<i>[Black Moonlight - Zhang Bichen and Mao Buyi]</i>

549

♫ <i>Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon</i> ♫

550
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:14,200
