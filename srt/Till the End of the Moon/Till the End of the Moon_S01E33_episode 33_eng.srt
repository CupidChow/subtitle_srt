3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,400
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,340
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Is it bright and warm?   ♫

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,980
♫   I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:47,160
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,680
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,200
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,220
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,540
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,980
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,120
♫  My existence  ♫

♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,140
   

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,000
   

17
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,640
 I heard the surviving followers of the Devil Lord, 

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,260
 Siying and Jingmie, lost the demon fetus a while back at the Battle of the Barren Abyss. 

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,230
 That's why they wreaked havoc. 

20
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,870
 They're trying to find the fetus through the guidance of the devil artifacts. 

21
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,840
 It doesn't matter if she's Ye Xiwu or Li Susu,  

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,250
 the Devil Lord's threat will always be the biggest obstacle between her and me. 

23
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,610
 We can't start over until I find a way 

24
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,360
 to stop the return of the Devil Lord. 

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,490
 Right now, I know nothing about him. 

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,790
 How am I supposed to handle him? 

27
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,460
 Since he has put Siying and Jingmie in charge of reviving him,  

28
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,850
 they must have information about the demon fetus. 

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,460
 If I could break free from the Devil Lord's control  

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,120
 then I might stand a chance of stopping his return. 

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,820
   

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,560
 This is the Barren Abyss. 

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,260
 It looks exactly the same as it did in Enlightened Life. 

34
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,530
 If I want to learn about the Devil Lord,  

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,330
 the quickest way is to venture into the devil's lair 

36
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,630
 and find Siying and Jingmie. 

37
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,080
 This place is like a confusing maze. 

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,550
 How do I find them? 

39
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,760
Xiaoyao Swordplay.

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,873
Find them!

41
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,400
 Devil energy is dense in the air 

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,780
 where those two are. 

43
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,830
 If I use it as a guide, I'll surely be able to find them. 

44
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,430
 The devil energy here is thick. 

45
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,560
 It must be that way. 

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,680
 I shall pay them a visit. 

47
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,370
That geezer, Dimian, actually ran away.

48
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,260
How did he manage to break free from

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,700
His Lordship's Decamillennium Demonic Seal?

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,000
Wait!

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,860
Maybe he tampered with the charm that he gave us.

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,870
I knew this would happen. Why else would he agree to help us so easily?

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,260
If I ever see him again,

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,840
I will rip him to pieces.

55
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,603
What is that?

56
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,330
It has been 10,000 years.

57
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,300
Siying and Jingmie, do you two remember me?

58
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,520
It's our lord.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,930
During these ten thousand years, how has your mission progressed, Siying?

60
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,470
My apologies for my incompetence, My Lord. It took me 500 human years...

61
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,920
to pinpoint the location of your demon fetus.

62
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,500
He's now hiding in an immortal sect.

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,180
I need more time.

64
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,120
As soon as I awaken the evil bone within him, you'll be reborn, My Lord.

65
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,380
I've been trapped in the Barren Abyss for 10,000 years.

66
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,580
How are you so sure he still has the evil bone?

67
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,530
What if it's destroyed?

68
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,870
Can I still return?

69
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,390
I can assure you that the evil bone is indestructible, My Lord.

70
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,460
It carries your will.

71
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,530
It will remain indestructible as all lives across all the Three Realms remain alive

72
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,040
and suffering continues.

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,510
The evil bone is all that's left of me.

74
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,830
I can't control the demon fetus's mind with only that.

75
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,970
No one can resist the will of the evil bone.

76
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,240
Nor can one stop your return.

77
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,170
If he goes against me, what do you suggest I do then?

78
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,170
Regardless of whether he's willing or not,

79
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,580
the evil bone will make him suffer

80
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,390
and eventually sacrifice himself for the Devil Lord.

81
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,640
You seem very certain about it.

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,970
Rest assured, My Lord.

83
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,150
Except for you,

84
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,740
no one knows the flaw in your plan.

85
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,190
I knew it was you disguising yourself.

86
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,320
What would a demon fetus of 500 years of age

87
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,680
know about His Lordship's resurrection plan devised 10,000 years ago?

88
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,090
Is this how you talk to the Devil Lord?

89
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,550
You're just a mortal lucky enough to be chosen

90
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,510
as His Lordship's demon fetus.

91
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,770
You're not as important as you think you are.

92
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,950
We will collect all three devil artifacts and activate the All-in-Distress Path.

93
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,830
Whether you like it or not,

94
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,060
our real Devil Lord will be brought back to life.

95
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,580
However, if you stay here in the Barren Abyss, I'll play nice with you.

96
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,730
You are, after all, the demon fetus of His Lordship.

97
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,240
You should feel honored.

98
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,070
Honored?

99
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,150
You're wrong there.

100
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,660
I'm not your lord.

101
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,700
Not now and especially not in the future.

102
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,310
You don't get to come and go as you please!

103
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,770
He has joined an immortal sect and is determined to pursue what's good.

104
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,810
He won't listen to our words no matter what we say.

105
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
So are we supposed to just let him go that easily?

106
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,740
He is His Lordship's demon fetus, after all.

107
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,770
How can a wolf remain hidden amongst a herd of sheep?

108
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,143
Father.

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,500
Susu, you…

110
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,480
I was just roaming around, and I don't know how I ended up here.

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,290
Now that you're back, you should go and get some rest.

112
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,253
Father, come inside and have a cup of tea.

113
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,040
I'll go boil some water.

114
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,963
Lord of Monsters?

115
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,613
Dimian?

116
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,980
 What is he doing here? 

117
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,180
 Does he intend to hurt Susu? 

118
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,150
Are you the Devil Lord?

119
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,400
 No. The Devil Lord has not yet been resurrected. 

120
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,140
You're the demon fetus the Devil Lord left behind, aren't you?

121
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,900
It's pretty bold of you to show your face here.

122
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,650
Are you not afraid of the immortal sect disciples seeing you

123
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,150
and eliminating you?

124
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,170
 It seems like he doesn't know that I'm a member of the sect. 

125
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,510
 I guess he didn't come for me. 

126
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,900
 Is he after Susu then? 

127
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,450
You can stop pretending to be a man of virtue, Lord of Monsters.

128
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,220
If I hadn't known you were once the leader of the Demon Clan,

129
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,480
a loyal follower of the Devil Lord who massacred thousands of deities, one of which was Chuhuang,

130
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,750
I would have thought you were someone else.

131
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,650
Who are you?

132
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,860
 If he's just a demon fetus,  

133
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,500
 how could he know what happened ten thousand years ago? 

134
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,910
 I can't put Susu in danger. 

135
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,110
 I'll test and find out who he is. 

136
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,260
 The techniques he's using are from the immortal sect. 

137
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,050
 But he clearly is a demon fetus. 

138
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,900
 He should be able to do more than this. I'll try again. 

139
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,493
Father!

140
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,020
Susu, don't come over.

141
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,240
You don't know this.

142
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,603
- He is a… 
 - I know.

143
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,690
I know what you're thinking, Father,

144
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,240
but this man in front of us is Cang Jiumin,

145
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,860
a Xiaoyao Sect disciple, not someone else.

146
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm sorry that I can't tell you the reason why.

147
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,920
However, Father, please trust me.

148
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,503
Okay, Susu. Don't worry.

149
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,220
I won't hurt him today.

150
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,930
However, you also have to trust me.

151
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,170
This man's background is far more complicated than you can imagine.

152
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,150
You should stay away from him.

153
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,620
Don't be fooled by him.

154
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,570
I promise you.

155
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,660
As long as he doesn't hurt you, I won't touch him.

156
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,270
I'll also keep this a secret for you.

157
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,290
I see.

158
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,290
It turns out that Lord of Monsters is your biological father.

159
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,190
Only Dad and Uncle Zhaoyou know about this.

160
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,380
Just pretend as if you know nothing in front of others.

161
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,840
Don't blame him.

162
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,650
He is just someone who once degraded to a devil and has a blood feud with the Devil Lord

163
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,500
and had momentarily mistaken you for him.

164
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,350
After all, he's just a repented poor man who is lost and trying to make amends.

165
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,030
Ye Xiwu.

166
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,140
That isn't my name.

167
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,770
The person I know is named Ye Xiwu.

168
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,140
That's not me.

169
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,510
The person you know has never been me.

170
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,643
Tantai Jin, haven't you been lied to by me enough?

171
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,980
But I've never lied to you.

172
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,240
I've always been Tantai Jin and not what you dread that I'll become.

173
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,083
Ye Xiwu, every day

174
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:51,170
in the past 500 years, I've been carefully recalling every moment I was with you.

175
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,080
Besides, I've stayed in the immortal sect for a while now.

176
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,410
I roughly know what you're worried about.

177
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,060
I'm not the Devil Lord.

178
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,570
Whether you'll tell me the truth or not, I'll never turn into that.

179
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,950
I'll forever keep this a secret for you.

180
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,813
It's better for everyone not to know.

181
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,730
I'll also not breathe a word about Bone-Refining Seal.

182
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,360
There's one more thing.

183
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,780
Bone-Refining Seal isn't the first devil artifact I came into contact with.

184
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,030
There's also a devil crossbow.

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,450
 I told you I'd been looking for you in the Nether River for 500 years. 

186
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,440
 There, I discovered 

187
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,500
 and merged with the God-Slaying Crossbow by accident. 

188
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,620
 And that force delivered me out of the Nether River. 

189
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,080
 That's how my master found me. 

190
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't know how to take it out.

191
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,520
When I woke up, I was already in Xiaoyao Sect.

192
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,450
If you don't believe me, you can ask my master, Sect Leader Zhaoyou.

193
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,383
No need.

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,650
Have you recovered?

195
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,310
I just suffered some minor injuries when Bone-Refining Seal backfired.

196
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm fine now.

197
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,540
I mean,

198
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,490
the burns you got...

199
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,750
in the Nether River.

200
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,050
They were healed by my master.

201
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,213
Good.

202
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,450
You said Ye Xiwu is just a dream.

203
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,033
However,

204
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,450
in Shangqing God Realm,

205
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,000
I saw the Red Immortal Fruit tree that was cut down...

206
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,050
ten thousand years ago sprout again.

207
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,980
Dimian, the once Lord of Monsters, also has a chance to start afresh.

208
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,100
Do you think there's a chance for Cang Jiumin...

209
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,693
and Li Susu to start over again?

210
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,400
Junior Brother Jiumin, isn't it a good thing that we're in the same sect now?

211
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,250
Why do we have to go back to the past?

212
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,260
♫  Every pair of stars from the east and the west  ♫

213
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,700
♫  were lonely souls in the beginning  ♫

214
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,640
 I'm sorry, Tantai Jin. I can't say yes to you now. 

215
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,500
 Maybe I should leave you 

216
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,750
 and leave this place for a while 

217
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,730
 to take my mind off this 

218
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,280
 and avoid seeing you. 

219
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,490
 It'll be better for both of us. 

220
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,203
 Ye Xiwu, do you really believe in Dimian's words 

221
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,510
 that I'm the Devil Lord? 

222
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,840
♫  Don't ask about the right and wrongs  ♫

223
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,930
 I've been looking for you for 500 years. 

224
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,900
 I won't let go of the past easily. 

225
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,120
 Moreover, I can decide who I am 

226
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,050
 and who I'm going to be. 

227
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,790
 I'll prove to you that I'm not the Devil Lord. 

228
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,350
You broke into my life in the past.

229
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,313
From now on,

230
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,410
it's my turn to pester you.

231
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,110
You're often in a daze lately, Younger Sister. Is something bothering you?

232
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,480
You're right.

233
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,060
I'm concerned about a defiant demon fetus.

234
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,610
Isn't it the person

235
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,090
who fought against us on the Divine Platform a few days ago?

236
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,200
I know him.

237
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
He was my enemy when I went through my tribulations.

238
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,110
Then he really is the demon fetus Yiyue tribe lost 500 years ago.

239
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
He should have possessed the supreme power of the Devil Lord.

240
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,950
However, he's deceiving himself in the immortal sect.

241
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,310
This demon fetus keeps disobeying His Lordship.

242
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,440
Unexpectedly, he's your enemy.

243
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,590
This man is insidious, cunning, and full of schemes.

244
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,760
You must not trust him.

245
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,340
When I was facing tribulations in the mortal world, he made me suffer a lot.

246
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,120
It would be hard to achieve our goal by force.

247
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,110
Why don't you let me help you to make it work?

248
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,510
With your help, we'll surely be able to revive His Lordship.

249
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,640
Everyone is worried that the Devil Lord will resurrect.

250
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,100
If they find out the demon fetus is living among them...

251
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,810
Immortal sects will be thrown into chaos,

252
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,180
pushing the blame on each other.

253
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,250
And the demon fetus will have no place to stay

254
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,320
and only be able to return to Barren Abyss.

255
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,210
Brilliant.

256
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,290
This is his past.

257
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,640
We should be able to find his weakness there.

258
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,860
He's also there.

259
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,830
Who?

260
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,720
The man standing next to Cang Jiumin is from the Yiyue tribe.

261
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,820
He's working for Jingmie now.

262
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,110
Are you saying that Nian Baiyu is also in Barren Abyss?

263
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,743
That's right.

264
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,970
Let's do something nice then.

265
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,930
I'll do as you say, Sister.

266
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,380
Sect Leader Qu.

267
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,013
Master.

268
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,043
Your Majesty.

269
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,900
Nian Baiyu?

270
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,310
Jiumin, you know this devil cultivator?

271
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,743
Yes.

272
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:18,480
He was my attendant in the Jing Kingdom 500 years ago.

273
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,690
When we got separated, I hadn't turned to the devil path.

274
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,940
I went astray later on, and it had nothing to do with him.

275
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,060
In that case, you're turning from evil to good

276
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,020
and coming to Hengyang Sect to look for your old master?

277
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,313
Yes.

278
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,010
Nian Baiyu is loyal and kind.

279
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,480
I believe that becoming a devil isn't in his nature.

280
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,310
I hope you can give him a chance to start over

281
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,310
on account of our years of friendship.

282
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,933
Your Majesty.

283
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,683
Since you've interceded for him, well,

284
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll let you stay.

285
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,410
Thank you, Sect Leader Qu.

286
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,440
Thank you, Sect Leader.

287
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,113
Get up.

288
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,173
Your Majesty.

289
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,620
Get up quickly.

290
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,250
Your Majesty, I…

291
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,530
I'm no longer a king

292
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,000
or anyone's master.

293
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,423
Get up.

294
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,540
Baiyu, no matter what happened in the past, you can start

295
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,640
all over again now.

296
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,070
You don't have to stay by my side.

297
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,060
It's up to you whether you want to stay in Hengyang Sect

298
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,510
or go back to the Yiyue tribe.

299
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,060
I want to stay.

300
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,380
Good. It's not easy for us brothers to reunite with each other after centuries.

301
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,460
You should settle down first.

302
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,310
Why are you here?

303
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,033
Yue Ya.

304
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,380
Sect Leader told me to show a devil cultivator to his room.

305
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,930
I didn't expect it to be you.

306
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,360
Why did a disciple from Zixiu Isles become a devil cultivator?

307
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,550
Miss Yue Ya, sorry, I…

308
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,010
Sect Leader asked me to settle you in.

309
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,020
Don't worry. I will do my best to take good care of you.

310
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,160
Come with me, you liar.

311
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,200
This immortal is incredible.

312
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,933
Yes.

313
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,133
 Senior Brother, I don't want to deceive you. 

314
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:08,000
 There is no room for anyone else in my heart. 

315
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,693
 I understand now. 

316
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,710
Thank you for helping us fight off the monster.

317
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,800
Sister, look.

318
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,440
This is so pretty.

319
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,171
- This is for you. 
 - Let me have a look.

320
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:14,050
Mistress Mo Nv, opening a silk workshop is indeed a great idea.

321
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,160
Not only can we help Mistress Siying accomplish the task

322
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,200
but we can also attract some lecherous and arrogant disciples over

323
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,590
to suck their vitality.

324
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,440
No one will suspect us.

325
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,830
I've gone through cycles of reincarnation,

326
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,330
so I'm disillusioned with the world.

327
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,070
I've left Barren Abyss.

328
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,840
It's a charitable deed if I could find you a place to stay.

329
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
- Thank you, Mistress Mo Nv. 
 - Thank you, Mistress Mo Nv.

330
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,560
   

331
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,830
Someone from the immortal sect is here.

332
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,100
- The immortal sect? 
 - The immortal sect?

333
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,833
Is anyone there?

334
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,073
Is anyone there?

335
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,880
Sir, what brings you to my silk workshop?

336
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,143
 Bingchang, I liked you 

337
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:00,710
 not because of that strand of Love Threads, 

338
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,860
 but because of who you are. 

339
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,990
 Unfortunately, I never got the chance to tell you these things, 

340
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,210
 and our fate has come to an end. 

341
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,933
 Xiao Lin. 

342
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,340
Why are you not saying anything?

343
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,870
Turns out it's a handsome man.

344
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,750
Nothing unusual from the Devil-Detecting Lantern.

345
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,110
I'm Gongye Jiwu, a disciple of the Hengyang Sect on Mount Changze.

346
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,360
I was supposed to go to the capital of Jing Kingdom. I entered here by accident.

347
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,043
My apologies.

348
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:45,020
 It turns out that he has become an immortal sect disciple. 

349
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,940
 My last name is Mo. You can just call me Mo Nv. 

350
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,010
I'm the owner of this silk workshop.

351
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,030
They are all embroiderers.

352
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,540
Miss Mo, there's demonic energy around here.

353
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,200
I worry that there's a demon wandering around.

354
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,550
I don't know if you've run into it.

355
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,110
Sir, I heard there is a demon in the capital of Jing.

356
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,260
Could it have come here?

357
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,850
Don't panic. The Demon-Detecting Lantern in my hand didn't respond.

358
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,680
It shouldn't be somewhere near here.

359
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,730
This is an Exorcising Talisman. Demons are afraid of it.

360
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,800
Paste it on the door for protection.

361
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,110
I'll thank you on behalf of my girls.

362
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,630
By the way, are you going to the capital of Jing?

363
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,960
I can give you a ride in my carriage.

364
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,190
There's no need. It's too much trouble.

365
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,960
Not at all. Fate has brought us together.

366
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,140
I'm going to town to buy silk thread.

367
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,940
It's a little scary to travel alone.

368
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,730
Since it's in the same direction, we can go together.

369
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,550
Thank you, Miss.

370
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,580
Nian Baiyu, you should be memorizing mnemonics in the room.

371
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,720
What are you doing here?

372
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,010
I haven't seen Senior Brother Cang Jiumin all day.

373
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,940
I wonder what he's doing.

374
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,220
Cang Jiumin?

375
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,720
Little Martial Aunt said she wanted to take a trip to Jing Kingdom and clear her mind.

376
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,140
I guess Cang Jiumin has gone with her.

377
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,920
Why did they go to the Jing Kingdom?

378
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,100
Have you come to Hengyang Sect to be a spy?

379
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,410
Why are you asking so many questions?

380
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,040
Why are you so nervous?

381
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,070
I'm just joking. You're such a loggerhead.

382
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,800
His Majesty has gone to the Jing Kingdom.

383
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,310
 If the demon fetus is born, the Devil Lord is likely to come back to life. 

384
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,410
 Susu is naive and kind. 

385
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,320
 If I take chances, it may lead to a disaster. 

386
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,170
 I can't stand by and do nothing. 

387
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,420
 Jingmie's Devil-Sound Spell? 

388
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,510
What's the matter?

389
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,300
We've got news from Nian Baiyu.

390
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,380
The demon fetus has gone to the capital of Jing.

391
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,680
Surprisingly, he's a romantic type.

392
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,780
Since he cares so much about that girl, why don't we make good use of that?

393
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,680
Let's threaten him with that girl's life.

394
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,860
 This is strange. 

395
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,350
 This should be a bustling street. 

396
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,170
 Why is there no one here? 

397
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,200
   

398
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,683
Sir, wait.

399
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:03,000
Who are you? What are you doing here?

400
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,110
I'm passing by this place and want to spend a night here.

401
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,200
However, the inn is closed. I wonder what happened.

402
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,900
You'd better leave.

403
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,790
As night falls, a demon will run rampant.

404
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,110
It has been more than half a month.

405
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,540
Everyone is terrified, and no one dares to go out.

406
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,620
You should stay in another inn.

407
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,980
Why? Why can't I stay in your inn?

408
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,000
The demon targets solo travelers.

409
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
My inn is the only one on this street that hasn't been attacked.

410
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,350
However, it'll happen soon.

411
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,570
I'll be doomed if I don't close it.

412
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,110
This demon is so ferocious.

413
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,310
Why don't you get an exorcist to deal with it?

414
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,590
This demon is so powerful.

415
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,660
The feudal government has tried its best but still can't capture it.

416
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,300
Take my advice. Leave here at once to save your life.

417
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,500
Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal walks so slowly. I've waited for you for a long time.

418
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,770
It's the opposite direction.

419
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,100
Why do you always follow me?

420
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,170
I finally got a chance to go down the mountain to clear my mind.

421
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,270
Can we just walk in a different direction?

422
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,480
Finally, you speak to me.

423
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,280
I was just wondering why you suddenly became mute, as you were still normal

424
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,510
before you came down the mountain.

425
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,060
You shamelessly follow me around.

426
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,510
You're just like a hooligan.

427
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,940
You've wronged me, Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal.

428
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,240
I'm not following you.

429
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,270
Even after 500 years, the Water-splashing Festival of the capital of Jing is still held annually.

430
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,350
People from all over will join in the festivities.

431
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,330
I'm a native of the Jing Kingdom. Of course, I will be here.

432
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,980
If you ask me, it's you who is following me.

433
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,360
Tantai Jin!

434
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,261
You learned glib-tongued skills a lot when you were in Xiaoyao Sect, didn't you?

435
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:20,701
You didn't studiously cultivate there. Aren't you afraid of encountering the demon when going out?

436
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:22,110
It's fine.

437
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,660
You, Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal, are here.

438
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,880
You have great luck and can protect me.

439
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,840
I can't win against you. Enjoy yourself. I'm leaving.

440
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,050
 I wonder if Junior Sister is doing well. 

441
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,700
 I should go back after being away for so long. 

442
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,690
 The capital of Jing can be the last stop. 

443
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,300
 If I still can't forget Susu,  

444
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,760
 I'm going to tell Master about this. 

445
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,470
Are you in a hurry to get to the capital of Jing?

446
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,250
Why are you in a hurry? To slay the demon?

447
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,753
I'm going there to search for an answer,

448
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:18,020
but I shall slay the evil spirit when meeting one.

449
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,853
 Xiao Lin, I'm evil now. 

450
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:28,170
 I wonder what your reaction would be if you found out. 

451
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,610
I hear that Emperor Jing is offering a reward for the warlock who kills the demon.

452
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,220
The demon in the capital of Jing seems very vicious.

453
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,670
so you must take care.

454
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,370
See? There's a demon now that you have arrived.

455
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,300
It's not good to have you around, isn't it?

456
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,930
    
 Then you have to kill that evil quickly, Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal.

457
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,280
Don't lose your reputation.

458
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,060
It's you.

459
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,230
Shopkeeper, we want to stay here.

460
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,440
Do you have a death wish?

461
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,160
I came to kill that demon.

462
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,300
Miss, why don't you take my advice?

463
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,830
Don't worry. Just give me one room.

464
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,813
Shopkeeper, I'm going to stay here as well today.

465
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:19,180
Do you… Do you want one room or two rooms?

466
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,710
- One room, of course. 
 - Two rooms, of course.

467
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,450
Well…

468
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,243
This…

469
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:26,840
I came out in a rush, without any money.

470
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,800
Would you like for me to sleep on the street tonight?

471
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,270
It's fine. I have money.

472
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,820
Shopkeeper, give him a room.

473
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,320
The further away from mine, the better.

474
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,853
Sure.

475
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:43,110
How despicable.

476
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,893
Here you go.

477
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,610
Sir, you woke up so early.

478
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,060
Eldest Senior Brother, what are you doing here?

479
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,080
I was worried about you...

480
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,620
You guys... You guys came to the capital?

481
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,253
Yeah.

482
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,450
Eldest Senior Brother, I'm glad that you are here.

483
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,990
You are adept at evil slaying. Give us some advice.

484
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,543
Sure.

485
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,750
Why do you stare at me?

486
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,020
Because you're beautiful.

487
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,080
So based on the clues provided by the locals

488
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,020
and what we know now,

489
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,700
the demon can change appearances and read minds.

490
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,880
Also, when getting dark, they can also deceive divine artifacts.

491
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,090
So the general warlocks had to give up on her.

492
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,630
You have to know yourself as well as the enemy to take that risk.

493
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,980
I read a book called List of Demons with Pictures in Scripture Hall.

494
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,110
It says there's a demon called Yemei.

495
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,460
She can change her looks and loves consuming human brains.

496
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,290
She especially prefers those who have felt the sting of love being rejected.

497
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,010
She will take advantage of you if you are lovelorn.

498
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,400
I've also read the book that you mentioned.

499
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,940
It recommended a divine artifact which can be used to track down Yemei.

500
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,460
However, I can't recall the name

501
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,000
of the divine artifact now.

502
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,420
That's all right.

503
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,410
I can ask the birds and beasts to send a message to the sect.

504
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,530
Then Nian Baiyu can check it out for us in Scripture Hall

505
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,080
and send the divine artifact for us.

506
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,540
I remember it was on a bookshelf around here.

507
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,070
Look at that.

508
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,970
Isn't it the book they're looking for?

509
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,650
Yemei.

510
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,200
I found it. Yemei has a keen sense of smell.

511
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,180
She can smell the fear and love in one's heart.

512
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,850
She is sharp-nosed, so she fears strong smells.

513
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,300
We can pour spell water along the way to limit the area she can walk.

514
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,881
- You're so careless! 
 - I'm so sorry.

515
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:32,770
You can deploy the red silk from Lingting Kingdom

516
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,430
along the path she'll pass by.

517
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:42,680
 The red silk will stick to Yemei's body and can't be gotten rid of. 

518
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,830
 Then the tracker can follow it to find her. 

519
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,480
She prefers well-dressed young people who are alone.

520
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,730
And will become the one they are afraid of or love.

521
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,890
She lures people into the fantasy she creates,

522
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,390
consuming their brain at the peak of their fear.

523
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,600
The one they love?

524
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,700
Don't focus on the meaningless part.

525
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,810
The three of us will split up and wait in the streets where spell water isn't spilled.

526
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,310
 There's a three-way road with only one exit in the capital. 

527
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,560
 I will guard the exit. 

528
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,310
 - I can make sure she cannot escape.  
 - Good wine.

529
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,000
 That's a good idea. 

530
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,100
 At least one of us will be able to find Yemei. 

531
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,230
   

532
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,860
A good couple loves each other?

533
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,710
It's not as pleasant as this wine.

534
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,790
   

535
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:15,120
Heaven and gods above, bless us.

536
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,930
Please don't let anything go wrong.

537
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,850
That's the only property I've got.

538
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,460
Please don't ruin it all.

539
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,560
 Beauty, go to sleep now. 

540
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,080
 Tell me what you love 

541
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,640
 and what you fear. 

542
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,080
 Remember to stall the other two for a while. 

543
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,460
 I don't want them to spoil our plan. 

544
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,650
 Don't worry, Mistress Siying. I'll get right on it. 

545
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,960
What is this?

546
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,100
Why can't I get it off?

547
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,033
Miss, it's late at night.

548
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,410
Why are you here alone?

549
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,213
Miss?

550
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:10,940
What are you doing?

551
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,383
Wife, you are here.

552
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,653
What?

553
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:40,110
It hasn't been that long since we've last seen each other, but you already miss me?

554
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,620
Damn it!

555
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,730
    
    

556
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,160
 I wonder how the other two are faring? 

557
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,060
You're Yemei.

558
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,910
Wait. Don't kill me.

559
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,480
I won't kill you.

560
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,260
You will be handed over to King Jing.

561
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,580
He will judge your guilt.

562
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,203
 Senior Brother. 

563
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,870
 I have seen the girl you love. 

564
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,480
Do you want to know about her?

565
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,830
You grew up together.

566
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,050
It's you who took care of her and read and cultivated with her.

567
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,150
You've waited for her for ten years.

568
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:08,060
Even your master thinks you're a man worthy of his daughter.

569
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,820
You and your demonic words.

570
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,610
I love her, and this has nothing to do with anyone.

571
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,630
I don't care who she loves and who loves her.

572
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,163
Seize!

573
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,850
Gongye Jiwu, are you really not curious about it at all?

574
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,690
Cang Jiumin had married her,

575
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,240
slept with her.

576
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,580
Your sect sister who you love is married.

577
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,400
She doesn't love you. She loves someone else.

578
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,490
She's married to someone else.

579
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,170
She doesn't belong to you.

580
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,390
She doesn't belong to you!

581
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,270
Gongye Jiwu, you're lucky this time.

582
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,430
 How did this happen? 

583
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,680
 It's you. 

584
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,940
 There are signs of a fight here. 

585
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,570
 This is bad. Susu. 

586
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:04,580
Mistress Siying, I underestimated the power of the demon fetus.

587
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,680
Also, Mistress Mo Nv suddenly…

588
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,900
You are such a disappointment to me.

589
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,320
You can't handle the demon fetus.

590
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,020
You can't even control Gongye Jiwu.

591
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,030
Get up.

592
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:23,330
Listen. Our target today is the demon fetus.

593
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,360
Nothing else matters.

594
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,140
I need you...

595
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,070
to go back to his immortal sect lover's dream and see what his weakness is.

596
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,740
 It's the Water-splashing Festival. 

597
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,550
 What place is this? 

598
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,300
 Why are we here? 

599
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,990
 You brought me here. 

600
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,070
 Look. How lively it is. 

601
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,110
 Me? 

602
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,420
 Bravo! 

603
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,000
 Why are they wearing masks? 

604
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,320
So today is the Water-splashing Festival.

605
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,780
 Where is he? 

606
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,440
 Tantai Jin? 

607
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,390
 It's… 

608
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,850
 me. 

609
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,280
This is the irresistible weakness of the demon fetus.

610
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,840
Just convince the demon fetus to believe

611
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,980
that Devil Lord is his inescapable destiny.

612
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,880
Mistress Siying, you will get what you want

613
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,570
and control the demon fetus as you wish.

614
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,890
Finally something interesting.

615
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,110
 Go and give a big present to the demon fetus. 

616
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,760
 How could I be here? 

617
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,020
 This is Barren Abyss. 

618
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,270
 Why am I back here again? 

619
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,560
 Devil Lord, it's you again. 

620
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,830
What do you want to do by bringing me here?

621
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,410
 What do I want? 

622
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,380
 I want to ask you. 

623
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,390
 Born as a demon fetus, 

624
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,630
 yet you think you are the God of War, Mingye. 

625
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,850
 Keep my look in mind. 

626
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,800
 This is the only look you'll ever be in the future. 

627
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,343
You're wrong!

628
00:48:35,343 --> 00:48:37,980
I used to be a demon fetus.

629
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,100
But now, I'm Cang Jiumin, a disciple of the immortal sect.

630
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,430
 If you didn't mention it, 

631
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,610
 I would have forgotten about that. 

632
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,440
Will your fellow disciples

633
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,640
accept you in the immortal sect?

634
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,630
What does this have anything to do with you?

635
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,900
How stupid.

636
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,870
You are clearly a wolf wanting to wear sheep's clothing and

637
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,830
hide among the sheep herd.

638
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,430
Are you joining the immortal sect because of her?

639
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,750
Look. There she is.

640
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,910
 Tantai Jin. 

641
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,180
 It's all over. 

642
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,100
 You can take off your mask now. 

643
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,490
 You didn't expect it, right? 

644
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,440
 It's me. 

645
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,770
 Tantai Jin. 

646
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,180
- All-in-Distress Path lasts forever. 
 - All-in-Distress Path lasts forever.

647
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,050
 Do you think by tricking my affection,  

648
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,380
 you can save the lives of the Three Realms? 

649
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,480
 How ridiculous. 

650
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,080
 Have you seen it? 

651
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,690
 Remember the face that scares you. 

652
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,870
 That's who I am. 

653
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,080
 No, this isn't real. 

654
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,930
 This is a dream created by the Devil Lord. 

655
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,020
Tantai Jin, you can only be me.

656
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,380
 Susu is in danger. I have to go to save her. 

657
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,100
 It turns out... 

658
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,290
 that you...  

659
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,530
 always... 

660
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,400
 fear me. 

661
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,953
Jingmie, why are you hiding here for?

662
00:53:44,953 --> 00:53:46,981
Did you get ready for the thing I asked you to do?

663
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:48,370
I walked around just now.

664
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,180
It's a lively place here during the Water-splashing Festival.

665
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,660
It's a pity to ruin it.

666
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,140
A pity?

667
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,270
The festival means a lot to the demon fetus.

668
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,460
Only this place can make him realize who he is.

669
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,950
Yes, you're right.

670
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,560
What's this?

671
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,380
This one is me.

672
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,580
The other one is you.

673
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,020
Legend has it that by burning the doll of us together,

674
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,240
evil spirits and disasters can be warded off.

675
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,880
Isn't the earthly custom interesting?

676
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,170
Don't tell me you've developed unnecessary emotions like those mortals.

677
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:24,650
Remember. Our only task is about the demon fetus.

678
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,070
 After 500 years, the Water-splashing Festival looks as lively as ever. 

679
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,560
Don't worry. The nightmare is over.

680
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,360
The Devil Lord won't appear at the festival.

681
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,360
The demon yesterday…

682
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,890
So I'm still the one you're most afraid of.

683
00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:00,023
No. I believe what you say.

684
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:01,830
You're not him.

685
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,110
You will never become that awful look.

686
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,690
How do you know for sure that it wasn't me?

687
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,900
You would never hurt me.

688
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,010
You wouldn't do it before and it's even less likely now.

689
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,910
You used to be Tantai Jin.

690
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:21,060
Now you are Cang Jiumin, the most kindhearted disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

691
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,110
You are not him.

692
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,970
Nor will you become him.

693
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,330
I believe in you.

694
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,873
I know now.

695
00:55:32,873 --> 00:55:34,830
What?

696
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,720
I've seen the appearance of the Devil Lord...

697
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,750
the demon made before.

698
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,680
That was the one you showed me from your memory

699
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,650
when it was over the gate tower and in the thunder of the suffering.

♫   My regrets   ♫

701

704
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,080
He's the Devil Lord.

705
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,240
So you know?

706
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:34,040
Have you known since you arrived at the Xiaoyao Sect?

707
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,590
♫   How did you get so far away?   ♫

708
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,623
Yes.

709
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,510
Ever since I joined the immortal sect, I've always heard

710
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,280
everyone talking about and discussing the Devil Lord.

711
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:54,843
I'm worried the one they talk about,

712
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:58,440
the one in their prophecy, is all me.

713
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,273
I'm afraid.

714
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,860
I'm afraid of being exposed one day.

715
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,810
I fear they will discover...

716
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,850
that I'm the demon fetus that everyone

717
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:15,510
in the immortal sect wants to eradicate so badly.
