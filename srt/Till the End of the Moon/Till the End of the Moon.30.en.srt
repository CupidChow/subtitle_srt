<i>Now in the three realms, the immortal sects are the leader,</i>

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,020
<i>the mortal realm comes second, and us, the devils and demons come last.
[Barren Abyss]</i>

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,030
<i>This is because the Devil Lord was killed 10,000 years ago.</i>

19
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,110
<i>It caused us dragons in the demon realm to lose our leader.</i>

20
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,900
- Why are there more and more demons?
- Barren Abyss is too big.

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,320
We are shorthanded. We need help in the north!

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,470
In the south… A big swarm of demons rushed out in the south.
<i>[Zhaoyou, Leader of the Xiaoyao Sect]</i>

What should we do? Master Zhaoyou?

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,760
Master Zhaoyou? The runes in the east have been installed.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,610
Don't panic. Sects in the east front, go help your left and right flanks.

26
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,790
Move the front to the north. The runes here have been set up.

27
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,620
<i>Yes!</i>

28
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,040
Come on.

29
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,410
Our goal is to deploy the Golden Vigilant Bells. Don't get distracted by the demons.

30
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,140
Hang on a little longer. We have almost finished deploying the Golden Vigilant Bells!

31
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,180
<i>Victory is at hand in the Barren Abyss.</i>

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,410
<i>A'Qu, I wonder how the battle has been going on your side?</i>

<i>[Demon-sealing Cliff, Hengyang Sect]</i>

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,590
Oh no. They're getting away.

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,610
It's Master's sword! Master is here!

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,680
Master!
<i>[Qu Xuanzi, Leader of the Hengyang Sect]</i>

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,410
- Reinforce the seal with me.
- Yes!

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,630
Master, why are these demons going on a rampage at the same time?

39
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,810
All demons of the four continents went crazy at the same time. They must be agitated by something.

40
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,300
<i>We're just living by our nature.</i>

41
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,550
<i>But they've been killing us like we're rats crossing the streets.</i>

42
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,990
<i>They've sealed us in this dark place for hundreds of years.</i>

43
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,880
Can you willingly accept this?

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,870
<i>- No!
- No!</i>

45
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,830
As long as we retrieve the demon fetus and revive His Highness,

46
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,000
we'll be able to revitalize Barren Abyss!

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,170
Although the Yiyue Tribe had lost the demon fetus, we have had to search for it for 500 years without results.

48
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,760
Thankfully, His Highness had planned beforehand.

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,010
He had left us with three Demonic Artifacts to guide us to find the demon fetus.

50
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:36,230
Our real target today is actually this minor little immortal sect called Yunchang Sect.

51
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,060
The clues of the Bone-Refining Seal,

52
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,420
the heart of the Devil Lord, are there.

53
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,900
The demon fetus and the demonic artifact interact with each other.

54
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,080
As long as we can find the Bone-Refining Seal, it'll definitely lead us to the demon fetus.

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,360
Reviving His Highness will only be a matter of time!

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,640
<i>Revive His Highness! Revive the Devil Lord!</i>

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,130
Master, fearing we'd distract you earlier, we dare not tell you that something unusual happened on Heaven Lake.

58
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,750
What?

59

- Tantai Jin, you won't die.</i>

80

Yes. You've finally survived your tribulation.

82
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
- My tribulation?
- Yes.

83
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,620
Somehow your lightning punishment didn't strike down.

84
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,030
But you've safely passed this tribulation in your life.

85
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,790
<i>Didn't the lightning punishment already strike?</i>

86
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,790
Dad, I wasn't talking about the lightning punishment.

87
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,510
You and Uncle Zhaoyou used the Mirror of the Past…

88
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,060
Mirror of the Past? That's the ultimate treasure of the Xiaoyao Sect.

89
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,720
When did we ever use it?

90
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,520
<i>This makes sense. I've successfully cut off the destined arrival of the Devil Lord.</i>

91
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,890
<i>They may not remember sending me back 500 years ago with the Mirror of the Past.</i>

92
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,930
Susu, have you confused things after ten years of retreat?

93
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,660
Ten years?

94
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,130
You really don't remember? Ten years ago, your body suddenly caught on fire by itself.

95
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,470
You dropped into a deep sleep and didn't wake up until today.

96
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,000
So there's no Devil Lord in this world?

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,420
There's no All-in-Distress Path? There's no world-wide catastrophe?

98
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,250
- Right?
- Right.

99
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,940
That's great. That's right.

100
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,300
It's so good to see you safe and sound.

101
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,190
<i>Xiao Lin?</i>

102
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,550
I've been hoping that you would wake up.

103
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,650
<i>No. Now that I'm back, I should call him Senior Brother Gongye.</i>

104
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,070
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

105
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,990
Susu. Jiwu. Let's go. Let's go home.

106
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,720
<i>That's right. She made it!</i>

107
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,860
<i>Susu, why do you treat me like a stranger now?</i>

108
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,070
Old Qu, Susu is out of her meditation retreat.

109
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,370
You can finally be rest assured after worrying for her for ten years.

110
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,090
Something doesn't seem right about her.

111
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,390
Her cultivation level actually dropped. I wonder what exactly happened?

112
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,440
When you're free, please tell her fortune for me.

113
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,720
By the way, how're things going at the Barren Abyss?

114
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,750
I'm here for this.

115
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,740
The Golden Vigilant Bells have all been deployed. Those demons won't be able to cause trouble for now.

116
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,300
But then again, this time, I didn't see the two devils, Siying and Jingmie.

117
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,170
I can't help but feel unsettled.

118
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,650
Their whereabouts have been quite unpredictable lately.

119
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,030
I wonder if they have some other plans. We must be careful.

120
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,320
I almost forgot. The letter from my younger sect brother.

121
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Zhao'en?

122
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,900
Didn't he go to Yunchang Sect?

123
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,920
Luckily, he survived because he was a half-day late.

124
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,680
I suspect that this is exactly why the two devils didn't show up.

125
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,940
This is a serious matter. It's best if we gather all sects to discuss.

126
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,100
But I heard Leader Cen of Chixiao Sect is still traveling.

127
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,300
When is he going to be back?

128
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,000
Leader Cen is most keen on killing demons. He'll return as soon as he gets the message.

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,320
Old Qu, there's another thing I want to ask you today.

130
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,170
Immortal Buxu told me to go to the bank of Ruo Water, saying that there was an abnormal sign in the southeast.

131
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,370
He particularly said that I must go personally.

132
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,730
I went there as he asked and I found a person there!

133
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,540
Could you tell me? Is this a fortune or a misfortune?

134
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,440
This isn't the Nether River.

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,320
Where is this place?

136
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,400
This is…

137
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,130
<i>That's right. I sank into the depth of the Nether River.</i>

138
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,100
<i>Then, it appeared.</i>

139
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,310
<i>I've seen that black crossbow in Enlightened Life.</i>

140
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,240
Friend, are you okay?

141
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,900
Come on, get up.

142
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you all right?

143
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,740
When did you wake up? Why didn't you call us?

144
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,790
Why am I here?

145
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,390
My master found you and brought you back.

146
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,320
My master is the leader of the Xiaoyao Sect.

147
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,780
He's the famous Immortal Zhaoyou in the immortal realm.

148
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,120
You are just so lucky.

149
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,430
<i>I conjured heavenly rain.</i>

150
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,480
<i>With the protection of my Heart-guarding Scale, it won't be long</i>

151
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,960
<i>before this place has abundant spiritual energy.</i>

152
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Surrounded by mountains, there is no light in the valley.

153
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,560
Let's call it Mount Buzhao.

154
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,730
<i>This is Mount Buzhao left by Mingye.</i>

155
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,120
Son, you're awake.

156
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,620
Aren't you going to say thanks to your savior?

157
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,550
<i>It's him.</i>

158
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>It seems that Ye Xiwu could've been alive at this time.</i>

159
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,250
<i>But because of me…</i>

160
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,350
Thanks for saving me.

161
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,910
I still have something important to do. I'll take my leave.

162
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,110
Don't be in a hurry to leave just yet.

163
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,640
You're in such a hurry.

164
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,790
Are you returning to the Nether River?

165
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,900
Do you know the gate to the Ruo Water

166
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,940
only opens every five hundred years?

167
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,700
Even if you made it to the bank of the Ruo River,

168
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,450
how are you going to open the gate of Ruo River?

169
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,490
I can't stay.

170
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,100
I have to find her.

171
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,680
Are you trying to retrieve her primordial spirit?

172
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,890
The dead can't come back to life.

173
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,050
She's already dead. What's the point of retrieving it anyway?

174
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,540
You're such a stubborn one.

175
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,580
Sect Great Uncle Buxu sent me a message to save someone by the Ruo River.

176
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,770
I thought I could find a treasure.

177
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,140
Instead, I found someone as costly as you!

178
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,410
Do you know how many

179
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,140
valuable drugs and treasures from Xiaoyao Sect I've spent in order to save you?

180
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,670
I've tried hard to get your life back, but do you just want to walk away like this?

181
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,760
Then what do you want?

182
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,650
If I cannot find her,

183
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,040
whether alive or dead, it makes no difference to me.

184
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,970
Forget it. I'll take it as a bad bargain.

185
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,510
I like to finish it once I start it.

186
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,920
If you really want to kill yourself,

187
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,540
wait till you leave our sect property, understand?

188
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,760
Master, are you really letting him go like this?

189
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,610
Rest assured. He can't leave this place.

190
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,960
He'll be back sooner or later.

191
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,570
<i>Bravo!</i>

192
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,910
<i>This should be the immortal sect that Ye Xiwu mentioned before.</i>

193
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,250
<i>The gate of Ruo River has closed.</i>

194
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,110
<i>I have to wait 500 years for it to open again.</i>

195
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,050
<i>It's easy to leave this place.</i>

196
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,310
<i>But where shall I go to find Ye Xiwu?</i>

197
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,930
Senior Brother.

198
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,290
You have allowed me to win. I'll challenge you again.

199
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,130
I'll defeat you and your Zhuokun Sword someday.

200
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,180
Let's go.

201
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,500
<i>Let's go.</i>

202
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,370
<i>Let's go.</i>

203
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,580
Prince Tantai left his home country to be a guest in our kingdom. He did it for the peace of the two kingdoms.

204
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,340
We should treat him politely. How can you bully him without any scruples?

205
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,830
Back when we were in the palace of Sheng, I was a prince and you were a hostage.

206
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,760
Our paths were nothing alike.

207
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,210
Who would've expected us to be at war with each other and become each other's archenemy in just a year?

208
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,990
I want you to pull your troops back and stop the war.

209
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,170
Now, the boundary of life and death

210
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,240
should be the thing that sets us apart.

211
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,530
Brother Tantai, I know you don't wish to see me dead.

212
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,490
But death is my only way out.

213
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,070
Thank you for granting my wish.

214
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,720
Xiao Lin?

215
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,680
Xiao Lin.

216
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,000
You look new here. Are you a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect?

217
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,050
How may I address you?

218
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,900
Why are you here?

219
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Me?

220
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm afraid you mistook me for someone else.

221
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,380
I am Gongye Jiwu. Eldest disciple of the Leader of the Hengyang Sect.

222
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,780
Gongye Jiwu?

223
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,490
I see.

224
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,530
Since you're unfamiliar with this place, let me walk you out further.

225
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,040
To be honest,

226
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,510
you look very much like one of my old friends from many years ago.

227
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,030
I wonder where you come from?

228
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,930
Maybe you two are related somehow.

229
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,480
I was…

230
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
adopted by Immortal Buxu.

231
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,380
I know nothing of my origin, either.

232
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,130
<i>It's this Immortal Buxu again.</i>

233
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,700
May I see this Immortal Buxu?

234
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,340
He sent out a message to save my life. I'd like to thank him in person.

235
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,580
This is the place.

236
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,180
Since Immortal Buxu passed away, he's been hiding in this golden flower.

237
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,600
Could you tell me how he died?

238
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,800
It's said that he had traveled through

239
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,510
the mortal realm and had seen every emotion.

240
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,950
He saw through the law of karma but couldn't achieve immortality.

241
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,500
Till the year when he was ninety,

242
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,170
a new casino was opened down the mountain.

243
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:12,040
He went there and won a big fortune. When he came back unsteadily with his cane,

244
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,430
he got too excited and fell.

245
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,880
Then he died seven days later.

246
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,740
Then how should I thank him in person?

247
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,540
I just need to summon him with my spell. Like this.

248
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,000
<i>Pang Yizhi?</i>

249
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,810
I've come this time to exchange something with Your Majesty.

250
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,350
I want a bottle of your heart blood.

251
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,510
Pang Yizhi, what do you want the blood for?

252
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,400
It has nothing to do with you, Your Majesty.

253
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,180
Is this his soul or an illusion?

254
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,600
Neither.

255
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,900
It's an interesting spell called Cloud.

256
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,870
Immortal Buxu created it.

257
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,210
He said that physical bodies will perish, but consciousness lasts forever.

258
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,820
That's why he cast this spell before he died to preserve his consciousness.

259
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,750
Brother Gongye, I have some questions to ask Immortal Buxu.

260
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,880
Would you leave us alone for a moment?

261
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,260
You may go ahead. I happen to have other things to do.

262
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,070
I'll take my leave.

263
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,920
Immortal Buxu.

264
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,920
Pang Yizhi.

265
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,120
Do you know where Ye Xiwu's soul is? How can I find her?

266
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
<i>If you want to tell your fortune, you need to use a spell from my sect.</i>

267
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,780
Pang Yizhi! Pang Yizhi!

268
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,990
<i>What are the secrets of this immortal sect?</i>

269
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,540
<i>The long-dead Xiao Lin actually stands here alive.</i>

270
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,030
<i>Why would Pang Yizhi tell Zhaoyou to save me?</i>

271
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,840
Son, weren't you in a hurry to leave?

272
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,180
Why are you still here now?

273
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,080
Is it because Xiaoyao Sect is too big and you got lost?

274
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,350
Do you need me to walk you out personally?

275
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,640
I heard that your sect has the Cloud spell. I'm here for a divination.

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,100
Do you need help from Immortal Buxu's Cloud?

277
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,440
But if you want him to answer your question, you must enter our sect first.

278
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,880
Only after you've learned our way can you summon him with your divine energy.

279
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,140
<i>Since Xiao Lin is here, could Ye Xiwu also be…</i>

280
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,650
<i>I need to stay to get to the bottom of it.</i>

281
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,680
Please enlighten me, Sect Leader.

282
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,670
Although you've kneeled to me, I didn't agree to take you in.

283
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,910
It's not so easy to join the Xiaoyao Sect.

284
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,940
How about this? Get up.

285
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,310
How about you go do something for me?

286
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,750
If you can complete it, you no longer owe me any drugs or treasure I spent on you.

287
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,340
What do you say?

288
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,680
As for accepting you as my disciple…

289
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,300
Come, my sword!

290
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,620
This sword is called South Branch. Forged by my master when he was still alive.

291
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,700
It was transformed from plum blossoms. It has the heart of spring and the soul of the frost. It carries no intention of killing.

292
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,560
If you see the world with this kindness, you'll break an obsession and see true freedom.

293
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,730
I'll give it to you as a witness.

294
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,450
When you can awaken it, you can comprehend the meaning of it.

295
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,250
Only then can you learn the immortal arts to cultivate yourself.

296
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,310
<i>Susu, you've been in a retreat for 10 years. Your fatal tribulation has passed.</i>

297
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,140
<i>Don't overthink anything. Just get some good rest.</i>

298
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,430
<i>I've extracted the evil bone from Tantai Jin. Destiny has been altered.</i>

299
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,630
<i>There will no longer be a Devil Lord.</i>

300
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,200
<i>But what if this is merely a tribulation?</i>

301
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,810
<i>Tantai Jin, are you really just a dream of mine?</i>

302
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,510
<i>When the dream ends, everything will disappear.</i>

303
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,440
Who's there? Come out.

304
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,170
- Junior Aunt.
- Who are you?

305
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,480
I… I'm not a bad person.

306
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,490
I'm also a disciple of the Hengyang Sect.

307
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,050
So, you're a disciple of Senior Sister Yao Wei?

308
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,580
You've never seen me before?

309
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,320
Since I was admitted into the sect, I'd heard that the Hengyang Sect had a Little Martial Aunt with a pure-spirit body.

310
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,030
But you were in a meditation retreat all along. I could only see that thundercloud.

311
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,760
I was so curious.

312
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,400
But when I saw you just now, I didn't know why, you looked so familiar to me.

313
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,390
Niece, what's your name?

314
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,400
My name is Yue Ya.

315
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,110
Little Martial Aunt can just call me Yue Ya, or Little Crescent.

316
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,260
Your name is Yue Ya?

317
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,990
Yeah, Little Martial Aunt. What's the matter?

318
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,290
<i>My name is Yue Fuya. Sister, you saved me. Right?</i>

319
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,240
Your original name is Yue Fuya. You're from the Yiyue Tribe.

320
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,670
Yue Ya is your new name. Am I right?

321
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,240
You're so awesome. How can you tell everything?

322
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,100
Fuya, why would you come to Hengyang Sect?

323
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,790
A sister once saved me and left a letter to my adoptive parents.

324
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,520
She told them to come here if they needed help. Later, when I was 15 or so, I was sick.

325
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,180
No doctor could treat me.

326
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,400
When I was about to die, my parents sent me here as the letter said.

327
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,990
Fuya, come here.

328
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,310
Fuya, do you still remember the look of your savior sister?

329
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,930
Savior sister?

330
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>From now on, your name is Yue Ya.</i>

331
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,760
<i>The name, Yue Fuya, must be kept unknown. Do you understand?</i>

332
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,860
I hope we will see each other again.

333
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,450
Are you the savior sister?

334
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,590
Savior Sister.

335
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,550
<i>All of this was not a dream.</i>

336
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,330
<i>Some people can still reunite after coming full circle.</i>

337
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,910
Savior Sister.

338
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,780
<i>Someone is etched in my memory, </i>

339
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,080
<i>yet I'll never see him again.</i>

340
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,200
<i>Here it is.</i>

341
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,700
<i>In a village ten miles east of Mount Buzhao, there's a blind old woman.</i>

342
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,920
- Zhi'er.
<i>- She has been waiting for someone at the village gate</i>

343
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,960
<i>for the past fifteen years from day to night, rain or shine.</i>

344
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,850
Mom, Zhi'er is back home.

345
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,510
Zhi'er, did I hear that right?

346
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,540
Zhi'er, is that you?

347
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,530
Zhi'er, you've come back!

348
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,140
<i>The old woman just has seven days to live.</i>

349
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,270
- My Zhi'er.
<i>- She's a kind-hearted woman.</i>

350
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,020
<i>The Immortal Sect wants to fulfill her wish.</i>

351
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,150
<i>Unfortunately, her son is dead.</i>

352
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,370
Yes, Mom. I'm back.

353
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,140
Zhi'er, get some good rest. I'll cook for you.

354
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,900
Be careful, Mom.

355
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,780
<i>Pang Yizhi may know something. I have to stay at Xiaoyao Sect.</i>

356
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,070
<i>No matter where you are, no matter how much time it takes,</i>

357
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,140
<i>I will find you. Ye Xiwu.</i>

358
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,880
Little Martial Aunt. Let's go.

359
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,380
Do you want to eat?

360
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,690
Little Martial Aunt, do you know? In the past 500 years, the Capital of Jing has changed a lot.

361
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,680
Why don't we often go down the mount to relax?

362
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,080
Look! There's a storyteller.

363
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,130
A thousand years ago, the Jing and the Sheng were one country.

364
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,180
Then it was separated into two by the river, and had been fighting.

365
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,980
An emperor showed up and reunited the two countries,

366
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,470
so that the prosperious age started.

367
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:20,320
- As to what happened thereafter, please come here next time.
- Let's go.
- All right.

368
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,970
Excuse me, sir.

369
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,800
<i>[On The Past And Present]</i>

370
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,140
If you're not in a hurry, please stay longer to tell me another story.

371
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,620
What story do you want?

372
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,390
Tell me about Tantai Jin of Jing Kingdom, 500 years ago.

373
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,860
Okay. Please sit down.

374
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,640
Little Martial Aunt, who's Tantai Jin?

375
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,680
He was...

376
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,590
the king of the Jing Kingdom.

377
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:55,750
Five centuries ago, the Jing was a weak country and many people lived in poverty.

378
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:01,260
Since Tantai Jin succeeded to the throne, he turned the tide,

379
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,280
made great achievements, and created peace for centuries.

380
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,340
But tonight, I won't tell you his well-known stories,

381
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,680
but an unknown story.

382
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,620
It is said King Tantai Jin had a beloved woman.

383
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,810
There is no word about the woman left in the history book.

384
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,630
Even her name is unknown.

385
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,020
She was not even given a title,

386
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,770
but received special favor from the king.

387
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:35,480
It's said after King Tantai Jin passed away,

388
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,340
he was buried with his beloved woman at Tantai Mausoleums.

389
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,410
In the next 500 years, the royal Tantai family has a lot of descendants

390
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,140
and wise kings.

391
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,290
<i>He had let go of the past and moved forward.</i>

392
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,040
<i>It's true.</i>

393
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,810
<i>When we were together,</i>

394
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,300
<i>we enjoyed happiness but also bore hatred.</i>

395
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,500
<i>I was just an ephemeral mote in his life</i>

396
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,910
<i>of being a king.</i>

397
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,240
<i>It's not worth remembering.</i>

398
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,350
<i>I should get over it and go on my immortal path.</i>

399
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,490
Mom.

400
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,860
Mom.

401
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,380
Why are you standing here at the break of day?

402
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,380
What time is it?

403
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,260
It's five o'clock.

404
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,060
No…

405
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,860
I mean, it's Spring Equinox today.

406
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,200
There's a plum tree in the courtyard that means much to me.

407
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
You go see if it has bloomed.

408
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,980
It… It has already withered away.

409
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,200
The tree has been there for ten years.

410
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,660
Every year I hope it will bloom.

411
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,770
But my wish has not come true in the past ten years.

412
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,630
<i>The most painful thing about living is that we can't get rid of memories.</i>

413
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,720
<i>Likewise, I'm trapped in the Nether River,</i>

414
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,230
<i>being washed by Ruo Water with excruciating pains every day.</i>

415
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,280
<i>To fulfill Granny's wish,</i>

416
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,070
<i>I have to help her let go of the past.</i>

417
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,830
Pretty.

418
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,900
Mom.

419
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,590
Today is Granny's last day living in the world.

420
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,370
By any means, I have to fulfill her wish.

421
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,570
<i>Zhi'er.</i>

422
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,260
Good son. Come here.

423
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,230
I have something to tell you.

424
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,330
What's the matter, Mom?

425
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,590
Son,

426
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:10,010
What do you think humans live for?

427
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,310
I don't know.

428
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,290
People live for the sake of others.

429
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,380
Others?

430
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,830
If not for waiting for my son,

431
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,600
I would have been dead.

432
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,800
If I had been dead,

433
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,470
who would remember or miss my son, Zhi'er?

434
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,530
Mom, I…

435
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,810
But I'm here.

436
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,920
I'm blind in the eyes,

437
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,860
but in my heart,

438
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,980
I know...

439
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,500
you're not Zhi'er.

440
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,010
It's kind of you to accompany me at the end of my life.

441
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,490
I, as an old woman, don't have any regrets anymore.

442
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,690
What about you, child?

443
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,800
Where is your home?

444
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,410
Does anyone still miss you?

445
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,350
No.

446
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,010
I lost my mom when I was still a kid.

447
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,070
My father hated me to death.

448
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,280
The people around me

449
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,660
never cared about me.

450
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,490
But...

451
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,410
I had a wife.

452
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,040
She protected me...

453
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,680
and saved me.

454
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,710
She tried to...

455
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,930
help me to be a good person.

456
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,830
Have you become a good person now?

457
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,660
I… I don't know.

458
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,030
She taught me to be kind,

459
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,930
merciful,

460
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,680
and love others.

461
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,830
However, I caused her death.

462
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,130
Now no one can tell me...

463
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,840
what kind of person I am anymore.

464
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,450
If you could get your wife back by turning into a bad person,

465
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,560
would you do that?

466
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,310
<i>She's right. If I use the power of the Devil Lord,</i>

467
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,240
<i>I might figure out a way to find Ye Xiwu.</i>

468
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,150
No.

469
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,350
She would not be happy to see me doing that.

470
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,510
That's right.

471
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,570
If you genuinely miss your wife,

472
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,580
you should fulfill her wish.

473
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,200
Do you understand?

474
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,190
What do you mean by fulfilling her wish?

475
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,250
Child, look. Look at the plum tree in the court yard.

476
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,130
Has it blossomed?

477
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,930
Zhi'er planted the tree before he left.

478
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,200
He said...

479
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,030
he would be back when the plum tree bloomed.

480
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,620
I often water the tree,

481
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,660
because I hope...

482
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,700
it's still alive

483
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,960
when Zhi'er comes back.

484
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,500
So he won't feel so sad

485
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,810
as I grow old.

486
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,640
That's it.

487
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,090
I seem to...

488
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,450
I think I've figured it out.

489
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,580
<i>Granny's son is the past that she has been trapped in.</i>

490
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,900
<i>And this plum tree is the key to unlocking this.</i>

491
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,850
<i>As long as Granny thinks the plum tree is blooming,</i>

492
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,070
<i>her son won't feel sad when he comes back. Granny's wish will be fulfilled.</i>

493
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,050
<i>This sword is called South Branch.</i>

494
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,620
<i>It has the heart of spring and the soul of the frost.</i>

495
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,490
<i>It carries no intention of killing.</i>

496
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,780
<i>Taking South Branch as the branch and nurturing it with spiritual power,</i>

497
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,330
<i>one can break an obsession and see true freedom..</i>

498
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,380
<i>Plants wither, flourish, and all things return.</i>

499
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,700
<i>All lives live in contentment without haste.</i>

500
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,320
<i>Shatter!</i>

501
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,530
Mom.

502
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,330
Look. The plum tree has blossomed.

503
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,510
I picked up one branch for you.

504
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,540
Thank you. You're a nice person.

505
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,530
Mom.

506
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,500
<i>Granny, you have concluded your life with virtues and merits.</i>

507
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,990
<i>You'll be blissful in your next life.</i>

508
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,530
Elder Zhaoyou, could you be my master?

509
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,910
I want to be a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect and stay here for cultivation.

510
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,120
Good.

511
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,210
Kid, I think you have a bond with immortal sects.

512
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,440
I knew you would come back.

513
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,900
You got out of Nether Water and were resurrected from death.

514
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,320
Now that you join our sect,

515
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,310
how about I give you a new name?

516
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,960
My secular surname was Cang.

517
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,180
I'll take advantage of you to

518
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,110
name you with my surname, Cang.
<i>(Giving one the same surname is to take him into his family lineage.)</i>

519
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,740
Your first name is Jiumin.

520
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,410
How's it?

521
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,400
What does Jiumin mean?

522
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,050
It's not the time to reveal everything yet.

523
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,800
Do you like this name, Jiumin?

524
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,710
Thank you, Elder.

525
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,820
Still calling me Elder?

526
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,560
Thank you, Master.

527
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,180
Good.

528
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,220
My good disciple.

529
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,520
Granny's wish has been fulfilled.

530
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,250
I give the sword back to you.

531
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm a beginner and don't need weapons.

532
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,970
Jiumin, what are you worried about?

533
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,480
You have already awakened the sword.

534
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,710
In that case, it belongs to you.

535
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,520
Keep it.

536
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,640
Come. I'll show you around our Xiaoyao Sect.

537
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,680
Jiumin, there are six peaks on Buzhao Mount.

538
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,880
The middle peak is named

539
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,960
Xianglu Peak, which is the tallest one.

540
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,080
When the devil artifact fell to the earth, it caused a landslide.

541
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,460
Buzhao Mount emerged at that time.

542
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,840
Mountains merged into one.

543
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,310
The six peaks stand out.

544
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,910
The sky is like a dome.

545
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,800
All of this form a natural array.

546
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,900
Our Xiaoyao Sect is in the middle.

547
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,380
We take the sky and ground as the furnace

548
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
to refine all things.

549
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,800
How time flies.

550
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
The place that had been soaked in devil energy.

551
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,420
Now, it has become an immortal abode.

552
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,340
Feel free to do whatever you want to and go wherever you want to go.

553
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,090
This is called Xiaoyao.

554
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,460
Therefore, Xiaoyao Sect created a unique sword technique

555
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,330
which is called Xiaoyao Swordplay.

556
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,210
Let the sword follow your heart and make numerous changes.

557
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,390
Since you've unsealed South Branch Sword,

558
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,820
now I'll teach you Xiaoyao Swordplay.

559
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,760
But you must remember swordplay follows your heart.

560
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,320
Before practicing the swordplay, you need to practice your heart.

561
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,810
<i>Bone-refining Seal is the heart of Devil Lord.</i>

562
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,800
<i>Ye Xiwu.</i>

563
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,460
<i>Is it nice?</i>

564
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,160
<i>Only when I forget about Tantai Jin,</i>

565
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,700
<i>I can gain stronger power.</i>

566
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,530
<i>Li Susu, focus.</i>

567
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,500
<i>I can't go on like this.</i>

568
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,690
<i>The one I love is you.</i>

569
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,130
<i>Not anyone else.</i>

570
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:14,360
<i>Ye Xiwu, are you going to abandon me, too?</i>

571
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,910
<i>When I tried to forget about Tantai Jin,</i>

572
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,940
<i>for a moment, my power became stronger.</i>

573
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,560
<i>I should let go of the past</i>

574
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,410
<i>and go on my immortal journey.</i>

575
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,210
<i>Is this Heartless Path?</i>

576
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,480
<i>If I don't go with the flow and practice the Heartless Path,</i>

577
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,560
<i>I'm afraid when my attainment is exhausted,</i>

578
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,650
<i>the power of Heaven Lake also cannot seal the evil bone.</i>

579
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,810
<i>Tantai Jin had lived his life as a wise king.</i>

580
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:06,180
<i>I shouldn't let myself be trapped in the memory and suffer from it.</i>

581
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,670
<i>So this is the life in the immortal sect.</i>

582
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,590
<i>This is the place where Ye Xiwu used to live.</i>

583
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,550
<i>Ye Xiwu, if only I can feel how good life was 500 years ago.</i>

584
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,190
Junior Brother.

585
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,340
You left in a hurry that day. We haven't had a chance to introduce each other.

586
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,730
I'm Zang Hai. If you need any help, you can just come to me.

587
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,360
Thank you, Senior Brother.

588
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,410
He's Zang Feng.

589
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,510
Junior Brother, you're new here.

590
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,070
Let me give you some advice.

591
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,040
Among the disciples of our Master, Zang Hai ranks second.

592
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,410
I rank third. What about you?

593
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,280
Every new disciple will get a new name when he joins.

594
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,130
What's your first name after surname "Cang"?

595
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,950
Cang Jiumin.

596
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,260
You don't have the same surname as us. How do we determine seniority?

597
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,980
Cang is Master's secular surname.

598
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,580
Are you his relative?

599
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,120
I didn't know Master before.

600
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,570
Master must have given him his name for a reason.

601
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,780
Stop speculating.

602
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,810
Little Brother, let me tell you about our eldest brother.

603
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,820
Let me tell you. His name is Zang Lin.

604
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,770
He's obsessed with martial arts.

605
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,820
He has a problem in here.

606
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,800
A problem?

607
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,510
Eldest Brother.

608
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:31,560
Zang Lin is just obsessed with practicing martial arts

609
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,910
and is more hardworking than others.

610
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,290
Yeah…

611
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,760
Are you Master's new disciple?

612
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,390
Why don't we compete?

613
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,830
You must have something special.

614
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,180
Show it to me.

615
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,260
- All right.
- Junior Brother, Jiumin.

616
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,400
You're injured. Take a break. We're leaving.

617
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,310
Go, Zang Lin.

618
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,310
Have a competition next time.

619
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,330
Have a competition with me.

620
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,720
Junior Brother, the immortal contest counts for much.

621
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,610
Don't forget to practice your sword skills.

622
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,120
<i>The divine essence is supporting me in cultivation.</i>

623
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,990
<i>Ye Xiwu.</i>

624
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,740
Uncle Zhaoyou, what's wrong with you?

625
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,270
You know,

626
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,530
I'm going to need a drink

627
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,330
at the sight of someone with a cold face, playing a profound thinker.

628
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,800
Or I will be uncomfortable head-to-toe and with eye twitching.

629
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,770
Where is your wine gourd? I'll get you a pot of it.

630
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,180
No. Trifles like getting wine in the future

631
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,570
will be left to my new dear disciple.

632
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,740
But I noticed you are good person,

633
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,450
how about I get you something?

634
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,870
Soothsaying your marriage.

635
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,460
Stop it!

636
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,920
Susu has made up her mind to practice the Heartless Path.

637
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,240
Susu, the Heartless Path's no joke.

638
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,710
Have you carefully weighed

639
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,020
the pros and cons of it?

640
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,270
Susu has been in tribulations for a decade.

641
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,130
But it's more like experiencing nirvana.

642
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,650
In her body, everything has been reshaped.

643
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,050
A lot of weird stuff goes on in Hengyang Sect.

644
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,650
Susu is still young and hasn't been in love.

645
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,490
How has she ever been in a love tribulation?

646
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,400
And why does she change to practice the Heartless Path?

647
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,610
<i>It seems Tantai Jin is my love tribulation.</i>

648
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,650
Father and Uncle Zhaoyou, you don't need to worry about me.

649
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,790
Now that I've shown my resolution to Father,

650
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,560
there is no need to hesitate here.

651
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,400
Susu, you may go back.

652
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,890
It's surprising to me.

653
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,910
What Susu said just now isn't like words a common ignorant girl would speak.

654
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,570
Susu.

655
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,800
Senior Brother Gongye.

656
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,400
Susu, I have something to tell you.

657
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,680
Instead, she acts as if she has been through the vicissitudes of life.

658
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,290
Okay.

659
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,560
Susu, we've known each other since childhood.

660
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,730
Over the past decade, my love for you has been rock-solid every day.

661
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:54,310
<i>Senior Brother, I never expected that there would be one day</i>

662
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,710
<i>that I'm afraid to look at your face.</i>

663
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,700
Senior Brother, I'm about to say thank you.

664
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,180
I was so young and immature before and fatheaded in doing things.

665
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,200
But you didn't mind these things.

666
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,160
You often helped me and instructed me.

667
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,460
I'm grateful for it.

668
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,630
I haven't found a way to repay you.

669
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:19,830
Susu, have you got nothing else to say in addition to gratitude?

670
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:23,040
- What about our engagement…
- You are close

671
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,110
to me and I respect you.

672
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,030
That's it.

673
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,130
As for my marriage,

674
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,420
I'll find a way to tell my dad

675
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,610
that I shall decide by myself.

676
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,760
You're really a different person than you used to be.

677
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,600
I get it.

678
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,420
Susu, I'll prove it to you.

679
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,690
My love for you hasn't changed,

680
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,700
whether it's in the past or now and what you've been through.

681
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,240
I wonder

682
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,670
if you'll think of me as your marriage partner in the future.

683
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,830
There's still time.

684
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,550
Senior Brother, I'm unsure what will happen between you and me.

685
