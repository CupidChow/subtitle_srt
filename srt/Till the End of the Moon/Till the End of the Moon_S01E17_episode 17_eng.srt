16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,710
 Where is this place? 

17
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,030
 This is the middle of the river, where the Water-calming Stone is. 

18
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,190
 The divine energy is abundant here. 

19
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,330
 It may protect his last meridian. 

20
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,310
 I'll leave him to you. 

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,560
Divine God of the Water-Calming Stone,

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,900
our Water Tribe of the Mo River suffered from this calamity because of me.

23
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,630
I bear a deep hatred and a demand for blood for blood that will be everlasting.

24
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm willing to become a devil if I can kill my foe...

25
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,940
 even at the cost of my life... 

26
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,100
 or my soul being dispersed. 

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,130
 I'll never regret it. 

28
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,140
Water-calming Sword,

29
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,970
follow me as I invade the God Realm...

30
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,700
to slaughter Tian Huan.

31
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,700
 Why do I suddenly feel so unsettled? 

32
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,390
 Forget it. Purifying the seal is perilous. 

33
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,480
 I need to calm down and focus. I cannot fail at the final step. 

34
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,270
Why are you so upset?

35
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,670
Maid Qingniao in Xuanzhang Palace was dismissed days ago and left Shangqing Realm.

36
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,770
So you are lovesick.

37
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,680
But I heard many maids in several palaces have been replaced by the maids from Flying Serpent Tribe.

38
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,040
I heard Goddess Tian Huan did it.

39
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
After the gods fell,

40
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,670
I'm afraid Shangqing Realm is no longer the same as in the past.

41
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,060
It's you again, little imp.

42
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,850
My honored guest, pardon me for not greeting you.

43
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,120
Where's Tian Huan?

44
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Follow me.

45
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,950
Goddess, have mercy on us.

46
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,990
We have cultivated ourselves for thousands of years before getting into Shangqing Realm.

47
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,480
Goddess, please don't drive us away.

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,870
I know it's hard for you to get into the realm.

49
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,190
But you can't blame me for this.

50
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,940
If you want to blame someone, blame Sang Jiu.

51
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,290
What does it have to do with Lady Sang?

52
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,240
Because you served her before, I feel annoyed when seeing you.

53
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,500
Is that a good enough reason for you?

54
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,560
What if I don't leave?

55
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,940
What?

56
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,240
I came to Yuqing Palace with God of War Mingye.

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,000
God Mingye is also the master of Yuqing Palace.

58
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,210
If you want to drive me away, we should argue this with his presence.

59
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,140
Are you threatening me with Mingye?

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,310
When the twelve gods were on their thrones,

61
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,260
no one was a bully or dictator in Shangqing Realm.

62
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,750
Everything should have impartiality.

63
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,040
You are just a mere flower immortal. How dare you offend me!

64
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,750
Goddess, please spare us…

65
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,510
Report!

66
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,320
Goddess, Sang Jiu from the Mo River asks to see you and says she wants to apologize.

67
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,580
She's putting her head in the noose before I take action.

68
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,840
Sang Jiu, don't you think it's too late to apologize to me?

69
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,190
No.

70
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,470
Tian Huan, I came here...

71
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,800
to take your life.

72
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,900
You…

73
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,360
You have become a devil.

74
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,010
You dirty and vulgar clam demon.

75
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,950
Unfortunately, Goddess,

76
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:28,450
today, you'll be killed at the hands of this dirty and vulgar clam demon.

77
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,150
 The time has come. 

78
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,040
 Sang Jiu, your divine essence will soon be reshaped. 

79
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,320
- Lord Immortal. 
 - Lord Immortal. Lord Immortal, help!

80
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,120
- A female devil barged into Shangqing Realm just now. 
 -  A female devil? 

81
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,940
She took Goddess Tian Huan and went to the southeastern spring.

82
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,510
Sang Jiu, what are you doing?

83
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
You've become a devil.

84
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,630
Mingye, you finally came to save me.

85
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,900
She took away my divine essence.

86
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,990
Help me.

87
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,020
Sang Jiu, if you can hear me, put down Tian Huan's divine essence.

88
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,530
Come here.

89
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,320
Put it down?

90
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,840
Sang Jiu!

91
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,580
Let go of me.

92
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,620
I must kill her.

93
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
Lord Immortal.

94
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
Help her out.

95
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,050
Yes.

96
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,340
 Sang Jiu, what exactly happened to you? 

97
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,320
 How did you become a devil? 

98
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's what happened.

99
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,530
Lord Immortal, Beryl died in such a grievance.

100
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,860
Don't worry. I'll get justice for you.

101
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,200
Get up.

102
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,120
Since you all received a tremendous shock today, go back and take a good rest.

103
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,130
Thanks, Lord Immortal.

104
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,130
Has the Mo River Water Tribe really been massacred?

105
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,550
Although being compelled,

106
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,910
you're generals from Shangqing Realm,

107
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,680
who should never be obsequious or aid villains.

108
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,870
Lord Immortal, we were wrong.

109
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,050
We were deceived by Tian Huan.

110
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,440
Since we returned from the Mo River, we have been feeling guilty.

111
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,080
Lord Immortal, for the sake of our contribution to the realm,

112
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,290
please let us off lightly.

113
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,440
 Please spare us! 

114
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,270
All of you will be sent to jail and be deprived of cultivation.

115
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,120
Wait for your sentences. Scram!

116
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,220
- Take them away. 
 - Yes.

117
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,940
Medicine King, what's the cure for Sang Jiu's condition?

118
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,630
I can't always tie her up with Ruo-River rope.

119
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,540
Her degeneration into becoming a devil is due to her emotional turmoil and unstable cultivation mind.

120
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,670
Being tormented by the extermination of her whole tribe,

121
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,440
Lady Sang degenerated into a devil.

122
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,980
Mental illness can't be cured by medicine only psychologically.

123
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,770
Psychologically?

124
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,440
It's not easy.

125
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,030
I'll go see her.

126
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,150
Wait.

127
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,030
Lord Immortal, if you show up now,

128
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm afraid you'll remind her of the painful memories,

129
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,120
and she'll sink deeper into the path of the devil.

130
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,910
It will be best to leave her alone for a while

131
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,100
and let the God Realm's pure energy dispel some of her devil energy.

132
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,840
You should give her some decoction to resolve the foul energy

133
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,740
and not see her until she has calmed down.

134
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,810
Lord Immortal, though this happened because of Tian Huan,

135
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,250
it's a fact that Sang Jiu became a devil, broke into our gate, and killed our soldiers.

136
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,750
Shangqing Realm has laws.

137
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,320
Lord Immortal, you can't be partial to her.

138
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
That's right, Lord Immortal.

139
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,180
Shangqing Realm has been irreconcilable with devils.

140
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,540
Otherwise, the sacrifice of the Goddess of the Universe and others would mean nothing.

141
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,920
 Sang Jiu, have you thought about this? 

142
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,680
 Mingye has been at odds with devils for many years. 

143
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,540
 Many of his dear comrades were killed by devils. 

144
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,880
 Now that you've become a devil, how could he tolerate you? 

145
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,270
She was right.

146
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,920
There's no turning back for me.

147
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,030
Lord Immortal, Goddess Tian Huan woke up.

148
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,300
She lost her divine essence and soaked for a long time in the Ruo River.

149
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,590
She's now bawling.

150
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,790
Has she confessed?

151
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,060
Yes. This is her statement.

152
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,240
She has a request.

153
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,000
She said her sin was heavy,

154
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,490
but she wanted to see you anyway.

155
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,210
You tell Tian Huan.

156
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,340
She took the wrong path and acted like a devil.

157
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,510
No. She's eviler than a devil,

158
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,260
so we have nothing to talk about.

159
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,810
 When she's punished by the thunderbolt 

160
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,100
 and her soul is dispersed, 

161
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,910
 I'll be there to supervise the execution. 

162
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,640
How was it?

163
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,790
Goddess, don't worry.

164
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,790
I've notified the elders of our tribe at your orders.

165
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,680
They'll soon go see God Mingye.

166
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,680
You give me such a precious gift.

167
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,250
Elders, what do you want to exchange it for?

168
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,750
Please spare Tian Huan's life.

169
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,270
This crystal can help Lady Sang's clansmen come back to life.

170
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,100
Although Tian Huan made a huge mistake,

171
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,400
she's the goddess of our tribe.

172
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,310
For the sake of the contribution of the Flying Serpent Tribe,

173
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,880
please spare her life and reshape her divine essence before banishing her from Shangqing Realm.

174
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,850
We promise we'll put her under house arrest

175
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,740
and forbid her to step out of Mist Mountain forever.

176
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,400
I can spare her life.

177
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,160
Don't you think you are being too greedy asking me

178
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,720
to reshape her divine essence

179
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,930
and release her back to Mist Mountain?

180
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,270
God Mingye insists on not reshaping your divine essence or releasing you.

181
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,000
Our elders have tried our best.

182
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,650
At least we saved your life.

183
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,650
Saved my life?

184
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,070
I lost my divine essence

185
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,920
and have been trapped in a hellhole.

186
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,550
How much longer can I live?

187
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,200
Even if I didn't suffer from a thunderbolt,

188
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm still waiting here for death.

189
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,670
Mingye, how cruel you are.

190
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,980
It's ridiculous.

191
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,010
My father has been his benefactor...

192
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,620
and I love him deeply,

193
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,030
but he repaid me with this.

194
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,650
Mingye...

195
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,900
If you don't want to save me,

196
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,110
don't think you can save the clam demon.

197
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,670
Yanghe, come closer.

198
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,950
Tell the elders to throw it into Barren Abyss...

199
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,920
before telling the news to Sang Jiu.

200
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,530
Lord Immortal.

201
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,100
Has the Flying Serpent gone back?

202
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes. They have left Shangqing Realm.

203
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,350
How did they know I'd purified Bone-refining Seal,

204
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,670
which can reshape divine essence?

205
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,070
Maybe they'd heard some rumors.

206
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,460
Keep an eye on Mist Mountain

207
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,100
and let me know the daily whereabouts of those elders.

208
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,640
Yes.

209
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,000
Lord Immortal, you just purified Bone-refining Seal with the Quadripod,

210
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,440
which cost much of your energy.

211
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,210
And now you're refining the ten-millennia crystal.

212
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,340
I'm worried about you.

213
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,940
I know how to take care of my body.

214
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,760
No need to say anymore.

215
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,680
 If I turn this crystal into a spirit container... 

216
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,860
 and put the Mo River Tribe's shells into it, 

217
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,650
 after one thousand years of cultivation, 

218
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,490
 the Mo River Tribe will come back to life... 

219
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,110
 which will be a comfort to Sang Jiu... 

220
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,840
 and bring her back to the right path. 

221
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,030
Have you heard of it?

222
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,210
God Mingye has absolved Goddess Tian Huan.

223
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,030
Flying Serpent Tribe has a long history.

224
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,460
Through generations, many heroes like Tian Hao came from the tribe.

225
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,190
At least God Mingye would show some mercy.

226
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,200
 That's right. 

227
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,030
 I think so. 

228
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,790
But the poor Mo River Tribe was killed.

229
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,880
I heard only Sang You survived with a serious injury.

230
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,290
He was then thrown into Barren Abyss and is as good as dead.

231
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,410
 Brother. 

232
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,680
Brother!

233
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,100
Brother!

234
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,340
Sang You!

235
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,610
Brother!

236
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,240
 Sang Jiu. 

237
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,200
God Jize, is that you?

238
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,720
 Yes. 

239
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,860
 You shouldn't have come here. 

240
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,000
 You're a demon. 

241
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,720
 Don't step forward or you'll be doomed eternally. 

242
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,390
 Sang Jiu, leave now. 

243
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,900
I won't go until I find my brother.

244
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,890
 Sang Jiu, don't be stubborn. 

245
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,570
 The abyss is full of devils. 

246
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,730
 You cannot go against them. 

247
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,130
 Where's Mingye? Why did he let you come alone? 

248
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,880
Now, I have the crystal.

249
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,650
Next,

250
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,930
all I need to do is find all the skeletons of the Mo River Tribe.

251
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,380
Lord Immortal, our soldier reported

252
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,140
the elders of the Flying Snake Tribe tended to be suspicious.

253
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,360
They had contact with the servants of Yuqing Palace in secret.

254
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,930
Lord Immortal, bad news!

255
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,670
Lady Sang is gone.

256
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,100
A soldier was killed in the palace.

257
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,520
Lord Immortal!

258
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,250
 Brother, I was a fool. 

259
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,490
 I should have listened to you. 

260
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,780
 Please be alive. 

261
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,960
 This is… 

262
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,780
Brother!

263
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,950
Brother!

264
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,720
Brother!

265
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,940
It's great that you're alive.

266
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,000
Sorry that I'm late.

267
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,310
I'll take you away.

268
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,850
I was wondering who you were,

269
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,900
you two little clam demons.

270
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,510
Having been trapped for so long,

271
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,050
I'm starving.

272
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,650
We can finally have a full meal.

273
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,280
Get away.

274
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,990
Don't be arrogant, little clam spirit.

275
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,680
Neither of you will leave here alive.

276
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,110
Brothers, take her.

277
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,430
 Aren't you God of War Mingye? 

278
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,890
 You're at odds with us. 

279
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,120
 Why did you degrade yourself to come here? 

280
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,560
 The God of War, are you risking your life 

281
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,720
 for the little clam spirit, your beloved one? 

282
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,800
 Unfortunately, you came too late. 

283
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,160
 She's now a mass of bleeding flesh. 

284
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,500
 All my men, take him. 

285
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,440
 Why? 

286
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,840
 Why should we be bullied? 

287
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,870
 Tian Huan has done so many sins 

288
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,540
 but has been forgiven. 

289
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,930
 My clansmen had done nothing bad... 

290
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,750
 but had to suffer. 

291
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,990
 Sang Jiu. 

292
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,290
Sang Jiu.

293
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,570
Wake up.

294
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,890
Stop degenerating.

295
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,530
Degenerating?

296
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,510
If you so-called noble and pure gods and goddesses

297
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,180
do something evil, that'll be degeneration!

298
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,160
Won't it?

299
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,050
Sang Jiu, go home with me.

300
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,940
I will make up for all the mistakes that I made in the past.

301
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,460
Go home?

302
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,290
Where is my home?

303
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,610
Tell me where it is!

304
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,540
 She's being very emotional now. 

305
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,140
 Whatever I say, she won't listen to me. 

306
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,990
 I should calm her down first and stop her degenerating. 

307
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,680
Sang Jiu.

308
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,200
The soldiers who massacred the Mo River Water Tribe are your troops.

309
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,140
How will you punish them?

310
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,980
Kill them?

311
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,480
They were deceived by Tian Huan

312
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,120
owing to my weak discipline.

313
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,080
I'll give them a severe penalty.

314
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,780
Good.

315
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,580
Have you forgiven Tian Huan and spared her life?

316
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,630
 God Mingye, please spare Tian Huan. 

317
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,980
 Our tribe will give the crystal bowl to help regenerate Lady Sang's tribe. 

318
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,310
Yes.

319
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,010
But Tian Huan lost her divine essence.

320
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,310
Even if I don't kill her, she doesn't have many years to live.

321
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,140
Mingye, you're so kind.

322
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,730
If you spare their lives,

323
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,050
who should pay for the deaths of my royal father and my clansmen?

324
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,260
Do you know what I want?

325
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,740
I want them all to die.

326
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,960
When they raised their swords to kill children and the elders of the Mo River,

327
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,210
they had no kindness or sympathy at all.

328
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:46,070
I want them to pay for their cruelty and indifference!

329
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,910
Sang Jiu, I understand your pain.

330
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,680
But I can't watch as you degenerate further and become a devil.

331
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
You are seeking death by doing this.

332
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,630
It's not worth it.

333
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,430
Who are you?

334
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,760
Who do you think you are, telling me what's worthwhile and what should or should not be done?

335
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,770
Get out of here!

336
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,020
Move!

337
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,220
You…

338
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,590
Sang Jiu.

339
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,460
 I need to figure out how to take them away first. 

340
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,480
Sang Jiu.

341
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,580
 Mingye, it has been a long time. 

342
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,770
Jize.

343
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,560
Jize, why are you in Barren Abyss?

344
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,010
- I thought you were… 
  - Yes. 

345
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,950
 My body has been destroyed, but my spirit still exists. 

346
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,870
 I decided to be imprisoned and guard Barren Abyss with my divine body. 

347
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,380
 I can't move in the formation's center, but I may help you to leave. 

348
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,460
 It's perilous in Barren Abyss. 

349
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,320
 Be sure not to come here again. 

350
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,660
Jize.

351
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,510
Jize, wait!

352
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,410
Goddess, forgive us. We arrived late.

353
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,210
Without God Mingye here,

354
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,230
it's much easier to enter into the barrier.

355
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,260
Since he took a risk to enter Barren Abyss to play hero,

356
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,700
why don't we...

357
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,610
reclaim Yuqing Palace back for our Flying Snake Tribe?

358
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,580
Why did you bring me here?

359
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,340
I thought you would bring me back to Shangqing God Realm and imprison me.

360
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,160
You know, I killed someone.

361
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,210
I promised you

362
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,780
I'd stand by your side.

363
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,320
It's not a lie.

364
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,780
Whether you're an immortal, demon, or devil,

365
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,150
you're always my Sang Jiu.

366
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,170
Where's my brother?

367
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,670
I've tried my best.

368
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,530
But he's severely injured and can't recover fully now.

369
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,840
Don't worry.

370
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,940
As long as we cultivate your clansmen using the crystal bowl,

371
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,510
they will have the chance to regenerate.

372
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,010
Brother.

373
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,320
As long as the remains of the Mo River Water Tribe are placed into the bowl,

374
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,500
your clansmen will be back after 1,000 years.

375
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,290
 The divine power in this bowl is Mingye's… 

376
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,490
Sang Jiu, since you just became a devil,

377
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,810
there is still a way to turn back.

378
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,120
I've refined Bone-refining Seal

379
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,760
and will help you reshape your divine essence with it.

380
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,610
I've asked Medicine King.

381
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,600
He said if you kept a cultivation mind,

382
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,850
with time,

383
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,950
you could get away from the path of the devil and back to the immortal path.

384
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,590
Sang Jiu, I really enjoyed the life

385
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,100
that I spent with you here.

386
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,640
For the rest of my life,

387
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,610
all I want is to live such a life,

388
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,620
whatever the cost.

389
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,380
Can you…?

390
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,900
Can you trust me once again?

391
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,380
How did you get...

392
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,100
the ten-millennium crystal?

393
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,810
From the Flying Snake Tribe.

394
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,240
Sang Jiu, listen to me.

395
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,440
They said they would give me the crystal bowl if I spared Tian Huan's life.

396
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,450
I agreed.

397
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,710
I know you bear deep hatred.

398
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,840
But only with the crystal bowl

399
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,330
can you bring your clansmen back to life.

400
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:47,280
You care about the lives of your clansmen more than that of Tian Huan.

401
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,210
Right?

402
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,580
Mingye, you're impartial and lead by example.

403
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,540
You're an excellent god.

404
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,030
But you must understand...

405
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,210
this is not a transaction.

406
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,360
Not everything in this world

407
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,720
can be measured fairly

408
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,110
or exchanged equally.

409
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,930
Mingye, do you still remember

410
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,760
the story my father told me?

411
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,440
It's about the king who cut off his flesh to save the dove.

412
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,130
He chose to do that...

413
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,010
just out of his compassion.

414
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,360
The white dove looked so cute.

415
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,970
Anyone would have compassion for it.

416
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,810
Just like me.

417
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,830
I had a crush on you, like anyone would,

418
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,090
and fell in love with you.

419
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
Even if I knew I had to pay for it,

420
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,540
I would still pick up the knife.

421
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,950
Back then, I thought

422
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:15,300
I had enough courage to bear the cost.

423
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,210
But I never expected...

424
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,760
such a huge cost.

425
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,460
It's too huge.

426
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,080
The king lost all his flesh because of his kindness.

427
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,340
And I caused the extinction...

428
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,600
of the Mo River Tribe because of you.

429
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,780
How ridiculous I am.

430
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,980
How sinful I am.

431
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,930
I'm only a clam spirit,

432
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,710
not as devout as the king.

433
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,560
He didn't regret it, so he became immortal.

434
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,530
But I can't.

435
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,580
I regret it.

436
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,610
I'm so regretful that I want to kill myself.

437
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,870
Since the day Tian Huan slaughtered my Mo River Tribe,

438
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,080
my heart...

439
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,550
has been filled with redemption and revenge.

440
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,380
There's no place for you.

441
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,930
No.

442
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,580
- Sang Jiu 
 - I'll find a way

443
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,730
to save my brother.

444
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,590
I cannot bear the God of War's feelings.

445
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,410
I'll kill...

446
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,420
my foe on my own.

447
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,690
Tian Huan, Flying Snake Tribe produced many heroes.

448
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:27,480
How could you enter into collusion and steal the crown?

449
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,430
Yeah. Our tribe produced many heroes.

450
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,920
As the daughter of Tian Hao, why can't I be the leader of the God Realm?

451
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,810
Ridiculous.

452
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,370
You took credit for your father's contribution but made no contribution.

453
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,890
How can you be the leader?

454
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,910
When we followed God Mingye to fight with devils, where were you?

455
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,410
We will never bow to you.

456
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:51,540
When God Mingye returns, your tribe will get what you deserve!

457
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,950
Mingye.

458
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:58,270
He degraded himself to go to the Barren Abyss to save a demon.

459
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,410
What qualifies him to condemn me?

460
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:06,350
Besides, it's not certain whether he'll get out of there.

461
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,620
That's it.

462
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,500
Since you refuse to take me as your leader...

463
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,970
Soldiers, throw them into the Quadripod and burn them.

464
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,700
You…

465
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,430
With enough lives in it, there will be divine essence for me.

466
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,380
It's a good idea

467
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,060
to refine divine essence with the Quadripod.

468
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,280
I wonder whether I'll extract something useful

469
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,610
if I put your tribe into the quadripod.

470
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,040
Sang Jiu,

471
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,610
you're actually alive!

472
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,940
She's a devil.

473
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,110
Capture and kill her.

474
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,250
No.

475
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,680
Don't kill me.

476
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,700
I didn't expect that a goddess would be afraid to die.

477
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,910
So you're no different from us, little imps.

478
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,590
Don't think you're nobler.

479
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,470
Sang Jiu,

480
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,160
do you think you can get

481
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,780
your clansmen back by killing me?

482
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,230
Do you think you and Mingye can get back together by killing me?

483
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,980
Dream on.

484
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,970
You're still in denial.

485
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,450
I admit you're much luckier than me

486
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,890
because you're going to reunite

487
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,800
with your Flying Snake Tribe.

488
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,250
I thought to myself and I don't have anything to say to you.

489
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,930
Goodbye,

490
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,170
Tian Huan.

491
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:42,520
Here, I take an oath to the world.

492
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,810
I'll find and kill Flying Snake Tribe

493
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:52,220
until they've been exterminated.

497
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:59,780
♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

498
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:07,580
♫  The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm  ♫

499
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:15,400
♫  Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain  ♫

500
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,280
♫  Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain  ♫

501
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,580
♫  We'll never meet again  ♫

502
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,540
♫  I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words  ♫

503
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,280
♫  Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense  ♫

504
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,760
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

505
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,780
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

506
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,120
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

507
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,300
♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

508
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,800
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

509
00:52:51,800 --> 00:53:00,060
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

510
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,460
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

511
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,180
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

512
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,440
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

513
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,640
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

514
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,860
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

515
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,920
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

516
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,600
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

517
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:36,540
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

518
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:44,340
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

519
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:53,080
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
