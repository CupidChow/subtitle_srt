♫  Is it bright and warm?   ♫

♫   I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,100
Ye Xiwu,

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,460
is that you?

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,820
 Sect Leader Qu, have you heard about a lady named Ye Xiwu? 

20
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,310
 We haven't heard about her in our immortal sect. 

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,300
 Is she a disciple of the Hengyang Sect? 

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
 Jiwu has no parents. 

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,260
 He's not even a "normal" human. 

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,120
 Are you the real Ye Xiwu or another fake Xiao Lin? 

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,210
Hello, friend.

26
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,930
You've got the wrong person.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,650
I don't know you.

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,580
Sorry. I am rude.

29
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,630
I'm Cang Jiumin, a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect.

30
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,663
May I know your name?

31
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,610
So, you're Junior Brother Cang.

32
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,050
I'm Li Susu from Hengyang Sect.

33
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,790
Junior Brother Cang, if there's nothing else,

34
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll make a move first.

35
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,303
Wait.

36
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,300
Senior Brother Jiwu mentions you often.

37
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,240
However, I couldn't get a chance to greet you.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,760
So, I'm lucky to meet you today.

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,683
Senior Sister, why were you not together with Senior Brother Jiwu?

40
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,460
He has something important to do.

41
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,310
That's why he didn't join me.

42
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,220
Why don't we go find him together?

43
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,940
Maybe we can gather some Red Immortal Fruit on our way there.

44
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,243
Okay. I can take the chance to stroll around.

45
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,180
It's my first time visiting the Shangqing God Realm.

46
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,760
These halls, painted pillars, and carved beams are magnificent.

47
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
We can admire them on our way there.

48
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,230
If you are interested in the Shangqing God realm,

49
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,560
I heard a story about it before.

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
10,000 years ago,

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,840
there was a God of War. His name was Mingye.

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,540
He married a smart and lovely princess from the Unionidae Tribe

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,530
♫  I still bet my life on you  ♫

54
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,900
Her name was Sang Jiu.

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
♫  ...love threads twine around the remaining warmth  ♫

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,590
♫  Our love has taken root  ♫

57
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,900
Though Mingye disliked the marriage at first, he fell for her gradually.

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,430
Before he had time to respond to her love,

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,830
Sang Jiu mistakenly thought that Mingye didn't love her.

60
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,770
So she left the Shangqing God Realm.

61
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,170
Why didn't he go after her since he regretted it?

62
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,820
How did you know he didn't do that?

63
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,630
There was a battle between gods and devils back then.

64
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,510
Even the Heavenly Pillar was destroyed.

65
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,210
Ming Ye was the God of War of this god realm.

66
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,630
He was afraid that he might lose his life in battle

67
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,370
and Sang Jiu would be sad about this.

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,463
That's why he reluctantly decided not to look for her.

69
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:35,770
But everything was fine to Mingye as long as Sang Jiu was happy

70
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,550
and safe.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,633
All right.

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I am done telling the story.

73
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's go and find Xiao Lin.

74
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,463
Sure.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,960
♫  Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?  ♫

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,773
Ye Xiwu.

77
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,280
♫  ...refuses to fly away  ♫

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,280
It is truly you!

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,580
♫  ...like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,970
I don't understand what you're talking about.

81
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,403
I said, you've mistaken me for another person.

82
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,880
 Why did you have to show up at this particular time? 

83
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,420
 I cannot acknowledge you yet. 

84
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,700
 Sorry. 

85
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,400
 Tantai Jin. 

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,720
♫  My turbulent years  ♫

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,260
♫  To dream in an illusion of staying together  ♫

88
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,100
♫  Why is the age of my heart a myriad?  ♫

89
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,840
Over there.

90
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,160
Unexpectedly, the Water Mirror has dried up after 10,000 years

91
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,630
and the Bone-refining Seal appears.

92
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,170
Otherwise, we would never have been able to find it even if we searched here for another ten years.

93
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,003
Let's do it.

94
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,213
Wait.

95
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:24,420
It's disadvantageous for us to fight in the Shangqing God Realm.

96
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,000
We need to use the diversion tactic.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,870
Go and distract them

98
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,820
so that they won't spoil our plan.

99
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,270
Yemei and Fengshi were on standby down the mountain.

100
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,770
I'm going to rendezvous with them

101
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,090
and engage Hengyang Sect in a huge fight.

102
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,260
Isn't that good, too?

103
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm Yue Fuya from Hengyang Sect.

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
I finally got a chance to engage devious demons like you all!

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I'll annihilate you guys, even at the expense of my life!

106
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,940
Watch out. Have you come to rescue me?

107
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,860
What's your name?

108
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,760
Where are you going? Can I go with you?

109
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
This place is scary.

110
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,363
Go now.

111
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,370
They've finally arrived.

112
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,620
Cast the Mountain Protection Array!

113
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,750
Taste my sword!

114
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,240
You'll never escape alive!

115
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Xiaoyao Sword Array! Ten Views of Cloud Mountain!

116
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,573
Stop!

117
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,970
Your primordial soul looks tasty.

118
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,380
Demon, stop!

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,860
Surrender immediately.

120
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,920
The Subduing Devil Array? So much for your trap!

121
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,930
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

122
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,633
Cast the array!

123
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,290
I thought you guys were capable.

124
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm disappointed.

125
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,410
When I served the Devil Lord,

126
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,230
only Jize and Chuhuang

127
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,310
were foes I deemed worthy!

128
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,800
Jingmie, stop talking arrogantly!

129
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,530
You are bound to die here today!

130
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,980
Where is Siying? Why is Jingmie the only one here today?

131
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,440
 There's a huge commotion out there. 

132
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,130
 I'm afraid Jingmie can't stall them for too long. 

133
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,150
 I need to hurry up.  

134
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,900
 I remember that in Enlightened Life,  

135
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,460
 Mingye had sealed the Bone-refining Seal in the Divine Platform. 

136
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,560
 The Bone-refining Seal is connected to the Devil Lord's energy and is very powerful. 

137
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,370
 Since it couldn't be destroyed, 

138
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,080
 the only solution now is to seal it under the Water Mirror 

139
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,480
 and keep it here forever with the help of divine power. 

140
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,720
This is bad. Something strange is happening on the Divine Platform!

141
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,700
Old Qu, stand still!

142
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,690
All of our disciples have returned. This may be a diversion.

143
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,120
Let's kill this demon first.

144
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Do not fall for their trick!

145
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,763
Stop, demon!

146
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,440
As long as I'm here, you are not allowed to take the Bone-refining Seal away.

147
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,980
 It's her. 

148
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,200
Then I will take your life.

149
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,100
 You won't get your way at the former divine residence. 

150
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,060
 Just by yourself? 

151
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,820
 The 12 gods couldn't stop His Lordship even when they risked their lives to battle him. 

152
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,130
 Who do you think you are? 

153
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,010
 The Bone-refining Seal, the heart of the Devil Lord, 

154
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,960
 will be returned to His Lordship eventually. 

155
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,920
 You are born with the evil bone 

156
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,850
 and doomed to be the Devil Lord. 

157
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,380
 You're the Devil Lord. 

158
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,300
 You were already the greatest curse... 

159
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,960
 in the world. 

160
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,440
 This is your destiny. 

161
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,970
 To be a devil or a god, 

162
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,150
 it all depends on your one thought. 

163
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,433
 Mingye, 

164
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,950
 why did you choose me to enter your Enlightened Life? 

165
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,030
You won't be able to take the Bone-refining Seal today.

166
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,450
An insignificant disciple of an immortal sect like you

167
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,480
could actually seal the Bone-refining Seal?

168
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,803
Xiaoyao Swordplay, shatter!

169
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,150
No. Something's wrong with the Divine Platform.

170
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,790
Cang Jiumin!

171
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,173
 Is this 

172
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,970
 His Lordship? 

173
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,923
Cang Jiumin! Don't succumb to the demonic energy!

174
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,860
Wake up quickly!

175
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,330
It's been 500 hundred years.

176
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,210
I've finally found the demon fetus.

177
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,960
 It looks like they have found it. 

178
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,160
 They've finally inserted the charm. 

179
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,960
 Devil Lord, I'm sure you didn't expect this. 

180
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,060
 The ones who unsealed me 

181
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,940
 were two of your most loyal subordinates. 

182
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,850
 I have regained the freedom 

183
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,580
 that was deprived by you. 

184
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:13,820
 Tantai Jin, you are the demon fetus. 

185
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,350
 How could you defy my will? 

186
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,100
 Once the Bone-refining Seal merges with your heart, 

187
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,263
 I... 

188
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,660
 will be awakened. 

189
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,870
Cang Jiumin,

190
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,800
wake up quickly!

191
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,780
Wake up!

192
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,953
No.

193
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:47,010
No way!

194
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,920
 It's His Lordship's power. 

195
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,090
Cang Jiumin! Calm down.

196
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,460
Don't be possessed by the Devil.

197
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,650
 His Lordship's plan is mysterious indeed. 

198
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,710
 This is a confusing situation. I should leave while I can. 

199
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,450
 I can take His Lordship back to Barren Abyss once the demon fetus is fully awakened. 

200
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,590
Fine, Your Lordship. The Bone-refining Seal was yours in the first place.

201
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,810
 I shall take my leave. 

202
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,710
 Is this demonic energy from the Bone-refining Seal that merged with his heart? 

203
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,430
Cang Jiumin! Don't be bewitched by the demon artifact! Wake up quickly!

204
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,490
The Bone-refining Seal is already connected to your heart!

205
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,620
Do you want to die?

206
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,043
Cang Jiumin! Wake up!

207
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,960
Cang Jiumin!

208
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,243
Siying?

209
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,693
Great timing.

210
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:33,040
Let's annihilate both of them today!

211
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,980
Jingmie, cease the needless fighting. Let's go.

212
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,650
I didn't expect them to escape.

213
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,400
 Could it be that someone leaked our plan? 

214
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,300
Information about the Immortal Sect Competition was actually leaked.

215
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,590
The two devils took advantage of it. It's my mistake.

216
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,350
To my surprise, they came to the Shangqing God Realm

217
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,750
to steal the devil artifact.

218
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,220
Forget it. Old Qu, it's not your fault.

219
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
It's called darkness under the light.

220
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,210
Nobody expected the Bone-refining Seal to be hidden in the Divine Platform.

221
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:35,410
Luckily, Jiumin and Susu fought desperately to retrieve the devil's seal.

222
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,620
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

223
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,210
Supposedly, the two devils...

224
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,720
would come up with new tricks to snatch the seal again.

225
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,170
 Master, abnormal movements were detected at the barrier outside of the mountain. 

226
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,720
 It seems the devils are invading us. 

227
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,170
- Who are you? 
 - How dare you intrude on our immortal realm!

228
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,690
All of you may leave.

229
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,373
My brother, long time no see.

230
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,130
Brother Dimian, you were imprisoned by the Devil Lord for 10,000 years.

231
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,050
You finally made it back today. Congratulations.

232
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,700
The past 10,000 years were fleeting.

233
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,650
I think your immortal attire fits you well.

234
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,820
Why not stay here temporarily?

235
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,580
You two can be reunited.

236
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,280
Father, why did you summon me?

237
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,230
If it's about Cang Jiumin's injury, I have handed him to Uncle Zhaoyou

238
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,160
for him to recuperate at his sect per your instruction.

239
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,453
My child.

240
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,580
 Susu. 

241
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,880
 Who are you? 

242
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,590
 Come to me. 

243
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,030
 How come you know my name? 

244
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,110
It's you.

245
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,100
Susu, do you two know each other?

246
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,170
I had been to Barren Abyss and spoken with him.

247
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,820
You fell in rashly at that time.

248
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,010
You would've perished if I didn't notice you in time.

249
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,190
I'm very thankful to you for saving my life.

250
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,790
It seems that you two were fated to know each other.

251
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,813
Susu, come here.

252
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,050
Get down on your knees and kowtow to your father to repay him for giving you life.

253
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,173
No.

254
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,070
I may be her biological father; however,

255
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,100
I haven't raised her for one day.

256
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,680
God has been nice to me for us to reunite here.

257
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,910
My father?

258
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,790
Dad, what's going on?

259
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,210
It's a long story.

260
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,970
During our routing of the devils 10,000 years ago, the Lord of Monsters defected and wounded the Devil Lord grievously.

261
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,220
However, he was sealed in Barren Abyss by the Devil Lord.

262
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,590
 Decades ago, I had an arduous struggle with evil cultivators. 

263
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,010
 I was seriously wounded and fell into the Barren Abyss. I was almost devoured by demons. 

264
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,960
 Fortunately, I fell outside Dimian's cave. 

265
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,780
 He tried his best to cover me with his devil power and repelled demons. 

266
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,910
 That's how I managed to survive. 

267
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:20,540
 To repay his favor, I promised him to find the spirit egg he had with his late wife, Chuhuang. 

268
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,340
 - I haven't seen it. 
 - No. 

269
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,500
 I haven't heard of it. 

270
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,253
 Thank you. 

271
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,270
 Luckily, Heaven rewards one who put forth great effort. 

272
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,050
 I found the spirit egg eventually. 

273
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,240
 It was very difficult to hatch the spirit egg. 

274
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,480
 Then I put it on top of the Magic Well of Sumeru Base. 

275
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,510
 It was nourished by the pure essence of Heaven and Earth. 

276
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,320
 Later, there was movement in the egg. 

277
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,080
 Then I cast its soul into the mortal world. 

278
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,690
It went through life cycles and tribulations constantly.

279
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:25,400
I hoped that one day it could find a chance to hatch.

280
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,230
 She was born on the Magic Well of Heaven Lake and was nourished by the pure essence of Heaven and Earth. 

281
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,860
 Thus, I named her Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal. 

282
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 When Chuhuang died back then, her body turned into the Chongyu Harp, a precious treasure of Hengyang Sect. 

283
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,060
 I gave the Chongyu Harp to that child 

284
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:51,530
 in hopes that she could be protected by her mother somehow. 

285
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,560
 So, the person I encountered was my mother. 

286
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,620
 Dad sent my primordial soul into the mortal world to undergo tribulations constantly. 

287
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,550
 That's why Ye Xiwu existed 500 years ago and looked just like me. 

288
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,610
 Maybe she is the evil part of my soul. 

289
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,710
 My primordial soul should have been restored after the trials of a lifetime,  

290
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,590
 but it was damaged by the Lightning Punishment. 

291
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:25,450
 As a result, after 500 years, my physical body will spontaneously combust without any external flames 

292
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,100
 and rest for ten years in the Sumeru Base. 

293
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,670
 Only when the tribulations end can I truly wake up. 

294
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,600
That's what happened.

295
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,590
Susu, I hid the truth from you for a long time.

296
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,840
You won't blame me, will you?

297
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,660
I…

298
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,203
Susu, you don't have to force yourself.

299
00:35:57,203 --> 00:36:02,460
It's understandable if you don't want to accept me as your father or even hate me.

300
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,650
I don't hate you.

301
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,170
I just don't know what to do.

302
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,880
That's fine.

303
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,180
No matter if you accept me or not, Chief Qu will always be your father.

304
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,280
Nobody can replace the love and care your dad did to bring you up.

305
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,413
All right. No matter if you are willing to call me father or not,

306
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:26,350
we will take care of you together.

307
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,113
Father.

308
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,910
Get up.

309
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,540
It's really strange when I think about it.

310
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,130
My mother is from the Phoenix Clan, but I was born to be afraid of birds and chickens.

311
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,520
It seems that fate is predetermined.

312
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,390
It turns out that I'm afraid of myself.

313
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,450
This is great.

314
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,500
You two have finally reunited today.

315
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,300
A huge burden in my heart has been lifted.

316
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,200
By the way, Brother Dimian, your identity is special.

317
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,220
Please reside in our sect for the time being.

318
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,470
When I find a suitable opportunity, I will invite all sects, clarify this matter,

319
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,210
and let you reestablish yourself in the world with honor and dignity.

320
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,863
Thank you.

321
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,880
Have you heard?

322
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,381
The person who trespassed into our sect was the Lord of Monsters, Dimian,

323
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,100
who commanded thousands of demons 10,000 years ago.

324
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,760
I guess you have no idea.

325
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
His wife is the Goddess of the Universe, Chuhuang.

326
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,310
He risked his life to work for the Devil Lord in order to find his weakness.

327
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,660
That's right. It is said in the legend that he was the one who defeated and killed the Devil Lord

328
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,200
It seems that he has been through a lot and endured many hardships, too.

329
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,590
Finally, he was able to restore his reputation and identity.

330
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,670
All immortal sects should treat him kindly and with respect.

331
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,341
For sure. He was the hero who killed Devil Lord!

332
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,710
 When the seal of His Lordship's Bone-refining Seal was broken, Elder Sister's primordial soul was gathered by accident. 

333
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,900
Elder Sister! You're finally awake!

334
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,770
His Lordship has saved you again!

335
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,340
Elder Sister?

336
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,313
Elder Sister!

337
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,780
I am Siying!

338
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,870
Siying?

339
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:51,450
Your soul was damaged 10,000 years ago.

340
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,940
That's why His Lordship cast you into the mortal realm to suffer tribulations.

341
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,660
Now that your soul has been restored,

342
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,480
we can finally be reunited.

343
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,370
Younger Sister!

344
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,333
Elder Sister!

345
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,410
Susu, 
    

346
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,710
since you now know your true identity,

347
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,540
naturally, you have answers to the changes

348
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,600
that you have undergone since emerging from the retreat.

349
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,220
The Phoenix Clan has a natural affinity for practicing the Heartless Path,

350
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,340
which is considered a shortcut to becoming a god.

351
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,740
However, it is ultimately up to your decision whether or not to pursue this path.

352
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,593
Dad, knowing my origins has strengthened my resolve to pursue my goal.

353
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:54,550
My mother was slain by the Devil Lord,

354
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,840
and my father was imprisoned by him as well.

355
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,020
Whether for public or private reasons,

356
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,920
it's my mission to fight against the Devil Lord.

357
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,460
If the Devil Lord were to be resurrected, only a true god would be able to...

358
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,820
go against him in the Four Continents and Three Realms.

359
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,970
It is quite a heavy burden to be shouldered by you.

360
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,703
It's…

361
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,900
Dad, rest assured. I promise.

362
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,150
The Devil Lord will never be resurrected.

363
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,940
 Although Tantai Jin's evil bone has been extracted, 

364
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,380
 the identity of the demon fetus is still highly sensitive. 

365
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,580
 It would be best to inform them 

366
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,210
 only after I have truly destroyed the evil bone. 

367
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,470
 It's just my practice of the Heartless Path is too… 

368
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,580
Junior Brother Cang, why are you here?

369
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,860
I have come to ask you for a favor today.

370
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,410
I'm all ears.

371
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,860
Actually, I was born in Jing Kingdom 500 years ago.

372
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,060
When I was young, I was loathed by my father

373
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,780
and bullied by others.

374
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,590
I had never felt the warmth of this world...

375
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,500
until a girl suddenly came into my life one day.

376
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,180
At first, she kept saying that she wanted to kill me.

377
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,140
But she saved me repeatedly.

378
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,970
It was she who showed me the joy

379
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,010
and warmth in life, as well as the pain,

380
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,910
the sorrow, and all the beauty that comes with it.

381
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,753
Later,

382
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,190
she told me that she liked me.

383
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,030
I was over the moon at that time.

384
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,160
It would be perfect if time was frozen...

385
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,210
at that moment.

386
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,170
   

387
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,660
Who was that girl?

388
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,220
Her name was Ye Xiwu.

389
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,023
Sadly,

390
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:40,180
I made an irreparable mistake.

391
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,850
She died because of it.

392
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,830
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

393
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,090
Please accept my condolences.

394
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,240
I originally wanted to...

395
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,690
die with her.

396
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,960
But someone told me

397
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,360
that there was a Nether River in this world that converged the souls of the three realms.

398
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,910
In order to see her again,

399
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,410
I found the Nether River

400
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,300
and searched for her for 500 years.

401
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,560
Every day, my flesh and bones were scorched by the Ruo Water,

402
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,030
and the pain was unbearable.

403
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,880
Later on, I couldn't feel the pain anymore.

404
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,890
I felt that I was no longer alive.

405
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,500
Even so, I still couldn't locate her soul.

406
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,580
What happened after that?

407
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,180
Until one day,

408
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,510
I felt that I was about to die.

409
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,940
Fortunately, Immortal Zhaoyou saved me.

410
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,930
I became a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect.

411
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,930
That was what I'd gone through over the past 500 years.

412
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:10,530
Junior Brother Jiumin, why are you telling me all of this?

413
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,600
The Nether River didn't help me to find Ye Xiwu.

414
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,580
However, I read about a Soul-Gathering Array that could help me find Ye Xiwu's soul.

415
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:30,490
However, this array requires the blood of a pure-spirit body as a primer.

416
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,090
Miss Li, can you help me to locate my beloved?

417
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,520
If I do find her,

418
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,990
I am willing to give everything I have...

419
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,260
to make it up to her.

420
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,793
Even if she wants my life,

421
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,030
I will give it to her.

422
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,880
I can't help you. She has already passed away.

423
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,330
Since you've changed your name and started anew,

424
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,640
why not forget about past events completely?

425
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,480
The Ye Xiwu in your heart no longer exists.

426
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,630
She no longer exists?

427
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,870
What do you mean by that?

428
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,570
You have the same face and the same temperament.

429
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,620
Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal, you are Ye Xiwu.

430
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,200
Why don't you dare to admit it?

431
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,050
Do you know something?

432
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,960
You don't even dare to look at me.

433
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,860
Have you heard of Zhuangzi's Dream of the Butterfly? 
  (The dreamer dreamed of himself to be a butterfly that he couldn't tell who he was.) 

434
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,693
What?

435
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:56,920
You can think of Ye Xiwu as that butterfly.

436
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,760
Everything is but a dream.

437
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,130
When you wake up, it should all be dispersed.

438
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,193
Dispersed? How?

439
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,130
It's been 500 years.

440
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,680
I have never forgotten about her.

441
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,960
I have seen her smile and cry.

442
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,600
She hugged me and protected me.

443
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,920
She loved me and hated me.

444
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,930
Even if this is really just a dream, how can I easily wake up from it

445
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,310
if you abandon me in the dream?

446
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,310
I don't understand what you are saying.

447
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,660
I have woken up from my dream.

448
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,230
It has nothing to do with me whether you wake up or not.

449
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,380
Tantai Jin,

450
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,880
if you really wish to make amends,

451
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,960
you should forget about the past and be Cang Jiumin.

Now that the Devil Lord is about to descend upon the world.

We need to be extremely cautious as if on the brink of an abyss.

458
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,140
I have decided to pursue the Heartless Path

00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,560
♫  even being drunken to lose my propriety in a big dream   ♫

480
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,000
♫  Rubbing our heads together, I am greedy of the faint print on your palm  ♫

481
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,080
♫  Out of everyone  ♫

482
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,420
♫  We are lucky we met  ♫

483
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,740
♫   Nothing can compare to a kiss   ♫

484
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,280
♫  I am clearly a player in the game  ♫

485
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,780
♫  Who can be not involved in it?  ♫

486
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:19,280
♫  Our love is rushing through yet the murmurs can't be heard  ♫

487
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,680
♫  I clearly know the more we embrace, the more bodily scars we get  ♫

488
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,100
♫  I still bet my life on you  ♫

489
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,560
♫  The more teardrops will fall when looking back  ♫

490
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,960
♫  Quietly and deeply into your eyes  ♫

491
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,160
♫  Peach blossoms float past your brow ridge  ♫

492
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,150
♫  I don't actually know who is the foil  ♫

493
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,360
♫  Beyond the deepest depths of our hearts  ♫

494
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,070
 She loved me and hated me. 

495
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,230
 Even if this is really just a dream, how can I easily wake up from it 

496
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,280
 if you abandon me in the dream? 

497
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,620
♫  Who can not be involved in it?  ♫

498
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,000
♫  Our love is rushing through yet murmuring not to be heard  ♫

499
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,963
 It turns out that you meant it 

500
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:06,200
 when you said that we will never 

501
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,780
 meet each other again forever. 

502
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,400
♫  A long, long dream together  ♫

503
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,820
♫  Love threads twine around the remaining warmth  ♫

504
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,800
♫  Our love has taken root; once love is planted, it is hard to separate  ♫

505
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,740
♫  Beyond the deepest depths of our hearts  ♫

506
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:29,940
♫  I long for you forever and ever  ♫

507
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,510
For this Immortal Sect Competition, I gave you so many artifacts

508
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,650
to help you come out on top

509
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,770
and bring glory to our Chixiao Sect.

510
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,050
But you didn't seem interested in winning at all.

511
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,450
You harassed a girl instead.

512
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,320
You've let me down.

513
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,260
I'm injured, too. Do you know?

514
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,840
Dad, you don't even intend to get even for me.

515
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,030
Get even for you?

516
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,300
I am too ashamed to see anyone now.

517
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:23,510
When can you bring me glory like Cang Jiumin and Gongye Jiwu did?

518
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,480
I want to be like them, too.

519
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,400
But I'm not as gifted as them.

520
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,070
You always tell me to work hard.

521
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,340
But why don't you work hard to give birth to a kid like them

522
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,690
if you're that capable?

523
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,730
Nonsense!

524
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,480
You!

525
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,040
Kneel and reflect upon your actions for 24 hours!

526
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,700
 Cang Jiumin,  

527
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,200
 just you wait! 

528
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,960
 I'll destroy your reputation 

529
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
 sooner or later. 

530
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,060
So, Cang Jiumin and you knew each other 500 years ago.

531
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,010
You two were even a couple in your mortal life.

532
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,940
The reasons behind it are complicated.

533
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,290
Please forgive me for not being able to explain it to you.

534
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,670
In short,

535
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,220
Cang Jiumin was a part of the tribulation in my past life 500 years ago.

536
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,820
No wonder you have been melancholic ever since you came out of the retreat.

537
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,130
It felt like you changed.

538
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,913
Senior Brother, I don't want to deceive you.

539
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:55,080
What happened between Tantai Jin and me is now in the past.

540
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,640
But after reuniting with him,

541
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,590
I realize...

542
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,580
that even if we can't continue our past relationship,

543
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,610
there is no room...

544
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,810
for anyone else in my heart.

545
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,063
Susu, you are telling me this just to…

546
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,880
Because if I continue to be indecisive,

547
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,130
I will only feel more sorry to you.

548
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,980
I understand now.

549
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,363
Susu,

550
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,620
you don't have to feel guilty.

551
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,940
I failed to realize it earlier as I was not thoughtful enough.

552
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,750
That caused you to suffer alone for a long time.

553
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,120
Although I am not willing to give up,

554
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,220
no matter what,

555
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,230
I hope you can find happiness

556
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,220
according to your heart's desire.

557
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,570
It is not easy to move on from someone.

558
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,400
Give me some time.

559
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,310
In the next few days,

560
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,070
I will ask Master for permission to leave the sect to catch demons.

561
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,640
I hope that when I see you again,

562
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,000
I will be able to face you with an open and calm heart.

563
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,450
And be your Eldest Senior Brother.

564
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,460
Eldest Senior Brother…

565
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,110
Get some good rest.

566
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,860
I'll make a move first.

567
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,860
 I'm sorry, Eldest Senior Brother. 

568
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,110
 A quick decision may incur short-term pain but will save you from long-term suffering. 

569
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,760
 This is the best choice for you and me. 

570
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:09,780
 If you really wish to make amends, you should forget about the past 

571
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,550
 and be Cang Jiumin. 

572
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,280
 As for me, 

573
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,290
 I am Li Susu, daughter of Sect Leader Qu. 

574
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,980
 Now that the Devil Lord is about to descend upon the world. 

575
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,700
 I have decided to pursue the Heartless Path 

576
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,160
 for the rest of my life and eradicate evil in order to uphold justice. 

577
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,230
 It's the Devil Lord again? 

578
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,030
 When the demon fetus reappears 

579
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,320
 and the devil artifacts find their owner, 

580
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,510
 the Devil Lord will be resurrected. 

581
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,630
 The three realms will face destruction by then. 

582
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,230
 I heard that the battle of Barren Abyss happened 

583
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,360
 because Siying and Jingmie, the two remnants of the Devil Lord, 

584
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,020
 lost the demon fetus. 

585
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,840
 That's why they wreaked havoc everywhere. 

586
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,030
 They're trying to find the fetus through the guidance of the devil artifacts. 

587
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,070
