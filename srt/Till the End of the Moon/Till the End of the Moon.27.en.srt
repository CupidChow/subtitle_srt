♫ <i>Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood</i> ♫

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ <i>Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light</i> ♫

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
♫ <i>Is it bright and warm?</i> ♫

5
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,060
♫ <i>I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,120
♫ <i>Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck</i> ♫

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,100
♫ <i>Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me</i> ♫

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,180
♫ <i>I do not fear </i> ♫

♫ <i>Breaking through, struggling to escape</i> ♫

00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,580
♫ <i>How to differentiate between good and bad</i> ♫

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>[Episode 27]</i>

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,680
You've been standing here all night, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,590
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

20
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,030
Would she have died if Pianran and Ye Qingyu arrived a little later?

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,700
The imperial physician said she had been so close to death.

22
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,650
I ask her to live well,

23
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,340
she should do as she's told.

24
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,380
Her life belongs to me. Without my permission,

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,050
she is not allowed to die.

26
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,690
Your Majesty, someone asks to see you.

27
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,660
Ask him to go.

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,320
It's Pang Yizhi. He said he had to see you, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,300
Scholar Pang, what did you come for?

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Majesty, you've addressed me wrongly. Sheng Kingdom has been conquered,

31
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,060
so I'm not the Sheng Kindom's Scholar of the Ministry of Ceremonies but a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

32
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,880
I came to make a divination for you to exchange for one thing.

33
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,980
What's the thing?

34
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,640
Don't you want to know what the divination is about?

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,243
No.

36
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:47,520
Emperor Jin, I can't hold anything back, so I have to say it

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,870
whether it's good or ill luck, or I'll go crazy.

38
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,460
From the divination image,

39
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,960
you'll suddenly lose your love

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,180
and live in pain and regret the rest of your life.

41
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,010
Cannot reclaim your love and be trapped in the underworld.

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,450
It seems you don't want your tongue anymore.

43
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,540
Emperor Jin, be patient. I haven't finished my words.

44
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,580
There are two chances showed in the divination image.

45
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,500
One is in thunder. The other is in water.

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,550
What do you mean?

47
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,190
You know, I'm not proficient.

48
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,820
Sorry, I can't explain it.

49
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
What do you want to exchange it for?

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,830
I want a bottle of your heart blood.

51
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,780
Scholar Pang, what makes you think I would give it to you

52
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,020
after hearing your nonsense?

53
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,460
You have the whole world under you.

54
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,210
Of course, I was not fully confident that you would give it.

55
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,740
However, I have a thunder-series artifact.

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,250
If you give me your heart blood, I'll repay you with it.

57
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,410
What is it?

58
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,380
This is Yin-Yang Twin Bracelets, made from thunder iron. It's an artifact of Xiaoyao Sect.

59
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,210
When two people wear one of the bracelets, the owner of Ying bracelet won't die

60
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,330
if the owner of Yang bracelet is alive.

61
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,210
The reason is that the lifespan of the owner of Yang bracelet

62
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,290
has offset the disasters of the owner of Ying bracelet.

63
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,990
Yet, once you put on the bracelet,

64
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,750
you can't take it off.

65
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,400
<i>Offset disaster.</i>

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm willing to offer the artifact in return for your heart blood.

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,873
Pang Yizhi, what do you want the blood for?

68
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,560
It has nothing to do with you, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Your Majesty.

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,920
We don't know his purpose. Besides, your heart has been injured.

71
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,200
I beg you to think well.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,343
Nian Baiyu. Dagger.

73
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,023
Thank you.

74
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,653
<i>Martial Nephew, I've been practicing martial arts</i>

75
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,700
<i>and learning divination for many years. What is it for?</i>

76
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,290
<i>I can't change what has happened or save my friends.</i>

77
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,480
<i>You're my friend.</i>

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,900
<i>Now, I'll make divination for you.</i>

79
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,250
<i>Xiao Lin, if you were still alive,</i>

80
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,520
<i>you would certainly admonish me from doing this.</i>

81
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,930
<i>Now that you're in the underworld, you can't stop me.</i>

82
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Just let me do what I want to.</i>

83
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,830
<i>From now on, our fates have become one.</i>

84
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

85
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,540
Take her pulse again.

86
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,740
Your Majesty, her pulse is recovering quickly.

87
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,250
She'll wake up in a few hours.

88
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,150
You can all leave.

89
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,183
Yes.

90
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,320
Your Majesty, are you okay?

91
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,250
When Ye Xiwu wakes up, lock her up in the Cold Palace.

92
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
No one is allowed to visit.

93
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,820
She's now my weakness. If she's killed,

94
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,740
my life span will be reduced.

95
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes.

96
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,353
Remember, don't talk about the bracelets to anyone,

97
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,840
including Ye Xiwu.

98
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,493
Yes.

99
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,570
Your Majesty, how do you want to deal with Ye Bingchang?

100
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,810
Have you found why she tried to kill Ye Xiwu?

101
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,360
She said Ye Xiwu caused Xiao Lin's death.

102
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,350
As Xiao Lin's widow, she wanted to avenge his death.

103
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,190
<i>The person who killed Xiao Lin was not Ye Xiwu</i>

104
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,420
<i>but me.</i>

105
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,410
Don't kill her.

106
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,320
Put her in the dungeon. Don't let her go unless she dies.

107
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,023
Yes.

108
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,663
Your Majesty, why does Pang Yizhi want your heart blood?

109
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,550
I think he's up to no good.

110
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,310
And I'm afraid it will be detrimental to you.

111
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,550
Your Majesty, I beg you. Please take care of your health.

112
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,970
I don't care about it.

113
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,810
<i>What did you put in there?</i>

114
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,280
<i>Dry mylabris.</i>

115
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,060
<i>One tiny sip...</i>

116
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,930
<i>is lethal.</i>

117
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,120
<i>Did you cook this porridge for me specifically?</i>

118
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,720
<i>No, Tantai Jin. I didn't want to kill you.</i>

119
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,660
<i>It's all wrong...</i>

120
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,410
<i>Li Susu, are you giving up?</i>

121
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,470
<i>This is...</i>

122
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,253
<i>Barren Abyss.</i>

123
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,170
<i>Li Susu.</i>

124
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,080
<i>Senior Jize.</i>

125
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,440
<i>I failed to kill the Devil Lord.</i>

126
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,950
<i>I've let down your trust.</i>

127
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,640
<i>You not only feel guilty to me, but also feel guilty to Tantai Jin.</i>

129
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,660
<i>Right?</i>

130
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,093
<i>Guilty?</i>

131
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:51,020
<i>I'm surprised that despite being convinced I wanted to fatally poison him,</i>

132
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,820
<i>he was still willing to marry me...</i>

133
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,130
<i>and be with me forever.</i>

134
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,573
<i>Senior, whether he is a demon or a god, since he loves me deeply,</i>

135
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,340
<i>how can I not be guilty?</i>

136
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,970
<i>Silly...</i>

137
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,730
<i>Let me tell you. Even if you and Tantai Jin didn't have such chaotic lives,</i>

138
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,540
<i>this would be how you and Tantai Jin end.</i>

139
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,353
<i>Li Susu, in this lifetime,</i>

140
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:26,260
<i>the fate of you two has already been written.</i>

141
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,920
<i>Whatever you do will have the same ending.</i>

142
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,350
<i>If you don't want to owe him, you have to owe the world.</i>

143
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,580
<i>In Barren Abyss, I mentioned</i>

144
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,330
<i>a dream, a teardrop, and a thread.</i>

145
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,860
<i>Have you understood them?</i>

146
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,530
<i>The tear is Soul-slaying Teardrop.</i>

147
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,340
<i>The silk is Tantai Jin's love thread.</i>

148
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,473
<i>The dream...</i>

149
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,650
<i>Was it Enlightened Life?</i>

150
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,850
<i>Since you've guessed right,</i>

151
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,990
<i>why haven't you woken up yet?</i>

152
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,710
<i>What do you mean?</i>

153
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,770
<i>What are you doing?</i>

154
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,603
<i>Sang Jiu, I'll take the punishment for you.</i>

155
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,290
<i>When my immortal body vanishes,</i>

156
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,730
<i>my divine essence will replace your devil bone.</i>

157
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,810
<i>Mingye, let go of me!</i>

158
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,300
<i>My divine essence will replace your devil bone.</i>

159
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,570
<i>My divine essence will replace your devil bone.</i>

160
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,700
<i>Everything happens for a reason.</i>

161
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,450
<i>Don't indulge in foolishness.</i>

162
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,230
<i>Seize the chance.</i>

163
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,490
<i>My divine essence will replace your devil bone.</i>

164
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,300
<i>If he loses the evil bone, Devil Lord won't return to life.</i>

165
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,690
<i>With the power of the lightning punishment, </i>

166
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,910
<i>Mingye replaced my demon bone with his divine essence.</i>

167
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,460
<i>So similarly, I can replace the evil bone with my divine essence.</i>

168
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,700
<i>But now my body has no power, </i>

169
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,270
<i>let alone divine essence.</i>

170
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,580
<i>What should I do?</i>

171
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,583
<i>That hurts.</i>

172
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,190
<i>With my weak body, </i>

173
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,020
<i>how can I build divine essence and trigger the lightning punishment?</i>

174
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,590
<i>It's a gem that I forged with the divine essence of the entire Flying Serpent clan.</i>

175
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,620
<i>This tiny piece contains the powers of immortals.</i>

176
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,640
<i>It's capable of overturning Heaven and Earth.</i>

177
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,340
<i>Why don't I call it World-alluring Jade?</i>

178
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,790
<i>World-alluring Jade!</i>

179
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,380
<i>That explains it.</i>

180
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,130
<i>This is the succession of cause and effect.</i>

181
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,640
<i>What is this place?</i>

182
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,170
<i>This place looks so familiar.</i>

183
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,420
<i>I feel I've been here.</i>

184
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,950
<i>This is where Tantai Jin lived when he was little.</i>

185
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,180
<i>This is the Cold Palace.</i>

186
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,750
<i>Have you ever seen your mom?</i>

187
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,470
<i>I haven't either.</i>

188
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,220
<i>They say I don't have a mom.</i>

189
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,650
<i>Yue Ruanruan.</i>

190
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,873
You're awake.

191
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,870
How are you feeling?

192
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,240
Here. Eat the medicine.

193
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,650
What's this bracelet for? Why can't I take it off?

194
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,840
I don't know it. It looks like a divine weapon or artifact.

195
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,270
Did Tantai Jin put it on you to stop you from escaping?

196
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,980
I won't escape.

197
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,810
Then, eat the medicine and get well.

198
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,700
Being alive is the most important thing.

199
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,240
They said you didn't eat or drink.

200
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,520
I thought you didn't want medicine but wanted to die.

201
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,340
How can it be?

202
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,390
Good. I've lived for so long

203
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,400
and have known that where there is life, there is hope.

204
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,790
Cheer up.

205
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,200
<i>If I go all out to absorb power from World-alluring Jade, </i>

206
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,300
<i>I'll definitely be devoured completely.</i>

207
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,810
<i>Even if I die, I mustn't die before completing this thing.</i>

208
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,320
<i>Jize's barrier won't last long. I have to hurry. </i>

209
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,610
<i>Your Majesty, this is the elixir refined by the warlocks today.</i>

210
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,250
Your life was reduced for Ye Xiwu.

211
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,700
I'll make the warlocks refine elixirs day and night to extend your life.

212
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,490
This is a drop in the bucket.

213
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,930
But it might be good.

214
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,310
If I'm still alive, Ye Xiwu won't die.

215
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,490
She mustn't die.

216
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm not done with her.

217
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,200
Your Majesty, it seems Ye Xiwu doesn't want to kill herself anymore.

218
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,900
She ate the meals we sent today.

219
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
Did she?

220
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,290
Why don't you go see her?

222
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,680
Ask her about the origin of the spikes,

223
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,480
so that we can find out how to pull them out.

224
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,123
Nian Baiyu.

225
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:22,620
As long as she's alive,

226
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,120
I don't want to know if she has meals or anything trivial like that.

227
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,150
I'm not interested.

228
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,903
Yes.

229
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,973
<i>What a pity.</i>

230
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,940
<i>When I'm devoured by the World-overturning Jade, </i>

231
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,810
<i>I won't see the stars clearly.</i>

232
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,943
<i>Will I...</i>

233
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,060
<i>not be able to see Tantai Jin's face clearly too?</i>

234
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,680
<i>Tantai Jin, I owe you in the lifetime.</i>

235
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,711
<i>But now my life doesn't belong only to me anymore.</i>

236
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:13,160
<i>I will repay you with my life.</i>

237
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,223
<i>As expected, with World-alluring Jade, </i>

238
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,020
<i>my cultivation has advanced considerably.</i>

239
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,840
<i>If I speed it up, the divine essence should be completed soon.</i>

240
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,610
<i>It was almost there.</i>

241
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,920
His Majesty has been working diligently lately.

242
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,690
Old guys like us can't keep up with him, huh?

243
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,110
But isn't His Majesty too harsh with regulating us officials lately?

244
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,720
<i>[Chenming Hall]</i>
I'm afraid His Majesty has been in a terrible mood lately.

245
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,540
<i>[Chenming Hall]</i>
It's more than a bad mood.

246
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,860
His Majesty seems to have health issues these days.

247
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,050
Could the rumor be true that His Majesty's meridians are badly injured and will die soon?

248
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't say that. Stop talking nonsense. Let's go.

249
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,800
This puppetry spell is recorded in the Yiyue Tribe's ancient books.

250
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,750
But it usually can only control one person.

251
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,080
After I improve it with Chixiao Sect's instrument forging methods,

252
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,220
you will be able to control thousands.

253
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,430
Mighty Ruo Water,

254
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,230
control the souls.

255
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,710
Wake up.

256
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
Wake up.

257
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,070
Wake up.

258
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,700
These civilians King Sheng sent us

259
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,050
will be your soldiers to fight for you and listen to your commands.

260
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,440
Congratulations, Your Highness.

261
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,860
With the ten thousand Nether Soldiers, our great plan will definitely succeed.

262
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,170
Your Majesty, recently in the southern borders,

263
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,200
suspicious people have been seen again.

264
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,020
They turn civilians into puppet demonic soldiers and wreak havoc everywhere.

265
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,500
They are large in number and are no longer small groups like before.

266
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,430
Did you find out who's behind this?

267
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,500
According to the scouts, the southern borders are covered by miasma.

268
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,920
The source of these demonic soldiers seems to be deep in the poisonous miasma.

269
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,020
They can't probe deeper since only Sheng civilians are involved,

270
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,120
so most ministers think this can be ignored.

271
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,700
Although they are remnants of Sheng, they're people of Jing now.

272
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,400
Go investigate immediately.

273
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,033
Yes.

274
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,873
Your Majesty, there's another thing.

275
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:23,453
What is it?

276
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:26,900
Ye Xiwu was found unconscious on the ground this morning.

277
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
Now she is awake.

278
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,500
We couldn't find out the cause.

279
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
We can only presume it's due to her weak body.

280
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Also, her hearing seems to have declined.

281
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,300
And she has poor eyesight.

282
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,380
It could be due to her being kept inside for a long time.

283
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,990
Your Majesty, please send a doctor to treat her.

284
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,100
No need to report

285
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,740
as long as she's not dead.

286
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,700
Why is the water filled?

287
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,660
When did this happen?

288
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,830
Congratulations, Your Highness, your spell has been completed.

289
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,240
Now with the Ruo Water Puppets to fight for you, you can devour the demonic energy without limit.

290
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
You can definitely kill Tantai Jin and get back to the throne.

291
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
You don't need to comfort me.

292
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,370
I'm perfectly aware.

293
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,960
Swallowing demonic cores and devouring the demonic energy

294
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,510
is the cause of this appearance of being between life and death.

295
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,080
My days are numbered. I'll die soon.

296
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,500
All this is because I won't accept my fate.

297
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,533
I'll do anything...

298
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,220
to fulfill my ambition.

299
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,420
But you... You've been following me since I was young.

300
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,570
I must thank you.

301
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,260
I've been following you since you were young and weren't made the crown prince.

302
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,630
I'm willing to follow you till the end.

303
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,400
Spread the news that I'm on the southern border.

304
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,460
When Tantai Jin knows, he'll definitely come personally.

305
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,630
I'll drag him into hell with me.

306
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,040
This fight between us won't stop till death.

307
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,800
It can never be reconciled.

308
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,810
Since you have such a resolution, you'll definitely succeed.

309
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,430
I'm willing to assist you with my life.

310
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,300
My men, listen! Let's go to war!

311
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,320
<i>Your Majesty, we've found that the mastermind behind the demonic soldiers is indeed Tantai Minglang.</i>

312
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,260
<i>Now he's hiding on the southern border and controlling civilians with demonic spells.</i>

313
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,760
<i>He gathered ten thousand puppets and has a demonic woman cultivator with him.</i>

314
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,680
<i>According to the chamberlains of Sheng Palace,</i>

315
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,920
<i>it was this woman who advised King Sheng to hold rituals with your mother's bones.</i>

316
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,853
<i>I shall...</i>

317
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,333
<i>personally...</i>

318
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,340
fight this war.

319
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,980
<i>Wise decision!</i>

320
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,080
<i>Wise decision!</i>

321
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,180
<i>Wise decision!</i>

322
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,190
<i>Wise decision!</i>

323
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,120
<i>[Jing Capital]</i>

324
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,440
<i>With the World-alluring Jade's side effects,</i>

325
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,840
<i>my body can't last for too long.</i>

326
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,260
<i>I'm about to forge the divine essence.</i>

327
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,700
<i>With it, I'll be able to trigger the lightning punishment.</i>

328
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,120
<i>I hope there's still time.</i>

329
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,920
Your Majesty, according to the refugees who got out,

330
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
thick fog started to appear a few days ago.

331
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,200
And the people in it will lose contact with the outside world.

332
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,833
This should be...

333
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,790
Tantai Minglang's place of demonic cultivation.

334
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,200
Your Majesty, there should be a lot of trapped civilians inside.

335
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,720
I've sent men go probe in there first.

336
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
The troops will pass after safety is confirmed.

337
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,420
- What is going on?
- What's that?

338
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,440
Have them come out now. Something's not right.

339
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,400
- This fog is poisonous.
- I'll go rescue them.

340
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,551
The poisonous miasma is too dangerous to go in.

341
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,900
Oh my, Third Brother, you're so alert.

342
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,520
But the entire southern border has been turned into a poisonous fortress.

343
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,220
I guarantee that anyone who enters shall not return.

344
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,360
Your abilities to control little animals won't be of use here.

345
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,610
Let this place be your

346
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,230
burial ground.

347
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,360
<i>This terrain is quite dangerous.</i>

348
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,160
<i>I'm afraid Tantai Minglang has troops waiting in ambush.</i>

349
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,030
<i>I must first clear the poisonous miasma to reduce our casualties.</i>

350
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,080
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

351
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,160
<i>- What happened?
- Look! What's that?</i>

352
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,040
<i>- It's the miasma.
- It has dispersed!</i>

353
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,580
- Your Majesty.
- Looks like the rumor is true. His heart and meridians are truly injured.

354
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,210
Let me see how long your injured heart can last.

355
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,560
Spread my order. Whoever kills Tantai Jin shall be a marquis.

356
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,260
<i>Kill Tantai Jin!</i>

357
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,950
<i>We mustn't fight a protracted war. The southern border is full of danger.</i>

358
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,190
<i>We have to keep our morale up by fighting a quick battle.</i>

359
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,123
Baiyu, follow me closely.

360
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:53,953
Yes. Go.

361
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,980
Protect His Majesty.

362
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>Charge!</i>

363
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,980
Tantai Jin is eager to save his people.

364
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,310
He's forcing out his power.

365
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,390
Let's just let him show off for now.

366
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,490
When his power runs out,

367
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,650
my preparations should be finished.

368
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,320
Fu Yu, I'll go first.

369
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
You come later.

370
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,090
Tantai Jin,

371
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,830
let's see how much longer you can hide.

372
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,020
You'll regret it

373
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,290
after you occupied the poisonous fortress.

374
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,840
Why isn't General Ye at the battle ground?

375
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,160
His Majesty already secured multiple victories.

376
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,850
But you're here wielding your weapon.

377
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,270
Does His Majesty not trust you?

378
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,170
That's not true.

379
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,520
His Majesty told me to guard the capital in case the rebels launch a sneak attack.

380
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,860
Tantai Minglang is a treacherous one.

381
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,830
His Majesty gives this important mission to me.

382
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,510
It means he trusts me.

383
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,830
It seems General Ye takes the idiom sleeping with your weapon literally.
<i>(To be prepared for battle)</i>

384
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,120
Well, I'm different.

385
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,220
I just want to stay in the capital and shy away from work.

386
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,570
Chief Pianran, how do you know

387
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,430
if I'm sleeping with my weapon or not?

388
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,503
Ye Qingyu,

389
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,550
you've been corrupted.

390
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,160
Focus on your practice.

391
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,560
I'll go check on the city gates.

392
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,030
Look at those dark clouds.

393
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,940
How unusual.

394
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,500
<i>There's thunder.</i>

395
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,230
<i>The lightning punishment is coming.</i>

396
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,050
<i>Ye Xiwu, you must hang on.</i>

397
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,590
<i>- The sky looks weird.
- No, it's not.</i>

398
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,740
<i>This seems like an ominous sign.</i>

399
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,360
<i>Is His Majesty suffering a defeat in the war?</i>

400
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,400
<i>We've only lived a few peaceful days.</i>

401
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,853
<i>- Don't tell me...</i>
- News of victory!

402
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:43,260
News of victory!

403
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,990
<i>With His Majesty taking the lead,</i>

404
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,500
<i>our troops smashed into enemy territory.</i>

405
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,030
<i>We will conquer the poisonous fortress soon.</i>

406
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,710
<i>We've captured more than 3,000 rebels and saved over 10,000 civilians.</i>

407
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,820
Is today some kind of festival?

408
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,010
Why's everybody so excited?

409
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,500
Don't you know it yet?

410
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,020
The rebel Tantai Minglang has been defeated.

411
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,470
<i>Your Highness, I've found a side door to the old city</i>

412
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,150
<i>at the northwest corner of the Jing capital.</i>

413
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,760
<i>Since it's recently being renovated, few people go through it</i>

414
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,750
<i>and there aren't many guards there.</i>

415
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,280
What's your business?

416
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
Material delivery.

417
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,500
Stop for a routine inspection.

418
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,990
You don't look familiar.

419
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,290
Are you carrying any prohibited goods?

420
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,653
Enemy attack!

421
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:50,060
<i>Tantai Jin, I didn't expect there would be someone you actually care for in this world.</i>

422
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,760
<i>I'm surprised.</i>

423
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,600
<i>It's the thunder.</i>

424
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,900
<i>I'm about to succeed.</i>

425
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,460
<i>What happened?</i>

426
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,200
<i>Run!</i>

427
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,400
<i>Tantai Jin, I'm coming.</i>

428
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,730
Your Highness, the gate to the Jing capital is open.

429
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,240
You'll achieve your ambition very soon.

430
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,180
Well done.

431
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Where do these burglars come from? How dare you trespass my territory?

432
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,260
A fox demon wants to guard Tantai Jin's city?

433
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,270
I like eating black-hearted demons the most.

434
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,620
A mixture of human and demon like you perfectly suits my taste.

435
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,030
Your Highness, the Ruo Water Puppets are ready.

436
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,840
Mighty Ruo Water, control her soul.

437
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,780
Please enter the palace first.

438
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,230
Leave this fox demon to me.

439
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,020
Try your best.

440
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,423
Yes.

441
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,583
Go.

442
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,990
Slay our way in!

443
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,950
<i>Attack!</i>

444
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,550
<i>Don't hurt innocent civilians!</i>

445
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,820
Are you being serious with me?

446
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,060
Demon-hunting Crossbow!

447
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,040

450
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,093
Ye Qingyu!

451
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:35,793
Ye Qingyu!

452
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,580
Pianran, look at me.

453
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,960
I have something to say to you.

454
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,980
I've failed my kingdom and family.

455
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,480
Now I die for protecting the civilians

456
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,820
and protecting my loved one.

457
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,600
This death is worth it.

458
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,040
What are you talking about? You won't die.

459
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,470
I won't let you die.

460
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,633
Ye Qingyu.

461
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,000
I thought I would never be as good as Jiang Rao.

462
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,900
Because he's already dead.

463
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,330
He'll live in your heart forever.

464
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,520
I didn't expect that now I'm also...

465
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,640
Ye Qingyu, you're not Jiang Rao.

466
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,460
And don't even think about becoming Jiang Rao.

467
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,640
You are Ye Qingyu.

477
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,753
Pianran, demons live much longer than humans.

478

Will you still remember me

479

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,820
♫ <i> Embracing the endless lingering fear </i> ♫

524
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,260
♫ <i> I've admired you through the myriad of years </i> ♫

525
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,420
♫ <i> I believed I have been loved for a moment </i> ♫

526
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,040
♫ <i> I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil </i> ♫

527
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:58,000
♫ <i> And become devout like the flawless moonlight </i> ♫

528
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,520
♫ <i> Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

529
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,420
♫ <i> and how they are just like any other creature </i> ♫

530
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,580
♫ <i> No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars </i> ♫

531
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,580
♫ <i> The moonlight is my armor </i> ♫

532
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,000
♫ <i> I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars </i> ♫

533
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,220
♫ <i> And willingness to live a life in peace </i> ♫

534
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,840
♫ <i> You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil </i> ♫

535
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:34,780
♫ <i> And learned to love what you used to resent </i> ♫

536
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:42,580
♫ <i> Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky </i> ♫

537
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:51,020
♫ <i> And we'll make it something to remember us by</i> ♫
