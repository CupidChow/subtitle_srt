<i>[Episode 23]</i>

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,820
Ye Qingyu.

19
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,410
You're awake.

20
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,550
You were drunk last night.

21
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,360
Do you have a headache?

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,080
I was being impulsive after drinking last night.

23
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,010
Please don't take it to heart.

24
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,210
I can tell what's real and what's not.

25
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,640
That's good, then.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,890
Ye Qingyu, I…

27
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,450
You're here to ask me about the antidote, right?

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,360
You can be frank with me.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,760
I can't stay here any longer.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,200
Give me the antidote.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
And I'll leave the capital by myself.

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,020
Why? Is it because of me?

33
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,010
I really don't know if I should feel honored

34
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,170
or unfortunate.

35
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,980
Ye Qingyu, it's impossible between us.

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,450
What do I have to do for you to give me the antidote?

37
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,040
There is no antidote.

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,390
What?

39
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,720
His Majesty told me that the pill he forced you to swallow

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,500
was just a regular tonic pill.

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,930
Tantai Jin!

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,960
So, you're free.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,150
Tantai Jin said he gave the antidote to you.

44
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,680
I can never leave your side

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,050
as long as you use that excuse to keep me around.

46
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,570
Why did you tell me the truth?

47
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,020
You're a woman of your word.

48
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,910
And I enjoyed momentary pleasure with you.

49
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,790
I dare not expect God to favor me again.

50
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,130
Pianran, encountering you

51
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,630
was the most fortunate event that has happened to me.

52
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,610
What if I...

53
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,360
feel like staying in the capital again?

54
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,440
It's okay. You can go wherever you want.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,810
If you don't wish to see me,

56
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,360
I can write to His Majesty and leave the capital myself.

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,630
Ye Qingyu, are you truly a fool?

58
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,740
Or are you pretending to be one?

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,970
Forget it. I can't bother to explain it to you.

60
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,560
Anyway, I'm free now.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I can go wherever I want.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,650
Now, I feel like staying in the capital again.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,070
Pianran.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,430
So, we can spend time with each other again.

65
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,140
Right?

66
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,190
I guess.

67
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,310
It depends on your performance.

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,950
Xiwu, have you two reconciled with each other?

69
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
There's nothing to reconcile about.

70
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,990
There are no overnight grudges between husband and wife.

71
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,630
Little One, you must tell me if you feel troubled.

72
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,350
Don't hold it in and suffer alone.

73
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm perfectly fine.

74
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,960
How can that be?

75
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,220
Tantai Jin is the emperor now.

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
And our family has fallen from grace.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,580
You may inevitably be subjected to humiliation in front of him.

78
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,430
What humiliation?

79
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,550
I made him sleep on the floor last night.

80
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,630
Second Sister, you're excellent at taming your husband.

81
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,950
Speaking of which, Bingchang hasn't returned home yet

82
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,740
since she arrived in the capital.

83
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,300
Now, Eldest Sister is the noble Madam Xuancheng.

84
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,280
Tantai Jin lets her live in the palace.

85
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,360
I think he's afraid that Xiao Lin may snatch her away.

86
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,630
It's always safer to hide in the palace.

87
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,950
When she's in the Palace of Jing,

88
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,370
Xiao Lin will have to hold back.

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,970
They won't ignore her.

90
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,120
Has Bingchang suffered any grievances then?

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
Don't worry, Grandmother.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
Tantai Jin isn't that kind of person.

93
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
If you're still worried,

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,630
I'll visit Eldest Sister after dinner

95
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,600
and ask her if she's willing to move back.

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,980
Good.

97
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,530
Come on, eat up.

98
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,540
That's the gist of it.

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,270
Sister, you must have suffered for the past few days.

100
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,030
I'll apologize to you on Tantai Jin's behalf.

101
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,860
There's no need to say that, Sister.

102
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,360
How could I make the emperor apologize to me?

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm happy for you that you two have reconciled with each other.

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,500
That's typical of Tantai Jin. He's so capricious.

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,730
Just don't take it to heart.

106
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,320
If you can't get used to living in the palace,

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,130
I can speak with Tantai Jin and tell him to let you leave.

108
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,690
You can go home and live with Grandmother and Father.

109
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,290
No need.

110
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,830
I mean, His Majesty must have his reasons to let me stay in the palace.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,650
Besides, I've already gotten used to it.

112
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,720
I shouldn't go home and disturb Grandmother and Father.

113
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,540
But…

114
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,380
Second Sister, we are both married women.

115
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,760
How can we keep living in our parents' home?

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,730
It's good for you that you can stay by His Majesty's side.

117
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,330
But me?

118
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,280
Sixth Prince is still missing.

119
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,780
If I live at home, I'll look like a divorced woman instead.

120
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,970
Our neighbors will criticize us.

121
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,620
It's better if I live in the palace.

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,540
All right.

123
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,100
But Grandmother and Father do miss you very much.

124
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,050
Please visit them when you're free.

125
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,140
All right. Thanks for your concern.

126
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,220
Then I'll head back first.

127
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,700
<i>Tantai Jin still loves her deeply despite how Second Sister treated him.</i>

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,940
<i>If I stay in the palace, I might still have a chance.</i>

129
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,640
<i>If I move home, it'll be difficult to see Tantai Jin again.</i>

130
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,080
<i>I didn't expect that he had no desire for me.</i>

131
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
<i>If I want to live off him,</i>

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,960
<i>I must be of use to him.</i>

133
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,770
Your Majesty.

134
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,910
You may speak from there.

135
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,810
I...

136
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,670
I don't know what I have done wrong

137
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,910
to make you dislike me.

138
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,590
You have done nothing wrong.

139
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,460
Once I capture Xiao Lin,

140
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll let you two reunite.

141
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,260
Your Majesty, do you have to capture Prince Xuancheng?

142
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,000
Why did you think I allowed you to stay here in the first place?

143
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,000
Your Majesty, I have something to discuss with you.

144
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,170
The rations I borrowed two days ago will run out in another two days.

145
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,610
We're out of medicine and bandages, too.

146
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,440
What should we do?

147
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Is there any nearby county which we haven't borrowed rations from?

148
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,670
There's none.

149
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,020
Try again then.

150
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,070
Your Highness, you're now a rebel.

151
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,100
We're all wanted criminals.

152
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,850
Forget about borrowing rations.

153
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,640
They have already done us one last favor by not reporting us to the local authorities.

154
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,470
Junior Martial Uncle, what are our odds of winning

155
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,470
if we keep this up?

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,630
Well, you see…

157
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,950
We have no chance of winning. Right?

158
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,010
There's nothing we can do about it.

159
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,970
Do you still remember you, me, and Qingyu

160
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,800
used to discuss state affairs in the capital?

161
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,640
<i>Common folks always suffer</i>

162
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,820
<i>no matter how the kingdom does.</i>

163
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,580
<i>It's always been like this.</i>

164
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,020
<i>I've engaged the people of Jing in battle on numerous occasions.</i>

165
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,520
<i>Although Jing Kingdom is our enemy,</i>

166
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,690
<i>their soldiers and civilians</i>

167
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,600
<i>are made of flesh and blood too.</i>

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
Qingyu was right.

169
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,380
To common folks, war is detrimental no matter if it's won or lost.

170
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,450
Now, Tantai Jin fights for peace.

171
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,020
People want him to unite the world.

172
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,630
Maybe I should lead our remaining people southward

173
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,650
and leave this place.

174
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,630
How could you harbor such thoughts?

175
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,200
Your Highness!

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,710
Your Highness, the spy we planted in the Capital of Jing sent us a secret letter.

177
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,550
It's for you.

178
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,340
It's Bingchang's handwriting.

179
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,210
No wonder Tantai Jin allowed her to write to you.

180
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,160
The content of the letter praises his benevolence.

181
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,520
Looks like Tantai Jin is still bent on making you surrender.

182
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,150
<i>[Tantai Jin rules the world with dignity and love. Everyone reveres him and he is diligent with politics. He is brilliant and divine and loves civilians as if they were his children.]</i>

183
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,460
Something's not right.

184
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,980
What do you mean?

185
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,500
<i>[Help]</i>

186
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,000
<i>[Jingyao Gate]</i>

187
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,810
Court dismissed.

188
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
General Ye.

189
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,040
Your Majesty.

190
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,000
Disaster relief impacts many people.

191
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,040
You're from the Sheng Kingdom.

192
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,790
I feel most reassured to let you

193
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,600
help the refugees to settle down.

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,720
I shall not fail you, Your Majesty.

195
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,140
Now, the world is united.

196
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,470
I desire for the people of Sheng Kingdom to settle down and recoup their losses

197
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,880
more than anyone else.

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,830
And I appreciate your kindness more than anyone else.

199
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,250
Today's the Qixi Festival.
<i>(Chinese festival similar to Valentine's Day)</i>

200
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,190
I heard that the night of Qixi in the Capital of Jing is the liveliest.

201
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,830
Why don't you...

202
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,360
leave the palace and go for a stroll with Pianran?

203
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,830
Go ahead.

204
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,360
<i>Ye Xiwu.</i>

205
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,740
<i>Bravo!</i>

206
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,690
Let's go.

207
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,550
Now, Sheng and Jing are united. The state is in peace.

208
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,860
We can finally have a proper festival.

209
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.

210
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,220
You accomplished a good deed.

211
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,260
I just did what a ruler should do.

212
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,140
Are you all right?

213
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,890
I'm fine.

214
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,450
It's crowded here.

215
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,360
Today's the last day of the Water Festival.

216
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,810
And it's also the Qixi Festival.

217
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,060
The townsfolk are all out on the streets.

218
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,140
The liveliest day of the year is today.

219
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,720
Tantai Jin,

220
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,220
why are they all wearing masks?

221
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,390
It's for the seven-day-long deity parade during the Water Festival.

222
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,480
It is said that it will help exorcise demons and ghosts.

223
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,100
You'll understand if we run into one later.

224
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,340
<i>Masks for sale!</i>

225
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,020
Sir, pick one.

226
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,860
Let's get one and follow the customs.

227
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,170
Okay.

228
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,980
Don't just agree verbally. Pay up.

229
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,370
Come. This one suits you.

230
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,070
I want this one.

231
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,640
Okay, thank you.

232
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,130
Thank you.

233
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,860
Let's go.

234
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,470
Masks for sale!

235
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,380
Masks for sale!

236
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,170
Sir, take a look.

237
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,250
I didn't expect that we would be able to enter the Capital of Jing so fast.

238
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,660
Keep your guard up. Stay cautious.

239
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,380
This is enemy territory after all.

240
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,030
Yes, sir.

241
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,900
All right.

242
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,410
Let's go.

243
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,410
You scared me.

244
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,890
Please feel free to try.

245
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,640
Try this one. It's freshly made.

246
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,980
- Thanks.
- Okay.

247
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,820
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

248
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,770
Take a look at this.

249
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,640
Exquisite craft for sale. It brings you good luck.

250
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,440
Take a look!

251
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
It's so pretty.

252
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,830
It's a white jade scepter.

253
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,020
<i>[Ward off evil and diseases]</i>

254
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,260
Excuse me.

255
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,620
<i>[Ward off evil and diseases]</i>

256
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,020

257
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,770
<i>Bravo!</i>

258
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,410
Like this.

259
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,810
<i>Bravo!</i>

260
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,370
<i>Bravo!</i>

261
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,680
<i>Pick me!</i>

262
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,330
Me?

263
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,630
Tantai Jin, what is this?

264
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,230
This is a custom of Jing.

265
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,670
When you're picked by the chief magician,

266
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,080
you'll be the goddess of this year's Water Festival.

267
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,620
Go now. You'll be blessed with good luck.

268
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay.

269
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,840
Why did he pick you then?

270
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,950
Are you a goddess, too?

271
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,370
Are you a god then?

272
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,760
Miss, what's with the question?

273
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,260
Have you not celebrated the Water Festival before?

274
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,390
I'm from the Sheng Kingdom.

275
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,330
No wonder.

276
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,850
Since the magician pointed at him,

277
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,270
that means he has been chosen as the Devil Lord.

278
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,330
You heard of the war between the devils and gods that happened 10,000 years ago. Right?

279
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,260
He has been chosen as the Devil Lord to join the parade with you.

280
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,960
Go now.

281
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,380
You were picked by the magician to pray for the world.

282
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,810
You'll be blessed with peace and happiness, too.

283
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,700
You need to finish the sword dance rite with the Devil Lord.

284
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,780
After that, you have to kill the Devil Lord.

Wouldn't it be a waste if we were to get drunk?

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,710
How about…

335
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,140
What were you thinking?

336
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,540
I…

337
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,330
The moon is clear and bright tonight.

338
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,850
It's perfect for fox demons to cultivate their powers.

339
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,160
I actually forgot about that.

340
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,620
If I don't absorb enough moon essence in time,

341
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,160
even demons like us will grow old.

342
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,220
By then, you'll be scared to death when my hair turns gray...

343
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,270
and my face is full of wrinkles.

344
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,570
Even so, you'll still be the cutest to me.

345
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,470
But I'm a mortal. At most, I can live a hundred years.

346
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,530
I'm afraid I have no chance to witness that moment.

347
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,090
Actually, there's a simple solution to it. There's a legend among fox spirits.

348
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,700
Legend has it that if you're married to your true love, with a bite on the arm as an oath and a drop of blood as a vow,

349
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,340
even if one of them dies, their soul will not head to the underworld.

350
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,560
This way, they can be together forever.

351
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,220
Really?

352
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,190
I haven't tried it before. How would I know?

353
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:37,310
Even if that day does comes, I won't give it a try.

354
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll drink a lot of wine, find another man,

355
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,800
and forget about you completely.

356
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,400
If so, I can rest at ease.

357
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:58,530
♫ <i>Let the sweetness of your slight smile and the saltiness of my tears</i> ♫

358
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,710
♫ <i>be your repayment and my debt</i> ♫

359
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:11,730
♫ <i>Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?</i> ♫

360
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,970
♫ <i>A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away</i> ♫

361
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:26,210
♫ <i>Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is like piercing my bone with a sword</i> ♫

362
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,660
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

363
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,400
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

364
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,840
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

365
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,640
Miss.

366
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,640
Do you guys want to buy some candy?

367
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,690
Little Sister, were you separated from your parents?

368
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,550
You're so young. Why are you selling things alone here?

369
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,560
Stop right there.

370
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,360
What are you doing?

371
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,370
I'll buy the whole basket.

372
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,570
Where are your parents?

373
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,680
They're dead.

374
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,160
Come.

375
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,790
Take this pouch and go to the new orphanage located at the East Palace Gate.

376
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,200
Find the manager there. He'll find you a new place to live.

377
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,490
- Thank you, Brother.
- Go now.

378
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,160
Why did you buy so much candy?

379
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,060
To eat.

380
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,830
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

381
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,370
Let's go.

382
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,830
Your Highness, Tantai Jin hasn't returned to the palace yet.

383
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,370
Okay. Let's split up and execute the plan.

384
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,100
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

385
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,530
<i>Over there!</i>

386
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,470
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

387
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,760
They almost caught us.

388
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,050
Why were they chasing you?

389
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,360
I guess they want to see me.

390
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,610
See you for what?

391
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,470
I heard that Tantai Wuji was unable to win over civilians' hearts,

392
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,470
Tantai Minglang was tyrannical and was killed by a swarm of mice.

393
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,390
The day I entered the capital, countless mice fled, and the tyrant died.

394
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,390
The news spread and people regarded it as an auspicious sign.

395
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,530
Later, they even said that I was a god sent from above.

396
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,030
See, everyone does love you.

397
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,110
They're just following the herd.

398
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,580
Now, they see me as a god.

399
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,100
But they might see me as a devil later.

400
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,390
Why are you belittling yourself like this?

401
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,230
You deserve to be liked by people after accomplishing a good deed.

402
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,140
I think you just lack compliments.

403
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,310
You'll get used to it after being praised by us for a few more years.

404
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,560
<i>No, I'm afraid he won't have a few more years.</i>

405
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,940
<i>I must destroy the evil bone within one year.</i>

406
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,990
I don't care...

407
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,460
whether people like me or not.

408
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,330
It's enough as long as you are willing to like me.

409
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,640
You should have this.

410
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,560
I don't like it.

411
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,020
If so, why did you buy so many of them?

412
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,140
Do you still remember the previous New Year's Eve?

413
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,260
That was my first time strolling through the street.

414
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,290
You bought me a new coat.

415
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,980
It was snowing that day.

416
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,770
And it got dark pretty soon.

417
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,750
On our way home,

418
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,020
we met a woman selling firecrackers.

419
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,710
<i>Sister, I'll buy all the firecrackers in your basket.</i>

420
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,540
<i>Miss,</i>

421
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,870
<i>I made these firecrackers with my own hands.</i>

422
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,020
<i>I'm afraid they are not very good-looking.</i>

423
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,740
<i>Don't worry. I like ones like that. </i>

424
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,400
<i>Miss...</i>

425
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,280
<i>You can have this, too..</i>

426
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,170
<i>Happy New Year, sister.</i>

427
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,940
<i> Miss!</i>

428
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,810
♫ <i>Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave</i> ♫

429
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,420
Back then, I couldn't understand why you did so.

430
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,820
But now, I can understand why.

431
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,400
Understand what?

432
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,650
♫ <i>I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish</i> ♫

433
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,050
I understand how tough it is for the sick.

434
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,740
I understand how miserable it is for the poor.

435
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,470
I understand sympathy.

436
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,730
And I understand the desire to do good.

437
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,810
♫ <i>I would send ashes and brightness to the moon</i> ♫

438
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,890
I can feel their pain and hardships.

439
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,230
Now,

440
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,550
I just want to do everything I can to help more people.

441
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,160
For some reason,

442
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,610
ever since I came back from the bottom of the Mo River

443
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,020
♫ <i>A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears</i> ♫

444
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,210
...and had you by my side, it seemed like...

445
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,100
I was able to feel more and more emotions.

446
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,260
Suddenly, I was able to appreciate...

447
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,350
how beautiful this world is.

448
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>What will happen if I tell him about the evil bone?</i>

449
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,650
<i>Maybe he won't turn into the Devil Lord on his initiative</i>

450
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,590
<i>once he knows the truth.</i>

451
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,330
<i>And I'll be able to be with him forever and protect him.</i>

452
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,370
<i>I won't need to turn my Soul-slaying Teardrop into spikes</i>

453
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,900
<i>and stab his heart with them.</i>

454
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,070
What's wrong?

455
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,760
Tantai Jin,

456
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,070
I think...

457
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,630
there's something...

458
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,530
you have to know.

459
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,400
What is it?

460
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,050
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
- I…

461
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,600
Your Majesty! There you are!

462
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,930
How could you leave the palace without telling me?

463
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,310
Even if you forbade me from following you,

464
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,670
at least you should notify me.

465
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,460
Second Young Miss, you're also here.

466
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,930
I guess I'll leave.

467
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,610
Never mind.

468
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,530
It's getting late. I'll return with you.

469
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,320
<i>Forget it. I'll find another chance to tell him.</i>

470
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,460
<i>Your Majesty, I have something to discuss with you.</i>

471
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,050
<i>Will you let me stay by your side</i>

472
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,830
<i>if I assist you in capturing Prince Xuancheng?</i>

473
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,950
<i>The city gates are open on the night of the Water Festival.</i>

474
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,870
<i>Tonight's the only night Xiao Lin can enter the city.</i>

475
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,390
<i>If he succeeds, my safety will be guaranteed.</i>

476
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,420
<i>If he fails, this will be my gift to Tantai Jin.</i>

477
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>Either way, it's my win.</i>

478
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,460
<i>Seems like the show's about to begin.</i>

479
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,610
No need to hide. Show yourself.

480
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,380
Eldest Young Miss Ye, stay quiet. It's me.

481
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,450
Scholar Pang?

482
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,590
We're running out of time. Let's go!

483
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,990
<i>If Pang Yizhi is here, that means the plan worked.</i>

484
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,020
<i>Xiao Lin is definitely here.</i>

485
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,070
Xiao Lin, now, you're the only survivor of the Sheng Kingdom.

486
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,380
You should cherish your life.

487
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,340
My life means nothing compared to the calamity my kingdom is facing.

488
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,590
Is it a calamity your kingdom is facing or is it a personal affair?

489
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,090
Eldest Young Miss Ye, what's wrong?

490
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,860
<i>The final winner is still unknown.</i>

491
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,160
<i>I can't leave yet.</i>

492
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,830
Scholar Pang, I can't walk.

493
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,090
You guys should hurry and escape. Don't worry about me.

494
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,570
His Highness entrusted you to me. How could I leave you behind?

495
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,150
Zhong Tai!

496
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,620
- Scholar Pang.
- Escort Eldest Young Miss Ye out of here.

497
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,180
Yes, sir.

498
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,210
Someone! Help!

499
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,470
- Help!
- Stop!

500
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,470
What happened?

501
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,560
There are assassins in the palace!

502
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,020
You must be careful!

503
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,340
Someone's trying to assassinate Tantai Jin?

504
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,220
Let them go.

505
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,300
Are you going to kill me?

506
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,460
Xiao Lin, the conflict between the two kingdoms just ended not long ago.

507
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,480
The world is gradually regaining peace.

508
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,340
If you kill me today,

509
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,240
the two kingdoms will descend into chaos again.

510
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,280
Countless people will die.

511
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,030
You know that...

512
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,240
better than anyone.

513
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,240
That's why you won't kill me.

514
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,590
Why are you here today?

515
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,720
I want you to pull back your troops and end the war.

516
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,170
A fair request.

517
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,680
But it's a shame.

518
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,670
Today,

519
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,270
you don't get to bargain with me.

520
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,430
You knew I was going to assassinate you tonight?

521
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,160
Every inch of land is my territory now.

522
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,740
Now, my eyes and ears are everywhere.

523
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,570
My informant will tell me everything, including when you made your plan

524
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,780
and when you will set off.

525
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,740
Today, Prince Xuancheng, you came here uninvited.

526
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,540
It would be rude of me not to give you a warm welcome.

527
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,360
I admit defeat.

528
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,430
Kneel.

529
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,280
Xiao Lin, is this all that's left of the Secret Dragon Guards?

530
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,040
Where are your two trusted followers?

531
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,140
Madam Xuancheng, where are you going in the middle of the night?

532
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,030
<i>Seems like Xiao Lin failed.</i>

533
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,410
How dare you kidnap me?

534
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,000
Chief Pian, they wanted to kidnap me.

535
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,790
Save me!

536
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,300
You guys heard that, right?

537
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,340
What a bunch of foolish men.

538
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,750
You all can't even figure this out?

539
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,040
Tantai Jin!

540
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,040
Tantai Jin!

541
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,500
Why are you here at such a late hour?

542
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,410
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

543
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,990
Don't worry. I'm fine.

544
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,650
I was terrified.

545
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,760
Look at you. Your hands are freezing.

546
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,050
Do you feel better now?

547
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,490
Xiao Lin?

548
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,830
<i>Xiao Lin was the one who tried to assassinate Tantai Jin?</i>

549
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,060
<i>What should I do?</i>

550
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,250
It's been a long time, Second Young Miss.

551
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,650
- Well…
- You'd better not ask me

552
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,920
to show him mercy at this moment.

553
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,410
Thank you for your kindness, Second Young Miss.

554
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,130
I was aware of the consequences.

555
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,830
<i>Report!</i>

556
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:47,470
Report!

557
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,730
Chief Pianran has intercepted the rebels who kidnapped Madam Xuancheng.

558
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,750
Your Majesty, don't worry. Madam Xuancheng is fine.

559
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,220
Good. Tell Pianran to bring her here.

560
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,670
I need to ask her something.

561
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,570
Run!

563
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,530
What?

564
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,090
Don't tell me you want me to help you up?

565
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,030
I wasn't on their side.

566
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,930
Please clarify the truth in front of His Majesty on my behalf.

567
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,900
Is that so?

568
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,150
Why do you possess it?

569
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,230
What do you mean?

570
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,300
Speak!

571
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,050
Why do you possess that love thread?

572
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,260
I don't know!

573
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,810
Let go of me!

574
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,030
I'm a distinguished guest of His Majesty.

575
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,800
I'm going to ask you one last time.

576
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,300
Where did you get that love thread?

577
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,080
Do you really think I'm as stupid as them?

578
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,360
You think I can't do anything to you if you don't talk?

579
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,980
Let go.

580
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,580
Pianran, calm down.

581
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,180
There's no need for violence.

582
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,950
Qingyu, she's trying to kill me.

583
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,430
Qingyu.

584
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,080
No matter what my sister has done,

585
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,600
I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

586
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,990
Let's straighten things out first.

587
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,320
I've got nothing to straighten out with you.

588
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,880
Out of my way!

589
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,950
Get lost.

590
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,480
Get lost!

591
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,950
Pianran, I heard you mention something about a love thread just now.

592
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,020
What exactly is going on?

593
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,780
It's none of your business.

594
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,980
How could that be?

595
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,350
Chief, His Majesty has ordered you to bring Madam Xuancheng to the main hall.

596
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,540
Sir, I failed to complete my mission.

597
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,380
How come?

598
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,220
Eldest Young Miss Ye claimed that we kidnapped her.

599
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,300
She was unwilling to leave with us.

600
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,220
Why would Xiao Lin fall for someone like her?

601
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,460
Scholar Pang, what should we do now?

602
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,960
Leave the capital in small groups as per His Highness's instruction.

603
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,970
After that, join up with Chen Xian's main force.

604
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,370
Yes, sir.

605
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,940
Let's go.

606
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Prince Xuancheng, it might be too sentimental for you to meet your wife in a foreign land.

607
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,570
Why don't you wait behind the hall for a while?

608
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,380
Please.

609
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,860
What's the matter?

610
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,350
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

611
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,990
Were you hurt?

612
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,690
Out of all the things to do, why did you put your neck into the noose?

613
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,610
Report!

614
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,500
Report! Chief Pianran, General Ye, and Madam Xuancheng are here to seek an audience.

615
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,190
Let them in.

616
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,350
<i>In the end, Bingchang still couldn't make it out.</i>

618
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,810
Madam Xuancheng contributed the most to the assassins' capture tonight.

619
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,940
She deserves the highest award.

620
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

621
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,340
I'm honored to resolve your troubles for you.

622
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,250
I…

623
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,280
dare not take credit for it.

624
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,320
What does that mean?

625
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,260
What has Eldest Sister got to do with this operation?

626
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,960
You had the idea to send Xiao Lin a letter with encrypted messages

627
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,870
to make him believe that your life was in danger.

628
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,120
You asked for his help urgently with the letter you wrote.

629
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:27,820
A chivalrous man like Xiao Lin would definitely come to your rescue personally.

630
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,980
This is a devious scheme that takes advantage of human nature.

631
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,250
You have outdone most of my advisers.

632
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,140
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

633
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,600
But I'm curious about something.

634
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,880
What if Xiao Lin succeeded in assassinating me tonight?

635
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,870
Would you swim with the current and leave together with him?

636
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,800
Your Majesty, please give us your wise judgment.

637
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,830
I had cut off all ties with Xiao Lin ever since I came back from the Sheng Kingdom.

638
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,880
Eldest Sister, you…
