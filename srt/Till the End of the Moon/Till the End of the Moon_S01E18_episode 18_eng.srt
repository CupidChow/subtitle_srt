♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,340
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,700
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,060
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,780
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,700
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,200
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,980
   

17
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,630
I'm powerful enough to do anything,

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,290
but I still lost to her.

19
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,120
 Ye Bingchang, you're awake, finally. 

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,090
Who are you? Why are you talking to me?

21
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,210
 After going through Enlightened Life, have you learned anything? 

22
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,390
 You've been jealous of Ye Xiwu since you were little, but you couldn't do anything about it. 

23
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,130
 You could only lie to yourself over and over again, convincing yourself that 

24
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,320
 Ye Xiwu was the noble daughter of a legitimate wife 

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,800
 while you are just a lowly concubine's daughter. 

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,850
 That's why you were inferior to her 

27
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,760
 and you didn't deserve everything she had. 

28
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,390
 How pathetic! 

29
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,570
Nonsense. I don't need to compare myself with her at all.

30
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,390
 Really? 

31
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,200
 But why did you take someone else's love thread as your own? 

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,060
 Does your husband Xiao Lin really love you? 

33
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,320
 What if you don't have the extra love thread with you? 

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,020
How did you know that?

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,110
 Since having this treasure, you've gained extraordinary charm 

36
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,930
 that can conquer many men, haven't you? 

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,070
 But fortune and misfortune are two buckets in the same well. 

38
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,240
 The dream demon kidnapped you 

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,020
 because she was attracted by this love thread. 

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,590
So you're here to kindly remind me?

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,290
 If you want to defeat Ye Xiwu, you'll need more than love threads. 

42
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,460
 When in Enlightened Life, even if you were the goddess of the Flying Serpent clan, 

43
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,600
 didn't she take everything from you again? 

44
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,310
 Tian Huan was born so noble. 

45
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,240
 If she did not blindly love the wrong man, 

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,750
 how would she end up in dismay? 

47
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,690
What exactly are you trying to say?

48
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,730
 Life is short. 

49
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,650
 If you only rely on your good looks, 

50
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,930
 bet everything on a man, and fail to seize the chance, 

51
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,120
 you can only and will always be a loser. 

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,960
 Tian Huan's tragedy will be your future. 

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,830
I'm not Tian Huan, and I have nothing to do with her!

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,240
Tian Huan has the power of the flying serpent,

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,850
but all she knows is to be jealous and try to please Mingye.

56
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,510
I'm nothing like her.

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,570
 What's different about you? 

58
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,290
In this world,

59
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,810
nobody is more worthy of my love than me.

60
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,000
Tian Huan is willing to kill for her man,

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,300
but I will only do that for myself.

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,740
 Clever girl. 

63
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,390
 May you be luckier than Tian Huan. 

64
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,430
Tian Huan.

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,100
It's the God-slaying Lightning.

66
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Sang Jiu.

67
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,880
Sang Jiu, what's that?

68
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,660
It's a gem that I forged with the divine essence

69
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,420
of the entire Flying Serpent clan.

70
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,180
This tiny piece contains the powers of immortals.

71
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,100
It's capable of overturning Heaven and Earth.

72
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,130
Why don't I call it World-alluring Jade?

73
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,300
Do you want to use it to revive your father and brother?

74
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,940
What's wrong with that? So are you here to stop me again?

75
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,050
Sang Jiu, don't use it.

76
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,690
You killed immortals for their divine essence and forged this evil object with devil fire.

77
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,130
It has harmed the heavenly harmony.

78
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,780
That's why the lightning punishment has come.

79
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,780
Everything in this world is connected by karma.

80
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Once you use its power, you'll have to repay it someday.

81
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,430
You will be doomed in the end.

82
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,470
Doomed in the end?

83
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,950
From the moment when I drew the Water-calming Sword, I never thought of any good ending!

84
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,540
Mingye, you mind everyone's business too much.

85
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,160
Out of my way!

86
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,510
What?

87
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,400
Do you want me to pay them with my life?

88
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,040
No. I just thought of another way.

89
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,250
Sang Jiu, you don't have to be a female demon anymore.

90
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,810
Everything can still be redeemed.

91
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,620
What's your way? With the so-called Bone-refining Seal?

92
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,950
Or did you borrow any treasure from someone else?

93
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,910
The Bone-refining Seal has been sealed by me in the Divine Platform.

94
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,590
You're right.

95
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:04,700
This shouldn't be a trade or a favor but compensation.

96
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,160
What are you up to?

97
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,270
Sang Jiu, look. This is the God-slaying Lightning.

98
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,230
It is powerful enough to shatter an immortal's soul.

99
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,310
It appeared...

100
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,520
because of your breaking the rules of Heaven and forging the World-alluring Jade.

101
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,130
If it strikes, you may not survive.

102
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,910
Is this lightning punishment for me?

103
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,080
♫  I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky  ♫

104
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,400
I didn't expect that I was just one step short...

105
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,060
before I could revive everyone.

106

♫  I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time to forget everything that's occurred  ♫

♫  I want to suspend a dream where I can exchange my tears for your return;  ♫

108

♫  My heart's in flames  ♫

♫  Otherwise, we will spend ten thousand years like this  ♫

110
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,740
What are you doing?

111
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,790
Sang Jiu, I'll take the punishment for you.

112
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,470
When my immortal body vanishes,

113
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,790
my divine essence will replace your devil bone.

114
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,770
Mingye!

115
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,650
Let go of me!

116
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,260
I didn't agree! Let go of me!

117
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,470
Let go of me!

118
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,060
 I didn't agree! Let go of me! 

119

♫  A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away  ♫

120
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,640
Sang Jiu, do you know?

121
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,810
I never found a chance to apologize to you.

122
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,950
It's my first time being a husband.

123
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,880
I didn't know how to love you.

124
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,960
And for such a long time, I didn't do anything for you.

125
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,430
When I start to understand,

126
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,310
you don't want anything.

127
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,690
It was me who didn't protect you.

128
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,670
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,860
You did nothing wrong.

130
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,400
As your husband, I'm not good enough.

131
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,570
It was me...

132
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,090
who made you a demon.

133
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,940
Fallen to be a devil.

134
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,160
♫  Otherwise, we will spend ten thousand years like this  ♫

♫  Let's stop time before we say farewell  ♫

136
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,080
I keep thinking of that bamboo forest.

137
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,970
Thinking of our home and the bitter decoction.

138
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,600
You kept tricking me into picking leaves endlessly.

139
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,110
I'd also think of you.

140
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,020
You were running, jumping, sleeping...

141
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,200
laughing, and crying.

142
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,790
If I could choose,

143
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,310
I really hope that I can stay with you in that cottage in the bamboo forest.

144
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,700
I dream of living the rest of our lives in tranquility.

145
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,940
This won't work.

146
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,450
This won't work!

147
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,030
Mingye,

148
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,490
whatever you say or do,

149
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,000
whether you're alive or dead, I won't forgive you!

150
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,310
Let go of me!

151
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,780
♫  I always remember the blooming flowers before they whither  ♫

153
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,060
I know.

154
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,220
Just hate me like this

155
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,290
and live on.

156
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:49,460
♫  to berth my love before everything turned to ashes  ♫

157
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,510
Mingye, actually, I should've died long ago.

158
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,810
My physical body...

159
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,340
had been devoured when I was in Barren Abyss.

160
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,540
 I don't understand. 

161
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,230
 Why do they have to suffer 

162
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,290
 for the mistakes I made? 

163
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,450
 Why do we have to be bullied but Tian Huan can be forgiven? 

164
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,640
Due to the hatred within, I didn't die.

165
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Instead, I transformed into a devil.

166
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,550
That's why...

167
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,060
I won't survive this lightning punishment.

168
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,540
I won't be able to accept your divine essence.

169
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,460
You can never repay me.

170
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,550
You owe this to me.

171
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,250
Sang Jiu.

172
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,520
Sang Jiu!

173
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,370
Sang Jiu…

174
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,370
Sang Jiu.

175
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,400
Sang Jiu.

176
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,500
Now that you want to devilize,

177
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,330
then I...

178
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,030
will devilize together with you.

179
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,000
 Who am I? 

180
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,650
 Am I Li Susu 

181
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,620
 Ye Xiwu, 

182
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,600
 or Sang Jiu? 

183
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,620
 What's wrong with its eyes? 

184
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,890
 This flood dragon keeps sleeping to experience dreams in Enlightened Life. 

185
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,450
 Whether he'll be the devil or god, this is the moment of truth. 

186
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,710
 No. 

187
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,370
 If my soul disintegrates like this, 

188
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,600
 Mingye will surely devilize due to desperation. 

189
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,710
 Mingye, you must think clearly. 

190
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,070
 Since you can't pull Sang Jiu out of her devilizing fate, 

191
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,000
 live on for her. 

192
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
 The Mingye whom Sang Jiu deeply loved 

193
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,130
 isn't someone who bows to fate. 

194
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,940
 He's always been that God of War in armor. 

195
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,860
 The devil soldiers haven't left, 

196
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,190
 which means I can still see you today. 

197
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,040
 If I cultivate hard and enter Shangqing God Realm, 

198
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,980
 I wonder if I'll get to speak with you. 

199
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,410
 Will I be able tell you there is 

200
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,590
 a little clam demon who always loved you? 

201
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,390
 She loved the God of War, who protected 

202
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,170
 the Mo River and the three worlds. 

203
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,650
 She loved the upright and unyielding you. 

204

♫  Every pair of the stars from the east and the west  ♫

205
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,340
♫  were lonely souls in the beginning  ♫

206
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,460
♫  Tossing and turning, falling hard for you, I was entangled by the thread of love  ♫

207

♫  Love is to become your beloved who loves the world that you cherish  ♫

211
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,420
Sang Jiu.

212

♫  Don't ask about the right and wrongs  ♫

213

♫  You'll only imprison your heart  ♫

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,940
♫  The ashes on the moon turned silent  ♫

215
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,690
I… I didn't devilize.

216
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,930
I know. You fought with the Devil Lord

217
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,070
and protected the Four Continents and Three Realms.

218
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,670
All along,

219
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,550
you were that God of War who was always protecting others.

220
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,990
But I didn't protect you well.

221
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,880
It's fine. I'll forgive you this time.

222
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,150
Never again.

223
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,170
 The thought of devilizing 

224
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,960
 shouldn't be my choice. 

225
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,030
 I'll always be the God of War loved by Sang Jiu. 

226

228
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,360
♫  My body was broken to pieces at the moment of falling flowers  ♫

230
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,710

♫  They were all derived from love  ♫

232

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240

♫  Have you ever become enamored even for a second?  ♫

236
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,820
 What is this feeling? 

237
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,850
They are finally out.

238
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,890
Xiao Lin.

239
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,250
Ye Xiwu.

240
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,490
Ye Xiwu!

241
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,940
Your Majesty, this is the illusion the flood dragon created.

242
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,410
It carries its memories.

243
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,330
This flood dragon is so wicked.

244
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,860
I've dragged people in here for nothing.

245
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,780
Your Majesty, the water-repelling barrier is about to disappear.

246
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,050
We must go ashore quickly.

247
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,280
 Mingye, 

248
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,670
 why did you choose me to enter your Enlightened Life? 

249
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,280
We've finally got out of this damn river and put our feet on the ground.

250
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,900
Xiwu.

251
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,580
 Kill her! 

252
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,130
Xiwu, I'm your elder sister.

253
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,160
Elder Sister, sorry. I was just…

254
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,240
It's okay. It's in the past.

255
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,930
Bingchang. Second Young Miss. Are you all right?

256
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,340
Where's that sleeping flood dragon?

257
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,720
It had long transcended and died at the bottom of the river.

258
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,050
After ten thousand years, the only thing left is its bones.

259
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,180
But it left a dream to attract people to come.

260
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,110
It managed to make you enter his dream and experience his life.

261
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,910
Why would he do that?

262
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,570
 For a prophecy. 

263
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,250
 To destroy the evil bones, 

264
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,860
 you'll need three keys. 

265
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,840
 A dream. 

266
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,860
 You can only awaken it after entering its dream. 

267
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,850
 A teardrop. 

268
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,530
 A thread. 

269
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,340
Mingye didn't devilize in the end.

270
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,910
and was lovesick.

271
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,460
So he left this illusion after he died.

272
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,800
It's probably for enlightening the destined ones.

273
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,530
What did you see in there?

274
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,700
How did it enlighten you?

275
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,150
 Sang Jiu, I hope that someday 

276
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,630
 somewhere in this world, 

277
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,790
 Mingye and you can meet each other again. 

278
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,680
Luckily, Tantai Jin didn't get the flood dragon.

279
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,020
Let's go back to the camp first.

280
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,900
I still have some unfinished business.

281
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm not going back with you.

282
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,430
Are you kidding, my Second Young Miss?

283
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,570
What are you going to do again?

284
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm going to Jing Kingdom.

285
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,650
I'll tell you when I make it.

286
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,550
Second Young Miss, do you have a death wish?

287
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,710
You've just ruined Tantai Jin's big plan.

288
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,110
Now if you go back and get caught by him,

289
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,350
he'll have your guts for garters!

290
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,010
Let her go.

291
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,220
Although I don't know what you're going to do,

292
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,430
I believe you'll definitely make it.

293
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,740
Everyone, we shall meet again someday in this big world.

294
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,620
Take care.

295
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,520
By the way, Scholar Pang.

296
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,250
This thing is called the Mirror of the Past.

297
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,330
When you return to the immortal sect someday,

298
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,700
remember to take it back to Xiaoyao Sect.

299
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,670
 Senior Jize deliberately adjusted the time for a few months 

300
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,310
 so that I could get out at the same time 

301
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,640
 as Tantai Jin caught the flood dragon. 

302
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,430
 A dream and a teardrop. 

303
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,510
 Now I've experienced them and acquired them. 

304
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,070
 Next, 

305
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,840
 I'll need Devil Lord to grow love threads and fall in love with me. 

306
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,700
 Then there's only one thing I need to do. 

307
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,210
Your Majesty, you seem to be a little absent-minded since getting out of Enlightened Life.

308
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,430
Every day you wait here for quite some time.

309
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,830
What exactly happened there?

310
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,510
 Why do I keep reminiscing about Enlightened Life? 

311
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,760
♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

312
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,660
 Sang Jiu. 

313
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,290
 No. 

314
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,250
 Ye Xiwu. 

315
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,090
♫  The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm  ♫

316
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,910
 They look so alike. 

317
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,880
 It's making it difficult to distinguish them 

318
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,840
♫  Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain  ♫

319
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,600
♫  Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain  ♫

320
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 This cloak is ugly. I don't want it. 

321
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,260
 You can have it. 

322
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,820
 Wake up, Tantai Jin. 

323
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,120
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

324
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,920
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

325
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,520
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

326
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,570
 You're finally awake. 

327
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,700
 I took care of you for a whole night. I'm exhausted. 

328
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,840
 Remember to drink your medicine. I'm going to bed now. 

329
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,390
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

330
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:18,430
 Tantai Jin, you must live on. 

331
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,570
 From today on, you will have all your meals here. 

332
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,550
 Chuntao will bring food for you. You'll eat whatever she puts before you. 

333
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,120
 Don't you ever eat disgusting, straight-up nasty scraps again. 

334
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,560
 Smells good. 

335
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,510
 It's really just a bowl of rice. 

336
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,920
 Tantai Jin, I'm going to escort you back to the Sheng Kingdom. 

337
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,830
 And then put you in prison to keep you from the outside world. 

338
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,620
 I'll be watching you every second of every day. 

339
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,250
 As long as I'm alive, don't ever think of devouring demon cores 

340
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,210
 or killing people. 

341
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,680
♫  Lovesickness has no one to advise  ♫

342
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,480
♫  If it wasn't for telling a lie  ♫

343
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,500
♫  and mentioning eternity so easily  ♫

344
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,320
♫  How can there be so many unfinished inscriptions of the people's hearts and minds?  ♫

345
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,680
 The dream has ended 

346
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,830
 It's already been so many days. 

347
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,320
 Ye Xiwu and Xiao Lin must've left. 

348
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,440
Your Majesty, General Ye brought reinforcement here.

349
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,150
Let's go back to the Jia Pass camp.

350
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,350
 Tantai Jin! 

351
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,100
Haven't you already left? Why do you come back?

352
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,870
Good or bad, I have to follow my husband.

353
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,790
Well, don't you want me anymore?

354
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,210
Sweet talking.

355
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,790
 Why is he cold to me again? 

356
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,890
Tie her up.

357
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,170
Wh-What are you doing?

358
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,860
I sincerely came to follow you.

359
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,720
I swam here!

360
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,390
I also walked for days.

361
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,670
My feet are worn out.

362
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,460
Did you swim here?

363
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,450
Give me that.

364
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,530
Chief Pian.

365
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,940
Take her back.

366
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,030
See if she's possessed by something evil.

367
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,220
Remember to check carefully.

368
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,730
Okay.

369
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,260
Wait…

370
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,580
My little darling, what the heck are you doing?

371
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,970
Just stay put in here. Don't play any tricks.

372
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,470
Otherwise, that person will really pull out my fox fur.

373
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm most willing to follow you.

374
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,270
Why would I run away?

375
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,830
They really treat me like a prisoner.

376
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,990
The first step is always the hardest.

377
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,170
It's true that if you let go of your ego,

378
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,650
you'll be able to say anything.

379
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,550
 What exactly should I do to let Young Devil Lord love me 

380
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,820
 and grow love threads? 

381
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,210
Just now, when I held his arm by the river,

382
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,790
that Soul-slaying Teardrop seemed to be warming up.

383
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,550
I guess I'll need to take the initiative.

384
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,480
 Second Young Miss, hold on. 

385
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,340
 Miss Xiwu. 

386
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,000
Who's there?

387
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,100
It's me!

388
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,230
Let her in.

389
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,500
Can I sleep here tonight?

390
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,330
No.

391
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,630
Did Sang Jiu leave you

392
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,310
some kind of trauma that night?

393
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,890
Shut up.

394
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,180
In this case,

395
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,280
didn't you realize anything after being through Enlightened Life?

396
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,020
Realization?

397
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,440
Ye Xiwu, you're so shameless.

398
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,580
What the hell were you thinking?

399
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,510
What? It's not that.

400
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,900
Why do you always have weird thoughts?

401
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,090
- I… 
 - I meant sentiments or inspiration.

402
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,080
Sentiments and inspirations.

403
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,730
Sentiments and inspirations?

404
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,620
Of course, I have some.

405
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,530
First. Mingye was such a fool.

406
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,180
He actually gave up the power of a god for a woman.

407
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,150
Second. The ancient Devil Lord is truly mighty.

408
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,960
Someday, I'll replace him.

409
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,140
 Oh no! Why are you admiring the Devil Lord? 

410
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,930
You know what? Tantai Jin,

411
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,560
for such a sad and sentimental love story,

412
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,040
don't you have any other thoughts?

413
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,000
Like, I'd think that if I loved someone,

414
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,930
I'd never be as humble as Sang Jiu.

415
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,470
I should say it out loud.

416
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,550
Say it out loud?

417
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,650
That was why I came for you.

418
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,240
♫   Spending a lifetime just to see one person   ♫

419
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,750
♫   From the first glance to being immersed in passion   ♫

420
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,930
Nian Baiyu.

421
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,750
 - At your service.  
 - Drag her out of here.

422
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,760
♫   We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts   ♫

423
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,320
Tantai Jin, are you being shy?

424
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,700
Drag her out.

425
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,250
Yes.

426
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,540
- Are-Are you being shy? 
 - Let's go, Second Young Miss.

427
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,410
 Tantai Jin. 

428
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,680
 - You're blushing.  
 - I…

429
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,500
- Second Young Miss. 
 - You're definitely being shy!

430
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
 It's true. Tantai Jin, you're being shy. 

431
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,570
Lock her in the camp. Don't let her bother me again.

432
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,030
If she keeps wandering, you punish her with a beating.

433
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,390
 Did Soul-slaying Teardrop warm up again? 

434
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,410
Can I even be shy?

435
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,600
 It's strange. Whenever I think of Ye Xiwu these days, 

436
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,700
 I'll have a tickling sensation in my chest. 

437
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,330
 Like something's about to come out. 

438
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,090
Your Highness, are you tired?

439
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,540
No, my mind just wandered.

440
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,670
Are you still thinking about the things in Enlightened Life?

441
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,620
Your Highness, I didn't choose to go into that dream.

442
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,270
I never wanted to do what Tian Huan committed.

443
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,050
That battle I fought with you at the bottom of the Mo River

444
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,550
still gives me the chills when I recall it.

445
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,230
If you're going to blame me for it…

446
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,370
Then I… I'll…

447
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,470
Why would I? You're not Tian Huan.

448
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,420
I'm not Sang You, either.

449
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,230
We both know that it's just a dream.

450
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,890
Your Highness, I'm a vulnerable woman.

451
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,740
I can only live with your protection.

452
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,480
Bingchang, now our kingdom is at stake.

453
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,810
Although I'm the crown prince,

454
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,980
I'm also your husband.

455
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,300
No matter how things will end, I will protect you well.

456
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,580
I won't leave you behind.

457
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,520
Why are you suddenly saying things like this?

458
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,650
A man's misfortune is often due to himself.

459
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,460
But a woman's is often due to her husband.

460
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,100
Just like Sang Jiu who married the wrong man

461
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,540
and eventually became a demon out of hatred.

462
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,370
Although I'd been her brother only in the dream,

463
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,940
my heart still aches when I think of her now.

464
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,340
Your Highness is so kind-hearted.

465
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,910
But my sister has gone to Jing Kingdom.

466
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,400
She'll be the wife of a king,

467
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,360
with limitless wealth and rank.

468
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,550
She won't need love from a fake brother.

469
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,150
Yeah. It's just a dream, after all.

470
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,000
Now the one I'll love and protect is you.

471
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,080
 Why did you take someone else's love thread as your own? 

472
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,830
 Does your husband Xiao Lin really love you? 

473
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,650
 What if you didn't have that extra love thread on you? 

474
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,900
 Yeah, without the love thread, 

475
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,330
 how could he love me so truly like this? 

476
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,170
 Without the love thread, 

477
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,400
 I'll still be that bullied and ignored concubine's daughter. 

478
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,030
 With no one to care about or pity me. 

479
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,720
 Putting on a smile for others every day. 

480
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,000
 But everything of mine had already been snatched by them. 

481
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,900
 This dream really lets me see myself and my so-called family. 

482
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,650
 Ye Bingchang, you must think more for yourself. 

483
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,630
 Put this love thread into good use. 

484
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,850
Your Majesty, I've sent Second Young Miss back to the camp.

485
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,400
 Have some tea. 

486
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,000
 You… 

487
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,350
 Drag her out! 

488
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,870
 - Are-Are you being shy? 
  - Let's go, Second Young Miss. 

489
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,510
 You're definitely being shy. 

490
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,660
 That's true. Tantai Jin, you're being shy. 

491
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,030
 Why am I happy for no reason when I see her? 

492
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,420
   

493
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,390
Good Pianran, I can undergo manifold ordeals,

494
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,580
but not this one.

495
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,050
You have no choice.

496
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,210
Sending you here to clean the poultry house and look after these military provisions

497
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,810
is the order from His Majesty. Let's go.

498
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,090
How can Tantai Jin be so cruel?

499
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,420
Why are these geese so big?

500
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,470
I can't do this. My head hurts.

501
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,560
I'm sweating and I can't catch my breath.

502
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,930
You think I don't know your little plan?

503
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,420
You came back this time to seduce Tantai Jin, didn't you?

504
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,270
Is that so obvious?

505
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,780
No need to be embarrassed.

506
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,920
However, His Majesty will be back in the capital soon.

507
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,730
If you don't want to be left alone, raising geese in the camp at Jia Pass by then,

508
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,700
just work hard now.

509
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,350
No.

510
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
Don't go.

511
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,380
   

512
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,600
Where's His Majesty?

513
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
He's patrolling the military camp.

514
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,750
Why are you bringing luggage? Where are you headed?

515
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,490
By His Majesty's order, I'm going back to the capital for family affairs.

516
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,900
Fine. You don't feel comfortable staying at the frontline, anyway.

517
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,610
It's better that you go back.

518
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,810
We'll also be back in a few days.

519
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,530
I'll leave first. I'll be waiting for you…

520
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,890
I'll be waiting for you guys to come back.

521
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,130
 I'm here to inform you 

522
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,660
 that your wife's raising geese now. 

523
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,600
 Men are the cruelest creatures. 

524
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,610
 Baiyu, go take a look. 

525
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,080
No!

526
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,550
Tantai Jin, you're so bad!

527
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,210
 Why is Young Devil Lord's smile different? 

528
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,560
 Did I see it wrong? 

529
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,210
Ye Xiwu.

530
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,930
She has a fever. Call the medic.

531
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,140
I'll give her medicine right away.

532
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,830
Get up. Stop faking it.

533
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,290
Do you want me to find some geese to wake you up?

534
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,950
What happened to me?

535
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,770
You caught a cold when you swam across the river.

536
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,880
Plus, you were quite frightened.

537
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,480
It's all your fault.

538
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,550
So many feathered brutes.

539
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,770
They were everywhere.

540
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,150
Get up and eat something.

541
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,690
What do you have?

542
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,870
Boiled goose eggs.

543
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,430
Steamed goose egg custard.

544
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,810
Salted goose meat.

545
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,230
 Seriously? You killed them all for one offense? 

546
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,200
 How horrible. 

547
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,930
Come on, dig in.

548
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,740
But I'm so weak.

549
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,880
I can't raise the chopsticks or peel an egg.

550
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,130
Could you feed me?

551
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,470
Ye Xiwu, I'm afraid you not only caught a cold

552
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,520
but also had some other illness in your head.

553
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,500
Medic!

554
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,260
Stop! Why are you so heartless?

555
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,760
Would I never be able to see you if I didn't faint?

556
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,170
I'll count to three.

557
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,330
All right, I'll eat.

558
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,910
Does it taste good?

559
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,560
Not bad.

560
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,930
Tantai Jin,

561
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:53,030
did you think I was funny when I was chased by geese just now?

562
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,990
I saw that you were quite happy.

563
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,970
Did you have a tickle in your heart,

564
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,730
and you couldn't help smiling?

565
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,980
I did.

566
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,460
Is that what happiness feels like?

567
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,220
What happiness? It's clearly unkindness.

568
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,600
You enjoyed watching me suffer.

569
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,800
 Young Devil Lord learned to be happy. 

570
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,300
 Has his love threads started to awaken 

571
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,010
 after being through Enlightened Life? 

572
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,960
 Then as long as I put more effort into it, 

573
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,480
 wouldn't success be in the bag? 

574
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,370
Enjoy your meal.

575
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,680
Where are you going?

576
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,900
Since you're already fine, get some good rest, then.

577
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm leaving.

578
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,160
You'll go back to the capital in a few days. Could you take me along?

579
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,650
You want to go back to the Jing Kingdom with me?

580
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:19,190
If not for this, why would I try so hard to swim across the river?

581
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,120
Yeah.

582
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,100
I'm also wondering why.

583
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,250
Don't say anything like "Following your husband everywhere."

584
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,970
On the ship back to the Jing Kingdom, you made it rather clear.

585
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,300
You didn't want to have anything to do with me.

586
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,940
Didn't you leave with Xiao Lin yesterday?

587
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,040
Why didn't you just let him bring you back to the Sheng Kingdom?

588
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,350
I just want to go with you.

589
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:03,630
Ye Xiwu, you've been weird since you left Enlightened life.

590
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,530
I'm telling you. I'm not Mingye.

591
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,830
I'm not as righteous as he is.

592
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,700
I don't want to save the three worlds

593
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,230
or protect all the people out there.

594
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,800
I know you're not Mingye.

595
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
And I'm not Sang Jiu, either.

596
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,230
But they're a couple.

597
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,420
We're also a couple.

598
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,570
Sang Jiu and Mingye couldn't disentangle themselves from their painful relationship.

599
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,480
We still have chances.

600
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,910
What's more, on my way here, I met a lot of civilians.

601
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,050
They don't care who the king is.

602
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,500
They'll go wherever they can to sustain their lives.

603
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,640
You governed your kingdom well.

604
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,910
Not only do I like you and want to follow you,

605
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:47,560
everybody else thinks the same.

606
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,280
Ye Xiwu, you're full of lies.

607
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,690
How can I trust you?

608
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,950
I'm here and at your disposal anyway.

609
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,750
Believe it or not.

610
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,580
At my disposal?

611
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,650
A royal maid?

612
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,170
Yeah.

613
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,480
Didn't you say you're at his disposal?

614
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,560
The royal maid's clothes look good, though.

615
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:44,000
Not bad. A cold monarch versus an unruly handmaid.

616
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,330
This feels so right.

617
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:04,340
Your Highness, Fuyu tried so hard to save you from the brink of death.

618
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,090
Please take good care of your body.

619
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,730
Yeah.

620
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,350
Thanks to you.

621
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,430
I can still live with no dignity in this dark cave.

622
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,520
Any news about Tantai Jin?

623
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,280
I heard Tantai Jin had conquered Jia Pass.

624
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,770
He'll be back in the capital soon.

625
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,710
Those spineless ministers in court

626
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,160
have all paid allegiance to him.

627
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,400
How is he qualified to be the King of Jing Kingdom?

628
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,780
Your Highness, whatever they do,

629
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,050
I'll always be by your side.

630
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,100
Did you find the people I told you to look for?

631
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,770
Good. Let them all in.

632
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,340
All of the best sorcerers of Jing Kingdom are here.

633
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,300
 Greetings, Your Highness. 

634
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,210
You're all experienced and knowledgeable cultivators.

635
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,580
I'll cut to the chase.

636
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,410
Do you know how Tantai Jin obtained the ability to use demonic hexes?

637
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,410
I heard he's been hunting demon creatures to devour demon cores.

638
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,680
 - That's right. 
 - Devouring demon cores is a forbidden way of cultivation. 

639
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,630
 - It's extremely risky. 
 - How could Your Highness put yourself in danger? 

640
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,710
Enough!

641
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,350
If Tantai Jin can do this, why can't I?

642
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:49,250
I must let him pay for what he did to me.

643
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:53,430
I can't wait one minute longer.

644
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:59,300

647
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:20,680
♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

648
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:28,380
♫  The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm  ♫

649
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:36,300
♫  Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain  ♫

650
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,180
♫  Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain  ♫

651
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,880
♫  We'll never meet again  ♫

652
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,540
♫  I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words  ♫

653
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,280
♫  Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense  ♫

654
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,660
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

655
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,480
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

656
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,020
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

657
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,200
♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

658
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,700
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

659
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:21,380
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

660
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,360
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

661
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,080
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

662
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,340
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

663
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,540
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

664
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,760
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

665
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,820
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

666
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,500
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

667
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:57,540
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

668
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:05,240
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

669
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:13,980
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
