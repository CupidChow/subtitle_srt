00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,760

Rest well, Second Young Miss.

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,959
I live next door. Call me if you need me.

17
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,620
<i>Father, I'm pretty much settled here.</i>

18
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,650
<i>You can put your mind at ease.</i>

19
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,790
<i>As for Devil Lord... I have found him.</i>

20
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,270
<i>But… I can't kill him yet</i>

21
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,320
<i>to change the destiny of the Devil Lord's manifestation.</i>

22
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,980
<i>However,</i>

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,300
<i>the good thing is that he's still a weak mortal now.</i>

♫ <i>Roads are longer than time,</i> ♫

25
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:57,130
<i>Anyway, I made him kneel in the snow.</i>

26
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,899
<i>Let him suffer a little for now.</i>

<i>Tonight,</i>

32
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,480
<i>it's going to be difficult to endure.</i>

33

♫ <i>Although green grass flourished and withered,</i> ♫

34
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,770
<i>The wind is howling outside.</i>

35
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,340
<i>Is he going to be okay?</i>

36
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,949

♫ <i>I understood the most was the moment in the dream</i> ♫

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,140

43
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:01,280

Miss, you're awake.

48
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,989
The wind was so loud like wolves howling last night.

49
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,390
Did you sleep well?

50
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,579
Why is Mr. Tantai still here?

51
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,550
Did you see? This is his third day, right?

52
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,409
He is resilient.

53
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,179
That's what he gets to offend Second Young Miss.

<i>Everybody despises him here.</i>

58
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,049
<i>If he does not play the victim, his life will only be much harder.</i>

59
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,020
<i>Thank you so much, Miss Ye.</i>

60
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,059
Miss Ye is an angel.

61
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:34,589
On every first and fifteenth day of the month, she will come here, giving out porridge to people in need.

62
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,560
And she's been doing this persistently for years.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,289
- Hold it tight.
- I'll go to the temple and pray for her tomorrow.

64
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,419
- May Sixth Prince and she be blessed to get married soon.
- You are welcome.

65
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,820
- They might start a big family with three or five young masters.
- You're welcome.

66
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,290
Miss, Sixth Prince sent Zhongtai to drop off a letter last night.

67
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,919
- Saying that he had a day off today and would come to help.
- You're welcome.

68
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,939
- His Highness should be here any minute.
- Careful.

69
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,600
- Thank you.
- Give me the spoon. Go dress yourself up.

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,460
That won't be necessary.

71
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,289
- Hold it well.
- By the way,

72
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,500
- Thank you, thank you.
- Zhongtai told me they went for military training yesterday.

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,719
- They ran into Second Young Miss in the suburbs.
- Please hold.

74
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,289
That shrew still refuses to leave Prince Lin alone.

75
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,070
Mind your language.

76
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,280
You're welcome.

77
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,729
Second Younger Sister is a married woman.

78
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,290
The fiasco is only going to further tarnish her reputation in the capital.

79
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,410
You should not recite this gossip you heard to Grandmother and Father.

80
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,060
- Miss, why do you worry about this for her?
- Not at all.

81
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,329
- You are welcome.
- She pushed you into a lake the other day,

82
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:26,620
which gave you a cold. Yet Old Master did not punish her.

83
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,960
Do not mention it again.

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,139
- Please hold it.
- Thank you, Miss Ye.

85
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,330
- Don't mention it.
- Would you clean this up?

86
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,850
<i>Sixth Prince is here!</i>

87
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,240
I should get going.

88
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,700
Bingchang.

89
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,669
We finally met.

90
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,480
I've waited so long to see you.

91
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,919
The sun is setting.

92
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,310
Seniors in the family might scold me if I get home late.

93
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,330
It would be disgraceful.

94
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,480
I've been at boot camp just outside the capital.

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,950
About half of the rules in the Sheng Military were made by your father, General Ye.

96
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,650
I thought I could spend more time with you when I came back here.

97
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,800
I didn't expect there would still be Family Ye's rules to follow.

98
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,290
Your Highness is joking. The Ye family indeed has strict rules for us to follow.

99
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,959
And I've been living with those since childhood. I'm used to it.

100
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,360
Well, apparently, they aren't strict enough to keep Second Young Miss under control.

101
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,779
She even made the hostage prince of the Jing Kingdom kneel in the snow.

102
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,330
Was Tantai Jin made to kneel in the snow?

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Even though Tantai Jin is a hostage prince, he is a prince of the Jing Kingdom.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,989
How could Ye Xiwu humiliate him?

105
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:55,310
Let it go. It is impossible to reason with an unruly person like her.

106
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,529
You haven't fully recovered after falling into the lake.

107
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,740
You should go home and get some rest.

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,609
Right. I'll take my leave now.

109
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,960
<i>It's been four days since your vicious wife forced you to kneel here.</i>

110
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,620
<i>You will die like this.</i>

111
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,970
<i>She really wants to kill you.</i>

112
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,850
<i>Can you tell?</i>

113
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,130
<i>Second Young Miss. Second Young Miss.</i>

114
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,830
<i>Second Younger Sister, I know what happened earlier by the lake</i>

115
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,900
<i>- was unintentional.
- I did it on purpose.</i>

116
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,100
<i>Eldest Sister,</i>

117
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,400
<i>you dressed up for Sixth Prince's visit.</i>

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,899
<i>You did not expect to be a drowned rat.</i>

119
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,640
<i>How do you feel?</i>

120
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,690
<i>Second Younger Sister, I've done nothing to hurt you.</i>

121
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,160
<i>Why do you oppress me?</i>

122
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,710
<i>Say that to Sixth Prince.</i>

123
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,310
<i>I do not know how you bewitch him</i>

124
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,450
<i>to make him go crazy over you. He hardly ever looks at me.</i>

125
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,529
<i>Even my unfaithful husband, Tantai Jin,</i>

126
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,810
<i>has also fallen prey to your charm.</i>

127
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,860
<i>Since he loves being the center of attention, his wish is granted.</i>

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,530
<i>If he is frozen to death, all I have to do is to fill Grandmother in.</i>

129
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,980
<i>Ye Bingchang, I'm just going to level with you.</i>

130
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,529
<i>No matter how hard you toss and turn,</i>

131
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,030
<i>in a few days, Tantai Jin must die.</i>

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,950
<i>And with the two of you gone before Sixth Prince, he can only like me.</i>

133
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,840
<i>What a vicious woman.</i>

134
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,800
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

135
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,140
Why are there crows flying around the house all the time?

136
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,880
This is a bad omen.

137
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,320
This has always been the case since Mr. Tantai's arrival.

138
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,620
<i>The sun has set again. It's the dead of winter.</i>

139
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,519
<i>If he stays out there much longer, he may not live to see tomorrow.</i>

140
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,260
<i>As much as he deserves it, I can't risk having the evil bone come back, or there'll be hell to pay.</i>

141
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,530
<i>Mr. Tantai, I'm terribly sorry.</i>

142
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,270
<i>I didn't see you here to appreciate the moon.</i>

143
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,460
<i>We didn't mean to get your clothes wet.</i>

144
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,250
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

145
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,009
<i>It's freezing cold out there. He does not have any cultivation.</i>

146
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,270
<i>With his clothes wet through, he's not going to make it.</i>

147
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,430
Second Young Miss, it's freezing cold out here.

148
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,880
Please go back inside.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,440
No need for you to monitor my punishment in person.

150
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,060
Who says that I am here to monitor that?

151
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,010
I just…

152
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,170
I just…

153
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,120
Just what?

154
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,350
I just want to check if you are dead.

155
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,130
Lest I have to collect your corpse for you.

156
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,720
I am so sure you don't need to do it yourself, even if I die.

157
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,999
Many in this world want me dead.

158
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:04,070
Probably more than I care to admit.

159
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,089
They might even flood in here to congratulate you on my death.

160
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,019
You don't actually think those words are going to make me go soft on you, do you?

161
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,120
Go soft on me?

162
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,869
<i>Oh no, Young Devil Lord is frozen and withered.</i>

163
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,260
<i>He could die if this continues.</i>

164
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,999
<i>Forget it. You will get your retribution later.</i>

165
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,300
This cloak is ugly. I don't want it.

166
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,830
You can have it.

167
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,300
It is Second Young Miss' clothes. I dare not accept them.

168
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,330
If you don't like it, you may have Chuntao get rid of it tomorrow.

169
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,930
You…

170
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,790
Is there anything else?

171
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,940
<i>See, Li Susu? Young Devil Lord is not a creature made of flesh and bone.</i>

172
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,219
<i>You expressed your sympathy for him, yet he was sarcastically mean to you in return.</i>

173
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:13,190
<i>He doesn't deserve your kindness. Not while he's still breathing.</i>

174
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,699
<i>So save your sympathy, and do something meaningful.</i>

175
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,940
<i>Patience is the key to success. No doubt Young Devil Lord is worthy of death, </i>

176
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,100
<i>but he is the key to the future of the Four Continents and Three Realms.</i>

177
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,200
Tantai Jin.

178
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,920
Drop the act. It's not going to make me feel bad for you.

179
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,120
<i>Why do I feel a sense of déjà vu?</i>

180
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,949
<i>Is this where he died and morphed into a devil?</i>

181
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,670
Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin!

182
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,950
Wake up!

183
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,120
Chuntao! Chuntao!

184
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,240
Miss, are you asking for me?

185
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,650
I am, yes! Come in, quickly!

186
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,939
Miss, is this a dream? Or are you not right in the head?

187
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,149
What are you talking about? Go boil some water! Quick!

188
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,930
Saving him is more important!

189
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,820
Quick!

190
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,700
Miss, why were you and Mr. Tantai clinging together?

191
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,209
Aren't we a married couple?

192
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,199
Don't husbands and wives in the mortal realm sleep together in the same bed?

193
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,150
Mortal realm?

194
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,220
Go check the water temperature.

195
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,310
Absolutely.

196
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,120
It's comfortably warm, Miss.

197
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,980
Chuntao, you go to rest first.

198
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,060
Yes, Miss.

199
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,420
<i>Did Ye Xiwu beat him and leave these wounds?</i>

200
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,700
<i>If I had known Young Devil Lord was this fragile, </i>

201
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,070
<i>I wouldn't have put the future of the Four Continents and Three Realms at stake just to get even with him.</i>

202
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,410
<i>Feel better.</i>

203
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,740
<i>Please. You're a devil god.</i>

204
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,870
<i>Don't die. Think about the Four Continents and Three Realms.</i>

205
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,080
<i>Tantai Jin, you are a poor, poor man.</i>

206
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,760
<i>It's you again.</i>

207
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,250
You always appear whenever death comes knocking.

208
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,850
<i>I am always here.</i>

209
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,720
<i>I know.</i>

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,530
<i>You're inside of me.</i>

211
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,270
<i>Do you want it?</i>

212
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,290
<i>Not yet. I am in no hurry.</i>

213
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,020
<i>Then, when is it?</i>

214
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,230
<i>Have you run out of patience?</i>

215
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,180
<i>But I don't blame you. For the past 20 years and more,</i>

216
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,829
<i>this body has done nothing but make you feel pain, hungry, cold, and humiliated.</i>

217
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,160
<i>And feel trapped.</i>

218
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,980
<i>Someday, you'll be free from this body,</i>

219
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,970
<i>offer me your soul,</i>

220
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,650
<i>and find eternal peace.</i>

221
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,040
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

222
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,110
<i>My body, and my soul,</i>

223
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,300
<i>you can have both if you like.</i>

224
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,350
<i>I do not care.</i>

225
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,610
<i>You have to be a bit more patient, Tantai Jin.</i>

226
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,089
<i>You're going to go through all hardships of mortal life. And be drowned in endless bitterness.</i>

227
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,529
<i>You are destined to be cursed and doomed to a tragic end.</i>

228
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,709
<i>When you're in your hardest time and approach the end of life,</i>

229
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:03,040
<i>I will come to accept your offerings.</i>

230
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,149
<i>It turns out that the moon shone so much brighter 500 years ago.</i>

231
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:12,650
<i>It's uch a shame that the devil god has descended, throwing a blanket of foul fog over the earth.</i>

232
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,580
<i>I haven't seen the moon for a long while.</i>

233
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,800
<i>Born from an evil origin, with an evil bone in him.</i>

234
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,310
<i>Where is that bone located?</i>

235
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,550
<i>What does it look like?</i>

236
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,850
<i>I wonder which of these is the evil one.</i>

237
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>They all feel pretty normal to me.</i>

238
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
What are you doing?

239
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,480
You're awake.

240
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,100
Ye Xiwu, what game are you playing this time?

241
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,590
It doesn't concern you.

242
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,140
Now that you're up, get up to put clothes on.

243
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,440
Do not soak in water and play dead.

244
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,910
Where are you going?

245
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,959
To the lake. It is not yet dawn.

246
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,580
No, you cannot go.

247
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,450
Stop right there.

248
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,800
You're not going to the lake. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

249
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,140
Why?

250
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,209
You're my man.

251
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,279
You were kneeling out there with many people passing by.

252
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,640
It's only going to embarrass me.

253
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,550
Well, I'm sorry.

254
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,519
I'm tired. I'm going to get some sleep. Don't talk to me.

255
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,139
<i>Father, I guess you didn't expect I would be sleeping with that devil god</i>

256
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:41,760
<i>when you sent me here.</i>

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,770
Why are you standing over there?

258
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,790
Do it. I want to get it over with and then go to bed.

259
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,039
Do what?

260
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,770
Things that you do to me every night, of course.

261
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,530
Have you... forgotten?

262
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,150
<i>Oh no. He can't find out who I really am.</i>

263
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,220
I remember. How can I forget it?

264
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,150
Hang on. I'm a little thirsty.

265
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,270
Chuntao, get me some tea.

266
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,239
Chuntao, tell me quickly.

267
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,850
What exactly is the thing Tantai Jin and I do every night?

268
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,020
Beat him.

269
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,369
You have become rather moody after marrying him.

270
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:54,039
And you whip him every night before bed as an outlet for your anger.

271
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,210
Is she a psychopath?

272
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,860
Where's the whip?

273
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,820
Under your mattress, Miss.

274
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,570
<i>How many times?</i>

275
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,809
<i>It is hard to say. It depends on your mood.</i>

276
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,530
<i>This is a long whip.</i>

277
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,780
<i>Ye Xiwu does have a twisted mind.</i>

278
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,499
<i>Li Susu, you used to slay demons without even blinking an eye.</i>

279
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:39,140
<i>How hard it is to whip him.</i>

280
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,550
<i>You will bear this whip for that devil god 500 years later.</i>

281
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,660
<i>Devil Lord, you deserve this</i>

282
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,029
<i>Li Susu, what are you doing?</i>

283
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,910
<i>He is not yet a devil god.</i>

284
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:31,730
<i>All these beatings and insults. Even though I bully and torture him,</i>

285
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,280
<i>it can't stop that devil god from coming to the world.</i>

286
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,060
<i>This is making you feel worse.</i>

287
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,770
I'm tired. I'm going to call it a night… and off to bed.

288
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,410
Tantai Jin.

289
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,930
Tantai Jin?

290
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,400
Tantai Jin.

291
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,410
Tantai Jin!

292
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,280
<i>He's burning up.</i>

293
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,659
<i>It is bad. He knelt in the snow for days and was whipped.</i>

294
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,740
<i>All too much for a mortal like him.</i>

295
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,259
<i>Li Susu, oh, Li Susu, you are in big trouble.</i>

296
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,500
Chuntao!

297
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>Chuntao! Are you asleep?</i>

298
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,060
<i>Chuntao!</i>

299
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,109
Miss, Mr. Tantai's medicine is ready.

300
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,960
Anything else before I go?

301
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,739
No, that's it. This is really the last time.

302
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,750
Have a good sleep.

303
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,130
Tantai Jin. Tantai Jin.

304
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,260
Here, drink this.

305
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,270
<i>He's confused with a fever.</i>

306
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,280
<i>I'm not even sure if these herbs here work.</i>

307
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,960
Open your mouth.

308
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,500
How come his temperature is still high.

309
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,440
<i>Father would place a cool washcloth on my forehead every time I had a fever as a kid.</i>

310
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,070
You're finally awake.

311
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,170
I knew this would work.

312
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,890
All right now, you get some rest.

313
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,070
I'm going to go to bed.

314
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,690
Seriously, what did I do to owe you this?

315
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,100
<i>She's been a different person ever since she came back from the temple.</i>

316
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,310
<i>Was she possessed by some evil spirit or something?</i>

317
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,540
<i>[Ye Mansion]</i>

318
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,989
Miss, you should have slept in a bit. You stayed up late last night.

319
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,190
Where's Tantai Jin?

320
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,539
Apart from getting corporal punishment, his typical day also involves copying sutras in the library.

321
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,920
He's probably been there since this morning.

322
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,960
<i>Tantai Jin, you owe me because I saved your life. You cannot deny it nor hide from it.</i>

323
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,810
<i>Bear that in mind.</i>

324
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,500
<i>Someday, you will pay for it with your life.</i>

325
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,829
What time is it?

326
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,300
Almost noon.

327
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,129
Old Lady, Old Master, and Eldest Brother are waiting in the dining room.

328
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,550
<i>Hello, Second Young Miss.</i>

329
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,720
<i>So these are Ye Xiwu's family, who she sees every day.</i>

330
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,609
<i>If I want to stay here, I'll need to get through this first.</i>

331
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,499
<i>This must be Xiwu's father, Sheng's Pillar of the State Great General.</i>

332
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,350
<i>And this must be Eldest Young Master, Ye Xiwu's eldest brother.</i>

333
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,449
<i>As for these women, they may be concubines of Ye Xiwu's father.</i>

334
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,220
<i>This old lady dressed in strikingly luxurious clothes, she's got to be Ye Xiwu's grandmother.</i>

335
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,580
- Grandmother.
- What's with you?

336
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,430
Don't look at Chuntao. Unless you want her to be punished, too.

337
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,940
<i>Ye Xiwu is such a trouble magnet. What did she do this time?</i>

338
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,490
Come here.

339
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,470
<i>Oh no, am I going to be caned on my palm?</i>

340
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,659
You made me worry sick!

341
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:56,650
Walking around without a windbreaker in the dead of winter?

342
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,289
Look at her. She's hardly wearing anything.

343
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,480
Oh, my poor little one.

344
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,860
You are surrounded by a bunch of inconsiderate people.

345
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,060
At the end of the day, only your family cares about you.

346
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:18,130
Here. Wear this. It'll keep you warm.

347
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,170
<i>After all, it is a false alarm.</i>

348
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,200
Now this is so much better.

349
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,680
Chuntao, fetch some pelts from the storage room.

350
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,420
- Make a few more coats for your miss.
- Yes.

351
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,440
Grandmother, I'd love a white fox fur coat, too.

352
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,280
You want it? Ask your father for it.

353
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,110
Father, can I have a white fox fur coat?

354
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,770
In your dreams.

355
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,970
Have you no shame, Ye Zeyu?

356
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,970
As my eldest son, you are supposed to train to fight,

357
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,969
guard the borders, and contribute to the country as your younger brother does.

358
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:57,390
Instead, you mess about with your gang. Wasting your time on having fun.

359
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,450
Look at you.

360
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,240
No decent girl in the capital will fall for you.

361
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,520
<i> - This father is harsh.</i>
- The food is getting cold. Let's just eat.

362
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,980
Little one, go sit by your father.

363
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,399
- Go. Easy
- All right.

364
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,410
Father.

365
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,470
Little one, try this.

366
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,100
I know you haven't been in a good mood lately.

367
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,719
I specifically ordered the kitchen staff to make your favorite dishes.

368
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:37,129
I have been told by the helpers that you were up all night last night, steeping in a hot bath and brewing medicine.

369
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:41,519
You must be tired after a sleepless night. You must eat more to fuel up.

370
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,820
- Right, here you go.
- Here, have some more.

371
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,090
- You need more protein in your diet. Eat this.
- Don't take that personally.

372
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,780
<i>This… </i>
- And this, too.

373
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,760
<i>this is family love as described in the book.</i>
- Eat more.

374
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,460
These dishes were made especially for you. They're all your favorite foods.

375
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,290
<i>- Father, don't worry. These people are nice to me.</i>
- Give her more braised pork.

376
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,630
The tofu soup is tasty.

377
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,830
<i>Like the way you treat me.</i>

378
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,240
I understand from the Marchioness of Order yesterday that

379
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,900
everyone in the capital is talking about

380
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,079
how Xiwu pushed Bingchang into the water. The news spread far and wide.

381
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,400
People can talk all they want about Xiwu. Are we afraid of them?

382
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,240
It'll harm her reputation.

383
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,529
What's done cannot be undone. Besides, little one is already married.

384
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:25,550
But, Father, before Xiwu got married last year, you said she should be allowed some harmless fun.

385
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,820
And that she would have to take responsibility for her behavior after marriage.

386
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,439
And now this. How is she always right?

387
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,739
Keep quiet. Eat your food.

388
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:39,079
<i>Ye Xiwu, oh, Ye Xiwu, now I know why you are such a spoiled brat.</i>

389
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,450
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought these days.

390
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,089
I shouldn't have pushed Eldest Sister into the lake. It's my fault.

391
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,450
I'd like to pay her a visit today and ask for her forgiveness.

392
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,780
Mother, Little One is mature.

393
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,310
Oh, isn't Xiwu thoughtful?

394
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,579
<i>- He calls this thoughtful?</i>
- Well… Little One is always been kind and dependable.

395
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:03,120
Absolutely worthy of being called the offspring of the Ye family.

396
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,130
<i>These people really spoil her rotten.</i>

397
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,690
You can skip the niceties, though.

398
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,980
What if Bingchang's cold hasn't gone away? We wouldn't want you to catch it.

399
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,679
- It's okay, Grandmother.
- <i>I agree with you, Grandmother.</i>

400
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,850
If Second Sister did make an apology, then she'd be underestimating the bond of our sisterhood.

401
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,619
- Eldest Sister.
- Sit, Second Sister.

402
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

403
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,800
I haven't felt well enough to greet you and Father for the past few days.

404
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,929
And I must also apologize for interrupting the meal.

405
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,620
I didn't think it would take me so long to get freshened up after giving out porridge to the needy.

406
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,180
You heard her, Little One.

407
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,490
Your sister said that your apology is not needed.

408
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,200
Bingchang, sit next to Zeyu.

409
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,970
Yes, Grandmother.

410
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,910
<i>No wonder Eldest Senior Brother… I mean, both Xiao Lin and Tantai Jin have a thing for her.</i>

411
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:22,430
<i>She's beautiful. She's gentle. And she has a kind soul.</i>

412
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,810
<i>Who would not like her?</i>

413
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,609
Where is Tantai Jin? Why isn't he here eating with us?

414
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,970
Do you honestly think you're one of the masters here?

415
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,400
You cannot just eat the food yet not work.

416
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,150
Yeah, you can't just do nothing all day.

417
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,869
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

418
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,990
Well, the brothers and I have spent the afternoon doing chores.

419
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,309
There's a pile of dirty dishes over there, all used by the masters.

420
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,970
I see you laze around all the time.

421
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,830
So do me a favor and wash those dishes before you eat.

422
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,439
- Is that okay?
- That's right.

423
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:29,289
- Thank you, Mr. Tantai.
- Go on, Mr. Tantai.

424
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,489
Go. Thanks a bunch.

425
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,659
Come on, guys. Time for lunch.

426
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,709
<i>- Come on over. It's lunchtime.
- Yeah, coming.</i>

427
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:39,020
<i>- Get me a bowl of rice.
- Hey, pass the pot over here.</i>

428
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,360
<i>- Nope, I'll help myself.
- Here you go.</i>

429
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,870
<i>- Yeah, all right.
- Give me this.</i>

430
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,380
<i>There.</i>

431
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,750
<i>Here you are.</i>

432
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,459
So Tantai Jin has never joined us at the table ever since he came here.

433
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,210
He has his meals with the servants in the kitchen.

434
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:57,790
Yes, Miss. You hate his guts. Having him around ruins your appetite.

435
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,180
And from what I hear, he isn't getting enough food.

436
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,660
The servants in the kitchen take their cue from you.

437
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,930
They watch what you do and they imitate.

438
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,580
<i>Well, serves him right. He's a devil after all.</i>

439
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,640
<i>But he's been keeping his distance from me.</i>

440
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,170
<i>I can hardly keep an eye on him.</i>

441
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,890
Where is the kitchen?

442
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,140
Let me tell you something.

443
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,390
Some people… may seem to have a status of master.

444
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,340
But deep down, they are just servants.

445
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,380
<i>That's so true.</i>

446
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,340
It's… what do you call it again?

447
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,300
<i>- A fallen noble.</i>
- A fallen noble.

448
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,310
Even we are living better lives than he is, aren't we?

449
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,130
<i>- That's right.
- Guys, let's dig in.</i>

450
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,400
<i>Yeah, come on. Go on, eat your food.</i>

451
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,430
<i>This smells so good.</i>

452
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,500
<i>It is tasty.</i>

453
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,170
Say, a person like him.

454
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,720
His life is absolutely pathetic.

455
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,160
He may as well take his own life and free himself from all these miseries.

456
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,969
<i>So, Ye Xiwu has been encouraging the servants to treat Tantai Jin like a doormat, huh?</i>

457
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:14,889
- I couldn't agree more.
- He should just end his miserable life.

458
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,570
Go.

459
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,770
Eat.

460
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,060
There's a fly buzzing around.

461
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,080
Where did it come from? It's winter.

462
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,929
What's wrong? Are you okay?

463
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,070
Have some water.

464
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,710
Are you all right?

465
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,350
Is everything okay?

466
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,690
I just swallowed that fly. I can't eat anymore.

467
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,390
- You guys go on without me.
- You eat.

468
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,499
<i>- You guys just eat.
- Let's continue the meal. Come sit right here.</i>

469
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,769
Done for the day. Guess this isn't my lucky day.

470
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:11,040
Go. Second Young Miss.

471
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,680
- Second Young Miss.
- What brings you here? Tantai Jin is…

472
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,629
Tell me. What did Tantai Jin have to do to be told to kill himself?

473
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,490
Miss, I put Mr. Tantai on dish duty.

474
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,189
In the bucket were chunks of ice that we collected from the frozen lake last night.

475
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:31,110
Oh, by the way, I spilled icy cold water on him while I was at it.

476
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,729
Too bad he survived the freezing cold last night. I'll make sure his hands are in the ice water long enough to lose his fingers.

477
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:41,130
And we didn't save him any food today. Only a bucket of swill.

478
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,240
So this is how poorly you people have been treating him?

479
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,260
Human beings are all equal.

480
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,320
But some prefer to stoop low and be stuck in service.

481
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,009
And to feel good about themselves, they walk all over people who are weaker than them.

482
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:57,490
Do you seriously take pleasure in watching people struggle?

483
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,310
Miss, you're taking this a little bit too seriously.

484
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,800
We were just trying to avenge you.

485
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,710
You have our absolute loyalty.

486
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,780
You've been utterly rude to Tantai Jin because you know he's alone and has no backing.

487
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,580
If someday our family were in ruins, you would do the same to my family and me, wouldn't you?

488
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,270
<i>Oh, no, no. Absolutely not.</i>

489
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,910
<i>Second Young Miss is right.</i>

490
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,679
<i>- Second Young Miss is right.
- Second Young Miss is right.</i>

491
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,540
Do not eat that.

492
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,700
Second Young Miss, one will die without any food.

493
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,220
It's awfully dirty.

494
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,169
Only God knows what those servants have added to it. It'll make you sick.

495
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,700
I've eaten far worse.

496
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,659
Why didn't you defend yourself when they said those things to you?

497
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:05,189
Why would you, a prince of a kingdom, let servants push you around?

498
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:07,800
Don't you feel shame?

499
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,560
A sense of shame?

500
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,610
It means nothing to me.

501
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,930
For me, personally,

502
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,020
this bowl of rice matters more.

503
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,200
Ye Xiwu!

504
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,910
Come with me.

505
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,340
I cannot survive without food.

506
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,220
But if I had had a sense of shame, I would have died long ago.

507
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,950
Shut it. You're coming with me.

508
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,179
Eat this. And I'll let you go.

509
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,060
You're too skinny and physically weak.

510
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,010
Even a disease can kill you.

511
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,360
Now you're pulling the same trick twice.

512
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,610
I'd be a fool to trust you again.

513
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,410
Now, if you'll excuse me.

514
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,090
Sit down.

515
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,280
What trick?

516
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,380
Make yourself clear.

517
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,259
You asked if I have a sense of shame.

518
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:36,780
The truth is that I don't think you have such a thing, either.

519
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,030
Fine.

520
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,569
Since you let me speak about it,

521
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:42,830
I'll say it again.

522
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,600
Fine, say it.

523
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,830
Your eldest sister met up with Xiao Lin at the royal feast six months ago.

524
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,910
They were roaming around the garden hand in hand.

525
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:01,369
And you, you were desperate to break them up so you could have Xiao Lin as your man.

526
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:06,430
You got this aphrodisiac tranquilizer called Spring Silkworm Knot.

527
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,560
You were going to drug Miss Bingchang and Fifth Prince, Xiao Liang,

528
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,389
hoping they would sleep together under the influence.

529
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:17,049
Unexpectedly, Prince Liang cornered me on that day.

530
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:18,919
<i>That was quite a feast.</i>

531
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,219
<i>Even the maids and the eunuchs can have some exquisite food.</i>

532
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:27,010
<i>You've had nothing to eat tonight, have you?</i>

533
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,920
<i>Lucky for you, I have a big heart.</i>

534
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,490
<i>Have a pastry.</i>

535
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,490
<i>Thank you, Fifth Prince.</i>

536
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,810
<i>It is unfortunate.</i>

537
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,389
<i>I don't know if you've heard, but my country and yours are at war.</i>

538
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:49,339
<i>If anyone reminded my father of your existence,</i>

539
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:51,859
<i>he might just have you beheaded as a sacrifice for the gods before a battle.</i>

540
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:54,570
<i>This might happen, right?</i>

541
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,429
<i>I've just remembered. You like foods broken into smaller parts.</i>

542
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,780
<i>Small enough?</i>

543
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,350
<i>Enough.</i>

544
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,009
The next thing I knew, my head started to spin.

545
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,860
Then you came out of nowhere and wrapped your arms around me.

546
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,780
I ate the drug-laced food meant for Fifth Prince by accident.

547
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:22,780
Oddly enough, the one meant for Ye Bingchang was eaten by you for all the wrong reasons.

548
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,309
Many in the palace witnessed it that night.

549
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:33,199
Your father had no choice but to arrange for us to tie the knot.

550
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,380
<i>To celebrate the love between the Pillar of the State Great General's daughter,</i>

551
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,219
<i>Ye Xiwu, and the third Prince of Jing Kingdom, Tantai Jin,</i>

552
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:46,820
<i>a marriage has been bestowed upon them.</i>

553
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,400
Then one day, you told me the whole story.

554
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,160
Since that point in time,

555
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,070
you've been mocking and torturing me just for fun.

556
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,830
And you've become increasingly twisted and cruel.

557
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:13,309
<i>Ye Xiwu. What have you done?</i>

558
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:24,380
So, Second Young Miss, what did you do to my food this time?

559
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,609
Nothing.

560
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,200
Really?

561
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,459
You're doing all this just to make sure I have enough to eat?

562
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:37,010
Cannot I do that?

563
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,429
Let me tell you something. Don't even think about starving yourself to death.

564
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:42,030
I won't let that happen.

565
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,080
Now watch me.

566
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,200
You happy now?

567
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,379
From today on, you will have all of your meals here.

568
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:06,709
Chuntao will bring food to you.

569
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,699
And you will eat whatever she puts before you.

570
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,199
Don't you ever eat disgusting, straight-up nasty scraps again.

571
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,200
<i>This bowl of rice does seem safe to eat.</i>

572
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,510
<i>What's gotten into her, really?</i>

573
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:11,099
<i>Guessing this is the first time you've had a square meal here at the Ye Mansion.</i>

574
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,439
<i>Have you noticed that that broad's a little too sane these days?</i>

575
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:17,700
<i>Does she have a loose screw?</i>

576
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,970
Well, maybe she's come up with other ways to play her twisted games.

577
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,740
I am here after all.

578
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,360
If I, the hostage prince, die. The Ye family can't get away with it.

579
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,399
<i>You are right. She does behave unpredictably.</i>

580
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,830
<i>You can't stay here much longer.</i>

581
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,370
<i>The problem is, if you leave here, where else can you go?</i>

582
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,970
<i>Oh, by the way, I bumped into a couple of crows from Jing Kingdom.</i>

583
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,050
The Jing Kingdom…

584
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,810
What a coincidence.

585
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,610
I was born there.

586
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,290
Have you ever been to its palace?

587
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,919
It's the most disgusting place in the world.

588
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:05,399
<i>They told me… they saw a shaman performing a burning ritual.</i>

589
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,179
<i>They smelled a decaying sick body.</i>

590
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:10,350
<i>And there were also restless and anxious ministers pacing the hall.</i>

591
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,490
It must have been the King of Jing.

592
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:18,030
The man I should have called Father…

593
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,080
is dying.

594
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,810
<i>But I'm stuck in here.</i>

595
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,600
<i>Those have nothing to do with me.</i>

596
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,499
Imperial Father, I have something important to report.

597
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:57,259
Lin'er, your timing is perfect.

598
00:48:57,259 --> 00:49:01,399
I've just received an urgent message. Tantai Wuji is at death's door.

599
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:04,100
Tantai Jin's brother will take the throne after him.

600
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,460
Looks like Tantai Jin has outlived his usefulness.

601
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,980
From what I've been told, Tantai Minglang is a ruthless man.

602
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,800
He may not even show empathy for his siblings.

603
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,939
We would be giving him what he wants by killing the hostage prince.

604
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:21,699
My son is indeed smart.

605
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:28,140
Now, if I spare him, he's going to be a thorn in Tantai Minlang's heart.

606
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,369
I'm going to summon Tantai Jin over.

607
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,810
I want to see his gesture.

608
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:39,489
If he has ambitions, I can send him back to Jing first to muddy the waters, and then have him killed amid chaos.

609
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:45,919
But if he is incompetent, I have no point of keeping him alive.

610
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:51,559
We will then send a male of similar age to Jing Kingdom to trick Tantai Minglang into thinking that's his brother.

611
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,020
Well... is authenticity that important?

612
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,480
Imperial Father…
