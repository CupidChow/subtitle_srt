Mingye.

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,750
You can't take it away.

17
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Is that so?

18
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,380
Chuhuang! You should be on my side.

19
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,130
You'd better think it through.

20
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,500
You keep getting in my way. I'm going to skin you alive!

21
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,790
Then bring it on.

22
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,030
In order to buy time and finish sealing the evil bone soon,

23
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,970
Mingye summoned the Venerable Twins.

24
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,520
This may boost his power for a short period of time,

25
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,330
but if we don't seal the evil bone soon, this world will

26
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,820
no longer have a God of War when his divine essence burns out.

27

Chuhuang. Chuhuang.

31
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,870
I can't hold much longer.

32
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Before the space completely closes,

33
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,920
let's combine our power

34
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,530
to implode the Demon Realm.

35
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,280
But what about you?

36
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,990
No.

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,620
Jize.

38
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,740
Being a god in this life,

39
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,890
I've fought against the demons and devils till the end.

40
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,490
Since there's nothing else I can do,

41
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,730
I don't mind falling into the endless abyss

42
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,410

43
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,260

Jize,

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
you may end your

I don't know why, but I'm quite unsettled.

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,470
Immortals are different from demons.

137
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,160
You'd been practicing immortal arts for hundreds of years.

138
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
Now you're a beginner in demonic cultivation.

139
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,870
It's normal that you can't change so soon.

140

Not even you, God of War!

147

I said I wouldn't kill you, and I won't break my promise.

148
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,670
But I will turn you into a flood dragon devil for me to command.

149
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,400
And I'll let you slaughter the three worlds.

150
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,020
And kill all of your associates!

151
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,880
What a pity. Your wish won't be granted.

152
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,180
I said you couldn't escape.

153
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,300
Activate the array!

154
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Is this all you can do with the gods' skills and celestial power?

155
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,450
Why do you betray me?

156
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,440
You promised me you'd spare her.

157
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,310
Now she's dead.

158
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,750
So you're just as foolish as them!

159
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,370
I will seal you for eternity!

160
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,080
The Devil Lord has finally been killed!

161

<i>You stole my evil bone.</i>

165
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,440
<i>You used the Celestial Punishment to kill me!</i>

166
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,740
<i>I won't have mercy on you!</i>

167
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,850
<i>When Heaven and Earth collapse,</i>

168
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,480

<i>I wonder how your Shangqing Realm will become?</i>

170
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,050
The God of War has lost his power,

171
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,200
but the Devil Lord is still alive.

172
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Now the Heavenly Pillars are collapsing and all lives are suffering and in misery.

173
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,110
Looks like...

174
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,750
we can only use the last resort.

175
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,780
<i>All gods return to the ruins to protect Heaven and Earth!</i>

176
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,410
<i>Fall!</i>

177
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,540
<i>Little Mingye, wake up!</i>

178
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,610
Everyone,

179
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,690
where is this place?

180
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,630
<i>Mingye, this is your nirvana realm.</i>

181
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,920
Have I fallen?

182
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,010
<i>No. We're going to fall.</i>

183
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,460
<i>As your comrades, we're here to say goodbye.</i>

184
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,270
What?

185
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,720
<i>Although we part from each other today,</i>

186
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
<i>one day we shall reunite,</i>

187
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
<i>in the form of snow on the mountaintops,</i>

188
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,110
<i>or pebbles in streams and willows by the water.</i>

189
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,770
<i>We'll leave the holy halberd, Yize, to you.</i>

190
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>Yize.</i>

191
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,260
Thank you all.

192
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,240
<i>I will return.</i>

193
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,540
What's wrong?

194
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Nothing.

195
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,260
<i>Report!</i>

196
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,590
Your Highness!

197
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,890
Brother, what happened?

198
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,250
Nothing. You stay in the bamboo forest to cultivate.

199
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,420
Don't go anywhere. I'll go back to Mo River to help Father.

200
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay.

201
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,990
Hold on!

202
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,620
Princess.

203
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,680
What's going on?

204
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
Well…

205
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Just say it.

206
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,180
Your Highness, news just came.

207
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,130
The gods and devils fought at Mount Changze.

208
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,800
They fought fiercely and neither would give in.

209
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,280
Then what about Mingye?

210
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,060
They fought quite a bloody war.

211
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,610
God of War must have been at the head of his men.

212
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,900
<i>The gods killed the Devil Lord and his army, but they have all fallen.</i>

213
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,640
<i>Mingye, the God of War, and Jize, the God of the Cosmos are both missing.</i>

214
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,080
<i>Where is Ming Ye now?</i>

215
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,580
<i>Even the war armor can't withstand it.</i>

216
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,310
<i>I'm afraid it's going to melt very soon.</i>

217
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,440
<i>Goddess Chuhuang.</i>

218
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,050
<i>This divine power can connect you and Mingye.</i>

219
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,630
<i>As long as you wish, you may see him across time and space.</i>

220
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,780
<i>But you can only use it once.</i>

221
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,710
<i>Chuhuang, help me.</i>

222
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,500
<i>Please send me to find Mingye.</i>

223
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,090
<i>Wherever he is,</i>

224
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,240
<i>I must bring him back.</i>

225
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,220
<i>[Bank of Ruo River]</i>

226
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,380
<i>Mingye, where exactly are you?</i>

227
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,500
♫ <i>I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky</i> ♫

228
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,600
♫ <i>Suspending the firefly and butterfly until the wind and snow arrive</i> ♫

229
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,000
<i>Mingye, I'll get you out of here.</i>

230
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,030
<i>Just hold on for a little more time.</i>

231
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,470
<i>We're going to leave together.</i>

232
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,980
♫ <i>I want to suspend a scene from a dream together with what I owe</i> ♫

233
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,000
♫ <i>Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?</i> ♫

234
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,220
♫ <i>A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away</i> ♫

235
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,540
♫ <i>Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is like piercing my bone with a sword</i> ♫

236
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:19,220
♫ <i>If fate is a calamity, I cannot help but want to resolve it</i> ♫

237
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,310
Mingye,

238
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,900
we're home.

239
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,440
<i>Report!</i>

240
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,860
Goddess, we still haven't found him.

241
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,780
How could it be?

242
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,940
So many celestial soldiers

243
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,890
searched the Four Continents and can't find Mingye?

244
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,140
<i>Mingye is badly injured.</i>

245
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,290
<i>Now he's back to his original form.</i>

246
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,820
<i>I have to take good care of him.</i>

247
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,980
<i>Will he be able to adjust to this place?</i>

248
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,690
<i>Oh, right!</i>

249
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,630
<i>I think the water of East Sea is salty.</i>

250
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,350
<i>Ming Ye, you're such a pain in the neck.</i>

251
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,440
<i>You're cuter like this.</i>

252
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,440
<i>According to books, these spirit herbs are good nourishment.</i>

253
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,160
<i>They can help you recover your human form.</i>

254
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,190
<i>Mingye, hurry and return back to your human form.</i>

255
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,320
<i>Curling in the shell like a little loach</i>

256
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,230
<i>doesn't feel like you at all.</i>

257
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,700
When you're back to human form, you'll leave. Right?

258
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,640
<i>You'll never forgive me for doing that to you that day.</i>

259
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,060
<i>Mingye, just wake up soon.</i>

260
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,100
<i>Don't worry. I won't badger you.</i>

261
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,610
<i>I'll leave once you've recovered.</i>

262
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,940
<i>We won't owe each other anything.</i>

263
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,720
<i>Oh no! I forgot Brother would come.</i>

264
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,580
Brother!

265
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,480
A'Jiu, you're back.

266
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,300
You went to pick herbs?

267
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,030
Are you feeling unwell?

268
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,980
No.

269
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,540
I've been reading medical books recently

270
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,690
and picked some tonics that are good for cultivation.

271
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
<i>Even if I don't say,</i>

272
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,590
<i>A'Jiu will hear about Mingye's death eventually.</i>

273
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,340
<i>But she's at a critical time in her cultivation.</i>

274
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,000
<i>What if she gets too emotional</i>

275
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,730
<i>and becomes a devil?</i>

276
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,750
<i>Never mind.</i>

277
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,730
<i>Instead of letting her hear about it from others,</i>

278
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,860
<i>I'll tell her discreetly.</i>

279
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,670
- Brother.
- A'Jiu.

280
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,400
Have you seen the pot I put on the table?

281
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,270
I saw that the ingredients and salt were already prepared.

282
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,630
So I cooked it in the kitchen for you.

283
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,380
If I was one minute late, I'm afraid you would have become tonic soup.

284
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,650
<i>A'Jiu, what happened?</i>

285
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,130
What's going on?

286
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,980
Nothing.

287
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,270
I suddenly remembered there were still ingredients that I didn't put in.

288
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,500
I planned to cook in a few more days.

289
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,080
Brother, let's go out.

290
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,980
Brother, what are you going to teach me today?

291
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,840
I haven't finished talking.

292
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,100
You're improving so fast.

293
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,410
Soon, I won't be qualified to teach you.

294
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,830
Then let me protect you, Brother.

295
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,360
Sure.

296
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,130
It's getting late.

297
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,780
If I leave any later, our father will find out.

298
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,840
I'll come to visit you ten days later.

299
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,280
Brother, now I can learn by myself.

300
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,610
It's a long trip. You don't have to come often.

301
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,080
You're getting independent so soon?

302
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,330
Fine then.

303
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,740
Then let's make it fifteen days. I'll be back to check your training.

304
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,410
<i>Mingye.</i>

305
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,680
<i>Mingye!</i>

306
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,580
<i>Have you ever had feelings for me?</i>

307
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,070
<i>Never.</i>

308
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,150
<i>I've never loved you.</i>

309
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,590
Oh, Sang Jiu, what were you thinking?

310
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,870
You even saved him.

311
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,720
Now he's transformed back.

312
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,180
When he wakes up and sees me,

313
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,550
he'll think that I'm badgering him again.

314
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,380
Why don't I take him back to Yuqing Palace?

315
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,360
Just leave him at the doorstep?

316
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,830
Forget it. I'll let you stay for a few more days.

317
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,210
When you wake up, you'll leave anyway.

318
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,610
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

319
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>Bed?</i>

320
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,520
<i>Did someone save me?</i>

321
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,810
<i>It's a human.</i>

322
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,100
Hey.

323
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,760
Hey. Wake up.

324
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,940
Don't be afraid. I'm not a bad guy.

325
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,760
Did you save me?

326
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,580
Are you there?

327
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,420
Wh… What are you doing?

328
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,980
<i>His eyeballs don't look injured.</i>

329
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,000
<i>Maybe his wounds haven't healed since he just transformed back to human form.</i>

330
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,580
<i>Let me take care of him for a little longer.</i>

331
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,030
That's right. I'm the one who saved you.

332
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,070
Where did you find me?

333
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,100
I…

334
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,150
I cast the net to catch fish, and caught a white loach.

335
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,660
I wanted to cook it with tofu, but you turned into a living person.

336
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,860
You even blew up my pot.

337
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,430
I'm sorry. I'll pay for your pot.

338
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,650
What are you doing?

339
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,010
Your wounds haven't healed yet. You're blind and limping.

340
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,070
Where are you going?

341
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,070
<i>Yeah, where should I go?</i>

342
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,860
<i>The Devil Lord is dead, and my soul is empty.</i>

343
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,890
<i>I couldn't fall together with them.</i>

344
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,040
<i>But this world no longer needs Mingye, the God of War</i>

345
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,340
Little loach, you still don't know, huh?

346
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,900
Now the Devil Lord has been killed.

347
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,700
The world has peace now.

348
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,000

Why don't you stay and work for me

350
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,350

351
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,210
I don't know how to work.

352
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,720
You can learn.

353
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,020
How about this?

354
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,690
You do odds and ends for me. And I'll help cure your eyes.

355
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,930
I'll let you go when your eyesight recovers.

356

How's that?

357
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,870
This is obviously a better deal for me.

358

371

I've changed your medicine. These are all skin traumas.
