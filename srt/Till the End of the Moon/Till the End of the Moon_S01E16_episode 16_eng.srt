3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,420
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,040
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,540
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:03,080
♫  I am not afraid of how the world treats me  ♫

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,160
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape.   ♫

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,560
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,180
♫  There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,160
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,120
   

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,980
   

16
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,030
Here.

17
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,580
What's wrong?

18
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
Feeling unwell?

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,010
Mozhu, if a friend of yours left you and could never make it back,

20
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,530
what would you do?

21
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,010
What if he died instead of refusing to come back?

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,540
If you have a spare moment today,

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,590
could you buy some wine for me from the town?

24
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,180
You have not fully recovered. You can't drink.

25
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,190
It's not what you thought. I want it to commemorate my friends.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,780
I heard when a mortal's relatives or friends died,

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,310
 they would evoke the dead with wine to commemorate and console their souls. 

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,710
 Some of my friends, who were very important to me, 

29
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,020
 passed away before me. 

30
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,420
 Where do you think mortals will end up after they die? 

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,530
 Their souls will wander 

32
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,640
 until they get to the Nether River 

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,070
 and float down the river to the end of the world. 

34
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,440
 What about gods? 

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,350
 Gods have no souls. 

36
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,280
 When gods fall, 

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,560
 they'll be completely gone in this world 

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,900
 and can't be seen anywhere. 

39
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,570
 But when they're remembered, they won't be completely gone. 

40
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,400
A new prescription?

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,250
Yes. Maybe this one will work.

42
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,330
If I can't recover, don't force it.

43
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,700
Just let it be.

44
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,590
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,170
Good medicine usually tastes bad. Just take it.

46
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,520
Or what? Never get back your sight and stay here forever for free food?

47
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,260
I don't know where else I can go.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
I don't have relatives.

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,660
All my friends have died.

50
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,530
My wife…

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,760
No.

52
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,650
I have nothing to do with her now.

53
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,470
She hates me.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,070
I'm afraid we won't ever meet again.

55
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,160
How…

56
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,800
How do you feel about her?

57
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,520
 I made it clear at the beginning 

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,220
 that we will go our own way. Do not disturb each other. 

59
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,270
Mingye, remember to tell me

60
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,740
when you feel any better with your eyes.

61
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,550
Even if you can see a little bit of light.

62
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,250
I have to be prepared.

63
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,220
Prepared for what?

64
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,260
 I must get ready 

65
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,310
 to leave here. 

66
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,870
Don't be so nosy.

67
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,970
Just let me know.

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Will you always be living here?

69
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,770
Why do you ask?

70
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,660
Now, in this world, you're my only friend.

71
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,600
May I visit you occasionally?

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,580
You can't.

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,300
After you get your sight back, I'll leave immediately.

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,540
Where will you go?

75
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,790
I don't know yet. It could be anywhere.

76
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,700
I'll just travel around, leading a free and happy life.

77
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,490
 If you knew it was me, 

78
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,290
 I'm afraid you wouldn't want to visit me again. 

79
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,750
Be careful on the stairs. Come on.

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,940
It is a sunny day!

81
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,980
Sit down and let me comb your hair.

82
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,680
- What? 
 - Just sit down.

83
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,700
It's the jasmine fragrance I made yesterday.

84
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,590
You're lucky to have some.

85
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,620
What… What's wrong?

86
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,490
♫  Flip through the written fabulous years in books  ♫

87
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,180
♫  Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret  ♫

88
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,370
♫  I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish  ♫

89
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,220
♫  A bond of marriage entwined for thousands of years  ♫

90
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,090
I'm fine.

91
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,190
Why are your eyes red?

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,490
Nothing. Maybe the fragrance irritates my eyes.

93
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,770
You should have told me. Let me check.

94
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,020
♫  My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

95
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,180
♫  My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

96
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,340
♫  I couldn't experience endless sorrows or worries  ♫

97
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,640
♫  A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears  ♫

98
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,860
♫  I only wish to exchange this life with eternity  ♫

99
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,220
♫  Ingenuine affection is also enough  ♫

100
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,170
♫  Sincerity makes flirtation hard  ♫

101
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,500
♫  I still believe in the touched feelings that you gave me  ♫

102
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,580
Do you feel better?

103
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,960
♫  Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed  ♫

104
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,360
♫  But this time, who will be the one  ♫

105
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,900
♫  Waiting for a long while?  ♫

106
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,080
What?

107
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,470
Nothing.

108
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,270
I thought your eyes recovered.

109
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't be too sad. Your eyes will recover.

110
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,890
These herbs are very efficacious.

111
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,840
 It turns out that the heaven treats me well. 

112
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,470
 I thought our paths would not cross again. 

113
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,050
 I did not expect that I could meet you again. 

114
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,190
 Sang Jiu, if I don't recover, 

115
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,620
 can we always stay together in this forest? 

116
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,960
 When I get the chance to tell Sang Jiu the truth, 

117
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,790
 I'll take her back to Shangqing God Realm. 

118
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,200
 I then will think of a way to purify her demonic energy and cleanse her essence. 

119
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,620
 I almost forgot. 

120
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,440
 My senior brother is coming in a few days. 

121
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,270
 I totally forgot my lessons lately. 

122
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,050
I've nearly recovered.

123
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,940
How about we switch places?

124
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,080
Come and sleep in the bed.

125
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,600
No way. Your eyes haven't recovered.

126
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,530
Then you come up on the bed.

127
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,150
We can squeeze up.

128
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,780
Don't worry. I'm a good sleeper.

129
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,770
I won't disturb you.

130
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,030
All right. Go to sleep.

131
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,620
Fine.

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,270
How come he hasn't got his sight back yet?

133
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,480
Tomorrow, I'll go up the mountain for another kind of herb.

134
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,780
It's said to be very efficacious.

135
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,900
 Sang Jiu, don't blame me for lying. 

136
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,810
 I just want us to stay together like this longer. 

137
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
 Even longer. 

138
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,930
Mingye.

139
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,650
Here. Take the decoction before it gets cold.

140
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,440
Open your mouth.

141
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,520
So sweet. Is it honey?

142
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,130
Yes. Because you hate the bitter decoction.

143
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,620
Come over.

144
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,030
You got a bee sting when stealing some honey?

145
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,790
Closer.

146
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,290
Even closer.

147
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,580
All right. It no longer hurts.

148
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,320
 Report. Goddess! 

149
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,780
In a bamboo forest, we found Lord Immortal's trace!

150
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,570
Come on.

151
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,820
Sit here in the sun.

152
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,510
I'll be back before noon.

153
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,220
I'll bring back some bamboo shoots for soup.

154
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,830
Okay.

155
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh. If you're thirsty, the water is on the table in front of you.

156
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,650
There are some leftovers in the kitchen.

157
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,750
If the wind rises, you have to put on your cloak.

158
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah, right beside you.

159
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,930
Okay.

160
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,380
I should go.

161
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,130
Mingye!

162
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,800
What are you doing in this place?

163
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
You're safe.

164
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,440
But why didn't you return to Yuqing Palace and let me know you are well?

165
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,080
I was badly wounded.

166
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,940
I retreated here and recuperated for some peace.

167
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,680
I am sorry to keep you worried.

168
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,640
You've recovered, right?

169
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,580
Mingye, how much longer will you stay here?

170
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,900
You go back without me. The scenery here is great.

171
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,130
I want to stay longer.

172
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,110
But you've just recovered. You need someone to take care of you.

173
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,670
- How about I stay here? 
 - No need.

174
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,790
Someone takes care of me here.

175
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,990
If nothing else, I'm going back for some rest.

176
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,210
I have to tell you an urgent matter

177
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,340
concerning a lot of people.

178
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,010
What is it?

179
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,650
Yesterday, heavenly soldiers reported

180
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,220
they found the Devil Lord's Bone-refining Seal in a valley.

181
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,880
That's why I hurried to you.

182
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,710
If the devil's energy overflows, I'm afraid…

183
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,590
The Bone-refining Seal has great devil energy.

184
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,260
If the land or water is polluted,

185
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,650
the consequences can be catastrophic.

186
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,670
We must not delay a single moment.

187
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,450
Let's go.

188
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,030
You two lead the way.

189
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,750
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

190
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,640
Hold on a minute.

191
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,910
Here we go.

192
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,440
Mingye, you leave with heavenly soldiers first.

193
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll fetch a weapon from Yuqing Palace and then catch up with you.

194
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,900
Fine.

195
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,760
 Sang Jiu, I'm hurrying to leave for an urgent matter. 

196
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,670
 Hearing that a devil artifact appeared, I have to go take care of it immediately. 

197
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,060
 In one to ten days, I will come back 

198
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,810
 and explain everything to you. 

199
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,390
 I am sorry to leave without saying goodbye. 

200
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,520
 I'll always miss you and think of you. 

201
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,350
 Mingye. 

202
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,740
The Bone-refining Seal is there in the center.

203
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,400
Even this crater was made by the Bone-refining Seal.

204
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,010
After the Devil Lord was gone,

205
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,930
I had our soldiers search everywhere

206
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,280
and finally, they found this devil artifact.

207
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,310
Thank you.

208
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,210
Finding the Bone-refining Seal consumed time and manpower only.

209
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,880
Mingye, your complete disappearance for days

210
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
was the matter that exhausted me.

211
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,010
Now, the Devil Lord is dead.

212
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,590
Without a master, the Three Devil Artifacts are less powerful.

213
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,740
But their devil energy still pervades for miles.

214
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,000
If we don't stop it,

215
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm afraid soon this place will be a shelter for demons.

216
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,880
My father told me the Bone-refining Seal has the most inscrutable functions

217
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,260
among the Three Devil Artifacts.

218
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,080
It can enhance the devil energy

219
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,610
and also make a seal or barrier.

220
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,480
When the heavenly soldiers were captured,

221
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,400
they were deprived of their divine essence, infused with devil energy,

222
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,100
and then became demons.

223
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,520
I really didn't dare to act rashly.

224
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,030
I had our men guard here until I found you.

225
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,550
 Deprived of their divine essence? 

226
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,310
 Sang Jiu is my only daughter and the princess of the Mo River! 

227
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,430
 For you, she extracted her divine essence and can never become an immortal! 

228
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,670
 Now, you think you can move on just by saying thank you? 

229
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,480
 My demonic energy backlashes. 

230
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,740
 If it can deprive someone of his divine essence, 

231
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,380
 maybe it can also help Sang Jiu rebuild her divine essence. 

232
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,760
I'll go check it out.

233
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,060
Mingye!

234
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,980
 This artifact appears to be evil but is moderate inside. 

235
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,180
 If the artifact is cleansed without devil energy, maybe it can mend its ways 

236
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,550
 and it can be put into good use. 

237
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,690
 The devil energy is temporarily held back. 

238
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,160
 I have to get it out as soon as possible. 

239
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,320
 The Bone-Refining Seal has huge devil energy 

240
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,030
 and has gradually infiltrated into the earth. 

241
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,400
 Powerful as I am, I still can't easily get it out. 

242
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,240
 It seems that I can only do this. 

243
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,930
 Heart-guarding Scale. 

244
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,380
 This is the hardest scale of a flood dragon like me. 

245
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,720
 Once the scale is injected with my divine power, it can serve as a shield to temporarily isolate the devil energy in the seal. 

246
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,040
Mingye, how did it go?

247
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,230
The seal crashed against the earth here.

248
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,980
They're nearly integrating.

249
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,450
To get the Bone-refining Seal, I had to exchange something.

250
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,500
I then exchanged my Heart-guarding Scale for it.

251
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,910
The Heart-guarding Scale was in your flesh.

252
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,720
How could you just pull it out?

253
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,260
The bodily pain wasn't much of a thing.

254
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,470
My father died in the fight against the Devil Lord.

255
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,310
Now, you sacrificed your Heart-guarding Scale

256
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,270
to exchange the devil artifact to grace this region.

257
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,410
You deserve to be the God of War.

258
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,680
If Father knew about this,

259
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,100
he would be gratified, too.

260
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,990
I conjured heavenly rain.

261
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,750
With the protection of my Heart-guarding Scale,

262
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,850
it won't be long before this place has abundant spiritual energy.

263
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,100
Surrounded by mountains,

264
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,510
there's no light in the valley.

265
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,020
Let's call it Mount Buzhao. 
   (Buzhao means no sun lights.) 

266
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,320
It's quite considerate of you, Mingye.

267
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,850
Father had many subordinates and disciples.

268
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,180
Only you followed in his steps

269
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,380
and knew his wishes best.

270
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,210
So, you would also protect

271
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,640
what my father had protected. Right?

272
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,310
Let's go.

273
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,690
Back to Shangqing God Realm first.

274
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,060
 So, this is the Sun Quadripod. 

275
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,310
 Before the world came into being, the Sun Quadripod's four legs represented four seasons. 

276
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,980
 The fire in it was the sun. 

277
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,330
 Burning fiercely. 

278
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,040
 When Tian Hao was alive, he used it to purify demons. 

279
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,200
 Unfortunately, it would cost the user's energy and shorten his life. 

280
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,650
Since then, it has been sealed here.

281
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,950
Purifying the Bone-refining Seal with the Sun Quadripod would really be perfect.

282
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,840
If it works, the purification can be done in four days and nights.

283
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,020
Then, I can use it to cure Sang Jiu.

284
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,690
 In the Sun Quadripod, there are spring, summer, fall, and winter. 

285
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,850
 The four seasons in the quadripod can purify everything. 

286
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,480
 When I burn my divine essence, 

287
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,850
 I can wash the devil energy off the seal. 

288
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,650
 In the future, nature may take its course and lead to something. 

289
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,450
 Sang Jiu and I can start all over again. 

290
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,500
 God of War, Mingye. 

291
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,720
 You can call me Mingye. 

292
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,970
 Why don't you try one? 

293
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,480
 Just try one. It's super sweet. 

294
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,980
♫  I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky  ♫

295
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,920
♫  Suspending the firefly and butterfly until the wind and snow arrive  ♫

296
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,270
♫  I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time to forget everything that's occurred  ♫

297
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,550
 Look at the sword, not me. 

298
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,010
 Are you willing to try dual-cultivation with me? 

299
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,640
 What? 

300
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:01,840
♫  Otherwise, we will spend ten thousand years like this  ♫

301
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,780
♫  Let's stop time before we say farewell  ♫

302
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,880
♫  Let the sweetness of your slight smile and the saltiness of my tears  ♫

303
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,930
 I will die and my soul will be destroyed on this journey.  
    

304
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,520
 Sang Jiu, 

305
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,640
 I will let you go. 

306
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,040
 It's better than being alone in Yuqing Palace for the rest of her life. 

307
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,760
 For so many days, 

308
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,130
 I dare not to say 

309
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,550
 or do anything. 

310
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,150
 I was even afraid to look at you and talk to you for a few moments. 

311
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,140
 Now, you don't even want to look at me. 

312
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,300
 Are you planning to use a piece of paper to drive me away? 

313
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,370
 Have you ever... even a little bit 

314
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,100
 for even one second, 

315
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,140
 had any feelings for me? 

316
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,970
 Never. 

317
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,250
 Sang Jiu. 

318
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,800
 Now, the Devil Lord has been killed. 

319
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,360
 Stability has been achieved in Three Realms. 

320
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,750
 Heaven grants mercy on me. 

321
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,610
 I will gradually make it up for... 

322
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,760
 what I owe you. 

323
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,340
 Wait for my return. 

324
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,570
 Even if I have to go all out, 

325
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,610
 I will purify the Bone-refining Seal 

326
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,250
 and remove the devil energy from you. 

327
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,640
 Mingye, how could you try to use the Bone-refining Seal 

328
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,290
 to cure that clam demon who lost her divine essence? 

329
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:42,580
 For her, you even take the risk of being possessed to use the Sun Quadripod. 

330
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,640
 Fine. 

331
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,670
Goddess, soldiers have assembled.

332
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,760
Thank you. I lost my parents and made no achievements in battles.

333
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
But you still take orders from me,

334
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,780
which scares me.

335
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,080
Don't say that, Goddess.

336
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,720
I and everyone else here followed

337
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,930
your father Tian Hao to settle in Shangqing God Realm.

338
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,870
Though you're young, you're the goddess of flying serpents

339
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,390
and owner of Yuqing Palace.

340
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,960
We don't dare to forget that.

341
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,150
Glad to hear that.

342
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,710
Mingye will have entered a strict meditation retreat for days.

343
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,430
To find the devil artifacts is concerned with people's lives.

344
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,360
It can't be suspended.

345
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,710
I just received the information

346
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,260
the Unionidae Tribe picked up a devil artifact.

347
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,040
Please go with me to search for it.

348
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,550
 Yes. 

349
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,010
 Try to fight with me for Mingye? 

350
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,540
 Sang Jiu, can you even survive? 

351
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,280
 Where on earth has Mingye gone? 

352
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,060
 I've been looking for him in the woods all day. 

353
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,300
 Without his vision, he couldn't have gone too far. 

354
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,650
 Did somebody take him? 

355
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,990
By order of Lord Immortal, you shall kill the clam demon on sight.

356
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,320
Search the place.

357
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,920
Yes.

358
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,570
 It's Tian Huan. 

359
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,600
 Mingye has already returned to the Shangqing God Realm. 

360
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,730
 Kill me on sight? 

361
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,780
 Mingye, is that you trying to kill me? 

362
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,490
Goddess Tian Huan, there's nobody here.

363
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,210
Goddess Tian Huan, there's no one outside, either.

364
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,140
Report, there's no trace of the clam demon.

365
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,030
Looks like she is one step ahead of me.

366
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,330
She escaped.

367
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,090
What a pity. She can run,

368
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,210
but she can't hide.

369
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,410
Let's go.

370
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,490
 No. I need to find out what that was all about. 

371
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,930
 What happened here? 

372
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,870
 These are new faces. 

373
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,010
Halt.

374
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,650
Who are you and why are you here?

375
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,070
I…

376
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,460
I'm a low-ranking immortal from the Lower Realm.

377
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,860
And I'm here to see Lord Immortal Mingye.

378
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,910
But you don't even have divine essence.

379
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,620
You are not so much an immortal as an imp.

380
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,870
What do you want to see the God of War about?

381
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,950
I have an urgent matter. Would you please get word to him?

382
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,660
Just give this to him…

383
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,580
What is this bead?

384
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm not passing it on to the God of War.

385
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,000
You should just leave.

386
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,510
I wish I could help you, but the God of War is in a 4-day strict meditation retreat.

387
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,320
He's not taking any visitors.

388
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,970
A strict meditation retreat? Why?

389
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,810
Is he not feeling well?

390
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,480
It's an important matter about the Four Continents and Three Realms.

391
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,100
He carries the peace of the world on his shoulder.

392
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,440
If something happened to him in the meditation retreat, who could take responsibility?

393
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,860
What has Goddess Tian Huan been up to?

394
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,100
Being on the same page with the God of War,

395
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,480
Goddess Tian Huan is leading the hunt for devil weapons scattered around the universe.

396
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,860
and evil beings roaming the Four Continents and Three Realms.

397
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,090
If any one of you demons is connected to the Devil Lord,

398
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,130
well, you might want to watch your back.

399
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,130
Mm, be careful.

400
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,060
 Since Mingye is tied up with his cultivation these days, 

401
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,950
 I'll just wait for him. 

402
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,990
 I have to get to the bottom of it all. 

403
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,690
Charge.

404
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,900
If you want to hurt my people,

405
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,000
you'll have to go through me first.

406
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,610
How come this river produces troublemakers?

407
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,930
You should ask yourself if you can take me.

408
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,540
Who are you to fight with me?

409
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,330
Go. Protect Father.

410
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,070
Yes.

411
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,410
Seize him.

412
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,790
You old clam demon, with thousands of years of cultivating,

413
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,740
yet you couldn't even take 100 blows dealt from my Fog Silk Brocade.

414
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,480
And you even call yourself a king?

415
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,430
That's funny.

416
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,580
Your son, on the other hand, was a handful.

417
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,000
But he, too, was defeated by me.

418
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,250
Tian Huan, what do you want?

419
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,540
To wipe evil demons off the map.

420
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,480
I am told the Water Tribe of the Mo River

421
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,790
is in cahoots with the Devil Lord and possesses a devil artifact.

422
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,510
Do you know it's a crime punishable by the extermination of a tribe?

423
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,110
But if you hand over the devil artifact, only the culprit gets punished.

424
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,960
The rest of you will be off the hook.

425
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,580
Nonsense!

426
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,970
We people in Mo River have always lived in peace and stayed in our own lanes.

427
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,730
How can we collude with the Devil Lord?

428
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,360
Is this the way the Gods of the Shangqing God Realm do things?

429
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,000
Framing people for crimes they didn't commit?

430
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,040
We offer protection to the three realms.

431
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,220
I don't need some lowly demon like you to tell me what to do.

432
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,500
So keep your opinions to yourself.

433
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,770
Why are you doing this to us in Mo River?

434
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,410
Have you forgotten the kindness we once showed you and Mingye?

435
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,320
You're right.

436
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,440
I do not have bad blood with people in Mo River.

437
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,800
Do you think I covet your poverty,

438
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,300
your demonic energy,

439
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,800
or these

440
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,610
crappy pearls of yours?

441
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,560
Goddess, should we run this by the God of War?

442
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,510
What do you mean?

443
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,520
Well, he is… he's the son-in-law of the Mo River.

444
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,050
The son-in-law of the Mo River...

445
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,760
This bunch of clam demons forced Mingye into marrying that smelly little clam demon.

446
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,490
He doesn't even like her. He had already divorced her.

447
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:07,190
How shameless they are to claim kindship with Mingye?

448
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,770
But... But there's no sign of a devil artifact.

449
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,220
That's because you're stupid to find a devil artifact.

450
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,700
It doesn't mean they aren't the Devil Lord's allies.

451
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,900
What?

452
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,540
Found your conscience after killing so many of the Water Tribe members?

453
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,240
Listen to me. They are in league with the Devil Lord.

454
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,950
We may not have found the weapon, but they fought back, which was suspicious.

455
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,440
Anyway, this demon is cunning.

456
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,620
Our heavenly soldiers fought back in an act of self-defense.

457
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,290
Don't worry. Mingye won't blame me for this.

458
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,520
We do not possess any devil artifacts.

459
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,900
But one thing's for sure. You have your demon.

460
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,400
You're jealous because my daughter married Mingye.

461
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,070
That's why you set her up.

462
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,060
I'm jealous of her?

463
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,010
A flying serpent is born to be a spirit beast.

464
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,000
Why would I, the flying serpent goddess,

465
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,940
be envious of an annoying and unsophisticated clam demon?

466
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,180
Do you know?

467
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,930
When her demonic energy flared up, I pretended to look after her.

468
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,450
I added some Ruo Water to the spring.

469
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,230
And I told her that was Essence-Cleansing Spring.

470
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:18,340
That dumb woman took my word for it and soaked in the water despite the pain.

471
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,530
Tian Huan, how could you be so vicious?

472
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,490
Whatever you do will come back to you.

473
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,250
Old clam demon, you and your Water Tribe will be wiped out today.

474
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,310
All thanks to your good daughter.

475
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,440
Getting involved with my Mingye,

476
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,730
she's bitten off more than she can chew.

477
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,000
 Sang Jiu, this is what you get for being against me. 

478
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,780
 By order of Lord Immortal, you shall kill the clam demon on sight. 

479
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,750
 Search the place. 

480
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,280
 Yes. 

481
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,080
 Why isn't this Image Reflection Pearl working anymore? 

482
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,590
 It runs on Senior Brother's demonic power. 

483
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,940
 Is it possible... 

484
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,120
 Did something happen to Senior Brother? 

485
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,190
 You're still new to demonic cultivation. 

486
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,600
 Your demonic energy isn't stable yet. 

487
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,420
 You need to avoid mood swings, 

488
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,730
 or you could slip into madness. 

489
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,480
 No one else in the Mo River is fairer than you, Princess. 

490
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,430
 You'll surely marry the right man someday. 

491
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,640
 Oh, you. You have the nerve to say it. 

492
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,380
 Mingye has divine essence. 

493
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,570
 And you do, too. 

494
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,500
 He is the God of War. 

495
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,430
 But what about you? You follow your brother and me everywhere and do nothing all day. 

496
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,980
 Have you no shame? 

497
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:24,980
 Remember, as long as you are sincere, 

498
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,380
 Gods will be moved. 

499
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,540
 It will. 

500
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,240
 All right, it is time for bed. 

501
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,500
 I'll read you stories tomorrow. 

502
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,910
 I am told the Water Tribe of the Mo River 

503
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,160
 is in cahoots with the Devil Lord and possesses a devil artifact. 

504
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,680
 Do you know it's a crime punishable by the extermination of a tribe? 

505
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,020
 We do not possess any devil artifacts. 

506
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,140
 But one thing's for sure. You have your demon. 

507
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,820
 You're jealous because my daughter married Mingye. 

508
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,460
 That's why you set her up. 

509
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,300
 I'm jealous of her? 

510
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,660
 Do you know? 

511
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,320
 When her demonic energy flared up, I pretended to look after her. 

512
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,900
 I added some Ruo Water to the spring. 

513
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,610
 And I told her that was Essence-Cleansing Spring. 

514
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,960
 That dumb woman took my word for it 

515
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,580
 and soaked in the water despite the pain. 

516
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,020
 Old clam demon, you and your Water Tribe will be wiped out today. 

517
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,270
 All thanks to your good daughter. 

518
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,130
 Getting involved with my Mingye, 

519
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,330
 she's bitten off more than she can chew. 

520
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,180
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

521
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,380
I shouldn't have fallen for him.

522
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,550
I shouldn't have saved him

523
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,110
and then even married him.

524
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:48,760
It is all because of my big mistake.

525
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,820
I should've known better,

526
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,910
I regretted.

527
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,810
I'm unworthy to be called your daughter

528
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,980
or Princess of Mo River.

529
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,440
