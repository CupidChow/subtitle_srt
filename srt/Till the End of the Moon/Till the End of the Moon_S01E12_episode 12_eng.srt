00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,440
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:39,180
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:47,260
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,820
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,080
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,220
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,540
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,280
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, to heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,300
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:31,240
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,040
   

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,000
   

16
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:31,370
 Comrades, your heroic souls will return to the stars. 

17
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,590
Mingye, there you are.

18
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,810
You haven't yet recovered from your serious injury. Beware of the wind and don't catch a cold.

19
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,123
Thanks.

20
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,013
Mingye, no need to be courteous to me.

21
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,580
You protect all beings in the Three Realms.

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,640
All I can do is to accompany you.

23
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,800
It's getting late.

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,540
The demons could strike at any moment.

25
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,690
Let me walk you back to your palace.

26
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,513
No, thanks.

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,700
The celestial troops suffered heavy casualties in the battle.

28
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,980
I need a moment to myself.

29
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,650
 Mingye. 

30
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,830
 So your name is Mingye. 

31
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,260
 You are the God of War. 

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,140
 No wonder you're so good in battle. 

33
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,790
 I wonder how the battle is going on. 

34
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,980
 Will the God of War come today? 

35
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,410
 We've been raided by the demons. Go inform the God of War, Mingye! 

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,210
 Look! The God of War is here! 

37
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,870
 Little flood dragon, you're quite good. 

38
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,930
 Before you're killed by the Sky-Slashing Sword, tell me your name. 

39
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,633
 Mingye. 

40
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,500
 I found him. He's here. 

41
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,500
What happened to you?

42
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,313
Wake up. Wake up.

43
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,360
Mingye. Mingye.

44
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,500
Mingye, wake up.

45
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,800
Mingye, wake up.

46
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
What's wrong with him?

47
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,790
The Devil Lord suddenly showed up and ambushed Mingye.

48
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,970
Mingye. Wake up, Mingye.

49
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,600
Mingye, please don't die. Mingye.

50
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,310
They're coming after us.

51
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,810
What should I do?

52
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,453
Follow me.

53
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,893
Mingye.

54
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,120
Mingye, wake up.

55
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,530
Mingye.

56
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,640
Where is this place?

57
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,820
This is the middle of the river, where the Water-calming Stone is.

58
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,270
The divine energy is abundant here. It may protect his last meridian.

59
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll leave him to you.

60
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Where are you going? How can I protect him alone?

61
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,510
Rest assured.

62
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,350
I'll cast a barrier to cover your scents.

63
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,870
Even if you cover our scents, you can't conceal our appearances.

64
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,530
What should I do if they find us here?

65
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,450
They won't. I'll lure them away.

66
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,170
After her!

67
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,480
 Mingye's breath is getting weaker. 

68
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,110
 If he dies, what will happen to me? 

69
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,280
 The Ancient Crystal. 

70
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,510
 Mingye was born in the East Sea. 

71
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,240
 This crystal is an ultimate aquatic treasure. 

72
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,170
 It might save Mingye's life. 

73
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,450
 The demons in this little river have a lowly status. 

74
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,920
 When I take the crystal and give them a chance to present the treasure to the God of War, 

75
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,400
 they should feel proud of it. 

76
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,670
 Mingye's in really bad shape right now. 

77
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,070
 I need to act expediently. 

78
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,510
The Water-calming Crystal was absorbed by him!

79
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,720
This man is Mingye, the God of War.

80
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,510
The Immortal Realm relies on him to counter the demon soldiers.

81
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,600
Whoever they rely on doesn't concern us.

82
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,870
I just know I'm the King of Mo River.

83
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,140
The Water-calming Crystal is what keeps ten thousand of residents in Mo River alive!

84
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,140
If we want to protect our people, we must make him return the crystal!

85
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,020
Dad, please don't kill him!

86
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,140
He absorbed the crystal because he was dying from the injury inflicted by the Devil Lord.

87
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,650
He was dying?

88
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,840
What a coincidence!

89
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,600
How did he happen to fall into my Mo River and take the Water-calming Crystal!

90
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,960
I… I brought him here.

91
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,870
- A'Jiu. 
 - What? I'm going to kill him!

92
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,403
No!

93
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,510
Mingye was already out of breath.

94
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,530
This place has the most abundant divine energy. I could only bring him here.

95
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,890
Besides, the Devil Lord's minions were after him.

96
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,000
I went to lead them away, but I didn't expect that he'd absorb the Water-calming Crystal.

97
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Did… Did you kill any of the Devil Lord's men?

98
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,733
I did.

99
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:22,700
You've… You've brought a terrible disaster to us today!

100
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,940
- Father, please calm down. 
 - Dad!

101
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,470
Since I caused the trouble, I shall take responsibility.

102
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,170
If the Devil Lord wants to catch the killer,

103
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,640
just hand me over to him.

104
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,420
- You take the responsibility? 
 - Father!

105
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,310
Are you capable of that?

106
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,760
Without the Ancient Crystal, the Water-calming Stone loses its energy source.

107
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,650
The Mo River will be muddy and billowy.

108
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,260
All of our people will suffer heavy casualties.

109
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,930
So many of their lives… How… How are you going to repay them?

110
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,140
The people of Mo River suffered a catastrophe today

111
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,620
because I failed to discipline my daughter.

112
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,170
Unionidae Tribe is always kind and peace-loving.

113
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,310
Now that we've lost our ancestors' blessing,

114
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,670
we'll definitely suffer from retribution!

115
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,440
The Water-calming Stone lost its energy source...

116
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,790
all because of me.

117
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,820
I should make up for it.

118
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,590
What are you doing?

119
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,750
What are you doing?

120
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,450
- A'Jiu! Come back! 
 - A'Jiu! Come back!

121
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,083
A'Jiu!

122
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,620
A'Jiu, don't be headstrong!

123
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,680
A'Jiu!

124
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,540
 My divine essence... 

125
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,110
 can replace the crystal to be the energy source. 

126
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,110
 I've made a mistake. 

127
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,110
I've extracted my essence to atone for my crime.

128
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,180
I only wish that the Mo River...

129
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,250
will be clear and calm.

130
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,063
A'Jiu! A'Jiu!

131
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,313
A'Jiu!

132
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,363
A'Jiu!

133
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,300
Father, all the aquatic residents have been appeased.

134
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,650
Please go get some rest. I'll watch her.

135
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,290
Your sister is asleep now.

136
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,100
I can stay with her for a little longer.

137
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,380
If she wakes up and gets angry at me, she might not want to see me.

138
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,750
Do you know? Your sister has been clingy since she was a kid.

139
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,280
Every night before she went to bed, she'd ask me to tell her like eight or ten stories.

140
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,000
And she could only sleep while grabbing my beard.

141
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,110
She was so young back then.

142
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,820
Her hair was short and sparse.

143
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,380
But she kept asking me to braid her hair every day.

144
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,423
Father.

145
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,873
I shouldn't… I shouldn't have hit her, should I?

146
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:20,160
Ever since she was born, she wasn't wronged a single bit.

147
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,240
She must've done this recklessly because I hit her.

148
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,040
She wasn't being reckless. She has grown up.

149
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,470
She's the princess of Mo River. She's saving her own people.

150
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,900
But… she has lost her divine essence.

151
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,790
The path of immortals and demons diverges.

152
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,310
She's been learning immortal arts since she was young.

153
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:53,220
Now without her divine essence, she won't be able to achieve immortality.

154
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,693
This won't do.

155
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,450
I can't just leave it like this.

156
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm still alive.

157
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,290
 The Devil Lord ambushed me. 

158
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
Thank you for saving my life.

159
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,590
The God of War, I don't deserve your gratitude.

160
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm not the one to save your life nor mend your immortal soul.

161
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,740
Your savior is the Ancient Crystal we used to calm the Mo River.

162
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,510
Is this the bottom of the Mo River?

163
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,420
I heard the Unionidae Tribe has lived here for generations and governs its territory.

164
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,830
I presume that you must be King of Mo River.

165
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,350
How generous of you to save my life with your treasure.

166
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,860
I don't know how to repay you.

167
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,540
No need.

168
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,830
We're just a small demon clan.

169
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,550
How dare we ask for rewards from the God of War?

170
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,510
I don't think I've ever offended you.

171
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,060
Would you be frank with me?

172
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,400
You're the noble God of War.

173
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,200
We don't deserve to be your friends.

174
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,510
I blame it on my nosy daughter who brought you back,

175
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,920
giving you an opportunity to steal the Ancient Crystal!

176
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,310
I've never stolen anything.

177
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,610
Please be careful with your words.

178
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,590
Did you not do it, or did you forget it?

179
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:42,410
Could it be that the Ancient Crystal just flew from the Water-calming Stone into your chest all by itself?

180
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:50,510
Or am I blackmailing you with the safety of our ten-thousand aquatic people as bargaining chips?

181
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,040
When I was shot down by the God-Slaying Crossbow, I lost consciousness.

182
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,200
I really don't remember what happened later.

183
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,400
Whether you admit it or not, the crystal has been exhausted by you.

184
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,590
I'm afraid you can't deny that.

185
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:10,420
As for what will happen to the Mo River, you don't need to worry about it.

186
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,870
My daughter Sang Jiu showed a wolf into the house, which cost us our most important treasure.

187
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,160
She knew she had made a huge mistake.

188
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,930
So she extracted her divine essence in replacement of the crystal.

189
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,480
May I have the chance to meet Miss Sang Jiu?

190
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,110
I want to thank her in person.

191
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,200
Thank her?

192
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,920
Sang Jiu is my only daughter and the princess of Mo River.

193
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,070
For you, she lost her divine essence and gave up her chance to achieve immortality.

194
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,250
So you're just going to say thank you and let it go?

195
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,540
Is that all the gratitude you have for her, and for the people in Mo River?

196
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,440
As long as it's within my capabilities, I'll do everything I can to compensate her.

197
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,630
I wonder how you would like me to show my gratitude to the people in Mo River?

198
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,920
Sang Jiu is the hope of the Mo River.

199
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,740
Now her future has been ruined for you.

200
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,880
If you are willing to marry her, protect her, and take her to the immortal realm,

201
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,640
I'll let bygones be bygones.

202
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,790
I've never met Miss Sang Jiu before.

203
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,250
There's no love between us.

204
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,720
This is such a hasty marriage.

205
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,170
Whether I want to or not,

206
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,720
will she agree?

207
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,590
Whether she wants to or not, is our family's matter.

208
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm asking you now.

209
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,550
What about you? Are you willing or not?

210
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,160
Brother, here you are.

211
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,180
How are you feeling?

212
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,450
Is Father still mad?

213
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,970
How's the river like now?

214
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,780
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

215
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,390
Brother, is there something wrong?

216
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,363
A'Jiu, Father let Mingye sign a marriage contract.

217
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:31,490
Mingye will come to marry you in three days.

218
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,460
Why? Did dad arrange this?

219
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,930
Did Mingye agree?

220
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,750
You sacrificed your divine essence for the Mo River.

221
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,440
No matter how hard you train, you'll never be able to leave this river.

222
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,350
Dad doesn't want to see you like this.

223
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,790
So he convinced Ming Ye to take you up to the Shangqing God Realm to cleanse your essence and cultivate.

224
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,030
There's nothing bad about staying in Mo River.

225
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,700
Aren't you and Dad both here?

226
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,590
Just tell me.

227
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,240
Are you willing to marry into the Shangqing God Realm?

228
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,933
I…

229
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,780
A'Jiu, listen to me.

230
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,720
Dad is picking a good future for you.

231
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,070
If you're not willing, no one can force you to do that.

232
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,550
You can stay at home forever.

233
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,300
You can be with Father and me.

234
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,933
Understand?

235
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,310
It's your own marriage. I won't urge you.

236
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,880
You think it through thoroughly.

237
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,580
If you're not willing, I'll convince Father to burn this contract.

238
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,110
Take your time.

239
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,210
Just tell me your answer within three days.

240
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,453
Brother...

241
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm willing.

242
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,280
Have you ever thought that Mingye has never met you? He'll naturally not love you.

243
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,490
But I love him.

244
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,140
   

245
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,503
You…

246
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,750
You've really made up your mind?

247
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,670
I want to be close to him.

248
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,620
I want to see the God of War whom I admire.

249
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,000
I want to see what the Shangqing God Realm looks like.

250
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,410
You used to say that I was a small girl with big ideas.

251
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,830
This time, just let me make my own decision.

252
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,650
I'm going to need you to help with my wedding.

253
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,883
All right. Get some good rest, then.

254
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,633
 Sang Jiu, you only have courage and a heart full of love. 

255
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:09,710
 Whether it's the right decision or not, you're going to have to carry on alone. 

256
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,780
Lord Immortal, the auspicious time is coming.

257
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,330
Please let me help you get changed.

258
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,630
No need to trouble you.

259
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,650
I'll do it myself.

260
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,943
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

261
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,790
Sister Ruby, does the God of War hate us?

262
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,110
He doesn't want us to serve him.

263
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,920
Do not take it personally.

264
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:28,310
Those servants from the East Sea told me that Lord Immortal preferred to be alone even when he hadn't been immortalized.

265
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,150
And he used to be a soldier. He really can't get used to being served.

266
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,220
Goddess Tian Huan is about to wake up soon.

267
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,050
When she's there, don't get too close.

268
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,160
If she sees you, you'll probably have trouble.

269
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,380
Does anyone in the Shangqing God Realm not know what she desires?

270
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,030
She has had an obsessive crush on Lord Immortal for years.

271
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,930
Now with the new bride coming, what hope does she have?

272
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,050
I used to think you were playing dumb. It turns out you really are foolish.

273
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,660
The words were spread all over the Shangqing God Realm.

274
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,730
Haven't you heard how the marriage was arranged?

275
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,920
The so-called bride is actually a clam demon in the Mo River.

276
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,670
This marriage is repayment for their kindness toward him.

277
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:11,310
They say that last time the God of War fell into the Mo River and used their…

278
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,540
 A'Jiu, this is the Image Reflection Pearl I raised. 

279
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,700
 Whenever you miss Dad and me, just use it to look at us. 

280
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,340
Let me give it a try. See what Dad is doing now.

281
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,640
It's the clothes I wore at a young age.

282
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,803
Dad.

283
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,933
A'Jiu. Mingye, the God of War.

284
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:58,280
Before you leave, a gentle reminder from the Mo River.

285
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,580
Maybe in the eyes of the immortal realm, the people of Mo River...

286
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,840
are as insignificant as ethereal duckweed or fine dust.

287
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,490
But A'Jiu is my father's only precious daughter.

288
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,330
A'Jiu was born to be timid but killed four demons to save you.

289
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,460
Mo River is a barren corner, but it offered you its crystal to heal you.

290
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,583
From now on, if you dare neglect or mistreat A'Jiu, even if you're the God of War,

291
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,910
I'll hold you accountable for her and for Mo River!

292
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,440
Who are you?

293
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,710
I'm Sang You, A'Jiu's elder brother.

294
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,940
Okay, I promise you.

295
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,180
 I will have a happy life. 

296
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,740

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,080
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

316
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,740
♫  If fate is a calamity, it never ends  ♫

317
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,060
♫  The sands of the wilderness roll across my longing  ♫

318
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,520
♫  My turbulent years  ♫

319
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,183
Be careful.

320
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,660
♫  Why is the age of my heart a myriad?  ♫

321
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,590
♫  Only because of that cool and dark night  ♫

322
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,650
 The bride and the bridegroom have heard about 

323
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,840
 each other's qualities and virtues for a long time. 

324
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,360
 Today, they finally meet and have decided to be husband and wife. 

325
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,400
 They promise to love each other forever and write their vows in this contract. 

326
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,220
 Mingye and Sang Jiu are married today. 

327
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,900
 May Heaven and Earth be informed. 

328
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,670
 I'm asking you now. 

329
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,980
 Are you willing or not? 

330
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,820
 My poor daughter lost her divine essence for saving you. And she even killed demon soldiers. 

331
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,050
 If the Devil Lord wants to find the culprit, I'm afraid she won't be able to live. 

332
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,190
 I can promise you to take Miss Sang Jiu back to the Immortal Realm. 

333
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,600
 I will cleanse her essence and protect her. 

334
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,400
 You stole the crystal. How can I trust you? 

335
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,920
 You might lie to Jiu and lie to us all. 

336
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,510
 I really don't know anything about that. 

337
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,360
 I hope you won't pursue it any further. 

338
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,690
 Then sign this marriage contract, so that we can trust your words. 

339
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,740
   

340
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,110
 Will this do? 

341
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,510
 You're really a straightforward man. 

342
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,110
 Our humble home in Mo River doesn't deserve to accommodate someone like you. 

343
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,900
 Sorry for not walking you out. 

344
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,940
Lord Immortal, it's getting late.

345
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,400
Got it.

346
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,570
You may go back to rest.

347
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,973
Yes.

348
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,373
Beryl.

349
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,280
This clam demon from the river really doesn't seem to have seen the world.

350
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,630
She's from a little ditch. What do you expect anyway?

351
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,110
I'm afraid she has never seen what our Immortal Realm looks like after living so many years.

352
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,080
- Lord Immortal. 
 - Lord Immortal.

353
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,400
Why didn't you two remind her?

354
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,460
Lord Immortal, we saw Madam was having a good time.

355
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,030
We didn't dare to interrupt her.

356
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:49,060
That's why we forgot to remind her.

357
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,523
The God of War, Mingye.

358
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,060
Miss Sang Jiu.

359
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,300
Miss Sang Jiu, is there anything?

360
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,383
I…

361
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,330
The God of War, Mingye…

362
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,230
You can just call me Mingye.

363
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:16,623
Mingye, I was waiting for you last night. But you didn't come.

364
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:18,450
So I accidentally fell asleep.

365
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,990
Did you come afterward? Did I oversleep?

366
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,533
Sorry.

367
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:28,683
Actually, I should have been frank with you last night.

368
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,690
We haven't met before. There's no fate for us to be together.

369
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,190
Although we're married, it's not out of my own will.

370
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,630
I guess you must think the same.

371
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,130
Since we're not actually husband and wife, for our future life,

372
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,190
why don't we make three rules?

373
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,263
First. You may enter or leave this Yuqing Palace freely.

374
00:47:53,263 --> 00:47:56,230
I won't go into your bedroom.

375
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,480
You and I will act on our own and not disturb each other.

376
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,743
Second. You're my wife nominally, but you can't use your title to bully others.

377
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:09,373
Third.

378
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,780
If you have anyone you love in the future, feel free to marry him.

379
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,590
I can write a letter to Clam King...

380
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,090
to divorce you.

381
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,280
I've got military affairs to attend to.

382
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,740
Excuse me for not keeping you company.

383
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,630
Sister Ruby, you guessed right.

384
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,020
She looks kind of pitiable in this case.

385
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,480
What's pitiable about her?

386
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,380
The Unionidae Tribe was blackmailing our Lord Immortal for saving his life.

387
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,600
They'll reap what they sow. Otherwise, should we be friendly to her?

388
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,530
Speaking of which, we still don't know the name of that little clam demon.

389
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,610
I'm Sang Jiu.

390
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,580
- Mad… Madam Sang. 
 - Madam Sang.

391
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,600
What are your names?

392
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,150
I… I'm Beryl. She's Ruby.

393
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,530
Two sisters, actually, I want to ask you something.

394
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,030
Do you know what the God of War likes in his daily life?

395
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,810
If I want to spend more time with him, what should I do?

396
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,110
Lord Immortal doesn't seem to have any hobbies.

397
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,920
He doesn't like to be close to anyone, either.

398
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,530
If he's not training soldiers, he'll be at war.

399
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,670
He works very hard.

400
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:52,440
So, Goddess Tian Huan often cooks soup with spirit herbs for Lord Immortal as tonics.

401
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,993
Also…

402
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,030
Madam, we're just lowly maids.

403
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,980
How are we supposed to know how to do that?

404
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,900
I understand.

405
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,960
So he loves training and fighting.

406
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,710
Now that I'm married, I can't be lazy and sleep in anymore.

407
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,920
I'll get up early and practice with weapons.

408
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,440
If I'm admitted into the army as an exception, wouldn't I be able to get close to him?

409
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,710
Maybe I can even help in the war.

410
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,030
Madam, you've got quite a unique way of thinking.

411
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,733
By the way, that Goddess Tian Huan you just mentioned, who is she?

412
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,180
Goddess Tian Huan is the only daughter of the previous God of War, Tian Hao.

413
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,710
He used to be the owner of the Yuqing Palace.

414
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,480
Lord Immortal followed Tian Hao for many years.

415
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,230
For Lord Immortal, Tian Hao is both his benefactor and his comrade.

416
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,030
Before Tian Hao died, he entrusted Goddess Tian Huan to Lord Immortal.

417
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,480
Therefore, Lord Immortal often looked out for her.

418
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,780
Madam, please don't overthink.

419
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,610
Is she that pretty female immortal with a very tall chignon?

420
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,880
I heard she's still in a coma.

421
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,010
Can I go and visit her?

422
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,800
The Goddess is still in seclusion in the Bihan Hall.

423
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,950
I'm afraid it is not convenient to visit her.

424
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,840
All right then.

425
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,710
When she wakes up, please remember to tell me.

426
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,630
I'll go and see her.

427
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,820
But the God of War only needs immortal soldiers.

428
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,381
He can't take in a little demon without divine essence.

429
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,860
