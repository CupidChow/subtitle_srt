00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,060
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,320
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,900
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,180
♫  I am not afraid of  ♫

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,080
♫  how the world treats me  ♫

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,160
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape. How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,480
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,120
♫  There are times when I'm fragile,  ♫

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,140
♫  heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,160
♫  My existence  ♫

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,700
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,060
   

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,230
   

19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,880
Don't you really like her?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,620
I… I can… like her?

21
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,920
Why is it so surprising?

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,200
As long as you are a person, you can have feelings for someone.

23
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,680
 Unless one doesn't have love threads. 

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,790
I'll leave you to reflect on it.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,940
I can find a way to make her fall in love with me.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,200
♫   When your gaze comes a little closer   ♫

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,730
♫    My heart beats faster taking root in the void  ♫

28
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,550
♫    The stars scattered in the sky   ♫

29
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,570
♫   Quietly falling on your brow   ♫

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,080
This, this, this, this, and this… All of them.

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,913
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

32
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:53,610
♫    I want to enter your dreams   ♫

33
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,720
♫   To explore the spring in your eyes   ♫

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,750
A full moon is coming soon.

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,710
In Mount Changze, this would be a good time

36
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,250
stargazing along Heaven Lake.

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,200
 I haven't seen Tantai Jin for two days. 

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,630
 I wonder what he's doing. 

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,770
 It's so heavy. Do you want to tire me to death? 

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,930
♫   Only hoping to be moved; Not afraid to call each other's name   ♫

41
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,210
♫   The traces of my innermost feelings, don't ask if they are worth it   ♫

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,090
♫   Just believe that it's the right time   ♫

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,390
 Pianran's tips work well. 

44
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,463
Tantai Jin.

45
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,070
 Pianran's tips work well. 

46
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,160
What do you want from me?

47
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,720
Why did you suddenly give me gifts?

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,430
Do you like them?

49
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,193
Not really.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,220
However, I've heard that girls love them.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,970
I thought you would as well.

52
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,010
Throw them away if you don't like them.

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,220
♫   From the first glance to being immersed in passion   ♫

54
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,410
♫   I carefully trace the lines of your palm   ♫

55
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,210
♫   We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts   ♫

56
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,300
Tantai Jin, I made you food to please you.

57
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,660
Did you send me gifts for the same good reason?

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,950
♫   Just believe that it's the right time   ♫

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,500
Let me teach you a trick. Do what others like.

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,080
If you want one happy, you need to give him what he likes.

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Well, what do you like then?

62
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,570
Ye Xiwu, the hour is late and there are many mosquitos.

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,860
Why do you bring me here?

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,900
Didn't you want to give me a gift?

65
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,910
Stay here and keep me company for a little while.

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,480
Look. How beautiful the stars are.

67
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,153
Take a seat.

68
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,970
What's wrong? Did something happen?

69
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,160
Nothing.

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,590
It's just that the sight of the full moon reminds me of my family.

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,410
Not the one out there. It's the one when I was young.

72
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,700
When you were young?

73
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,720
There was a lake as well.

74
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,610
The water is clear and cold in summer.

75
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,290
I used to lay beside the lake and watch the stars

76
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,830
while fireflies lit the bushes.

77
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,190
At least, there are fireflies here.

78
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,603
Look.

79
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,560
 What's the name of the lake? Where is it? 

80
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,310
 Somewhere far away. 

81
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,270
 I'll take you there when the chance comes. 

82
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,060
Your Highness, we're stuck.

83
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,880
So is the Jing Army.

84
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,780
We don't know how long it will last.

85
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,643
You are wrong.

86
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:38,900
We're stuck, but they're not.

87
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,450
Please make it clear.

88
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,660
Jia Pass has natural barriers, and it's only 20 miles from the Mo River.

89
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,690
Even if we manage to pass the river,

90
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,280
breaking through the line of defense along the coast of Jing Kingdom is not enough.

91
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,180
When our army just crosses the river and hasn't yet regrouped,

92
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,560
the Jing Army will pour from the pass and force us back to the river.

93
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,250
However, His Majesty has ordered that we must not retreat.

94
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,820
Based on what you said, we can only win by confronting the pass after crossing the river.

95
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,860
How-How could that be possible?

96
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,150
We have no supplies nor stamina.

97
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,910
Tantai Jin knows that very well.

98
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,980
That's why he confidently...

99
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,010
returned to the capital.

100
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,300
He retreated to lure us,

101
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,880
expecting us to lose patience and attack.

102
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,570
What should we do then?

103
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,440
We have three options.

104
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,433
Option one: Negotiate for peace to cut our loss in time.

105
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,710
That won't do, Your Highness.

106
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,280
His Majesty won't agree.

107
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,470
Option two: Wait until the Mo River freezes to reduce the minimal loss and then attack.

108
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,603
However, that might take months.

109
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:04,790
Then... what about option three?

110
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,813
Option three:

111
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,610
We pretend to attack the Mo River while sending a squad

112
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,160
to find the other breach.

113
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,870
But this multi-front battle requires the cooperation of other generals in the court.

114
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,690
I can't do it alone.

115
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,113
Your Highness,

116
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:28,230
accomplished generals in the court have either been persecuted or have retired.

117
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,890
Even General Ye…

118
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,480
We have no men.

119
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,400
There's nothing we can do but wait for the river to freeze.

120
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,910
However, His Majesty is paranoid. He won't allow it.

121
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,060
Moonshadow Guards of the Jing Kingdom?

122
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,410
What are they doing here?

123
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,763
Let's go.

124
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,450
Your Majesty, it's done.

125
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,350
The letter has been intercepted by the Sheng sentry.

126
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,610
I'll send men to watch their moves.

127
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,360
How about those Moonshadow Guards for this mission?

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,610
They've escaped back. Some of them are injured, but their lives are not in danger.

129
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,123
Good.

130
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,250
Reward them handsomely and promote them up by two ranks.

131
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,430
Yes.

132
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,170
You may leave now.

133
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,760
Why do you want me here?

134
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,060
I did not cook today.

135
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,560
What's this?

136
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,200
A star.

137
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,860
Is this a star?

138
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,280
It fell from the sky and was collected by a herdsman in the north.

139
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,130
 I never thought he would really look for a star. 

140
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,190
Today is your birthday.

141
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,630
This siderite is a gift for you.

142
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,150
 So today is Ye Xiwu's birthday. 

143
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,630
 And he remembers. 

144
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,300
Why? You don't like it?

145
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,510
No, I'm just a bit surprised.

146
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,083
Ye Xiwu, I'll give you one-day leave.

147
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,130
Go home.

148
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,483
Great.

149
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,243
Tantai Jin, come home with me.

150
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:54,430
Let's celebrate it together at home.

151
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,383
Sure.

152
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,000
   

153
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,090
Grandma, I'm full.

154
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,920
The noodles stand for a long life. Have more.

155
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,210
Look at you. You've lost a lot of weight in the palace.

156
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,700
Chuntao told me that Tantai Jin accompanies you but stays outside.

157
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,310
As far as I can see, the grandson-in-law has every reason

158
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,520
not to enter our house.

159
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,730
Think about it. When he was with us, he had a pretty tough time.

160
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,230
Not only Zeyu found fault with him and bullied him,

161
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,540
your father and I had never really treated him with respect.

162
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:23,400
In the end, we mistreated him.

163
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,610
 No wonder he happily came with me, but then refused to come in at the door. 

164
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,510
 He is reminded of something unhappy from the past. 

165
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:39,450
To be honest, he spared our lives despite our ill-treatment,

166
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,740
so I'm grateful for that even though he's an enemy of Great Sheng.

167
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,370
Besides, I can tell he really cares about you.

168
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,400
Little one, you should cherish it.

169
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,520
As for other aspects, there is ample time to consider.

170
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
There's no need to rush.

171
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,150
You're right, Father.

172
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,920
I'm full. I should go back now.

173
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,130
I have some unfinished business in the palace.

174
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,763
Little one. Little one!

175
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,490
   

176
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,270
Tantai Jin.

177
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,590
What happened?

178
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,440
Why do you return so soon?

179
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,400
You had a tough time with my family.

180
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,050
It's so foolish of me to bring you back.

181
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,800
I only thought you'd feel lonely in the palace.

182
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,120
The trip was meant to cheer you up.

183
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,210
Yet, you ended up waiting for me here.

184
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,720
I…

185
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,413
It's okay.

186
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,650
Did you enjoy your birthday?

187
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,770
That's enough.

188
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,970
Although I didn't visit your family, still,

189
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm happy you brought me with you.

190
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,050
Since we have come, let me show you a place.

191
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,920
   

192
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,070
You mentioned your old home. 
    

193
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,230
This is the place I desired to come to the most when I was young.

194
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,410
 Auntie Lan'an, do you know where Lingxing Hall is?  
    

195
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,040
 Is it far from here? 

196
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,470
 Lingxing Hall? 

197
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,800
They said Consort Rou is buried there.

198
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,790
Consort Rou is my mom, right? I want to take a look.

199
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,930
Can we walk there in one or two days?

200
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,530
Well, Lingxing Hall is right beside the city gate.

201
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,100
It is not far.

202
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,540
Only an hour's walk.

203
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,560
However, it's an imperial graveyard.

204
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,440
You cannot go there.

205
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,193
Understand?

206
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,550
This one hour's walk is so long

207
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,840
that I didn't finish it until I took the throne.

208
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,700
   

209
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,570
   

210
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,710
   

211
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,573
Mother, she's Ye Xiwu.

212
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,260
I'm your daughter-in-law.

213
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,280
If you saw her for yourself, you'd love her.

214
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,420
Tantai Jin is now the King of Jing.

215
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,800
He's doing pretty well. You can rest assured.

216
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll come and see you when I have time.

217
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,490
I didn't let you say this for me.

218
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,263
Come.

219
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,610
I give you this opportunity...

220
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,080
to pick a place you like and decide where you want to be buried.

221
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,280
Stop your gloating.

222
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,830
I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you.

223
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,080
Answer me, Ye Xiwu.

224
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,180
Do you have feelings for me?

225
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,590
One day together, deep love forever.

226
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,040
Of course, you're my husband.

227
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,070
No, I don't mean the marital duty.

228
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,970
I want your true love.

229
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,180
 Young Devil Lord, this is the only thing I can't give you. 

230
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,720
It's fine. I understand.

231
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,200
True love doesn't come easily.

232
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,250
There's no need to rush.

233
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,800
I heard your mother also passed away when you were young.

234
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,550
If you want to commemorate her,

235
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,640
I can set up a spirit tablet here for her.

236
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,240
It's no big deal. She passed away a very long time ago.

237
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,980
Really?

238
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,500
You used to cry every time you went to commemorate her before.

239
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,133
Remember?

240
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,760
It is a bit late to pretend, don't you think?

241
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,490
 Sorry, I'm not Ye Xiwu. 

242
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,360
 I'm lying to you. 

243
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,820
 Why does Tantai Jin want my affection? 

244
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,500
Is he...

245
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,120
in love with me?

246
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,190
 The spikes increase so slowly. 

247
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,790
 I suppose he doesn't understand love yet. 

248
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,210
 Until when will I collect all of them? 

249
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,500
 Jize said after his fall, Barren Abyss Barrier lasts only 300 days. 

250
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,710
 I need to hurry up. 

251
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,880
 It hurts badly by one single poke, 

252
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,840
 while nine spikes will pierce Tantai Jin's heart. 

253
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,810
Your Majesty, this is the information we intercepted.

254
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,030
How dare Lin harbor such ambition after I gave him military power!

255
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,110
Calm down, Your Majesty.

256
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,850
How can I calm down?

257
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,070
Haven't you heard the rumor in the city?

258
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,700
They said Prince Xuancheng disapproved of my decision to start a war.

259
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,190
He thinks I am militaristic at the cost of the people.

260
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,350
A rumor is a rumor.

261
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,430
I've urged him many times. Have you ever seen him deploy his troops?

262
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,080
I suppose everyone in the court is expecting me to hand him the throne.

263
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,180
Your Majesty, Prince Xuancheng is loyal and filial to you.

264
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,280
There must be a reason why he doesn't deploy troops.

265
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,380
Maybe you think too much.

266
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,351
I didn't mean it.

267
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:55,550
I suppose you're one of them.

268
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,910
Guards, drag him out and club him to death.

269
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,940
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

270
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,150
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

271
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,083
Your Majesty, please spare me.

272
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,240
 Your Majesty! 

273
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,743
Report. Your Highness, an order from the Sheng capital.

274
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,110
What is it, Your Highness?

275
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,760
His Majesty demands us to march north in three days.

276
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,700
What should we do?

277
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,780
If we do this, the casualties will be grave.

278
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,210
What do you think, Your Highness?

279
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,750
Follow the order, of course.

280
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,750
Your Highness, there's something I must say.

281
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,840
A general does what needs to be done.

282
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,910
As you said earlier, as long as we stay put, we can hold the Mo River.

283
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,560
If we attack recklessly, we're almost sure to fall.

284
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,930
I'm a subject of the Sheng Kingdom and the son of His Majesty.

285
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,640
I can't disobey my father's and my king's order.

286
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,320
I shall lead the soldiers...

287
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,460
and make a final attempt.

288
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,590
 How do we fight this battle? 

289
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,023
 Yes. 

290
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,240
 What should we do? 

291
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,890
Your Majesty, Xiao Lin crossed the river

292
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,940
and landed on the north bank.

293
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,530
As I expected, the King of Sheng has taken the bait.

294
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:24,360
Qingyu, I promised you to unite the country and end the war.

295
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,920
The time has come.

296
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,591
Qingyu, follow me. Let's ride to Jia Pass tonight.

297
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,083
Yes.

298
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,460
Where is Tantai Jin?

299
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,840
He left for the battlefield.

300
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,390
Not long ago.

301
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,280
They said Xiao Lin swooped in on the Mo River last night.

302
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,290
Xiao Lin.

303
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,260
Why didn't he take you?

304
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,660
Little Madam,

305
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,650
with so many great generals in the Jing Kingdom,

306
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,120
including your own brother in the front,

307
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,750
why would he need me?

308
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,330
Your Highness, the enemy at Jia Pass didn't expect us to cross the river so quickly.

309
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,080
We can break through this pass in less than half a day.

310
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,460
It will cost too many lives.

311
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,080
If we can't take Jia Pass today, we'll lose nearly half of our men.

312
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,320
We'll succeed.

313
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,380
There are only a few thousand troops here in Jia Pass.

314
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,690
We almost broke right through here following them.

315
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,760
They won't last long.

316
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,800
Never underestimate your enemy.

317
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,970
We lost our men to cross the Mo River.

318
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,600
We fought so hard for days before seeing a glimmer of hope.

319
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,450
If we can't take Jia Pass by force today,

320
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,450
then we crossed the Mo River in vain.

321
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,450
 Everyone, return to the city at once. 

322
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,410
   

323
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,280
Tantai Jin is already here. He came faster than I thought.

324
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,840
Your Majesty, shall we send the Moonshadow Guard to flank them from the outside?

325
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,360
We can eliminate them once and for all.

326
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,950
There's no need.

327
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,150
Today, I'll hold Xiao Lin captive by myself on the battlefield

328
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,850
and destroy Sheng's will to fight.

329
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,930
- Your Highness. 
 - Your Highness.

330
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,080
Your Highness.

331
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,613
Your Highness.

332
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,170
He's the king of the Jing Kingdom.

333
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,410
He can do witchcraft.

334
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,250
I heard that he could drive demon beasts.

335
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,040
It was his Firewing Army that breached General Ye's defenses

336
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,120
and defeated him in less than half a month.

337
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,320
He was a hostage prince in the Sheng Kingdom.

338
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,170
His Majesty didn't treat him well.

339
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,370
He's not going to get back at us, is he?

340
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,080
Xiao Lin, we can talk.

341
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,560
Don't go there.

342
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,093
It's okay.

343
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,710
Xiao Lin, now you have all the prestige of Sheng.

344
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:37,170
If you will submit to me, I don't mind governing the world with you.

345
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,520
Likewise. If you're willing to withdraw your troops and submit yourself to the Sheng Kingdom,

346
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,570
I'm also willing to tell my father and confer you a lord.

347
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,060
You really don't care about the lives of the Sheng soldiers, Your Highness.

348
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,420
Your army has suffered heavy losses at the Mo River and Jia Pass.

349
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,110
You knew that your odds of winning this battle were slim,

350
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,910
but you couldn't go against your king's orders,

351
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,410
so you decided to take the plunge.

352
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,123
Am I right?

353
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,670
What a pity. Had I been here a few hours later,

354
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,480
perhaps you really could have taken Jia Pass.

355
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,410
However, as smart as you should know,

356
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,770
even if you managed to retreat today,

357
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,070
Sheng will only last for a few more days.

358
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,220
The Sheng Kingdom has not come to an end yet.

359
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,620
Don't you try to mislead the people here.

360
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,390
Xiao Lin.

361
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,600
A great man should go with the flow,

362
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,180
not fight it pointlessly.

363
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,493
Looks like...

364
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,210
there's no deal.

365
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,940
Xiao Lin, you know perfectly well that you can't win.

366
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,490
- Your Highness. 
 - Your Highness.

367
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,400
Heart-guarding Scale.

368
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,200
What a treasure.

369
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,850
Jia Pass is such an ideal place to draw lightning.

370
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,270
Look at how many thunderbolts and lightning just one Lightning Charm can draw.

371
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,930
It's a pity that you reacted too fast, Your Majesty.

372
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:48,640
Otherwise, you could personally taste what it's like to be struck by lightning.

373
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,890
We missed our timing. There's no need to fight.

374
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,790
Let's call it quits and retreat.

375
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,133
Your Majesty.

376
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,370
Let them go.

377
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,470
Why, Your Majesty?

378
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,270
He's a smart man.

379
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,990
This war was first started by the King of Sheng.

380
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,940
It's a war with no just cause.

381
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,320
The forced attack on Jia Pass was just his last attempt.

382
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,710
He knew he couldn't win.

383
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,510
 Only when I reunite all the lands will the war truly end. 

384
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,110
 It is time to end the continuous conflict of thousand years between the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms. 

385
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,210
Useless! You are all useless.

386
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,410
Tantai Jin is almost here.

387
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,090
Go back and tell Xiao Lin that if he can't hold Boshan City, he doesn't have to come back.

388
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,390
Also, send an edict to the Side Consort of Prince Xuancheng.

389
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,840
Tell her to come to the palace at once and stay at the queen's side.

390
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
Your Highness, why did you get hurt so badly this time?

391
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,850
Tantai Jin was on the battlefield himself.

392
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,880
Tantai Jin?

393
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,340
His troops will soon reach here.

394
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,140
If we lose Boshan City,

395
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,250
the Sheng will have no more strongholds to defend.

396
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,910
However, judging from our current situation,

397
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,010
there's nothing we can do.

398
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,580
Your Highness, a country's fate is unpredictable.

399
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,140
The current situation is not something you can control alone.

400
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,270
Bingchang, I'm a son of the Xiao family.

401
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,680
My father may be unkind, but I can't be unfilial.

402
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,390
The current war situation is not good for us.

403
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,390
If I die on the battlefield one day…

404
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,210
Your Highness, please don't say something like that.

405
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,490
Death is always a hair's breadth on the battlefield.

406
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,290
I should have told you this earlier.

407
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,543
Bingchang, if I die in the future,

408
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,940
I hope you won't have to remain a widow for me.

409
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,530
If you find someone reliable

410
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,870
who happens to win your heart

411
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,010
and can take care of you for the rest of your life,

412
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,660
it's not a bad idea to marry again.

413
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,003
No.

414
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,610
If that day comes,

415
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,560
I'll die alongside you.

416
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,340
Didn't you say that...

417
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,500
no matter how good or bad it is, you'll bear it with me?

418
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,510
I shouldn't have scared you.

419
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,810
It's okay. Don't cry now.

420
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm fine right here.

421
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,340
Don't worry. No matter what happens,

422
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,770
I'll keep you safe.

423
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,870
 However, if you can't even save yourself,  

424
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,400
 how can you save me? 

425
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,240
It took me so hard to collect a few spikes

426
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
and now, Young Devil Lord ran away.

427
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,230
What should I do now?

428
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,600
The way I see it, little meteor, you're just like him,

429
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,960
all dark inside and out.

430
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,940
And you've got so many holes in you,

431
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,440
just like he has so many tricks and schemes.

432
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,260
Why don't I call you Little Jin?

433
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,200
What do you think?

434
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,750
Little Jin, luckily, you won't run away without saying anything.

435
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:29,280
 If we are apart for long, those spikes might shrink back again. 

436
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,040
 I wonder how he's doing on the battlefield. 

437
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,720
 Tantai Jin said that if you wanted to contact him, 

438
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,260
 you could write a letter and give it to the crow. 

439
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,450
♫  Flip through the written fabulous years in books  ♫

440
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,310

Your Majesty.

458
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,750
Has Ye Xiwu sent another letter?

459
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,440
Yes. It's the fourth one today.

460
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,510
How can she write so much?

461
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,330
The crow will be exhausted.

462
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,630
The crow has complained about it recently.

463
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,810
Put it down.

464
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,343
Yes.

♫  But I never forget your utterance, "No regrets"  ♫

470
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,850
 I was back at Ye Mansion this evening. 

471
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,910
 I had Grandma's flower cake. 

472
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,930
 It tastes sweet and smells so nice. 

473
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,470
 You would love it if you were here. 

474
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,560
 So I learned how to make them with Grandma. 

475
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,200
 However, I don't know why the flower cakes I made smelled funny. 

476
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,560
 How is the food in the barracks? 

477
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,980
 Not so good. I bet. 

478
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,470
 Come back soon. I'll be waiting for you.

482
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,210
 No. I can't let her see that my handwriting has changed. 

483
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,670
♫  Who is not willing to let go?  ♫

484
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,970
♫  Who dares not to insist?  ♫

485
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,870
 She urged me to come back. 

486
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,910
 It's probably only because she doesn't want Sheng to be defeated by me so quickly. 

487
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,310
♫  ...until skyscrapers fall apart, until we grow old together  ♫

488
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:12,030
 I guess it's not because she likes me. 

489
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:21,310
♫   No more talk of leaving or staying, silence is the most comforting   ♫

490
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:26,390
♫  Why need alcohol when one can get oneself drunk?  ♫

491
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,580
♫  I only ask if the world can still remain  ♫

492
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,660
Not only did he leave without telling me,

493
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,910
but he also doesn't answer my letters now.

494
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,100
♫  I don't want to change the world, only your heart, immortality is forever  ♫

495
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,390
Xiao Lin was always good at leading his troops.

496
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,770
Young Devil Lord wouldn't have been ambushed by Xiao Lin, would he?

497
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,190
The front line ordered me to lead a troop and leave the capital immediately.

498
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,040
I'm here to tell you that I'll leave tomorrow morning.

499
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,793
Wait!

500
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,520
Why do you have to leave all of a sudden?

501
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,620
What happened on the front line?

502
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,520
Do you know you're really a jinx?

503
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,910
It's nothing serious.

504
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,010
Tantai Jin is injured. That's all.

505
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,063
Was it bad?

506
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:20,550
I don't know. He's not dead.

507
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,440
Why are you so worried?

508
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,690
Ye Qingyu is also injured but not seriously.

509
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,350
Tantai Jin and Qingyu both got hurt.

510
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:39,130
- Pianran, will you take me… 
 - No.

511
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,790
Tantai Jin had given strict orders before he left

512
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,390
that you must not leave the capital.

513
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,980
I'm just going to sneak a peek. I won't let him find out.

514
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,750
I'll come back right away as soon as I'm sure he's doing fine.

515
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,210
Not a chance.

516
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,080
I won't take responsibility for this.

517
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,850
Besides, if you just want to know how he is,

518
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,710
whether he's dead or alive, I'll take a look for you.

519
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,770
Didn't you say you didn't like him before?

520
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,820
Why are you so nervous now?

521
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,830
   

522
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,610
   

523
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,450
 This wild girl really can't be stopped. 

524
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,100
 I have no choice but to teach you a lesson. 

525
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,360
Listen, you all.

526
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,040
March a hundred miles before sunset today.

527
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,640
 A hundred miles? 

528
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,020
 I'm so done for. 

529
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,520
 Li Susu, you're really asking for it. 
   

530
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,543
Your Highness.

531
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,190
I don't want to leave.

532
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,923
Bingchang.

533
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,930
You'll stay with Mother in the palace for just a couple of days.

534
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,263
I know.

535
00:47:02,263 --> 00:47:05,460
You're worried that the people of Sheng won't accept you.

536
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,160
However, Father also sent his personal guards to escort you,

537
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,610
so there won't be anything wrong.

538
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,010
Besides, it's much safer to go back to the capital than to stay at the battlefront.

539
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,370
♫  ...like snow foam floating on the cup and then sinking below  ♫

540
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,860
Jiahui.

541
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,220
♫  My heart is touched by an astonishing moment  ♫

542
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,020
Help the consort get into the sedan.

543
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,653
Yes.

544
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:35,320
♫  My wrist seems tied to a bright and sharp sword  ♫

545
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,090
♫  Meticulously planning my life with one person for a lifetime  ♫

546
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,480
♫  The more carefully it's guarded  ♫

547
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,830
♫  The more we are not meant to be  ♫

548
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,030
♫  Although the sceneries are beautiful, I am at fault for it all  ♫

549
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,680
♫  I am clearly a player in the game  ♫

550
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,723
Your Highness.

551
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:00,170
In the future, I'll not be by your side.

552
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,310
Please take care.

553
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,360
I'll wait for you to come back.

554
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,310
♫  The more teardrops will fall when looking back  ♫

555
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,150
♫  Peach blossoms float past your brow ridge. I don't actually know who is the foil  ♫

556
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,480
Depart!

557
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,160
♫  Beyond the deepest depths of our hearts  ♫

558
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,730
♫  There is already an empty pillow before we have grown old  ♫

559
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,460
 It's only a matter of time before we lose. 

560
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,760
 If the capital is breached,  

561
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,090
 what will happen to Bingchang? 

562
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,590
 And what will happen to Father? 

563
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,370
Since Side Concubine of Prince Xuancheng came into the palace,

564
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,240
she has been following the queen day after day to pray to Buddha

565
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,820
and copying sutras in small script.

566
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,910
She also eats vegetarian food with her.

567
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,350
There isn't any meat in her meal. What a poor woman.

568
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,940
Why should a servant take pity on his master?

569
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,310
The entire Ye family betrayed our country so shamelessly.

570
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,810
It's merciful to keep her alive.

571
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,343
She's here.

572
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,350
Are you all right, My Lady?

573
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,153
I'm fine.

574
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,710
After we get back, I'll use hot towels to warm your knees.

575
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,290
There's no need for that.

576
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,480
Our place is still leaking.

577
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,470
I'll go ask them to fix it for us.

578
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,020
Don't bother. No matter how many times we ask, it won't work.

579
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,340
In the future, we'll repair the leaking roofs

580
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,890
and torn clothes by ourselves.

581
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,510
As I said before,

582
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,880
power is a sharp tool.

583
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,060
However, I'm just a weak woman.

584
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,330
I can only rely on powerful men.

585
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,020
I thought I could depend on Xiao Lin my whole life,

586
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,230
but now he won't even answer my letters.

587
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:55,200
Thank you for watching out for me in the palace these days.

588
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,890
I don't understand.

589
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,600
You keep saying things like this lately, My Lady.

590
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,140
I'm a little scared.

591
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,190
It's okay.

592
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,980
I'm here with you.

593
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,333
Let's go.

594
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,473
Be careful.

595
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,383
Your Majesty.

596
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,060
No letter today, either.

597
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,940
It has been half a month.

598
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,420
Have you asked the crow why?

599
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,160
You can also speak with birds and animals.

600
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
Why don't you ask him yourself, Your Majesty?

601
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,020
This is your family business after all.

602
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,540
Nian Baiyu, you brat. I'll beat you to death.

603
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,500
I don't care if she writes to me or not.

604
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,043
Your Majesty.

605
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,570
All of you must be exhausted today. Get some rest.

606
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,233
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

607
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,310
I didn't expect you to keep up with us.

608
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,600
You evil fox.

609
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,530
You knew I was here all along,

610
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,590
and you watched me suffer every day.

611
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,610
I haven't written to him for many days.

612
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,080
I wonder if he has forgotten about me.

613
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,680
 Luckily, that spike didn't shrink back. 

614
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,600
Rest assured. You're playing hard to get now.

615
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,310
As you know, if you cling to men all day, they won't take you seriously.

616
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,770
Being cold toward them occasionally can be very effective.

617
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,210
Trust me.

618
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,740
His Majesty lives there.

♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

638
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,230
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

639
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,550
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

640
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,670
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

641
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,290
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

642
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:48,330
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

643
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:56,130
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

644
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:04,970
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
