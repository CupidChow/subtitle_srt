♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,160
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,820
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:51,040
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:59,560
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:07,059
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

♫   There are times when I'm fragile, to heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,040
 Devil Lord is the incarnation of all sins, 

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,190
 who brings disasters and deaths. 

18
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,960
 Safe journey, Devil Lord! 

19
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,780
   

20
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,140
My Lord, we have arrived.

21
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,260
My Lord.

22
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,940
My Lord, the Xiaoyao Sect is right over there.

23
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,530
What a strong immortal nimbus!

24
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,360
That's where the Mirror of the Past is kept?

25
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,430
It is, My Lord.

26
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,160
    
 It's kept in Mount Buzhao of Xiaoyao Sect.

27
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,360
When the sun and moon stop shining, the world will plunge into darkness and destruction. 
  ("Buzhao" means to stop shining) 

28
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,300
It seems like today the saying will be fulfilled.

29
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,090
Xiaoyao Sect's barrier was easily smashed by you, My Lord.

30
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,020
Let's go.

31
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,990
Let's see the divine artifact that can allegedly end my life.

32
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,560
   

33
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,940
   

34
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,820
   

35
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,360
Susu, you've guarded here the whole day.

36
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,530
Go back to your room for some rest.

37
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,270
Senior Brother Gongye.

38
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,749
Are my father and the seniors back?

39
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:59,689
The sect leader, with some seniors, has gone to the Mo River to save people.

40
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,330
I'm afraid they won't be returning any time soon.

41
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,090
   

42
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,009
All immortal sects have been destroyed, except Xiaoyao Sect and Hengyang Sect. 
    

43
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,530
How much longer can we fight?

44
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,420
How many more people can we save?

45
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,700
If only we could kill the demon god.

46
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,399
Ten thousand years ago, all gods died sacrificing themselves to finally kill the ancient demon god.

47
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,650
Now, a new demon god appeared abruptly.

48
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,650
We don't even know his name or origin.

49
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,810
How can we kill him?

50
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,850
Isn't there some way to stop the demon god?

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,760
No gods still exist now.

52
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,560
With our mortal bodies, we can't even harm a hair on his head.

53
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,640
No.

54
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,650
There must be some other ways to kill him.

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,860
Although no gods exist now,

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,860
there may be some hope if we find the divine artifact that restricts the demon god.

57
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,090
But we don't know where it is or what it is.

58
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,680
How could we kill the demon god?

59
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,730
   
   

60
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,189
Xiaoyao Sect's light went out.

61
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,160
It was invaded.

62
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,679
 The leader of the Xiaoyao Sect is quite weak. 

63
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
 We caught him effortlessly 

64
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,940
My Lord, we found the Mirror of the Past.

65
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,020
But we can't activate it with our devil energy.

66
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,190
It requires their immortal energy.

67
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,913
The scenery in Xiaoyao Sect is splendid.

68
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,850
It'd be a great pity to destroy it.

69
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,090
Immortal Zhaoyou, why don't you activate it for me?

70
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,629
Then I won't have to destroy your sect.

71
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,380
What do you say?

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,900
Kill me as you wish.

73
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,410
You don't have to tease me.

74
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,140
It makes you even worse than dogs and pigs!

75
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,540
You're right.

76
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,629
Dogs feel happy when seeing their masters.

77
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,929
When pigs have something to eat, they'll be too contented to worry about anything.

78
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,189
I'm not happy or contented, though.

79
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,159
Indeed, I'm worse than them.

80
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,520
You!

81
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,290
 Demon, here I am, Qu Xuanzi of Hengyang Sect. 

82
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,820
 I won't tolerate you humiliating the immortal sects. 

83
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,750
I didn't expect that the immortal sects were this foolish.

84
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,370
Sect Leader Qu, I'm in a good mood today.

85
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,130
If you activate the Mirror of the Past for me, I'll let the both of you go.

86
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,560
What do you say?

87
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,680
You wish!

88
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,850
Get him.

89
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,770
If you want to save him, you have to agree to my proposal.

90
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,630
Old Qu, you brute.

91
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,719
Why did you risk your life to come here instead of defending your own sect?

92
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,140
Run! Don't risk your life in vain.

93
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,020
I came to see how you made a fool of yourself.

94
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,749
Old Qu, what are you doing?

95
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,309
 Shut up. How else can I lure him here? 

96
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,640
Sect Leader Qu, you don't play by the rules.

97
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,070
Is this what righteous men from prominent sects do?

98
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,260
I don't need to play by the rules to fight demons like you!

99
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,850
 Si Ying, Jing Mie, since he wants some fun, 

100
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,770
 you two can satisfy his wish and play along. 

101
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,250
How funny.

102
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,439
You think you can break His Lordship's Bone-Deteriorating Chain?

103
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,459
You tried, already. Save your breath! Leave now!

104
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,209
The demon god is in there. Neither of us can leave if you waste time!

105
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,949
Stop gibbering! We live and die together.

106
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,530
How stubborn!

107
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,840
Just stop!

108
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,720
You're overreaching yourself.

109
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,270
Leave now!

110
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,149
I won't. Shatter!

111
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,100
Xiaoyao Technique!

112
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,620
Shatter!

113
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,440
 That was interesting. 

114
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Are you all right?

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,040
- The Mirror of the Past. 
 - You recognized it, too?

116
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,930
 They evened the fight with Si Ying and Jing Mie. 

117
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,569
 That was interesting. 

118
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,550
 Let me join in on the fun, too. 

119
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,800
It's… Bone-Refining Seal.

120
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,000
 His Lordship? 

121
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,900
My Lord.

122
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,260
 All right. 

123
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,570
 Since you want to play, 

124
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,370
 let's play it to the fullest. 

125
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,530
Guess who I will shoot first.

126
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,370
 No one can survive a shot from His Lordship's Soul-Slaying Crossbow. 

127
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,810
Old Qu, your forehead…

128
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,730
Maybe it'll be fun to shoot both at one time.

129
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,170
Run, Susu! Don't bother to save us!

130
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,220
You can't defeat them!

131
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,950
 Don't continue fighting, hurry and disperse. 

132
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,879
 You want to run? Not that easily! 

133
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,930
Well done, Zhaoyou.

134
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,500
My good daughter, catch it.

135
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,529
Take the Mirror of the Past and leave!

136
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,020
They came for it!

137
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,650
How dare you fool me!

138
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,860
Mirror of the Past?

139
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,830
Interesting.

140
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,800
Let's go separately!

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,620
Try your best to live, and let's meet at Hengyang Sect.

142
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,240
 Go! 

143
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,510
Dragon Chariot.

144
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,149
 Chongyu Harp is also a divine artifact. 

145
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,739
 It can indeed hurt the demon god 

146
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:20,739
 The Mirror is a divine artifact of the Xiaoyao Sect. 

147
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,519
 The demon god wants it so desperately. 

148
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,090
 Can it be…? 

149
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,830
 It's you. 

150
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,740
Sky-Slashing Sword, a demonic weapon.

151
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,810
Over the past 500 years, you were the first one who hurt me.

152
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,650
You deserve to die at the hands of my Sky-Slashing Sword.

153
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,670
Immortal Lady, please return the Mirror back to me.

154
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,240
The Mirror belongs to Xiaoyao Sect.

155
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,290
If you want it, you'll have to kill me first.

156
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,710
Today, I'm going to massacre all immortal sects

157
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,699
so that no immortals will exist throughout Four Continents and Three Realms.

158
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,760
Immortal Girl, I thought you had some power.

159
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,900
But you turn out to be so weak.

160
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,970
 Mirror of the Past… 

161
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,320
 Father, I… I won't be able to return. 

162
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,480
What's that between your eyebrows?

163
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,650
 Mirror of the Past… 

164
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,980
 Where am I? 

165
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,690
 Surprisingly, my blood activated the Mirror of the Past. 

166
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,630
 Li Susu. 

167
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,220
 Who are you? 

168
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,800
 How do you know my name? 

169
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,880
 It doesn't matter who I am. 

170
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,040
 But who you are means a lot to this world. 

171
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
 Me? 

172
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,910
 Yes. 

173
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,039
 The demon god wants the Mirror of the Past because the Chosen One can use it 

174
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,620
 to reverse destiny. 

175
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,100
 And you are the Chosen One. 

176
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,820
 Reverse destiny? 

177
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,189
 Yes. The demon god wasn't born to evil. 

178
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,729
 His past is his only weakness. 

179
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:20,540
 What should I do? 

180
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,010
 Watch carefully and remember him. 

181
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,720
 Bark like a dog. 

182
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,550
 - Say something. 
 - Tantai Jin. 

183
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,380
 Are you mute? 

184
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,200
 We're talking to you. 

185
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,100
 Say something! 

186
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,649
 - What a coward!  He doesn't even fight back. 
 - Indeed. 

187
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,960
 He's the demon god. 
 - Even dogs are fiercer than you. 

188
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,039
 All you can do is get beaten up. 

189
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,860
 Yeah. 

190
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,160
-  This is the Devil God's past life. 
 - Punch him! Punch him! Beat him! 

191
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,899
 500 years ago, he was a mortal fetus in the Palace of the Sheng Kingdom. 
 - Beat him! Beat him! 

192
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:07,409
 But born as the demon fetus, he was already accumulating strength for the demon god's revival. 

193
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,060
 Li Susu, time is running out. 

194
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,590
 The demon god has already appeared. 

195
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,839
 But if he fails to become a demon back then, today's destruction wouldn't happen. 

196
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,450
 Remember the person you have to find. 

197
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,200
 Go back to Hengyang Sect and activate the Light Breaking Array. 

198
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,900
 It's the only way to turn the tide. 

199
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,200
 Now, the demon god is unbeatable. 

200
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,940
 I have to go back to the time before he turned evil. 

201
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,910
 It's our only opportunity. 

202
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,550
I won't let you hurt her.

203
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,210
Don't kill him!

204
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,500
Senior Brother Gongye!

205
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,010
Susu, don't worry about me.

206
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,379
Take the Mirror and go back to Hengyang Sect.

207
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,730
No, I'm not leaving!

208
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,729
I won't let you catch her.

209
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:43,900
Devil Lord, are you scared of death?

210
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,300
No!

211
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,340
Susu.

212
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Susu.

213
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,499
Why are you back alone? Where's Jiwu?

214
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,440
Father, check this.

215
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,650
 Even dogs are fiercer than you. 

216
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,799
 All you can do is get beaten up. 

217
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
 Yeah. 

218
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,930
 -  Punch him!   
  -  Punch him! Beat him!  

219
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,160
 -  Punch him!   
   - Beat him!  

220
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,900
 Beat him! Beat him! 

221
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,929
The Mirror is broken. That is all we can watch.

222
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,640
At least, we know that the demon god wasn't born to evil.

223
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,620
When he was a teenager, he was merely a weak mortal.

224
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,210
If we return to the past with the Array and kill Tantai Jin before he turns evil,

225
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,270
the demon god won't come into being.

226
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,280
Father, let me do it.

227
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,200
You?

228
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,140
Okay.

229
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,199
It's Susu who took back the Mirror and showed us the past.

230
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,819
It's her destiny.

231
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,110
Susu, remember.

232
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,750
Born as a demon fetus, Tantai Jin has evil bones.

233
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,510
If his body dies, his evil bones will wake up.

234
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,299
Then immediately, he'll become a demon.

235
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:37,450
So, you must find a way to destroy his evil bones first to kill him completely.

236
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,790
 I'm here to get the Mirror of the Past. 

237
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,440
 Members of Hengyang Sect, come out and welcome me. 

238
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,440
    
 The demon god has arrived.  Get into formation.

239
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,549
Zhaoyou, activate the Light Breaking Array and send Susu back to the past!

240
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,379
 Ten thousand years ago, God of Cosmos left behind the Light-breaking Array,  

241
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:13,649
 which was inherited by leaders of my sect through generations. 

242
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,440
    
 It can only be activated at a destined time.

243
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,819
Old Qu, the time is now. What are you waiting for?

244
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,450
Wait. Uncle Zhao You, what are you talking about?

245
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,040
Father!

246
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,060
Gods left a prophecy when they died.

247
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,970
On the destruction day of immortal sects,

248
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,979
someone would enter the Light Breaking Array and change the past and future.

249
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,350
The destruction day?

250
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,720
Uncle Zhao You, stop!

251
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,490
Father!

252
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,210
Father!

253
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,780
 Susu, since we have a chance to stop the demon god from appearing, 

254
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,930
 there may be some hope for the world. 

255
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,400
 It's your destiny to enter the Light Breaking Array and live. 

256
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,380
 Defending our sects until we die is the destiny of your uncle Zhao You and me.  

257
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,140
 Farewell, Susu. Take care of yourself when you're there. 

258
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,410
- Disciples, listen to my command! 
  - Aye! 

259
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,489
This is a life-and-death fight for our world.

260
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:21,780
Now, we shall defend Mingwu Hall until we die!

261
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,409
The barrier won't be broken until the last one of us dies!

262
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,000
Cast the formation!

263
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,280
You're really stubborn.

264
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,860
Father!

265
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,250
Susu, we have no time.

266
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,980
You must return to the past right away.

267
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,340
That will be the only chance.

268
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,539
I'll send you back to the Sheng Kingdom of 500 years ago.

269
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:13,000
Remember. Whatever you see, don't come back!

270
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,189
The Four Continents and Three Realms count on you! Understand?

271
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,350
My turn.

272
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,040
Soul-Slaying Crossbow

273
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,250
No.

274
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,580
No.

275
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,750
No!

276
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,500
Father!

277
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,070
Tantai Jin,

278
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,690
I swear I'll kill you.

279
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Why is the sky blue?

280
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,110
Miss.

281
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,929
Why are you talking so weirdly? Miss.

282
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:07,970
Did you hit your head, Miss?

283
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,149
Miss, wake up.

284
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,410
 Remember the person you have to find. 

285
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,890
 Try to stop the demon god from appearing and there will be a new ending. 

286
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,490
Miss.

287
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,480
 Father, Uncle Zhao You, I returned to the past. 

288
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,580
 Wait for me. 

289
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,280
 Susu, I trust you. 

290
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
 You'll definitely succeed. 

291
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,280
- Wait for me. 
 - Miss.

292
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,629
Miss, wake up!

293
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:38,800
Please.

294
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,630
Umm…

295
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,780
Excuse me. Could you help me up?

296
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,760
I feel a little bit dizzy.

297
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,240
 First, I have to figure out what happened. 

298
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,660
Well, what's your name?

299
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,679
Miss, I'm Chuntao!

300
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,109
- Chuntao? 
 - You really hit your head.

301
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:09,850
If His Lordship knows, he'll kill me.

302
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,240
 Sounds like I'm from a rich family. 

303
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,099
Chuntao, you're right.

304
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:25,510
I had a heavy fall, and I can't remember anything now.

305
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,910
- Could you do me a favor? 
 - Miss,

306
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,350
if you want me to do anything, just ask me to.

307
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,000
You sound scary when you talk like that.

308
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,580
You even smiled at me.

309
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,690
Chuntao, tell me.

310
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,279
What's my name, and who are my parents?

311
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,209
Your full name is Ye Xiwu.

312
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:48,240
You're the second lineal daughter of General Ye.

313
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,510
Oh, I remember now.

314
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,730
But what were we doing here in the wilderness?

315
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,880
Oh, I can't remember. My head hurts.

316
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,319
Miss Xiwu, we went to Cishou Temple to offer incense earlier today.

317
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,549
After that, you insisted on seeing the scenery of the back mountains.

318
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:18,419
We ran into some bandits on our way who threatened to rob you of your money and violate you.

319
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,330
- Did they succeed? 
 - No.

320
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,349
We scrambled all the way here.

321
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:27,650
But you rolled down from that slope and passed out.

322
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,800
So, we were running away from bandits?

323
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,789
Did we get rid of them?

324
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,760
 Look. There she is! 

325
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,250
 Let's go. 

326
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,829
 Oh, no. A mortal can't fly. 

327
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:46,760
Miss, what are you doing?

328
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,910
Nothing. My feet were numb. I had to stamp them.

329
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,190
Run!

330
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,200
 Girls, stop running! 

331
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,400
 You can't get away. 

332
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,010
 Second Young Miss, stop running! 

333
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,790
 You can't get away, Second Young Miss! 

334
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,809
- Go hide somewhere. 
 - All right.

335
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,690
Forget it. Why not hide behind me?

336
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,410
All right.

337
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,589
Miss, thank you for protecting me.

338
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,200
If only you always had a problem with your head!

339
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,730
I will try my best.

340
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,829
- Second Young Miss, stop running! 
 - Second Young Miss!

341
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,490
Stop there!

342
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,109
Tell me who sent you to hurt me, and I will let you go.

343
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,690
Miss, why did you ask that?

344
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,730
Just now, he called me Second Young Miss Ye.

345
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,159
Clearly, they know I am General Ye's lineal daughter.

346
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,589
If real bandits wanted to rob me, they would have to hesitate.

347
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:56,589
Miss, you've become clever since you hit your head.

348
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,720
So, you would still fight, huh?

349
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,300
Brothers, catch her!

350
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,900
Go!

351
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,999
 Ye Xiwu, did you learn no martial arts at all? 

352
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,400
 Do you never exercise? 

353
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,919
 Come on, Li Susu. 

354
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,580
 The Four Continents and Three Realms are waiting for you. 

355
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,150
 Will I die before my mission starts? 

356
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,140
 The Chongyu Harp is tied with my lifeline 

357
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,430
 I can summon it. I have to summon it! 

358
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,110
Chongyu Harp!

359
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,540
Chong… Chong what?

360
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,590
Miss, you dropped your pendant.

361
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,940
 Darn it. 

362
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,499
 Now, I only have a mortal's body without any martial arts. 

363
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,780
 I can't even summon my weapon. 

364
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,970
 I have to fight on my own. 

365
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,440
Miss! Miss!

366
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,160
 Run. Come on. 

367
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,400
Eldest Senior Brother.

368
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,000
Eldest Senior Brother.

369
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,860
Second Young Miss, behave yourself.

370
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,030
Eldest Senior Brother.

371
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,610
Gongye Jiwu.

372
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,730
What did you call me?

373
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,330
Your Highness!

374
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,570
Your Highness, are you all right?

375
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,010
Second Young Miss Ye? Not you again.

376
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,360
 He isn't Eldest Senior Brother. 

377
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,289
Sixth Prince, my lady hit her head just now, and she's a little bit confused now.

378
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,360
Please forgive her.

379
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,550
Second Young Miss, stop pretending.

380
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,709
In my life, I, Xiao Lin, love no one but Ye Bingchang.

381
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,380
I won't have feelings for you.

382
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,049
I just saved you for moral reasons.

383
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:26,850
I hope you'll behave yourself.

384
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,090
Farewell.

385
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,160
 This world is not the same as the one from 500 years after now. 

386
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,910
His name is Xiao Lin?

387
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,150
That's right.

388
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,830
It's all right that you don't remember your parents.

389
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,530
But why do you not remember Sixth Prince?

390
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,609
Then tell me about him. Who is he?

391
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,229
Sixth Prince is the only lineal son of His Majesty.

392
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,269
He's the most popular with our people, known as Prince Camellia.

393
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:05,739
What did he mean when he said he loved someone and didn't have feelings for me?

394
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,810
Now that you have forgotten it, please don't ask.

395
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,150
Forget it forever.

396
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,900
It doesn't matter. Just tell me.

397
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,930
Previously, you adored Sixth Prince but couldn't be with him.

398
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,070
And soon, he'll marry your elder sister.

399
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,900
I adored him?

400
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,530
Everyone in the capital city of the Sheng Kingdom knows about that.

401
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,430
He just mentioned Ye Bingchang.

402
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,410
So, she's my elder sister?

403
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,949
The other day, Sixth Prince came to our mansion to visit Miss Bingchang.

404
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:44,380
You felt so upset that you pushed her into the lake.

405
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,089
Sixth Prince is still angry about it.

406
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,570
Don't blame him for being rude.

407
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,610
 Pushed her into the lake? 

408
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,060
 Ye Xiwu, weren't you too wicked? 

409
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,350
Is my sister all right?

410
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,549
I heard she caught a cold, and it wasn't very serious.

411
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,690
But, Miss, you are really weird today.

412
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,130
You threw a tantrum saying you wanted to come here and pray for Eldest Young Miss.

413
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,900
 Second Young Miss! 

414
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,910
Stop!

415
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,990
Second Young Miss, how was it?

416
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,959
How was what? Stay away!

417
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,250
How was our performance?

418
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,959
We didn't frighten you, did we?

419
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,610
You asked us to be as fierce as we could.

420
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,229
Second Young Miss, you can't go back on your word.

421
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,399
You promised us.

422
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,259
If we got Sixth Prince here to save you, you would give us another ten taels of silver.

423
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:44,050
You saw him, talked to him, and cuddled into his arms.

424
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,510
Isn't it time to pay us?

425
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,740
Miss,

426
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,890
I won't tell anyone about it.

427
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,520
 Impressive, Ye Xiwu. 

428
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,130
 I can't even imagine how wicked you are. 

429
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,229
Miss, remember.

430
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,709
Your father is Sheng Kingdom'sPillar of the State Great General.

431
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,390
Your dead mother was Commandery Princess Rong'en.

432
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,229
Your grandmother is Grand Princess Royal.

433
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,699
All your family members are high-ranking nobles of the Sheng Kingdom.

434
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,629
Got it. I can nearly recite it.

435
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,110
When I get back home, you must help me.

436
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,930
    
 Don't let my father know I hit my head.

437
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,869
Don't worry, Miss Xiwu. Count on me.

438
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,319
 What an impressive mansion! 

439
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,900
 Family background is indeed important. 

440
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,110
 I wonder where the demon god is. 

441
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,720
Chuntao,

442
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,089
there's someone I want to ask you about.

443
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:40,410
Maybe you haven't heard of him.

444
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,110
He probably lives in the palace.

445
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,440
Try me.

446
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,449
His name is Tantai Jin.

447
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,440
Have you heard of him?

448
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,450
Do you know him?

449
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,280
He's Mr. Tantai, your husband.

450
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,630
Miss.

451
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,189
This is the garden.

452
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,549
Mr. Tantai is still there, I suppose.

453
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,820
Almost there.

454
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,069
 I didn't expect to find the demon god so soon. 

455
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,610
 I wonder how powerful he is since he's from 500 years before. 

456
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,959
 I only have a mortal's body and can't use Chongyu Harp. 

457
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,919
 Can I kill him? 

458
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,100
Miss, why do you look so pale?

459
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,359
Chuntao, you mentioned Tantai Jin had lived with my family for six months.

460
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,410
Do you know his Achilles' heel?

461
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,330
Achilles' heel?

462
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,180
It means something he's scared of.

463
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,480
Miss, how could you forget this?

464
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,720
In this family, you're the one he's most scared of.

465
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,219
 The demon god wasn't born to evil. 

466
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,659
 When he was a teenager, he was merely a weak mortal. 

467
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:06,399
 Looks like the God in the Mirror of the Past was right. 

468
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:11,169
 Now, Tantai Jin is a mere mortal. 

469
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:16,909
 At this moment, I might as well meet the demon god who hasn't grown stronger yet. 

470
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,590
 The Light Breaking Array sent me to the right place at the right time. 

471
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,280
 I found him so easily. 

472
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,570
 It seems even Heaven is helping me. 

473
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,960
 So this person is Tantai Jin, the demon fetus? 

474
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,470
 He looks so weak. 

475
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,070
 Will he really become the demon god? 

476
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:08,509
 If his name weren't Tantai Jin, I wouldn't believe that he would become the demon god even if I were beaten to death. 

477
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,030
You…

478
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,200
I…

479
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,820
Second Young Miss, what do you want to say?

480
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,540
 If I killed him,  

481
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:59,009
 I could stop the demon god's advent, and the Four Continents and Three Realms would not be destroyed. 

482
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,380
 But before I came here, Father said something. 

483
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,499
 Susu, born as a demon fetus, Tantai Jin has evil bones. 

484
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,399
 If his body dies, his evil bones will wake up. 

485
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,229
 Then immediately, he'll become a demon. 

486
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,789
 So, you must find a way to destroy his evil bone first to kill him completely. 

487
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,830
 Be patient, Li Susu. 

488
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,460
 Before his evil bone is destroyed, he must stay alive. 

489
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,810
 But where is his evil bone? 

490
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,400
 And how can I destroy it? 

491
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,110
 The more I look at him, the stranger I find it. 

492
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:48,100
 Did something go wrong? 

493
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,000
 Everything went so smoothly. 

494
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,410
 Even dogs in Hengyang Sect are fiercer than him. 

495
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,960
 Does he just look like the demon god, just as Xiao Lin looks like Eldest Senior Brother? 

496
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,899
 No. I can't kill an innocent man. 

497
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,000
 I have to confirm this. 

498
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,219
Miss, it's so cold.

499
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:14,510
Let's go inside.

500
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,030
Tantai Jin, show me your hand.

501
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,300
Mr. Tantai.

502
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,280
A bit closer.

503
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,830
Tantai Jin, try strangling me.

504
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,850
Don't shrink away.

505
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,900
Give me a fierce look.

506
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,590
Have a try.

507
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,940
Second Young Miss, punish me as you wish.

508
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,340
You don't have to tease me.

509
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,320
Tantai Jin, think of it in your heart

510
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,740
that you want to kill someone.

511
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,240
That you want to kill me.

512
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:36,179
 Today, I'm going to massacre all immortal sects so that no immortals will exist. 

513
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,510
 It's him! 

514
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,750
Miss. Miss...

515
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,410
Miss, what's the matter?

516
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,160
Did Mr. Tantai strangle you too hard?

517
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,680
You've been shivering.

518
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,000
Shall I walk you back to your room?

519
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,389
All right. Chuntao, let's stay away from him.

520
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,680
Why is Tantai Jin kneeling on the ice?

521
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,389
Don't you remember?

522
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:38,700
You punished him by letting him kneel for three days.

523
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,690
And he just listened?

524
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,940
What'd you expect?

525
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,359
 Ye Xiwu, good for you. 

526
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,420
 You've managed to overpower the demon god. 

527
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,840
What did I punish him for?

528
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,110
Oh, I can't remember that.

529
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:58,459
It was because of the event where you pushed Miss Bingchang into the lake.

530
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,589
How was Tantai Jin involved?

531
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,130
You slipped and fell into the lake, too.

532
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:07,499
Sixth Prince jumped into the water immediately and swam to save Eldest Young Miss.

533
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:11,060
Seeing that, Mr. Tantai jumped into the water, too.

534
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,660
To save me?

535
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,839
To save… Eldest Young Miss.

536
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,539
They got Miss Bingchang out of the water, but you struggled your own way out of it.

537
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:19,669
You were furious about that.

538
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,069
Then you punish Mr. Tantai by letting him kneel out there.

539
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,549
That night, it snowed heavily.

540
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,399
The lake was covered with a sheet of ice.

541
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,659
You were happy to see that and asked Mr. Tantai to kneel on the ice.

542
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:36,080
You said, "Tantai Jin, don't you love to show off in the lake? Then kneel there for a couple of days!"

543
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,860
This is ridiculous.

544
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,420
I mean, Tantai Jin didn't take my side and helped someone else.

545
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,780
This is ridiculous.

546
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,399
Miss Xiwu, don't be angry, or it will be bad for your health.

547
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:57,210
- Although Mr. Tantai likes Eldest Young Miss... 
 - What?

548
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,189
Are you saying Tantai Jin likes Ye Bingchang?

549
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,069
But he can only think about her!

550
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,509
Miss, you are vicious.

551
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,480
Mr. Tantai does not have the guts.

552
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,080
He has to stay with you and can only long for her.

553
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,280
So, I like Sixth Prince, while he likes my elder sister.

554
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,319
And Tantai Jin likes her, too.

555
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,020
Exactly.

556
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,709
 Ye Xiwu, you and your husband are impressive. 

557
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:32,099
 Since you both like someone else, how do you live together? 

558
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,710
Since I adore Sixth Prince, why did I marry Tantai Jin?

559
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,879
I don't know.

560
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,149
But back at that time, Mr. Tantai was called Prince Tantai.

561
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,439
How could I humiliate a prince this way?

562
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,959
While they are both princes, they have different destinies.

563
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,819
I heard when Mr. Tantai was a prince in Jing Kingdom, and nobody liked him.

564
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:58,789
When he was very little, he was sent to our kingdom as a hostage.

565
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,199
So, Tantai Jin is a hostage from the Jing Kingdom.

566
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,320
Then, why does nobody like him?

567
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,839
Mr. Tantai has a strange personality so it's inevitable people would dislike him.

568
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,589
However, some dislike him unexpectedly.

569
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,630
His royal father, for example.

570
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,910
It seems he has never cared about his son's life.

571
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,340
Relying on well-provisioned and well-trained troops, Jing Kingdom rose in arms in autumn,

572
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,830
saying they'd fight across the Mo River and spend the Spring Festival in our capital.

573
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,289
Thanks to our Master, General Ye.

574
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:31,049
He not only repulsed Jing Kingdom's troops but also drove them back to their kingdom!

575
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,110
It was very impressive!

576
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:40,739
As far as I see, Mr. Tantai happened to marry you at that time, so he survived.

577
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:44,860
Otherwise, His Majesty would have killed him first.

578
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,680
