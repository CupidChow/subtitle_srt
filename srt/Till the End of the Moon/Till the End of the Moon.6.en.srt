00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
♫ <i>Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood</i> ♫

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,339
♫ <i>Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light</i> ♫

4
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:39,079
♫ <i>Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:47,260
♫ <i>Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck</i> ♫

6
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,180
♫ <i>Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me</i> ♫

7
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:03,079
♫ <i>I do not fear how people treat me in this world</i> ♫

8
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,219
♫ <i>Breaking through, struggling to escape </i> ♫

9
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:11,539
♫ <i>How to differentiate between good and bad </i> ♫

10
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:19,079
♫ <i> There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love</i> ♫

<i>[Episode 6]</i>

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,840
Teach me.

16
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,039
What should I teach you…

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,419
The one you used to repel the crows at Xiao Lin's mansion that day.

18
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:53,180
Not that one. That spell is too dangerous.

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,549
You're just an amateur, and if you mess the charm up, you might blow up the house.

20
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,479
<i>It's always wise to play it safe.</i>

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,399
<i>Because you are Tantai Jin, I will never teach you spells that can kill.</i>

22
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,460
Then, what are you going to teach me?

23
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,200
I got one. Watch this.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,460
I'll teach you this today.

25
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,519
Okay. That's it.

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,740
A charm is finished.

27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,410
But you need the right incantation to make it work.

28
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,560
Is it nice?

29
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,740
What's this charm for?

30
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,500
This charm is called "Sketch".

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,749
When I was little, I was always clamoring to go out to play.

32
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,420
My father…

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,100
An immortal taught me this spell

34
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,159
so that my mind could wander around the world even when I was stuck in a small room.

35
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,809
Also, every time I scribe the charm, I get to see different sceneries.

36
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,559
These cultivators are extremely boring.

37
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,749
Instead of improving their cultivation, they choose to waste their time on such useless things.

38
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,940
That's not true.

39
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,959
The immortals say that the body, heart, and mind are three different parts.

40
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,140
When the three parts are unified, the golden elixir is formed.

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,060
Empty thy heart to unite soul and character,

42
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,949
Calm thy body to silence energy and emotions,

43
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,140
Steady thy mind then all three merge into one.

44
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,480
Unite the body, heart, and mind, and the golden elixir will be cultivated.

45
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,360
But how to unify them?

46
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,660
Turn your energy into Qi and your body won't move.

47
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,260
Turn Qi into a soul, and your heart won't move.

48
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,850
Make your soul empty, and your mind won't move.

49
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:45,000
Destroy your desire for romantic love, and then you can understand the universe and all lives.

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,160
This is the one and only way of Heartless Way.

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,219
♫ <i>Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret</i> ♫

52
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,419
♫ <i>I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish</i> ♫

53
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,780
♫ <i>A bond of marriage entwined for thousands of years</i> ♫

54
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,259
♫ <i>To smooth the frivolous face</i> ♫

55
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:14,680
♫ <i>I was already tired of bidding farewell</i> ♫

56
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,660
♫ <i>I would send ashes and brightness to the moon</i> ♫

57
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,520
But I've gotten carried away.

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,839
All roads lead to the right way, and Heartless Way is just one of them.

59
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,780
♫ <i>My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons</i> ♫

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay, I will learn it.

61
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,820
♫ <i>A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears</i> ♫

62
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,140
♫ <i>I only wish to exchange this life with eternity</i> ♫

63
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,949
<i>It is a pity. I've looked into it.</i>

64
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,260
<i>The Young Devil Lord doesn't have an immortal bone.</i>

65
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,200
<i>No matter how hard he works, there's no way he can achieve immortality in this life.</i>

66
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,049
<i>But as long as he doesn't turn to the dark side, staying a mortal might not be a bad thing for him.</i>

67
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:59,979
♫ <i>Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed</i> ♫

68
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,379
♫ <i>But this time, who will be the one</i> ♫

69
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,100
♫ <i>Waiting for a long while?</i> ♫

70
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,260
Ye Xiwu, did I draw this charm correctly?

71
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,110
But why is it not working?

72
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,179
Well, you can't guarantee to succeed every time you scribe a charm.

73
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:44,089
This is your first time. Getting the pattern right is impressive enough.

74
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,759
Also, the Sketch charm will show you the purest and most beautiful things.

75
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,829
You must clear your mind of all thoughts when chanting the spell, especially no evil thoughts.

76
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,850
Only by doing that can you make it work.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,900
Take your time. Don't waste the materials.

78
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Remember, clear your mind.

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,869
As a teacher, you fell asleep right in front of your student.

80
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,930
You are really something.

81
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,350
Wake up!

82
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,039
Make sure I've learned it before you go to sleep. Wake up.

83
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,200
Why are you so unreasonable?

84
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,240
I haven't learned it yet.

85
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,530
This is not the Sketch charm.

86
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,650
I'm teaching you a new one.

87
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,380
Are you not happy?

88
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
Ye Xiwu, what are you doing?

89
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,550
Let go of me.

90
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,999
Once you started drawing, you haven't taken any breaks.

91
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,050
- What do you want to do?
- If you practice all night, you might die from exhaustion.

92
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,170
Come on.

93
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,710
Ye Xiwu!

94
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,850
- You…
- Be good. Let's resume the study tomorrow.

95
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,330
Ye Xiwu, let go of me.

96
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,200
Be quiet.

97
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,000
Ye Xiwu.

98
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,910
Ye Xiwu.

99
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,540
<i>Because I love you, all right?</i>

100
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,499
<i>When you love someone, you want to keep them alive and spend time with them.</i>

101
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:23,879
<i>You get anxious when they're not around, and feel happy when you see them.</i>

102
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,980
The universe manifests in an inch of land. The soul follows the mind.

103
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,720
Rise!

104
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,149
Tri-foot crow is the royal totem of the Jing Kingdom.

105
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,190
Were there any people from Jing at the wedding that day?

106
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,360
The hostage prince Tantai Jin was also there.

107
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,130
<i>It's said that the Yiyue tribe can communicate with birds and control them.</i>

108
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,620
<i>This matter…</i>

109
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,350
This child has been lurking for many years.

110
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,000
He is extremely scheming.

111
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,719
Keeping him alive will lead to disaster sooner or later.

112
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,960
Your Majesty, means...?

113
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,700
I want him dead.

114
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,490
Hide the traces well.

115
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,580
I got it.

116
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,019
Your Majesty, Ye Xiao's second son, Ye Qingyu, is coming back from the border today.

117
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,259
I remember he was smart from a young age, and very organized when doing anything.

118
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:01,750
He is a young talent no less gifted than Lin.

119
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,530
Yes.

120
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,690
I heard people lining the streets to welcome him.

121
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,079
The Pillar of the State Great General's hard work rendered great merits.

122
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,039
The army is full of his supporters. And this son of his excels him.

123
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,240
I think this son's reputation is even better than his father's.

124
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,060
What's going on?

125
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,500
They both came from the same dad,

126
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,749
but the firstborn is hopeless, while the second son is young and promising.

127
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,750
He outshines his father.

128
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,869
It doesn't matter!

129
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,240
Even your ten fingers are different lengths.

130
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,509
<i>[Ye Mansion]</i>

131
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,450
Who is missing me?

132
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,040
My Second Younger Brother will be back soon. Right?

133
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,290
Our house has been in turmoil since early in the morning.

134
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,250
None of us can get a moment of peace.

135
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,870
I-I can't stand any longer.

136
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,020
I'm exhausted.

137
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,250
I'm still injured.

138
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,260
Second Young Master is home.

139
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,980
Greetings, Second Young Master.

140
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,789
Grandma. Father. I'm back.

141
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,970
Thanks to God's blessing, you are home safe and sound.

142
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,399
It was unfilial of me to leave Grandma and Father for so long.

143
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,290
Please punish me, Father.

144
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,649
Why would I punish you? You were guarding the country.

145
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,389
Is there anything more honorable than that?

146
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,969
Although you couldn't stay home to keep us company,

147
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,869
our ancestors would be very proud of you, and the people of Sheng admire you.

148
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,790
As your father, I'm very proud of you.

149
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,009
Stand up now.

150
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,270
Up.

151
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,050
Come, let's start eating.

152
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,389
We waited so long for you to come home.

153
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,950
- Come on.
- Don't bring up "punishment" the moment you get back.

154
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,720
Why isn't my second eldest sister here?

155
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,340
You mean Xiwu?

156
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,720
She was busy with something in the attic last night.

157
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,949
Qingyu, your Second Elder Sister has been studying so hard these days, forgetting to eat and sleep.

158
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,710
She probably forgot the meal time again.

159
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,119
Let's just bring her some food later.

160
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,239
Yes.

161
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,810
That's not appropriate.

162
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,190
Grandma and Father are both waiting here.

163
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,620
How could a junior be absent?

164
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,869
Qingyu,

165
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,340
Xiwu... Xiwu is still a child.

166
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,550
She is in her 20s and a married woman.

167
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,700
Xiwu has married into another family anyway…

168
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,629
Married or not, everything she says and does represent our family tradition.

169
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,380
Well…

170
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,129
Though having been at the border these years, I have also heard of Xiwu's infamous behaviors.

171
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,769
She maltreated our servants, pushed the eldest sister into the water,

172
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,609
got drunk and lost her virginity in the imperial palace, and even got married muddleheadedly.

173
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,029
That's right, Qingyu. You should discipline Ye Xiwu.

174
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,579
Look at my injuries!

175
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,649
On the wedding day of the Sixth Prince, evil birds made a ruckus in his palace.

176
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:23,280
Xiwu left us outside and rushed back to save her husband, protecting outsiders.

177
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,380
She's not worthy of her last name Ye!

178
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,200
Eldest Brother, as a man of the Ye family,

179
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,059
you failed to help someone in need and protect your sisters. Yet you have the nerve to criticize Second Elder Sister.

180
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,029
At least, Second Elder Sister was trying to save someone.

181
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,920
Who were you trying to protect when getting these wounds?

182
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,290
I'm starving.

183
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,450
I feel so dizzy. I can't hear anything clearly.

184
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,349
Xiwu has always been naughty.

185
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,779
I'm afraid after I left, no one here has taught her how to behave. I need to go check on her.

186
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,739
<i>Qingyu! Chuntao, go and help your miss out!</i>

187
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,770
Ye Xiwu, get up. We have company.

188
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,020
Let me sleep a little longer.

189
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,540
Someone is coming here. Time for lunch.

190
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,930
Let me sleep.

191
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,650
Tell Chuntao to save some food for me.

192
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,630
This is ridiculous!

193
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,889
Miss! Miss, you…

194
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,390
Why are you yelling?

195
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,590
Who was here?

196
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,309
Your younger brother, Ye Qingyu.

197
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,419
Yes, Miss. Why are you still sleeping here?

198
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,240
Second Young Master came home today!

199
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,190
What does Second Young Master's return have to do with me?

200
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,590
<i>I had my palms beaten after all.</i>

201
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,209
<i>One can get off today, but not tomorrow.</i>

202
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,029
<i>It is bad.</i>

203
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,450
<i>How come this Second Younger Brother is even meaner than Ye Xiwu?</i>

204
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,270
Ye Xiwu, Grandma and Father were waiting in the dining room today. But you were absent for no reason.

205
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,520
That was unfilial.

206
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,020
Your brother came back from thousands of miles away,

207
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,220
and Father and Grandma were there to welcome me home, yet only you weren't.

208
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,239
That was disrespectful of your sibling.

209
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,810
You are married, but you were doing… doing licentious acts in broad daylight.

210
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,960
That was shameless.

211
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,410
I was away from home for three years and neglected to discipline you.

212
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,590
How could you become such a rascal?

213
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
I am unworthy of the Ye family.

214
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,790
I've realized my mistakes.

215
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,099
Since you've realized your mistakes and I just got home, I won't punish you too harshly.

216
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:14,370
Kneel here for half an hour and introspect on your behavior.

217
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,140
Miss, you should kneel down.

218
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,799
If Second Young Master sees you like this, he will make you kneel for another half an hour.

219
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,069
There is no such thing as he, as the younger brother, teaching me a lesson.

220
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,250
Even the eldest brother is scared of me in the family.

221
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,060
But he has the authority.

222
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,750
He is the warden of the Ye family.

223
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,130
I thought the warden was my dad.

224
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,599
Yes, it used to be him, but he doesn't like too much red tape,

225
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,999
so when dealing with a lot of things, he always muddles through them.

226
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:05,829
But people in the Sheng Kingdom take clans and etiquette very seriously.

227
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:12,409
<i>Then one year, Old Master found it too much work, so he gave all the worship ceremony work to Second Young Master.
[Clan Patriarchs]</i>

228
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,509
<i>Unexpectedly, Second Young Master did a great job, more reliable than Master.</i>

229
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:22,420
<i>Ever since then, Second Young Master was voted to be the warden by all the Ye family members.</i>

230
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,679
<i>[Clan Patriarchs]</i>

231
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,239
Some became prime ministers at the age of 12,

232
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,749
but just how unreliable was my dad that had the whole clan approve of this brat becoming the family warden?

233
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,159
Don't say that about Old Master. Second Young Master will punish you again.

234
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,340
When is Second Young Brother going to leave?

235
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,240
After the Spring Festival, the earliest.

236
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,180
Miss. Miss.

237
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,440
Miss.

238
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,199
Who is the family warden beating this time?

239
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,820
Second Young Master went to your husband.

240
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,820
<i>Ye Qingyu is so fierce.</i>

241
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,949
<i>If he finds out that Tantai Jin is evil, my brother will get rid of him immediately.</i>

242
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:25,150
Miss...

243
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,410
Miss, be careful.

244
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,820
The universe manifests in an inch of land. The soul follows the mind.

245
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,490
Prince Tantai.

246
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,610
I've heard a lot about you.

247
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,679
Whatever you heard about is probably not something good.

248
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,830
Slanders and rumors can ruin a person, but I believe in seeing with my own eyes.

249
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,720
You came here not to chitchat with me. Right?

250
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,150
First, I want to apologize for Second Elder Sister's misbehavior.

251
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,399
Second, I want to invite you to have meals with the family from now on.

252
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,979
Last, my sister is ignorant and unruly, so please don't let her mess around in the future.

253
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,409
For example, her shameful act earlier today.

254
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:37,979
If word gets out about it, the Ye family's and your reputation will be stained.

255
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,830
Shameful act?

256
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,690
Why don't you be straight and tell me exactly what we were doing?

257
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,199
I can just let it go.

258
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,290
I shouldn't interfere in your private matters.

259
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,520
But there is another thing I want to ask you about.

260
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,760
What is it?

261
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,450
Earlier, were you chanting a spell?

262
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,340
You misheard.

263
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,040
I cultivated in Xiaoyao Sect for three years.

264
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,010
Although not a master, I can tell when one is chanting a spell.

265
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,269
Does Second Elder Sister know about this?

266
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,069
Does my father know about it?

267
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,279
You want to know if Ye Xiwu knows, then why don't you go ask her yourself?

268
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,639
I grew up with Second Elder Sister.

269
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,309
Although naughty and mischievous, she is careless.

270
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,190
She can be easily deceived.

271
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,360
Prince Tantai, I've heard that there have been frequent disturbances

272
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,210
and rampant demonic activity in the capital recently.

273
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,480
What does it have to do with me?

274
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,069
The Xuancheng Palace suffered a disaster on their wedding day.

275
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,559
Many places still urgently need repair and my eldest brother's injuries have not yet healed.

276
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,659
Even my father, Pillar of the State Great General, has been injured.

277
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:10,200
I heard you were there too, but you were unscathed.

278
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,650
So what?

279
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,549
I was just lucky.

280
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,550
Jing Kingdom's royal symbol is a three-eye crow.

281
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,099
The beast that broke into Xuanchen Palace that day happened to be crows.

282
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,950
What a coincidence!

283
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,990
General Ye, considering your amazing imagination,

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,590
it's an awful waste of your talent to have you defend the border as a general.

285
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:49,650
Prince Tantai, I have a spell called Bone Inspect, which can tell one's nature.

286
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,900
Would you care to try it?

287
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,330
Do you have to do this?

288
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,540
If you are innocent, what's there to be scared about?

289
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,730
Second Younger Brother, you misunderstood him.

290
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,509
Is half an hour over so fast?

291
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,410
Not yet.

292
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,810
I'll soon go back to the ancestral hall to make up for it.

293
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:28,599
Second Younger Brother, when the monsters were rampaging, I was with Tantai Jin the whole time.

294
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,779
He almost died. It wasn't him. Really.

295
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,179
Let me ask you for the last time. Have you been secretly studying spells?

296
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,269
I thought you were mad over some big deal.

297
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,890
Yes, he is practicing spells.

298
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,679
I learned some simple spells recently.

299
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,509
I thought it was boring to practice alone, so I had Tantai Jin practice with me.

300
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,349
But he is so dumb that he can't grasp them at all.

301
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,479
That's why he was secretly practicing in the room.

302
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,820
So that's what you are worried about.

303
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,379
What's so secretive about it? Why couldn't you just tell him?

304
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,479
Learning spells?

305
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,000
Who did you learn spells from?

306
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,859
Remember there were demons in the capital?

307
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:21,000
I had Scholar Pang teach me a few tricks.

308
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,580
Prince Tantai, I was rude to you just now. My apologies.

309
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,759
Second Elder Sister, I just told Prince Tantai. Since we are a family, he shouldn't eat alone at a single table.

310
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,300
Starting tomorrow, he may dine with us.

311
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,029
Great. I agree.

312
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,070
You made a very wise decision.

313
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,679
<i>You only care about eating.</i>

314
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,260
<i>Just now if it weren't for me, you might've been killed.</i>

315
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,640
Qingyu.

316
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,760
Speaking of spells, do you know immortal arts as well?

317
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,209
The Bone Inspect spell you were talking about…

318
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,160
Fake, just to intimidate him.

319
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,240
<i>I was scared to death.</i>

320
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,800
Oh, well, Tantai Jin. Ignorance is bliss.

321
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,310
You... Fortune favors fools.

322
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,930
Second Young Master.

323
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,700
Second Young Master, Prince Xuanchen sent people to invite you over.

324
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,239
His Highness said that after being long parted from you, he misses you very much.

325
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,630
He invited you to his palace to catch up.

326
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,640
- Get the horse ready.
- Yes.

327
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,969
<i>[Xiao Mansion]</i>

328
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:48,930
General Ye, it turns out you are also a disciple from our Mount Buzhao.

329
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,370
I wouldn't have figured it out if Your Highness didn't say anything.

330
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,499
Descendants from Sheng's official families are most likely sent to immortal sects

331
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,069
for a few years of cultivation, no matter whether they are talented or not.

332
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,719
It's something of a tradition now.

333
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,299
It's normal that Scholar Pang can't tell.

334
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,949
Unlike His Highness, I don't have his talent in making elixirs and cultivating.

335
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:08,650
I only fit in armies, playing with weapons.

336
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,050
You are joking, General Ye.

337
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,589
A talent like you can even be humble about your gift,

338
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,310
then I would be a parasite of your kingdom.

339
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,670
I heard the emperor of Jing has died suddenly.

340
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,109
If the news is true, I don't know what kind of disturbance the world will suffer.

341
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,250
You don't need to worry.

342
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,749
Tantai Wuji died of a severe illness, and his throne will fall into Tantai Minglang's hands.

343
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,010
I heard this man is paranoid and bad-tempered.

344
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,239
If he succeeds to the throne, I'm afraid the Jing Kingdom itself will be in trouble.

345
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:47,110
As the saying goes, "The rise brings suffering to the people, and the fall also brings suffering to the people."

346
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,050
It has been like this since ancient times.

347
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:56,350
Your Highness, although the Jing Kingdom is an enemy, their soldiers and civilians are all flesh and blood,

348
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,830
no different from us.

349
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,749
General Ye, you are very broad-minded.

350
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,830
I feel ashamed of my shallowness.

351
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,919
As the guardian general of the borders, I receive a salary from the court.

352
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,630
I am duty-bound to protect the Sheng Kingdom with all my heart and strength.

353
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,589
However, deep down in my heart, I hope there will be no more wars in the world,

354
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:14,620
and one day the countries can be reunified.

355
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,250
But the hostility between the two kingdoms has been there for years.

356
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,769
I wonder which powerful lord will have such courage, and in which year and month this will happen.

357
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,679
Your Highness, if someday you become the emperor of Sheng,

358
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,140
I…

359
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,840
General Ye, my father is in his prime.

360
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,690
You should not have said such things.

361
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,640
I spoke out of turn. Please punish me, Your Highness.

362
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,210
Don't be like this.

363
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,230
The general trend of the world is that what has been divided must be united, and vice versa.

364
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,940
You mortals should accept this reality.

365
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,650
How about this?

366
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,240
I'll conduct fortune-telling for you guys.

367
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
What fortune?

368
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,590
What's the matter?

369
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,810
According to the divination result, the person who can end the chaos, pacify the empire,

370
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:26,380
and bring happiness to the people is now in Sheng's capital city.

371
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,900
Let me check again.

372
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:50,429
<i>That day, I devoured the dream demon. It gave me temporary power, but it ran out very quickly.</i>

373
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,439
<i>My body's yearning for demonic powers seems to be insatiable.</i>

374
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,750
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

375
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,310
Ye Qingyu suspects me,

376
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,110
and Ye Xiwu follows me around every day.

377
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,440
I have to figure out another way...

378
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,380
to find new demonic power.

379
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,090
- Second Young Master.
- Chuntao, have you seen Eldest Young Master?

380
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:47,159
Eldest Young Master… He went out early in the morning after borrowing thirty taels from Miss.

381
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,200
He probably went again to the…

382
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,310
How dare you, Ye Zeyu!

383
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,620
<i>Big!</i>

384
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,370
<i>Big!</i>

385
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,530
Big!
<i>[2 + 2]</i>

386
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,550
Another round?

387
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,940
Yes.

388
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,550
For each round you lose, you have to take off a piece of clothing.

389
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,480
Eldest Young Master Ye, you have just taken off one.

390
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,800
If you lose one more time, you'll be stripped naked.

391
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,790
So what about taking off clothes?

392
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,390
You, a lady, can watch me without feeling shy, then why would I flinch? Let's start.

393
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,940
Another round, then.

394
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,969
Sir, please stop. Who are you looking for?

395
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:51,590
Ye Zeyu. Is he inside?

396
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,119
What is it you want to see him about? Tell me so I can inform him for you.

397
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,490
I'm here to break his legs.

398
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,680
<i>[Gamble House]</i>

399
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,780
My ancestors, please bless me.

400
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,020
I need to win once!

401
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,130
You don't want to see me become a laughing stock, do you?

402
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,959
<i>Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big!</i>

403
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,480
<i>Open it! Open It! Open it!</i>

404
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,100
<i>Open it! Open It! Open it!</i>

405
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,600
<i>Big!</i>

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,510
<i>[2 + 2]</i>

407
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,229
My ancestors, you guys are unbelievably iron-hearted!

408
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,250
<i>Strip! Strip! Strip!</i>

409
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,590
I haven't lost yet. You go!

410
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,060
<i>Go!</i>

411
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,060
Eldest Young Master Ye, are you quite unlucky today?

412
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,710
<i>Small! Small! Small! Small! Small!</i>

413
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,560
<i>Small! Small! Small! Small! Small!</i>

00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,570
<i>Small! Small! Small! Small! Small!</i>

00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,030
<i>Small! Small! Small! Small! Small!</i>

416
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,649
<i>- Small!</i>
- Open! Bless me.

417
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:11,960
<i>Open! Open! Open!</i>

418
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,330
<i>Small! Small! Small!</i>

419
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:22,410
<i>Small! Small! Small!</i>

420
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,410
<i>Small!</i>

421
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,180
<i>[1 + 1]</i>

422
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,420
It's small!

423
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,360
It's your turn to undress!

424
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>Undress! Undress! Undress!</i>

425
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,690
Go ahead! Undress!

426
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,710
<i>Undress! Undress! Undress! Undress! Undress!</i>

427
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,410
<i>Undress! Undress! Undress!</i>

428
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,880
<i>Undress! Undress! Undress!</i>

429
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,980
Who the hell dared to hit me?

430
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,420
You did well.

431
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,790
Second Younger Brother, you are here.

432
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,440
Put on your clothes and go to the Ancestral Hall.

433
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,080
Kneel there according to domestic discipline.

434
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,809
Yes. I'll go right now.

435
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,690
Make way. Make way for me.

436
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,010
What are you looking at? Look away.

437
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,809
<i>Ye Qingyu really seems quite powerful. I have to guard against him.</i>

438
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,230
<i>My spell skills is progressing slowly, and can be found out easily.</i>

439
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,670
<i>It's not nearly as useful as demonic elixirs.</i>

440
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,330
<i>It happens to be Spring Festival, and the streets are full of the hustle and bustle,</i>

441
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,230
<i>suitable for going out and hunting.</i>

442
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,490
<i>But Ye Xiwu definitely won't let me out.</i>

443
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,410
Tantai Jin, let's go Spring Festival shopping.

444
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,149
You are looking for trouble yourself.

445
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,280
Why are you dragging me along?

446
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,669
It's not like I'm asking you to draw a carriage. Why are you rejecting me?

447
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:05,799
Everyone should bathe in the sun more.

448
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,699
In this way, you can get stronger. Being confined in that little attic all day long, you'll become a freak.

449
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,480
<i>This is just what I want.</i>

450
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Let's go. Come on.

451
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,530
<i>Festivals in the mortal world are so lively.</i>

452
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,000
<i>There are more people on this street than the whole of Mount Changze.</i>

453
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,130
Chuntao, let's get off and walk around.

454
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,169
- Miss, that's delicious, too!
- You only think about food!

455
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,730
<i>As Spring Festival approaches, people come and go on the streets.</i>

456
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:58,160
<i> If I look carefully, I should be able to find a monster or two pretending to be people.</i>

457
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,090
Wait a moment, Young Master.

458
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,830
You forgot your cloak.

459
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,410
You can keep it as a compensation. I apologize for my brother.

460
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,340
You are not him.

461
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,620
He owes me. Why are you paying back on his behalf?

462
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,280
He owes me a piece of clothing.

463
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,480
Are you, as his brother, going to strip on his behalf in front of me?

464
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,759
Also, the money he owes me is far more than the value of a dress.

465
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,690
It's sweet. You want some?

466
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,630
Then I'll eat all of it.

467
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,310
So many people here.

468
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,570
<i>I can distinctly sense the demonic power nearby.</i>

469
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,220
<i>But where is it hiding exactly?</i>

470
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,719
<i>Delicious chestnuts. Take a look here.</i>

471
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,300
Chestnuts! Let's go!

472
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,810
Miss, would you like some chestnuts?

473
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,030
- I'll have some, please. I'll have some.
- All right.

474
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,780
<i>- Bravo!
- Yeah!</i>

475
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,070
Hey!

476
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,330
Where are you going?

477
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,570
Let's watch this.

478
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,640
Here, have a taste.

479
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,610
Have a try!

480
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,980
Okay.

481
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,650
Look at you. Hiding in that little attic all day long,

482
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,129
you look as if you will melt in the sun.

483
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:57,669
You should come out for a stroll more often, enjoying some good food to lift your mood.

484
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,020
<i>Great!</i>

485
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,360
Are you saying I can come out whenever I want?

486
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,420
Of course.

487
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,850
But I should come with you, lest you get lost.

488
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,690
<i>This woman is not dumb. She is still guarded with me.</i>

489
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,310
Miss, there are still so many things to buy.

490
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,899
If we keep hanging around like this, we won't be done even when it gets dark.

491
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:23,080
Good point.

492
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,279
I'll leave the carriage to you.

493
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,060
You can go back home after you get everything. I'll walk around a little longer.

494
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,930
Let's go.

495
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,950
<i>- Good!
- Great!</i>

496
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,530
<i>Awesome!</i>

497
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,149
- You got rid of all of them?
- Yes.

498
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,710
That Second Young Miss Ye is inseparable from His Highness.

499
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,559
Those people probably won't have another chance to harm His Highness.

500
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:53,279
If you want to meet him under the Ye family's nose, you have to be cautious.

501
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,379
High Priestess, although His Highness is the princess's son, he is not so close with the Yiyue tribe.

502
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,320
Also, you had been gone for so long.

503
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,110
What if he refuses to recognize you?

504
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,680
It's not only for the Yiyue tribe,

505
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,800
but also for himself.

506
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,690
Let's go and find a place to stay the night first.

507
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,150
Yes.

508
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,170
Tantai Jin. Tantai Jin, what's this?

509
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,960
I don't know.

510
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,690
This is a mud whistle.

511
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,530
Every kid has played with one of these.

512
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,149
Could it be that you two are immortals who have descended to earth and not partake in the pleasures of mortal life?

513
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:49,659
<i>I did come to earth, but I didn't expect Young Devil Lord to not recognize this thing.</i>

514
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:52,970
<i>He has been living like a prisoner since he was a child. Who would buy him toys?</i>

515
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,490
Here.

516
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,709
<i>Seeing as how he's looking around with an inexperienced look,</i>

517
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:04,169
<i>I think he is probably just like me, coming to a temple fair for the first time. </i>

518
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:08,080
Tantai Jin, how about I buy you one?

519
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,740
Ye Xiwu, are you a little child? Using me as an excuse to buy toys for yourself.

520
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,510
I will buy it.

521
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,110
Hide!

522
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,420
I didn't expect Second Younger Brother, who is usually serious, to come out shopping.

523
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:50,059
We shopped for half a day. I think I have paid off what my brother owes you.

524
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:51,830
Let me calculate.

525
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,829
The principal has almost been paid off, but you also need to pay me some interest.

526
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,370
- That's a lot of interest.
- Of course.

527
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,870
Which color is the prettiest?

528
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,560
All good.

529
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,799
Buy lipstick for me, and the debt you owe me is cleared.

530
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,500
Okay.

531
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,149
- Put it on for me, then.
- I…

532
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,110
Hurry up.

533
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,550
I'll close my eyes and spare you the embarrassment. Okay?

534
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,030
Gosh.

535
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,030
Did you see that?

536
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,980
Am I pretty?

537
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,249
Am I hallucinating?

538
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:24,870
Is that really our family warden?

539
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,509
Have you had enough fun?

540
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,180
He turned around to us.

541
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,960
- I'll buy these two.
- These two. Okay.

542
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,600
Have a good one.

543
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,860
Tantai Jin, do you smell something strange?

544
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,730
No, not a smell. I can't tell what it is.

545
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,400
No.

546
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,860
<i>This is the source of that demonic energy.</i>

547
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,740
<i>I've finally found her.</i>

548
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,180
<i>If I can take her demonic elixir…</i>

549
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,319
Pian Ran, where are you from?

550
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm not a Sheng citizen.

551
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,889
My hometown is remote, and you probably haven't heard of it even if I told you.

552
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,800
So you come from afar.

553
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,950
Do you have any relatives in the capital?

554
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,770
No.

555
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,630
I live by myself.

556
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:40,040
Alone and nowhere to belong. If I encounter any trouble in the future, I might have to go to you for help.

557
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,470
No problem. You may come to me whenever you need help.

558
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,860
My home is just across the bridge ahead.

559
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,690
Young Master Ye, you have been running around all day with me.

560
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,190
Would you like to come to my place for a cup of tea?

561
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,569
Today is the New Year's Eve. My grandmother is at home, and I shouldn't stay out for too long.

562
00:45:57,569 --> 00:46:00,480
All right. No need to ramble on.

563
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,680
I can let you go today.

564
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,310
Young Master Ye, remember to retrieve the cloak when you have time.

565
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,000
Goodbye.

566
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,170
Young Master Ye.

567
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,440
Don't forget, now you owe me a cup of tea.

568
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,230
<i>This man is likable.</i>

569
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:35,329
<i>Never mind. I'm not in a hurry now.</i>

00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,069
<i>[Ready-Made Clothing Store]</i>

571
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,190
This dress is perfect for Grandma. This one is for Father.

572
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,229
I'll take this one, too. It fits Chuntao perfectly.

573
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,359
Shopkeeper, please pack them for me. Let's see what else I need.

574
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,500
Oh, Ye Zeyu! Come in!

575
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,409
- What's wrong?
- Try it on for me.

576
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,930
My size is different from Eldest Young Master's.

577
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,740
I think it fits.

578
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,079
Sir, I will take this one too. You don't need to pack it. We will put it on.

579
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:08,799
Right, pick several sets of clothes in this size for each season.

580
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,429
Choose them based on his body measurements. Pack them all and send them to General Ye's manor.

581
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,400
Okay.

582
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,390
Ye Xiwu, is it for me?

583
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,270
Didn't I promise to buy you a new one before?

584
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,340
I forgot for many days. I'm sorry.

585
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,859
What are you standing here for? Put it on. It's getting dark.

586
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,110
Father and the others will worry about us.

587
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,300
Go.

588
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,330
Go, go, go!

589
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,150
Change into it.

590
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,570
Finally, we've finished shopping.

591
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,890
We can go home to have New Year's Eve dinner.

592
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,320
It seems taking you with me was a pretty wise decision.

593
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,810
Firecrackers. Who wants some firecrackers?

594
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,629
Firecrackers!

595
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,750
She is selling firecrackers.

596
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,960
Chuntao has bought some.

597
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,790
Buy some firecrackers!

598
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,540
There's no harm in buying a few more.

599
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,210
Ye Xiwu.

600
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,709
Miss, please buy some firecrackers.

601
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,320
Sister, I'll buy all the firecrackers in your basket.

602
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,999
I made these firecrackers with my own hands.

603
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,760
I'm afraid they are not very good-looking.

604
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,310
Don't worry. I like ones like that. How much do I owe you?

605
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,130
You can pay me 30 pennies. No, no...

606
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,549
pay me 20. Twenty is enough.

607
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,440
Here.

608
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,679
No, you shouldn't have. But…

609
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,729
- Miss…
- You can have this too.

610
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,450
- Happy New Year, sister.
- Miss, you don't have to…

611
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,130
I met a goddess today.

612
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,450
Why did you buy so many firecrackers?

613
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,210
I like setting them off. You got a problem with that?

614
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,059
It's so cold. The sooner she sells all of them, the earlier she can go home to celebrate New Year's Eve.

615
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,610
You bought all of them today, but tomorrow... she will still be out in the cold to sell them.

616
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:36,170
Maybe she'll meet another fool like me tomorrow.

617
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:41,370
Ye Xiwu, your small bag of money can't do much for her.

618
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,070
You are right.

619
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,950
There's no way to rid this world of misery, and there's nothing I can do to make a difference.

620
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:14,830
But, at least, she gets to go home earlier to celebrate New Year's Eve today.
