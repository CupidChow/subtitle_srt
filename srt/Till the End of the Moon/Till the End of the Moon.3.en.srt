<i>[Ye Mansion]</i>

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,129
He talks to birds?

17
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,290
Yeah. And flies and mosquitoes!

18
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,899
When he passed by the lake the other day, a toad was sitting on the shore, and they chatted for a while.

19
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,509
Mr. Tantai is so weird.

20
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,279
He can hold a conversation with a toad.

21
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,180
Is he talking to himself?

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,529
- The servants passing by the lake were all snickering at him.
- <i>Indeed.</i>

23
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,980
<i>You, stop being naughty!</i>

24
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,770
What is this nonsense?

25
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,199
Haven't I told you?

26
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:09,579
Forget about supervising him to find faults, your only job is to watch Tantai Jin.

27
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:15,489
If he does anything suspicious, especially if he is up to any tricks, report it right back.

28
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,419
Also, keep a close eye on him.

29
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,859
Don't let him freeze, starve, or get beaten up.

30
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:23,429
He's not allowed to leave Ye Mansion.

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,909
His every movement is being watched.

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,779
It's utterly impossible for him to play any tricks.

33
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:32,769
He also talks to sparrows, butterflies, and whatnot.

34
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,929
Basically, he talks to all animals except humans.

35
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:43,910
Miss, do you think he can actually talk to animals?

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,090
You must've overworked yourself.

37
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,130
Why don't you take a few days off?

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,340
Miss, I really saw them talking!

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,030
Maybe it's because no one in this mansion ever talks to him.

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,529
Anyone would go crazy without someone to talk to all year round.

41
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:10,950
Now that I think about it, Mr. Tantai is quite pitiful.

42
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,719
<i>Could it be that he became a devil god because he was isolated for too long?</i>

43
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,309
<i>This won't do. I need to get information from him.</i>

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,830
Second Young Miss.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,629
You've followed me around for days.

46
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,130
Do you have something to say to me?

47
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,739
You guessed right.

48
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,409
I've been so bored lately. So I wanted to have someone to chat with.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,460
Go ahead.

50
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,430
Nice weather today, huh?

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,700
It's freezing!

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,750
Tantai Jin.

53
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,600
Tantai Jin!

54
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,629
You're always getting bullied. How does that make you feel?

55
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,030
I don't.

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,329
No way.

57
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:45,330
Anyone who gets insulted would be angry or feel resentful.

58
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,600
Haven't you thought of doing something about it?

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,910
Like… killing me?

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,940
You want me to kill you?

61
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,189
No.

62
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,330
That's not what I meant.

63
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,740
I just wanted to know what you're thinking.

64
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,230
It doesn't matter what I think.

65
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,530
You all insult me not because of what I've done, but simply because you enjoy it.

66
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,190
I can't change all of you.

67
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,110
As for whether I hold resentment or grudges, none of it matters.

68
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,140
I'm just a hostage prince from Jing Kingdom.

69
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,550
To be alive is exhausting enough.

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,530
I don't have the energy to think about anything else.

71
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,209
<i>This was five hundred years ago.</i>

72
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,410
<i>The young devil god truly hasn't done anything bad.</i>

73
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,529
<i>Or should I say, he hasn't had his chance yet.</i>

74
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,000
<i>Instead, others were the ones doing bad things to him.</i>

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,029
<i>Maybe he only became a devil god due to the series of tragedies.</i>

76
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,869
<i>If someone was willing to help him, to show him kindness, and cared about him</i>

77
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,630
<i>would he have fallen on this devilish path?</i>

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,720
Tantai Jin, life is indeed tough, but you still have to live on.

79
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,529
Come find me if you ever feel bored.

80
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,680
Not socializing for too long can turn you into a psychopath!

81
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,190
Like you?

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,579
You looked good when you smiled just now.

83
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,089
There're so many people in the mansion.

84
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,330
I'm sure someone would like you and want to talk to you.

85
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,600
No one will ever like me.

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,170
And I don't need to be liked.

87
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,259
Miss!

88
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,229
Miss, look!

89
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,129
I visited all the clothing stores in the captial and got some nice and thick winter clothes.

90
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,210
Pick one for Mr. Tantai.

91
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,330
This one's too thin.

92
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,579
This works.

93
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,800
The color looks good, too.

94
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,469
But it's too big. He can't wear this.

95
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,839
How am I supposed to know his size?

96
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,840
Go fetch me some sewing tools.

97
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,079
Miss, I'm not sure if I should ask you this…

98
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,440
Then don't.

99
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,359
Why are you being so nice to Mr. Tantai now?

100
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,769
Because I'm afraid.

101
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,630
Afraid? Of what?

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,069
I'm afraid one day when Mr. Tantai freezes to death, he'll drag us along to hell.

103
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,150
And what if after all the constant ill-treatment, he finally snaps one day,

104
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:12,780
decides he's done being a punching bag, turns into a big tiger donned in a black robe, and eats us all!

105
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,330
Why would a big tiger be wearing a black robe?

106
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>[Don't freeze to death]</i>

107
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,370
This coat is for me?

108
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,789
A kept man who lives off a woman can actually afford a new coat?

109
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,070
Stop right there.

110
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,570
Tantai Jin? What is it?

111
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,950
You just slit my coat.

112
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,470
Slit?

113
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,220
Now that's a slit.

114
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,700
Are you getting mad?

115
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,169
Are you starting to have a temper because Second Sister hasn't beaten you lately?

116
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,339
How dare you glare at me?

117
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,620
Our Ye family has given you such a good life...

118
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,789
that you've gotten brash with your masters now?

119
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm going to beat you up right now!

120
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,490
Why are you getting violent?

121
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,020
Wait! Why did you pull me away?

122
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,010
I just helped you slit that kept man's coat.

123
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,950
Look at him showing off.

124
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,940
Ye Zeyu, pay for it.

125
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,139
Hasn't Father taught you an eye for an eye, a coat for a coat?

126
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,430
What?

127
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,019
What's wrong with you, Xiwu?

128
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,339
You paying or not?

129
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,830
Don't make me go to Father.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,650
I'll pay.

131
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,260
Here!

132
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,000
What happened to your loyalty after falling in love?

133
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,219
Just ignore him.

134
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,709
This slit is too big to be patched.

135
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,149
You can't wear this anymore.

136
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,930
I'll get a new one.

137
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,769
You gave this to me.

138
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,870
It's mine now.

139
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,619
All right. You keep it.

140
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:35,120
I'll have Chuntao buy you a new one.

141
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,579
Miss! It's a royal edict!

142
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,880
Mr. Tantai is to have an audience with the king.

143
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,500
<i>This young devil god still has ties within the palace?</i>

144
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,499
<i>I must follow him to find out.</i>

145
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,970
<i>In case something fishy is going on.</i>

146
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,570
I'll come with you.

147
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>Tantai Jin is here to meet His Majesty!</i>

148
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

149
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,210
Second Young Miss Ye, His Majesty will only meet Prince Tantai alone.

150
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,109
If you have nothing to do, how about having a chat with the Queen Dowager?

151
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:30,359
It's okay. I'm pretty familiar with the palace.

152
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,970
I'll just take a walk.

153
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,960
Sure.

154
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,860
<i>Devil Lord was raised in this palace.</i>

155
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,839
<i>What on earth did Tantai Jin go through?</i>

156
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,539
<i>How did he spend his youth?</i>

157
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,199
<i>Why choose him to become a devil god?</i>

158
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,079
<i>If I saw the place he lived in before, maybe I can find some clues.</i>

159
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,349
You there.

160
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,080
Second Young Miss Ye.

161
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,800
Do you know where Tantai Jin used to live?

162
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,299
Tantai Jin, here's a letter from the Jing Kingdom.

163
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,279
It was sent from the palace.

164
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,280
Do you want to read it?

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,390
No.

166
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:21,869
Any normal person would want to hear from his family. When you say no, it sounds like a lie.

167
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:27,979
For me, the Jing Kingdom is a thousand miles away, to which I shall never return.

168
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:34,480
Emperor Jing is someone I knew twenty years ago, whom I will never reunite with.

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,690
He is but a foreigner in a foreign land.

170
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,590
I don't care.

171
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,380
Nor do I need to care.

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Do you mean that?

173
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,439
Do you know the king of Jing Tantai Wuji is about to die of an illness?

174
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:56,399
Your elder brother Tantai Minglang has been made crown prince.

175
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,740
<i>I see.</i>

176
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,820
Noted.

177
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,379
Thank you, Your Majesty.

178
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,909
Tantai Minglang is an ambitious one.

179
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:16,289
He's been waging wars against us and never bothered to care about you, his younger brother's wellbeing.

180
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:23,579
Are you truly not afraid that I might cut your head off as a sacrifice?

181
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,090
Tantai Minglang and I are just strangers who share the same blood.

182
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,030
He wouldn't care if I lived or died.

183
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:47,980
If you were to behead me as a sacrifice, I'm afraid that may be exactly what he wishes.

184
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,679
He shows no mercy for you.

185
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,179
Have you never thought of going back to the Jing Kingdom and taking back all that belongs to you?

186
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,510
<i>I see he's trying to play me against my own brother.</i>

187
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,260
Your Majesty, I'd left my country over a decade ago.

188
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,240
I am but a wanderer.

189
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,960
The people of Jing Kingdom only acknowledge Tantai Minglang.

190
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,469
There's no place for me back there.

191
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,560
Besides, fate has a plan for us all.

192
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,510
The throne, the mortal land, I'll leave these for others to compete.

193
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,790
This is my fate.

194
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,880
To be able to live is enough for me.

195
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,540
It seems I was overconcerned.

196
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,550
You may leave.

197
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,379
This man has a heart of stone.

198
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,110
He baffles me every time I see him.

199
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,450
No wonder his old man does not care for him.

200
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,490
Since he refuses to work for me, he's useless now.

201
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,010
Have someone keep an eye on him.

202
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,080
He'll cause trouble as long as he's alive.

203
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,019
About what I mentioned before, get it done quickly.

204
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,609
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,589
I've already made arrangements.

206
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,909
Do be careful. Find someone of similar appearance and age.

207
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,809
Don't make any mistakes.

208
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:32,980
When the time comes, I can weaken the Ye family and disrupt the Jing Kingdom as well.

209
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,400
Wise move, Your Majesty.

210
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,370
Second Young Miss, we've arrived.

211
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,359
This was where Prince Tantai had lived before being sent to the Ye family.

212
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,550
You guys want to harm His Highness!

213
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,630
You guys want to harm His Highness! They want to harm His Highness.

214
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,799
Ma'am, it's a cold day. Why are you on the ground?

215
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,590
Second Young Miss, this is Nanny Yingxin.

216
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,669
I heard she's the one who brought up Prince Tantai.

217
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,730
She followed His Highness here from the Jing Kingdom.

218
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,039
You want to harm His Highness!

219
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,280
You want to harm His Highness!

220
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,250
Do you mean Tantai Jin? Who wants to harm him?

221
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,130
I'd never cause him harm.

222
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,480
Your Highness, please hold on.

223
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,140
Steward Wu.

224
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,470
I haven't had the chance to congratulate you on your marriage.

225
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,740
Congratulations.

226
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,940
Steward Wu, let's drop the pleasantries.

227
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,709
I heard that although you married Miss Ye Xiwu, the one you love is Miss Bingchang.

228
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:19,979
As we all know, Miss Bingchang and our Prince Lin have reciprocated feelings for each other.

229
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:24,659
And General Ye has long regarded him as his son-in-law.

230
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,779
Since you're now at the Ye Mansion, this is rather convenient.

231
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,040
Could you keep an eye out for me?

232
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,310
What do you mean?

233
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,330
For proof of their collusion, of course!

234
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,920
Collusion?

235
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,820
You want me to help you frame Xiao Lin and Ye Xiao?

236
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,319
What a poor choice of words.

237
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,109
I'm His Majesty's close attendant.

238
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,149
Certainly, I should share his worries.

239
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,019
If you're willing to help, not only can I guarantee you'll live long,

240
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,870
but I may also help you marry your one true love.

241
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,089
<i>In this vast capital, Xiao Lin is the only one who has been sincere to me.</i>

242
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,850
<i>We're not close enough to meddle in each other's affairs, </i>

243
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,870
<i>but there's no reason for me to harm him.</i>

244
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,139
I'm afraid I won't be able to help you do that.

245
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,099
Don't ask for the hard way.

246
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,870
Don't forget what happened to Yue Yingxin.

247
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,090
How did she become like this?

248
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,419
This cold palace has few visitors all year round.

249
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,379
We don't know when she went crazy either.

250
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:36,329
I just heard that she's been like this ever since Prince Tantai left for Ye Mansion.

251
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:39,590
I didn't harm His Highness. I didn't harm His Highness.

252
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,680
It's not me. No. I didn't harm His Highness.

253
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,690
I didn't harm His Highness.

254
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,939
Don't you forget where you are right now.

255
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,040
Don't forget I'm in control of her fate.

256
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,869
It's up to me whether she lives or dies.

257
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:03,210
Don't think you can live in peace by being a docile son-in-law with no say in the Ye family.

258
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,860
I'll kill Yingxin if you don't comply.

259
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,319
But I won't let her die so quickly.

260
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,240
I thought you were just Xiao Liang's loyal dog.

261
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,520
I didn't expect you to be a talkative one, too.

262
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,940
Tantai Jin, you…

263
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
His Highness is summoning you.

264
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,840
I'll be right there.

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,810
Hostage Prince Tantai, as for what I just said…

266
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,200
Steward Wu, you were just catching up with me.

267
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,479
You're getting better at this, huh?

268
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,600
All right, listen.

269
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,249
If you dare tell anyone else about what I said, I will make you regret being born.

270
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,040
A lowly son of a lowly mother!

271
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,390
<i>That Steward Wu talks too much.</i>

272
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,320
That Tantai Jin thinks too highly of himself!

273
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,950
Godfather, don't let anger consume your health.

274
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,969
About the one you told me to find, I've got him.

275
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:31,010
It'll surely be enough to fool those of the Jing Kingdom.

276
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,760
No. I just shared too many secrets with him.

277
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,799
If he is of no use to me, I can't let him live any longer!

278
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,729
Tantai Jin must be killed tonight!

279
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,690
If he won't listen, replace him with someone who will!

280
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,490
Godfather! Godfather!

281
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,900
Godfather!

282
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,560
He's dead!

283
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,340
He's dead!

284
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,330
Lin'er, you said you had something important to discuss.

285
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,040
What is it?

286
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,329
Royal Father, many civilians of late have gone missing in their sleep.

287
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,990
I suspect a demon has entered the capital.

288
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,109
I sent Chen Xian to lead the Secret Dragon Guards

289
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,029
to investigate the missing civilians as soon as I heard the report.

290
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,299
I've arranged day-and-night patrols in and out of the capital to look out for the demon.

291
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,339
Royal Father, please be careful in the palace too, in case the demon causes trouble.

292
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:39,669
Of all the princes and nobles we sent to Mount Buzhao, you're the most promising one.

293
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,419
You excelled the fastest in your cultivation.

294
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,109
You've made great progress in just three years.

295
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:51,519
But faced with demons like this, I'm afraid success isn't guaranteed with just three years of cultivation.

296
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,729
Sorry to let you down.

297
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,450
It's fine.

298
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,790
I happen to have someone who can be of use to you.

299
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,390
Sixth Prince, we meet again.

300
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,140
Junior Martial Uncle!

301
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,110
So, Master sent you here?

302
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,829
My senior brother said the opportunity of my lifetime would be in the capital.

303
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,720
He told me to spend a few years here before returning.

304
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,769
What opportunity is that?

305
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,419
Well, I don't have a clue.

306
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,009
But at least I can help while I'm here.

307
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,279
The Barren Abyss Barrier has weakened recently,

308
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,839
and demons are slipping through, wreaking havoc in the mortal world.

309
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,979
You also know that our Xiaoyao Sect loves minding irrelevant things like this.

310
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,689
This is not irrelevant.

311
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,769
It's a big deal concerning people's lives.

312
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:47,029
Since Royal Father appointed you as Scholar of the Ministry of Ceremonies, as an official, you ought to protect your people.

313
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,919
Now that we are under attack by demons, please help me subdue them right away.

314
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
Look how the tables have turned.

315
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,319
Back in Mount Buzhao, I was your Martial Uncle.

316
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,890
Now that I'm in the Sheng Kingdom, I've become your subordinate!

317
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,189
But the salary of a Sheng official is simply too low.

318
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:08,019
I can't even feed my own mouth. Let alone, my family members.

319
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,000
Junior Martial Uncle, you're adopting cats again.

320
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,650
You know me best.

321
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,770
<i>Young Devil Lord had a hard life in the palace, </i>

322
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,320
<i>that's why he's so pessimistic and hopeless.</i>

323
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,239
<i>The evil bone feeds on hatred and pain to accumulate strength.</i>

324
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,080
<i>That's why Tantai Jin suffered so much.</i>

325
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,870
<i>Is this the fate of a devil god?</i>

326
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,910
Little one.

327
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,789
It's late. Why are you out on this windy night?

328
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,949
Aren't you cold?

329
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,050
Father, why are you home so late?

330
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,870
You have worked hard.

331
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,600
You have learned to worry about me?

332
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,860
You've really grown up.

333
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,390
By the way, if you have nothing important to do, don't hang around outside.

334
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,299
- Why?
- The capital isn't safe.

335
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,750
Some civilians have disappeared in their sleep.

336
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,689
It seems it's a demon's doing.

337
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,769
And another strange thing happened in the palace.

338
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,050
His Majesty's loyal advisor Steward Wu had an accident.

339
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,109
He chatted a little with Tantai Jin and died soon after going back.

340
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,289
His ear canal was bleeding.

341
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,179
The way he died was bizarre.

342
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,670
A wasp even crawled out of his ear.

343
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,130
<i>- A wasp?
- He talks to birds?</i>

344
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,399
<i>Yeah, and flies and mosquitoes. They chatted for a while.</i>

345
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,049
I won't say more, in case my darling daughter becomes too frightened to sleep.

346
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,910
Go to bed.

347
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,390
Miss, are there really demons in this world?

348
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,010
Not only demons, but also devils.

349
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:21,570
<i>Even when I left the palace and hid in Ye Mansion, they still wouldn't let me go.</i>

350
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,820
<i>I must find a way to get out of Sheng Kingdom.</i>

351
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,170
<i>Steward Wu, you've lived long enough.</i>

352
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,100
<i>Go.</i>

353
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,549
<i>With my current abilities, controlling a couple of small creatures is the best I can do.</i>

354
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,460
<i>I barely got out of danger this time.</i>

355
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,050
<i>Next time, might be more challenging.</i>

356
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,580
<i>How do I know if he has awakened?</i>

357
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,349
<i>Young Devil Lord doesn't have much power now.</i>

358
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,479
<i>If it was him who did it, he must have used a curse or a charm.</i>

359
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,240
<i>If you murdered someone, you'll definitely leave traces behind.</i>

360
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,630
Second Young Miss?

361
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,600
<i>There's nothing on him.</i>

362
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,779
What are you dissatisfied with, Second Young Miss?

363
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,270
<i>I'll just have to trick it out of him.</i>

364
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,589
Steward Wu from the palace suddenly died today.

365
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,480
Did you know that?

366
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,669
I heard that he stopped you before you left the palace.

367
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,820
What did he say to you?

368
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,530
Nothing.

369
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,999
<i>So calm.</i>

370
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,010
<i>Is he really innocent?</i>

371
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,100
From today on, I'm going to search you before you go to bed.

372
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,079
I'm warning you! Don't even think about playing tricks on me.

373
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,799
Second Young Miss's interests are getting more and more interesting.

374
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,519
Don't you start with me.

375
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,409
Who knows if you might have told one of those wasps or bugs to kill for you.

376
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,979
I don't want to end up like Steward Wu, dying a mysterious death.

377
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,530
<i>How did she find out?</i>

378
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,290
In this case, searching my body doesn't seem enough.

379
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,010
How about...

380
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,780
I take off all my clothes so that you may be rest assured?

381
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,449
Go ahead. Not my loss.

382
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,669
We're husband and wife after all. I've already seen it all.

383
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,560
Go on.

384
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,139
You're not going to do it?

385
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,010
Shall I do it instead?

386
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,770
<i>When did she become so much smarter?</i>

387
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,140
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

388
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,000
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

389
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,860
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

390
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,350
<i>Grudge, hatred,</i>

391
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,970
<i>fear, remorse…</i>

392
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,730
<i>You're the one!</i>

393
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,340
<i>Help!</i>

394
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,820
<i>[East Capital Gate]</i>

395
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,790
<i>As expected, nowhere else has more nightmares</i>

396
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,870
<i>than this palace does.</i>

397
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:24,020
<i>With the aid of these nightmares, I can cultivate more nightmare blossoms.</i>

398
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,490
<i>The red string is up to your neck.</i>

399
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,350
<i>It seems you've had a miserable life.</i>

400
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,140
<i>Why don't you leave here with me?</i>

401
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,560
<i>I sense a unique scent outside of these palace walls.</i>

402
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,139
<i>It's not yet dawn anyway. I'll go take a look.</i>

403
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,490
<i>[Ye Mansion]</i>

404
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,560
<i>It's right here. It was worth the trip.</i>

405
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,240
<i>This scent is truly unique.</i>

406
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,470
It was mine, to begin with.

407
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,899
Your Highness, don't go.

408
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,460
<i>Little beauty, you're obviously a mortal, </i>

409
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,630
<i>but there's something demonic in you.</i>

410
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,490
<i>How very interesting.</i>

411
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,950
<i>What a fruitful night I got.</i>

412
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,570
<i>Why don't you come back with me, too?</i>

413
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,530
<i>With the nourishment of these miserable souls,</i>

414
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,280
<i>the nightmare blossoms will soon cover this mountain.</i>

415
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,300
<i>As long as they bloom all over the forest, </i>

416
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,670
<i>I can evolve from a demon to a devil!</i>

417
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,980
<i>[Ye Mansion]</i>

418
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,690
<i>A demon in the capital…</i>

419
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,780
<i>Steward Wu's violent death…</i>

420
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,620
<i>Do they have anything to do with Young Devil Lord?</i>

421
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,489
What are you looking at?

422
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,639
There better not be leftovers. Finish them.

423
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,380
Ye Xiwu, you're so capricious.

424
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,079
Yeah. Lately, I find myself enjoying watching people eat.

425
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,040
Is there a problem?

426
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,619
When this month ends and you don't put on three pounds, I'll give you a good beating!

427
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,760
<i>Her psychopathic ways are becoming more unpredictable.</i>

428
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,140
Miss! Miss!

429
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,089
- Bad news! Eldest Young Miss is missing!
- What?

430
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:22,719
She was perfectly fine last night, but she was suddenly gone this morning.

431
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:27,309
I'm afraid… it's t-t-that… demon His Lordship mentioned.

432
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,350
What should we do?

433
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,629
Calm down. Tell me in detail.

434
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,609
His Lordship sent for the Scholar of Ceremonies to exorcise demons in the mansion.

435
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:35,379
I hear Sixth Prince is here, too.

436
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,980
I'll go take a look.

437
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,489
<i>She's still interested in Xiao Lin.</i>

438
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:44,780
<i>Good. This way, no one will care about Steward Wu's death.</i>

439
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,710
Butler Liu, bring Jiahui back to have a good rest.

440
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,110
Yes.

441
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,370
Elder Brother, who's this guy?

442
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,079
He's the new Scholar of Ceremonies, Pang Yizhi.

443
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,259
I heard he's the direct disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect, and also the sect uncle of Sixth Prince.

444
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,990
Identifying devils and catching demons is his specialty.

445
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,109
Then, do you know who his master is?

446
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,080
I heard it's Immortal Qingxu from Mount Buzhao.

447
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,090
<i>Never heard of him.</i>

448
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,510
<i>Could he be Uncle Zhaoyou's great-grand master.</i>

449
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,879
No demon or devil can escape from his eyes.

450
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,990
He can identify one in an instant.

451
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,650
When he strikes, every demon and devil dies in his hands.

452
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,700
<i>Oh, no. He's a senior disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.</i>

453
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,659
<i>If he finds out Tantai Jin's evil bone and executes him, that would be bad.</i>

454
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,390
<i>What do I do?</i>

455
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,050
Scholar Pang, anything I can help you with?

456
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,760
Junior Martial Uncle, what's wrong with him?

457
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,819
- Scholar Pang, he…
- This young master...

458
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,280
has a charming face.

459
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
He's bound to be rich and famous.

460
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,510
When you're rich, don't forget me. Don't forget me, yeah?

461
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,990
Thank you for your blessing.

462
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,269
<i>The Xiaoyao Sect five hundred years ago must've been lenient with admissions.</i>

463
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,780
Scholar Pang, you've walked in circles for a while. Have you found anything?

464
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:53,510
General, for now I haven't seen anything yet, but everyone in your mansion should be fine.

465
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,120
Please allow me to cast an array in your mansion

466
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,869
to search for that demon's traces, and get Eldest Young Miss back.

467
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,900
Sure. Thank you, Scholar Pang.

468
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,110
You mean that well-cultivated demon took them to Mount Banzhen in the southern outskirts

469
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,170
and used these people...

470
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,670
to plant flowers?

471
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,159
<i>Yes. Ye Bingchang and Yingxin were both taken by that demon.</i>

472
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,509
<i>But it seems like that demon doesn't plan on killing these people yet.</i>

473
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:27,689
<i>Why don't we share these clues with them and have them rescue the kidnapped?</i>

474
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:29,410
Got it.

475
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,260
You go check what Ye Xiwu is doing.

476
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,030
<i>Ye Xiwu has been very perceptive lately.</i>

477
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,800
<i>She has suspected me of controlling animals.</i>

478
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,120
<i>If I tell her these, it's no different from pleading guilty.</i>

479
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,770
<i>Forget it. Why bother getting into trouble?</i>

480
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,479
<i>[Demon-Locking Array]</i>
Demon-Locking Array.

481
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,710
It's here.

482
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,320
Next step…

483
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,510
What's the next step again?

484
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,440
Where should this flag be planted?

485
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,950
The white flag corresponds to the metal element.

486
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,290
I've tried this spot. That one's wrong, too.

487
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,670
This doesn't make sense. It's not here.

488
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,510
<i>Will this poorly constructed array work?</i>

489
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,319
<i>Never mind. I'll do it myself.</i>

490
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,069
<i>Thankfully, Father forced me to learn how to draw spells for a few years.</i>

491
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:29,559
<i>Since I don't have any powers, I can use this for desperate times like now.</i>

492
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,399
<i>Scholar Pang, I'll borrow some of your incantation slips.</i>

493
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,689
<i>It's for the good of everybody. Surely you wouldn't mind.</i>

494
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,100
<i>The misery in the mortal world is indeed nightmare blossoms' best fertilizer.</i>

495
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,779
<i>Traveling thousands of miles from Barren Abyss was certainly worth it.</i>

496
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,150
<i>Aren't these two the ones I brought back just last night?</i>

497
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>Their nightmare blossoms have bloomed so quickly.</i>

498
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,279
<i>My judgment was right.</i>

499
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:36,909
<i>Let me see what's special about your experiences.</i>

500
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,700
<i>So you're a maid from Jing Kingdom.</i>

501
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>You followed a hostage prince to Sheng Kingdom.</i>

502
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,890
<i>Let go of me. Your Highness!</i>

503
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,090
<i>Let go of me!</i>

504
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,660
<i>Who is this?</i>

505
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,760
<i>There's someone with such a twisted fate?</i>

506
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,819
<i>He hasn't had a hint of warmth or a glimmer of light in his life.</i>

507
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,940
<i>If I plant a nightmare blossom with him, it'll definitely be the best of its kind.</i>

508
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,740
<i>It can surely help me become a devil.</i>

509
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,260
<i>[Order]</i>

510
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,879
<i>This demon-locking array is like guarding by a tree stump for a hare.</i>
<i>(Idiom, waiting for a windfall)</i>

511
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,369
<i>If the hare doesn't show up, he won't catch a thing in ten thousand years.</i>

512
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,820
Shoo!

513
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,340
Second Young Miss, are you all right?

514
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,519
I'm okay. I was just startled by this bird.

515
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:20,119
<i>I think if you don't tell them where the demon is, they won't find a trace till dawn.</i>

516
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:26,590
Who'd have thought Ye Xiwu who fears nothing and no one,

517
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,490
would be afraid of a bird?

518
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,579
Please keep a distance from her.

519
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,719
<i>Fine.</i>

520
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,070
<i>This woman is usually so vicious yet she somehow fears me.</i>

521
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,780
<i>Nighttime is the best time.</i>

522
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,210
<i>I smell it. Right there.</i>

523
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,910
<i>He's the one.</i>

524
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,390
<i>I've never smelled such a sweet scent.</i>

525
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,680
<i>He can definitely grow the most beautiful nightmare blossom.</i>

526
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,290
<i>Someone from Xiaoyao Sect is here.</i>

527
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,780
<i>I better be cautious.</i>

528
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,610
What was that?

529
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,319
The edict of the Heavenly Lord reveals all hidden evil.

530
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,590
Demon-Binding flag, purge all darkness!

531
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,930
Seize!

532
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,930
Sixth Prince, we caught it, didn't we?

533
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,430
Oh, no. This black fog was a smokescreen.

534
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,590
It was a distraction!

535
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,720
That's… Tantai Jin's chamber!

536
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,239
<i>[Ye Bingchang is in the southern outskirts on Mount Banzhen]</i>

537
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,640
<i>Now they can't tell who wrote it.</i>

538
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,070
<i>I have to think of a way to slip this note to Xiao Lin.</i>

539
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,110
<i>Let him play the hero.</i>

540
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,320
<i>I can't arouse Ye Xiwu's suspicion again.</i>

541
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,070
You're the one I've been looking for.

542
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,299
You will allow me to flourish the most beautiful nightmare blossom.

543
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,340
By the light and power of the mystic thunder, strike!

544
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,799
You've overestimated yourself.

545
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,319
Tantai Jin, hold on to me.

546
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:17,059
Ye Xiwu, are you a fool? You'll get yourself killed!

547
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,320
I can't let you die!

548
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,620
<i>What a pair of lovebirds.</i>

549
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,390
<i>Then you can come along.</i>

550
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,260
Second Young Miss!

551
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,980
I'm doomed.

552
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,070
She is General Ye's precious daughter.

553
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,840
He's going to rip my head off!

554
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,090
Sixth Prince, nothing must happen to Second Young Miss!

555
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,840
Second Young Miss was kidnapped by the demon.

556
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,290
<i>[Ye Bingchang is in the southern outskirts on Mount Banzhen]</i>

557
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,550
"Ye Bingchang is in the southern outskirts of Mount Banzhen."

558
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm going to save her.

559
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,940
Could this scribble be some kind of trap?

560
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,950
It's our last resort. I have to give it a try.

561
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,689
Bring the Secret Dragon Guards. Let's go.

562
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,110
Okay.

563
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,650
<i>What is this place?</i>

564
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,740
<i>Susu, that devil god came like a storm.</i>

565
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,359
<i>You must stay and guard the gate.</i>

566
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,759
<i>I'll help the sect leader.</i>

567
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:47,760
<i>What? Why is Senior Brother here?</i>

568
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,120
- <i>And why am…</i>
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

569
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,209
<i>Hengyang Sect's mantle must be passed down.</i>

570
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:53,960
<i>Hengyang Sect… But it's clearly…</i>

571
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,849
<i>Susu, wake up!</i>

572
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:58,460
- <i> clearly… </i>
- <i> Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon.</i>

573
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,730
<i>The devil god has awakened. You're about to fail.</i>

574
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,219
<i>Susu, wake up!</i>

575
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:04,890
<i> Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon. </i>
- <i> Susu, wake up!</i>

576
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,909
<i> Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon.</i>

577
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,080
<i>Father.</i>

578
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,920
- <i> Junior Sister, wake up!</i>
- <i> Junior Sister…</i>

579
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,710
<i> Devil God… Tantai Jin…</i>

580
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,060
<i>Dream demon…</i>

581
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,309
- <i> Junior Sister, wake up!</i>
- <i> Junior Sister…</i>

582
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,400
- <i> Junior Sister, wake up!</i>
- <i> Junior Sister…</i>

583
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,550
<i>Where is this place? The demon's den.</i>

584
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,210
<i>What was that dream I just had?</i>

585
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,899
Tantai Jin! Thank goodness, you're not dead!

586
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,999
Why are you still standing there?

587
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,100
Help me get down!

588
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,730
Nightmare blossoms.

589
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,830
It all makes sense now.

590
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,520
What's a nightmare blossom?

591
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,600
I've read about it in books.

592
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,149
The dream demon brings people to her den, then uses their dark memories or fear as seeds

593
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:32,140
that grow into vines and bind them in place.

594
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:42,350
Trapping them in endless nightmares flourishing the nightmare blossoms that she feeds on.

595
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,600
It's like raising livestock.

596
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,350
Ye Xiwu,

597
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,690
you've been reading?

598
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,249
Have you seen my elder sister?

599
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:02,700
She should be here, too.

600
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,370
Over there.

601
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,960
Let's go.

602
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,210
Here she is.

603
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,220
Yingxin?

604
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,350
Why is she also here?

605
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,540
How do you know her?

606
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,000
I saw her when I was in the palace.

607
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,960
You were investigating me?

608
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,330
No, I wasn't.

609
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,500
I was just…

610
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,959
Passing by a remote and cold palace, and saw a crazy woman.

611
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,249
So what if I investigated you?

612
00:48:11,249 --> 00:48:13,850
You're always being so mysterious.

613
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,370
Have you seen the demon?

614
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,870
The night's still young.

615
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,000
I guess she's still hunting.

616
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,379
She captured so many people. And she's got her own barrier.

617
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:35,169
She's quite a mighty one.

618
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:37,890
No wonder Pang Yizhi couldn't catch her.

619
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,650
The deeper you sleep, the tighter the vines will twine.

620
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,940
Tantai Jin, why weren't you bound?

621
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,770
Because I never dream.

622
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,420
Let's rescue them.

623
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,660
Be careful.

624
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,170
<i>This is the land of the Yiyue Tribe.</i>

625
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,100
<i>But we were just in the woods.</i>

626
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,910

627
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,970

628
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,390
