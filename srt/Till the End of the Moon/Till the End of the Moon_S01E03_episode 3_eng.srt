00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,439
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,379
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:39,019
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:47,219
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,800
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,179
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,159
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,579
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:19,119
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,159
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,100
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,119
   

15
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,019
   

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,100
   

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,129
He talks to birds?

18
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,290
Yeah. And flies and mosquitoes!

19
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,899
When he passed by the lake the other day, a toad was sitting on the shore, and they chatted for a while.

20
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,509
Mr. Tantai is so weird.

21
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,279
He can hold a conversation with a toad.

22
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,180
Is he talking to himself?

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,529
- The servants passing by the lake were all snickering at him. 
 -  Indeed. 

24
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,980
 You, stop being naughty! 

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,770
What is this nonsense?

26
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,199
Haven't I told you?

27
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:09,579
Forget about supervising him to find faults, your only job is to watch Tantai Jin.

28
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:15,489
If he does anything suspicious, especially if he is up to any tricks, report it right back.

29
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,419
Also, keep a close eye on him.

30
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,859
Don't let him freeze, starve, or get beaten up.

31
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:23,429
He's not allowed to leave Ye Mansion.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,909
His every movement is being watched.

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,779
It's utterly impossible for him to play any tricks.

34
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:32,769
He also talks to sparrows, butterflies, and whatnot.

35
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,929
Basically, he talks to all animals except humans.

36
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:43,910
Miss, do you think he can actually talk to animals?

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,090
You must've overworked yourself.

38
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,130
Why don't you take a few days off?

39
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,340
Miss, I really saw them talking!

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,030
Maybe it's because no one in this mansion ever talks to him.

41
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,529
Anyone would go crazy without someone to talk to all year round.

42
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:10,950
Now that I think about it, Mr. Tantai is quite pitiful.

43
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,719
 Could it be that he became a devil god because he was isolated for too long? 

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,309
 This won't do. I need to get information from him. 

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,830
Second Young Miss.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,629
You've followed me around for days.

47
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,130
Do you have something to say to me?

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,739
You guessed right.

49
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,409
I've been so bored lately. So I wanted to have someone to chat with.

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,460
Go ahead.

51
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,430
Nice weather today, huh?

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,700
It's freezing!

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,750
Tantai Jin.

54
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,600
Tantai Jin!

55
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,629
You're always getting bullied. How does that make you feel?

56
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,030
I don't.

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,329
No way.

58
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:45,330
Anyone who gets insulted would be angry or feel resentful.

59
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,600
Haven't you thought of doing something about it?

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,910
Like… killing me?

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,940
You want me to kill you?

62
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,189
No.

63
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,330
That's not what I meant.

64
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,740
I just wanted to know what you're thinking.

65
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,230
It doesn't matter what I think.

66
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,530
You all insult me not because of what I've done, but simply because you enjoy it.

67
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,190
I can't change all of you.

68
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,110
As for whether I hold resentment or grudges, none of it matters.

69
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,140
I'm just a hostage prince from Jing Kingdom.

70
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,550
To be alive is exhausting enough.

71
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,530
I don't have the energy to think about anything else.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,209
 This was five hundred years ago. 

73
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,410
 The young devil god truly hasn't done anything bad. 

74
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,529
 Or should I say, he hasn't had his chance yet. 

75
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,000
 Instead, others were the ones doing bad things to him. 

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,029
 Maybe he only became a devil god due to the series of tragedies. 

77
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,869
 If someone was willing to help him, to show him kindness, and cared about him 

78
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,630
 would he have fallen on this devilish path? 

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,720
Tantai Jin, life is indeed tough, but you still have to live on.

80
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,529
Come find me if you ever feel bored.

81
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,680
Not socializing for too long can turn you into a psychopath!

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,190
Like you?

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,579
You looked good when you smiled just now.

84
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,089
There're so many people in the mansion.

85
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,330
I'm sure someone would like you and want to talk to you.

86
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,600
No one will ever like me.

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,170
And I don't need to be liked.

88
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,259
Miss!

89
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,229
Miss, look!

90
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,129
I visited all the clothing stores in the captial and got some nice and thick winter clothes.

91
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,210
Pick one for Mr. Tantai.

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,330
This one's too thin.

93
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,579
This works.

94
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,800
The color looks good, too.

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,469
But it's too big. He can't wear this.

96
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,839
How am I supposed to know his size?

97
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,840
Go fetch me some sewing tools.

98
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,079
Miss, I'm not sure if I should ask you this…

99
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,440
Then don't.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,359
Why are you being so nice to Mr. Tantai now?

101
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,769
Because I'm afraid.

102
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,630
Afraid? Of what?

103
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,069
I'm afraid one day when Mr. Tantai freezes to death, he'll drag us along to hell.

104
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,150
And what if after all the constant ill-treatment, he finally snaps one day,

105
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:12,780
decides he's done being a punching bag, turns into a big tiger donned in a black robe, and eats us all!

106
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,330
Why would a big tiger be wearing a black robe?

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,520
   

108
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,370
This coat is for me?

109
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,789
A kept man who lives off a woman can actually afford a new coat?

110
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,070
Stop right there.

111
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,570
Tantai Jin? What is it?

112
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,950
You just slit my coat.

113
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,470
Slit?

114
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,220
Now that's a slit.

115
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,700
Are you getting mad?

116
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,169
Are you starting to have a temper because Second Sister hasn't beaten you lately?

117
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,339
How dare you glare at me?

118
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,620
Our Ye family has given you such a good life...

119
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,789
that you've gotten brash with your masters now?

120
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm going to beat you up right now!

121
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,490
Why are you getting violent?

122
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,020
Wait!  Why did you pull me away?

123
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,010
I just helped you slit that kept man's coat.

124
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,950
Look at him showing off.

125
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,940
Ye Zeyu, pay for it.

126
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,139
Hasn't Father taught you an eye for an eye, a coat for a coat?

127
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,430
What?

128
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,019
What's wrong with you, Xiwu?

129
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,339
You paying or not?

130
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,830
Don't make me go to Father.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,650
I'll pay.

132
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,260
Here!

133
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,000
What happened to your loyalty after falling in love?

134
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,219
Just ignore him.

135
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,709
This slit is too big to be patched.

136
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,149
You can't wear this anymore.

137
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,930
I'll get a new one.

138
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,769
You gave this to me.

139
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,870
It's mine now.

140
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,619
All right. You keep it.

141
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:35,120
I'll have Chuntao buy you a new one.

142
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,579
Miss! It's a royal edict!

143
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,880
Mr. Tantai is to have an audience with the king.

144
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,500
 This young devil god still has ties within the palace? 

145
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,499
 I must follow him to find out. 

146
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,970
 In case something fishy is going on. 

147
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,570
I'll come with you.

148
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,480
 Tantai Jin is here to meet His Majesty! 

149
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,210
Second Young Miss Ye, His Majesty will only meet Prince Tantai alone.

151
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,109
If you have nothing to do, how about having a chat with the Queen Dowager?

152
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:30,359
It's okay. I'm pretty familiar with the palace.

153
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,970
I'll just take a walk.

154
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,960
Sure.

155
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,860
 Devil Lord was raised in this palace. 

156
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,839
 What on earth did Tantai Jin go through? 

157
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,539
 How did he spend his youth? 

158
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,199
 Why choose him to become a devil god? 

159
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,079
 If I saw the place he lived in before, maybe I can find some clues. 

160
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,349
You there.

161
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,080
Second Young Miss Ye.

162
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,800
Do you know where Tantai Jin used to live?

163
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,299
Tantai Jin, here's a letter from the Jing Kingdom.

164
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,279
It was sent from the palace.

165
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,280
Do you want to read it?

166
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,390
No.

167
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:21,869
Any normal person would want to hear from his family. When you say no, it sounds like a lie.

168
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:27,979
For me, the Jing Kingdom is a thousand miles away, to which I shall never return.

169
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:34,480
Emperor Jing is someone I knew twenty years ago, whom I will never reunite with.

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,690
He is but a foreigner in a foreign land.

171
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,590
I don't care.

172
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,380
Nor do I need to care.

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Do you mean that?

174
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,439
Do you know the king of Jing Tantai Wuji is about to die of an illness?

175
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:56,399
Your elder brother Tantai Minglang has been made crown prince.

176
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,740
 I see. 

177
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,820
Noted.

178
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,379
Thank you, Your Majesty.

179
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,909
Tantai Minglang is an ambitious one.

180
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:16,289
He's been waging wars against us and never bothered to care about you, his younger brother's wellbeing.

181
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:23,579
Are you truly not afraid that I might cut your head off as a sacrifice?

182
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,090
Tantai Minglang and I are just strangers who share the same blood.

183
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,030
He wouldn't care if I lived or died.

184
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:47,980
If you were to behead me as a sacrifice, I'm afraid that may be exactly what he wishes.

185
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,679
He shows no mercy for you.

186
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,179
Have you never thought of going back to the Jing Kingdom and taking back all that belongs to you?

187
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,510
 I see he's trying to play me against my own brother. 

188
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,260
Your Majesty, I'd left my country over a decade ago.

189
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,240
I am but a wanderer.

190
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,960
The people of Jing Kingdom only acknowledge Tantai Minglang.

191
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,469
There's no place for me back there.

192
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,560
Besides, fate has a plan for us all.

193
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,510
The throne, the mortal land, I'll leave these for others to compete.

194
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,790
This is my fate.

195
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,880
To be able to live is enough for me.

196
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,540
It seems I was overconcerned.

197
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,550
You may leave.

198
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,379
This man has a heart of stone.

199
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,110
He baffles me every time I see him.

200
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,450
No wonder his old man does not care for him.

201
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,490
Since he refuses to work for me, he's useless now.

202
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,010
Have someone keep an eye on him.

203
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,080
He'll cause trouble as long as he's alive.

204
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,019
About what I mentioned before, get it done quickly.

205
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,609
Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,589
I've already made arrangements.

207
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,909
Do be careful. Find someone of similar appearance and age.

208
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,809
Don't make any mistakes.

209
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:32,980
When the time comes, I can weaken the Ye family and disrupt the Jing Kingdom as well.

210
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,400
Wise move, Your Majesty.

211
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,370
Second Young Miss, we've arrived.

212
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,359
This was where Prince Tantai had lived before being sent to the Ye family.

213
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,550
You guys want to harm His Highness!

214
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,630
You guys want to harm His Highness! They want to harm His Highness.

215
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,799
Ma'am, it's a cold day. Why are you on the ground?

216
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,590
Second Young Miss, this is Nanny Yingxin.

217
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,669
I heard she's the one who brought up Prince Tantai.

218
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,730
She followed His Highness here from the Jing Kingdom.

219
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,039
You want to harm His Highness!

220
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,280
You want to harm His Highness!

221
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,250
Do you mean Tantai Jin? Who wants to harm him?

222
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,130
I'd never cause him harm.

223
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,480
Your Highness, please hold on.

224
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,140
Steward Wu.

225
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,470
I haven't had the chance to congratulate you on your marriage.

226
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,740
Congratulations.

227
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,940
Steward Wu, let's drop the pleasantries.

228
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,709
I heard that although you married Miss Ye Xiwu, the one you love is Miss Bingchang.

229
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:19,979
As we all know, Miss Bingchang and our Prince Lin have reciprocated feelings for each other.

230
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:24,659
And General Ye has long regarded him as his son-in-law.

231
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,779
Since you're now at the Ye Mansion, this is rather convenient.

232
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,040
Could you keep an eye out for me?

233
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,310
What do you mean?

234
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,330
For proof of their collusion, of course!

235
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,920
Collusion?

236
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,820
You want me to help you frame Xiao Lin and Ye Xiao?

237
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,319
What a poor choice of words.

238
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,109
I'm His Majesty's close attendant.

239
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,149
Certainly, I should share his worries.

240
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,019
If you're willing to help, not only can I guarantee you'll live long,

241
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,870
but I may also help you marry your one true love.

242
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,089
 In this vast capital, Xiao Lin is the only one who has been sincere to me. 

243
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,850
 We're not close enough to meddle in each other's affairs,  

244
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,870
 but there's no reason for me to harm him. 

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,139
I'm afraid I won't be able to help you do that.

246
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,099
Don't ask for the hard way.

247
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,870
Don't forget what happened to Yue Yingxin.

248
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,090
How did she become like this?

249
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,419
This cold palace has few visitors all year round.

250
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,379
We don't know when she went crazy either.

251
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:36,329
I just heard that she's been like this ever since Prince Tantai left for Ye Mansion.

252
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:39,590
I didn't harm His Highness. I didn't harm His Highness.

253
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,680
It's not me. No. I didn't harm His Highness.

254
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,690
I didn't harm His Highness.

255
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,939
Don't you forget where you are right now.

256
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,040
Don't forget I'm in control of her fate.

257
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,869
It's up to me whether she lives or dies.

258
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:03,210
Don't think you can live in peace by being a docile son-in-law with no say in the Ye family.

259
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,860
I'll kill Yingxin if you don't comply.

260
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,319
But I won't let her die so quickly.

261
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,240
I thought you were just Xiao Liang's loyal dog.

262
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,520
I didn't expect you to be a talkative one, too.

263
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,940
Tantai Jin, you…

264
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
His Highness is summoning you.

265
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,840
I'll be right there.

266
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,810
Hostage Prince Tantai, as for what I just said…

267
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,200
Steward Wu, you were just catching up with me.

268
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,479
You're getting better at this, huh?

269
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,600
All right, listen.

270
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,249
If you dare tell anyone else about what I said, I will make you regret being born.

271
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,040
A lowly son of a lowly mother!

272
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,390
 That Steward Wu talks too much. 

273
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,320
That Tantai Jin thinks too highly of himself!

274
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,950
Godfather, don't let anger consume your health.

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,969
About the one you told me to find, I've got him.

276
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:31,010
It'll surely be enough to fool those of the Jing Kingdom.

277
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,760
No. I just shared too many secrets with him.

278
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,799
If he is of no use to me, I can't let him live any longer!

279
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,729
Tantai Jin must be killed tonight!

280
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,690
If he won't listen, replace him with someone who will!

281
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,490
Godfather! Godfather!

282
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,900
Godfather!

283
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,560
He's dead!

284
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,340
He's dead!

285
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,330
Lin'er, you said you had something important to discuss.

286
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,040
What is it?

287
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,329
Royal Father, many civilians of late have gone missing in their sleep.

288
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,990
I suspect a demon has entered the capital.

289
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,109
I sent Chen Xian to lead the Secret Dragon Guards

290
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,029
to investigate the missing civilians as soon as I heard the report.

291
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,299
I've arranged day-and-night patrols in and out of the capital to look out for the demon.

292
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,339
Royal Father, please be careful in the palace too, in case the demon causes trouble.

293
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:39,669
Of all the princes and nobles we sent to Mount Buzhao, you're the most promising one.

294
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,419
You excelled the fastest in your cultivation.

295
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,109
You've made great progress in just three years.

296
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:51,519
But faced with demons like this, I'm afraid success isn't guaranteed with just three years of cultivation.

297
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,729
Sorry to let you down.

298
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,450
It's fine.

299
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,790
I happen to have someone who can be of use to you.

300
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,390
Sixth Prince, we meet again.

301
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,140
Junior Martial Uncle!

302
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,110
So, Master sent you here?

303
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,829
My senior brother said the opportunity of my lifetime would be in the capital.

304
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,720
He told me to spend a few years here before returning.

305
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,769
What opportunity is that?

306
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,419
Well, I don't have a clue.

307
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,009
But at least I can help while I'm here.

308
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,279
The Barren Abyss Barrier has weakened recently,

309
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,839
and demons are slipping through, wreaking havoc in the mortal world.

310
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,979
You also know that our Xiaoyao Sect loves minding irrelevant things like this.

311
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,689
This is not irrelevant.

312
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,769
It's a big deal concerning people's lives.

313
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:47,029
Since Royal Father appointed you as Scholar of the Ministry of Ceremonies, as an official, you ought to protect your people.

314
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,919
Now that we are under attack by demons, please help me subdue them right away.

315
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
Look how the tables have turned.

316
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,319
Back in Mount Buzhao, I was your Martial Uncle.

317
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,890
Now that I'm in the Sheng Kingdom, I've become your subordinate!

318
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,189
But the salary of a Sheng official is simply too low.

319
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:08,019
I can't even feed my own mouth. Let alone, my family members.

320
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,000
Junior Martial Uncle, you're adopting cats again.

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,650
You know me best.

322
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,770
 Young Devil Lord had a hard life in the palace,  

323
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,320
 that's why he's so pessimistic and hopeless. 

324
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,239
 The evil bone feeds on hatred and pain to accumulate strength. 

325
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,080
 That's why Tantai Jin suffered so much. 

326
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,870
 Is this the fate of a devil god? 

327
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,910
Little one.

328
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,789
It's late. Why are you out on this windy night?

329
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,949
Aren't you cold?

330
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,050
Father, why are you home so late?

331
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,870
You have worked hard.

332
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,600
You have learned to worry about me?

333
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,860
You've really grown up.

334
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,390
By the way, if you have nothing important to do, don't hang around outside.

335
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,299
- Why? 
 - The capital isn't safe.

336
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,750
Some civilians have disappeared in their sleep.

337
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,689
It seems it's a demon's doing.

338
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,769
And another strange thing happened in the palace.

339
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,050
His Majesty's loyal advisor Steward Wu had an accident.

340
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,109
He chatted a little with Tantai Jin and died soon after going back.

341
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,289
His ear canal was bleeding.

342
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,179
The way he died was bizarre.

343
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,670
A wasp even crawled out of his ear.

344
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,130
 - A wasp? 
 - He talks to birds? 

345
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,399
 Yeah, and flies and mosquitoes. They chatted for a while. 

346
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,049
I won't say more, in case my darling daughter becomes too frightened to sleep.

347
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,910
Go to bed.

348
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,390
Miss, are there really demons in this world?

349
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,010
Not only demons, but also devils.

350
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:21,570
 Even when I left the palace and hid in Ye Mansion, they still wouldn't let me go. 

351
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,820
 I must find a way to get out of Sheng Kingdom. 

352
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,170
 Steward Wu, you've lived long enough. 

353
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,100
 Go. 

354
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,549
 With my current abilities, controlling a couple of small creatures is the best I can do. 

355
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,460
 I barely got out of danger this time. 

356
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,050
 Next time, might be more challenging. 

357
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,580
 How do I know if he has awakened? 

358
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,349
 Young Devil Lord doesn't have much power now. 

359
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,479
 If it was him who did it, he must have used a curse or a charm. 

360
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,240
 If you murdered someone, you'll definitely leave traces behind. 

361
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,630
Second Young Miss?

362
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,600
 There's nothing on him. 

363
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,779
What are you dissatisfied with, Second Young Miss?

364
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,270
 I'll just have to trick it out of him. 

365
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,589
Steward Wu from the palace suddenly died today.

366
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,480
Did you know that?

367
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,669
I heard that he stopped you before you left the palace.

368
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,820
What did he say to you?

369
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,530
Nothing.

370
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,999
 So calm. 

371
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,010
 Is he really innocent? 

372
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,100
From today on, I'm going to search you before you go to bed.

373
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,079
I'm warning you!  Don't even think about playing tricks on me.

374
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,799
Second Young Miss's interests are getting more and more interesting.

375
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,519
Don't you start with me.

376
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,409
Who knows if you might have told one of those wasps or bugs to kill for you.

377
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,979
I don't want to end up like Steward Wu, dying a mysterious death.

378
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,530
 How did she find out? 

379
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,290
In this case, searching my body doesn't seem enough.

380
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,010
How about...

381
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,780
I take off all my clothes so that you may be rest assured?

382
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,449
Go ahead. Not my loss.

383
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,669
We're husband and wife after all. I've already seen it all.

384
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,560
Go on.

385
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,139
You're not going to do it?

386
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,010
Shall I do it instead?

387
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,770
 When did she become so much smarter? 

388
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,140
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

389
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,000
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

390
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,860
Be wary of your candles during this hot summer!

391
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,350
 Grudge, hatred, 

392
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,970
 fear, remorse… 

393
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,730
 You're the one! 

394
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,340
 Help! 

395
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,820
   

396
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,790
 As expected, nowhere else has more nightmares 

397
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,870
 than this palace does. 

398
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:24,020
 With the aid of these nightmares, I can cultivate more nightmare blossoms. 

399
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,490
 The red string is up to your neck. 

400
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,350
 It seems you've had a miserable life. 

401
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,140
 Why don't you leave here with me? 

402
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 I sense a unique scent outside of these palace walls. 

403
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,139
 It's not yet dawn anyway. I'll go take a look. 

404
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,490
   

405
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,560
 It's right here. It was worth the trip. 

406
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,240
 This scent is truly unique. 

407
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,470
It was mine, to begin with.

408
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,899
Your Highness, don't go.

409
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,460
 Little beauty, you're obviously a mortal,  

410
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,630
 but there's something demonic in you. 

411
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,490
 How very interesting. 

412
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,950
 What a fruitful night I got. 

413
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,570
 Why don't you come back with me, too? 

414
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,530
 With the nourishment of these miserable souls, 

415
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,280
 the nightmare blossoms will soon cover this mountain. 

416
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,300
 As long as they bloom all over the forest,  

417
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,670
 I can evolve from a demon to a devil! 

418
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,980
   

419
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,690
 A demon in the capital… 

420
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,780
 Steward Wu's violent death… 

421
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,620
 Do they have anything to do with Young Devil Lord? 

422
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,489
What are you looking at?

423
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,639
There better not be leftovers. Finish them.

424
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,380
Ye Xiwu, you're so capricious.

425
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,079
Yeah. Lately, I find myself enjoying watching people eat.

426
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,040
Is there a problem?

427
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,619
When this month ends and you don't put on three pounds, I'll give you a good beating!

428
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,760
 Her psychopathic ways are becoming more unpredictable. 

429
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,140
Miss! Miss!

430
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,089
- Bad news! Eldest Young Miss is missing! 
 - What?

431
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:22,719
She was perfectly fine last night, but she was suddenly gone this morning.

432
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:27,309
I'm afraid… it's t-t-that… demon His Lordship mentioned.

433
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,350
What should we do?

434
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,629
Calm down. Tell me in detail.

435
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,609
His Lordship sent for the Scholar of Ceremonies to exorcise demons in the mansion.

436
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:35,379
I hear Sixth Prince is here, too.

437
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,980
I'll go take a look.

438
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,489
 She's still interested in Xiao Lin. 

439
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:44,780
 Good. This way, no one will care about Steward Wu's death. 

440
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,710
Butler Liu, bring Jiahui back to have a good rest.

441
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,110
Yes.

442
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,370
Elder Brother, who's this guy?

443
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,079
He's the new Scholar of Ceremonies, Pang Yizhi.

444
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,259
I heard he's the direct disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect, and also the sect uncle of Sixth Prince.

445
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,990
Identifying devils and catching demons is his specialty.

446
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,109
Then, do you know who his master is?

447
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,080
I heard it's Immortal Qingxu from Mount Buzhao.

448
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,090
 Never heard of him. 

449
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,510
 Could he be Uncle Zhaoyou's great-grand master. 

450
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,879
No demon or devil can escape from his eyes.

451
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,990
He can identify one in an instant.

452
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,650
When he strikes, every demon and devil dies in his hands.

453
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,700
 Oh, no. He's a senior disciple of Xiaoyao Sect. 

454
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,659
 If he finds out Tantai Jin's evil bone and executes him, that would be bad. 

455
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,390
 What do I do? 

456
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,050
Scholar Pang, anything I can help you with?

457
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,760
Junior Martial Uncle, what's wrong with him?

458
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,819
- Scholar Pang, he… 
 - This young master...

459
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,280
has a charming face.

460
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
He's bound to be rich and famous.

461
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,510
When you're rich, don't forget me. Don't forget me, yeah?

462
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,990
Thank you for your blessing.

463
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,269
 The Xiaoyao Sect five hundred years ago must've been lenient with admissions. 

464
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,780
Scholar Pang, you've walked in circles for a while. Have you found anything?

465
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:53,510
General, for now I haven't seen anything yet, but everyone in your mansion should be fine.

466
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,120
Please allow me to cast an array in your mansion

467
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,869
to search for that demon's traces, and get Eldest Young Miss back.

468
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,900
Sure. Thank you, Scholar Pang.

469
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,110
You mean that well-cultivated demon took them to Mount Banzhen in the southern outskirts

470
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,170
and used these people...

471
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,670
to plant flowers?

472
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,159
 Yes. Ye Bingchang and Yingxin were both taken by that demon. 

473
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,509
 But it seems like that demon doesn't plan on killing these people yet. 

474
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:27,689
 Why don't we share these clues with them and have them rescue the kidnapped? 

475
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:29,410
Got it.

476
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,260
You go check what Ye Xiwu is doing.

477
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,030
 Ye Xiwu has been very perceptive lately. 

478
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,800
 She has suspected me of controlling animals. 

479
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,120
 If I tell her these, it's no different from pleading guilty. 

480
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,770
 Forget it. Why bother getting into trouble? 

481
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,479
    
 Demon-Locking Array.

482
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,710
It's here.

483
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,320
Next step…

484
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,510
What's the next step again?

485
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,440
Where should this flag be planted?

486
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,950
The white flag corresponds to the metal element.

487
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,290
I've tried this spot. That one's wrong, too.

488
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,670
This doesn't make sense. It's not here.

489
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,510
 Will this poorly constructed array work? 

490
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,319
 Never mind. I'll do it myself. 

491
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,069
 Thankfully, Father forced me to learn how to draw spells for a few years. 

492
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:29,559
 Since I don't have any powers, I can use this for desperate times like now. 

493
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,399
 Scholar Pang, I'll borrow some of your incantation slips. 

494
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,689
 It's for the good of everybody. Surely you wouldn't mind. 

495
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,100
 The misery in the mortal world is indeed nightmare blossoms' best fertilizer. 

496
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,779
 Traveling thousands of miles from Barren Abyss was certainly worth it. 

497
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,150
 Aren't these two the ones I brought back just last night? 

498
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,880
 Their nightmare blossoms have bloomed so quickly. 

499
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,279
 My judgment was right. 

500
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:36,909
 Let me see what's special about your experiences. 

501
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,700
 So you're a maid from Jing Kingdom. 

502
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,200
 You followed a hostage prince to Sheng Kingdom. 

503
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,890
 Let go of me. Your Highness! 

504
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,090
 Let go of me! 

505
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,660
 Who is this? 

506
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,760
 There's someone with such a twisted fate? 

507
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,819
 He hasn't had a hint of warmth or a glimmer of light in his life. 

508
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,940
 If I plant a nightmare blossom with him, it'll definitely be the best of its kind. 

509
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,740
 It can surely help me become a devil. 

510
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,260
   

511
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,879
 This demon-locking array is like guarding by a tree stump for a hare.  
  (Idiom, waiting for a windfall) 

512
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,369
 If the hare doesn't show up, he won't catch a thing in ten thousand years. 

513
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,820
Shoo!

514
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,340
Second Young Miss, are you all right?

515
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,519
I'm okay. I was just startled by this bird.

516
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:20,119
 I think if you don't tell them where the demon is, they won't find a trace till dawn. 

517
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:26,590
Who'd have thought Ye Xiwu who fears nothing and no one,

518
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,490
would be afraid of a bird?

519
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,579
Please keep a distance from her.

520
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,719
 Fine. 

521
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,070
 This woman is usually so vicious yet she somehow fears me. 

522
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,780
 Nighttime is the best time. 

523
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,210
 I smell it. Right there. 

524
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,910
 He's the one. 

525
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,390
 I've never smelled such a sweet scent. 

526
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,680
 He can definitely grow the most beautiful nightmare blossom. 

527
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,290
 Someone from Xiaoyao Sect is here. 

528
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,780
 I better be cautious. 

529
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,610
What was that?

530
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,319
The edict of the Heavenly Lord reveals all hidden evil.

531
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,590
Demon-Binding flag, purge all darkness!

532
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,930
Seize!

533
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,930
Sixth Prince, we caught it, didn't we?

534
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,430
Oh, no. This black fog was a smokescreen.

535
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,590
It was a distraction!

536
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,720
That's… Tantai Jin's chamber!

537
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,239
   

538
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,640
 Now they can't tell who wrote it. 

539
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,070
 I have to think of a way to slip this note to Xiao Lin. 

540
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,110
 Let him play the hero. 

541
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,320
 I can't arouse Ye Xiwu's suspicion again. 

542
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,070
You're the one I've been looking for.

543
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,299
You will allow me to flourish the most beautiful nightmare blossom.

544
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,340
By the light and power of the mystic thunder, strike!

545
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,799
You've overestimated yourself.

546
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,319
Tantai Jin, hold on to me.

547
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:17,059
Ye Xiwu, are you a fool? You'll get yourself killed!

548
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,320
I can't let you die!

549
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,620
 What a pair of lovebirds. 

550
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,390
 Then you can come along. 

551
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,260
Second Young Miss!

552
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,980
I'm doomed.

553
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,070
She is General Ye's precious daughter.

554
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,840
He's going to rip my head off!

555
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,090
Sixth Prince, nothing must happen to Second Young Miss!

556
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,840
Second Young Miss was kidnapped by the demon.

557
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,290
   

558
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,550
"Ye Bingchang is in the southern outskirts of Mount Banzhen."

559
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm going to save her.

560
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,940
Could this scribble be some kind of trap?

561
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,950
It's our last resort. I have to give it a try.

562
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,689
Bring the Secret Dragon Guards. Let's go.

563
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,110
Okay.

564
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,650
 What is this place? 

565
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,740
 Susu, that devil god came like a storm. 

566
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,359
 You must stay and guard the gate. 

567
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,759
 I'll help the sect leader. 

568
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:47,760
 What? Why is Senior Brother here? 

569
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,120
-  And why am…  
 -   Listen to me. 

570
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,209
 Hengyang Sect's mantle must be passed down. 

571
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:53,960
 Hengyang Sect… But it's clearly… 

572
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,849
 Susu, wake up! 

573
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:58,460
-   clearly…   
 -   Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon. 

574
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,730
 The devil god has awakened. You're about to fail. 

575
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,219
 Susu, wake up! 

576
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:04,890
  Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon.   
 -   Susu, wake up! 

577
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,909
  Tantai Jin has been killed by the dream demon. 

578
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,080
 Father. 

579
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,920
-   Junior Sister, wake up!  
 -   Junior Sister… 

580
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,710
  Devil God… Tantai Jin… 

581
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,060
 Dream demon… 

582
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,309
-   Junior Sister, wake up!  
 -   Junior Sister… 

583
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,400
-   Junior Sister, wake up!  
 -   Junior Sister… 

584
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,550
 Where is this place? The demon's den. 

585
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,210
 What was that dream I just had? 

586
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,899
Tantai Jin!  Thank goodness, you're not dead!

587
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,999
Why are you still standing there?

588
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,100
Help me get down!

589
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,730
Nightmare blossoms.

590
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,830
It all makes sense now.

591
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,520
What's a nightmare blossom?

592
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,600
I've read about it in books.

593
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,149
The dream demon brings people to her den, then uses their dark memories or fear as seeds

594
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:32,140
that grow into vines and bind them in place.

595
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:42,350
Trapping them in endless nightmares flourishing the nightmare blossoms that she feeds on.

596
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,600
It's like raising livestock.

597
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,350
Ye Xiwu,

598
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,690
you've been reading?

599
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,249
Have you seen my elder sister?

600
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:02,700
She should be here, too.

601
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,370
Over there.

602
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,960
Let's go.

603
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,210
Here she is.

604
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,220
Yingxin?

605
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,350
Why is she also here?

606
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,540
How do you know her?

607
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,000
I saw her when I was in the palace.

608
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,960
You were investigating me?

609
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,330
No, I wasn't.

610
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,500
I was just…

611
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,959
Passing by a remote and cold palace, and saw a crazy woman.

612
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,249
So what if I investigated you?

613
00:48:11,249 --> 00:48:13,850
You're always being so mysterious.

614
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,370
Have you seen the demon?

615
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,870
The night's still young.

616
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,000
I guess she's still hunting.

617
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,379
She captured so many people. And she's got her own barrier.

618
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:35,169
She's quite a mighty one.

619
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:37,890
No wonder Pang Yizhi couldn't catch her.

620
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,650
The deeper you sleep, the tighter the vines will twine.

621
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,940
Tantai Jin, why weren't you bound?

622
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,770
Because I never dream.

623
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,420
Let's rescue them.

624
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,660
Be careful.

625
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,170
 This is the land of the Yiyue Tribe. 

626
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,100
 But we were just in the woods. 

627
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,910
 This… 

628
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,970
 This isn't reality. 

629
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,390
 Tantai Jin? 

630
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,779
Greetings from Yingxin, Princess.

631
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:13,620
♫   My empty heart has nothing to yearn for   ♫

632
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,880
I see. Thanks for telling me.

633
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,910
But I'm the princess of Yiyue Tribe.

634
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,410
For the tribe, I have to go.

635
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,070
