3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,120
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,200
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,300
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,560
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,020
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,250
♫  My existence  ♫

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,020
   

16
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,850
Lianhua, please properly store these flowers for me.

17
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,920
Lord Immortal, where are these flowers from?

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,490
Where else can they be from?

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,940
They are from the garden of God of Wood.

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,460
Lord Immortal, you just stole her flowers.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,410
There are countless flowers in her garden.

22
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,810
I only clipped a few tiny branches just for the sake of the scent.

23
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,400
Take them back and put them in the jade vase.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,430
Remember to change the water every day.

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,650
I… I dropped them.

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
You little brat.

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,260
You've been absent-minded and careless in your cultivation every day.

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,980
Now you've lost my flowers.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,930
If this goes on, how can you become an immortal?

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,180
Lord Immortal, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,710
Show me your hand.

32
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,760
I have to teach you a lesson today.

33
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,860
Go. Find my camellias back.

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,700
If you can't find them, don't ever come back.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,380
Do you understand?

36
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,913
Yes.

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,100
Just go.

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,740
 The gods and devils will eventually have a war. 

39
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,310
 I can't see through the causes and effects. 

40
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,520
 You're bound to have a worldly relationship with these camellias. 

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,270
Lianhua, go cultivate and hide in the mortal world.

42
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,190
You've just gotten happily married.

43
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,721
Why are you willing to leave your beautiful wife and go out?

44
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:39,260
Today, the twelve gods gathered to discuss the solution to eliminate the devils.

45
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,210
I can't be absent.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,980
You're no fun at all.

47
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,410
My jokes don't work on you.

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,943
So boring.

49
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,720
Chuhuang, you came so early.

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,260
I'm just getting some air, in case when you guys arrive later, you'll nag me to sleep.

51
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,960
Mingye suddenly got married at such a young age.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
So many female immortals are crying their eyes out.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,460
If I had not known that you were the most decent man there is,

54
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,480
I'd have thought you had an affair in the Mo River.

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,190
Even you're making fun of me.

56
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,520
No need to explain.

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,700
We all know how it is.

58
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,340
The only problem is how are you going to treat Goddess Tian Huan?

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,170
I've no personal feelings for Tian Huan.

60
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,170
She used to be my subordinate, and she will remain so.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,390
It's good if you know that.

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,800
Now you've married this clam spirit princess.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,740
Although you're of two races, you can't give her the cold shoulder.

64
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,403
I understand.

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,460
My eyes can glimpse at one's past and future lives.

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,470
How about I take a look for you? See how this marriage goes?

67
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,330
Little Jize, quit showing off your abilities.

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,480
Even though we're all gods, our marriages are determined by our own actions.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,510
The ignorant have no worries.

70
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,310
Just let him live his own life.

71
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,770
Everyone's here.

72
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,520
Let's go.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,050
   

74
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,970
   

75
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,770
Without my divine essence, a large part of my shooting ability is lost too.

76
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,923
Watch out!

77
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,040
Who's up there?

78
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,293
It's me.

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,133
You…

80
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,780
What are you doing up there?

81
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,280
I saw that these fruits were nice and no one was here to pick them.

82
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
So I wanted to eat some to quench my thirst.

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,773
Are…

84
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,630
Are they edible?

85
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,650
Aren't these your fruit trees?

86
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,550
You haven't tried them before?

87
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,233
I…

88
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,260
The immortal trees have been growing in Shangqing for 10,000 years.

89
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,020
They were always on their own.

90
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,940
No one has ever picked their fruits.

91
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,473
 My goodness. 

92
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,940
 Don't tell me these fruits are expensive. 

93
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,390
 I've eaten a lot of them. 

94
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,023
But you…

95
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,140
Why do you eat everything you see?

96
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,170
What if they were poisonous?

97
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,193
No, they're not.

98
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,630
I won't pick them anymore.

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,330
Why don't you try one?

100
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,823
I…

101
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,530
Just try one. It's super sweet.

102
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,430
I'm going back to my room.

103
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,690
   

104
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,263
Morning!

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,120
They do taste good.

106
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,613
Thank you.

107
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,280
   

108
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,570
You're so awesome, Madam!

109
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,950
 My arm hurts so much. 

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,280
Be level with the arrow.

111
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,300
Raise your arm a little. This may save you a little strength.

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,200
What do you mean?

113
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,150
Draw the bow one more time.

114
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,230
♫   When your gaze comes a little closer   ♫

115
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,730
♫    My heart beats faster taking root in the void  ♫

116
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,880
♫    The stars scattered in the sky quietly fall on your brow  ♫

117
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,720
 Raise your arm high. 

118
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,480
What did you say?

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,800
♫   Using the Milky Way as a pillow, the moonlight as a kiss   ♫

120
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,970
♫    I want to enter your dreams to explore the spring in your eyes  ♫

121
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,220
♫   We are devoutly turning the gears of fate; spending a lifetime just to see one person   ♫

122
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,200
♫   From the first glance to being immersed in passion,  I carefully trace the lines of your palm   ♫

123
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
♫   We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts   ♫

124
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,840
Nothing. I'm leaving now.

125
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,320
♫   Wishing to see only one person in this lifetime   ♫

126
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,090
♫   Only hoping to be moved; Not afraid to call each other's name    ♫

127
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,150
♫   The traces of my innermost feelings, don't ask if they are worth it   ♫

128
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,960
♫   Just believe that it's the right time   ♫

129
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,040
I didn't say anything.

130
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,370
Why was he being shy?

131
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,330
 This bow works better. 

132
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,270
 Mingye, I like the bow you gave me. 

133
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,240
 A gift for a gift. 

134
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,970
 I'll take you to see something interesting. 

135
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,970
 See you soon. 

136
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,470
The shooting stars here are so beautiful!

137
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,720
When I was in Mo River, I used to look up to the sky.

138
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
That's where the most beautiful stars are.

139
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,920
I love this.

140
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,060
I wonder if you love this or not?

141
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,953
What?

142
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,730
Something's not right!

143
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,910
What do you mean?

144
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,300
Normally, Mingye will spend 24 hours in the military camp.

145
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,490
He's ready for battle all year round.

146
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,610
But these days, he keeps heading home.

147
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,380
Aren't all married men like this?

148
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,873
This won't do.

149
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm going to see what kind of beauty this little clam spirit is.

150
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,870
She was able to make Mingye's iron tree blossom. 
  (Someone with no feelings to have romantic feelings) 

151
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,670
What are you going to do?

152
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,840
Let's go. We haven't been to Yuqing Palace in a while.

153
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,140
Let's ask for a cup of tea from Mingye.

154
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,730
If anyone didn't know you, they'd take you as a thief!

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,840
Good heavens!

156
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,670
Is this still the Mingye I know?

157
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,020
Do my eyes serve me right?

158
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,080
This move may not only hurt your fellow soldiers,

159
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,700
it will also leave you defenseless, and give your enemies chances to hurt you.

160
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,840
Then let me try again.

161
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,673
Try again.

162
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,460
Raise your arm.

163
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,240
Do you see?

164
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,170
Look at the sword, not me.

165
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,640
Exchange moves with me.

166
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,023
Okay.

167
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,060
I obviously saw this sword going in that direction.

168
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,460
Why is it here?

169
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,850
Goddess Chuhuang, why have you learned Jize's bad habits?

170
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,840
Coming without an appointment.

171
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,730
Because you're hiding your wife from us.

172
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,720
If I notified you in advance, would I have been able to see this harmonious scene?

173
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,900
You scared me.

174
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,630
Your little wife is impressive.

175
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,080
One single move and my face was nearly ruined.

176
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't control my move.

177
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
It's not Sang Jiu's fault.

178
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,360
Your remarks were just sour grapes.

179
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,540
Sorry.

180
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,770
I was being careless.

181
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,650
Lord Immortal, are you all right?

182
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,500
Did I scare you just now?

183
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,320
I didn't expect that we would be connected in a way.

184
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,350
Jize, what do you mean?

185
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,550
You'll understand when the time comes.

186
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,780
It's just that you and she both know, but Mingye and Sang Jiu don't.

187
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,930
What do you mean?

188
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,400
Sang Jiu, my little friend.

189
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,720
I visited you on a whim. I didn't bring you any gift.

190
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,020
How about I give you four words?

191
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,740
Remember why you came.

192
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,780
I guess it's something not for us to know.

193
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,550
Miss Sang Jiu, you don't need to ask in detail.

194
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,400
You just need to remember what Lord Immortal Jize said.

195
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,260
It'll be useful someday.

196
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,280
You're Jize, the God of Time?

197
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,340
That's me.

198
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,110
This is Chuhuang, the Goddess of the Universe.

199
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,480
No wonder.

200
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,170
Just now this sword obviously flew forward, but it fell by my side.

201
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,520
So it's due to your divine power.

202
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,130
Miss Sang Jiu, I don't know why, but I get a sense of intimacy when I see you.

203
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,880
I didn't bring any gift for a sudden visit.

204
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,260
Shall I give you a wisp of divine power?

205
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,633
What's this?

206
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,070
It can connect you and Mingye.

207
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,780
As long as you wish, you may see him across time and space.

208
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,640
But you can only use it once.

209
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,113
Thanks.

210
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,920
It turns out that you're here to send gifts.

211
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,880
Aren't we here for the tea?

212
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,160
Let's go to the tea room.

213
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,880
Since Lord Tian Hao fell and you took over his palace,

214
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,200
I've never come here once.

215
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,490
Speaking of which, how's Goddess Tian Huan?

216
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,960
She's already recovered, but she hasn't awakened yet.

217
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,740
A'Jiu, what happened?

218
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,803
Brother, why am I like this?

219
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:17,923
A'Jiu, your demonic energy has started to devour you.

220
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,480
I was a demon, to begin with.

221
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
How can I be devoured by demonic energy?

222
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,110
You used to have divine essence.

223
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,790
You practiced immortal arts since young.

224
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,070
Your core and meridians were the same as immortals'.

225
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,730
Now that your divine essence is lost, your demonic nature is back after some time.

226
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,070
Foul energy grows inside you.

227
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,980
It's like feeding meat to a rabbit and feeding grass to a tiger.

228
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,950
If you don't deal with it carefully,

229
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,150
I'm afraid you may lose your sanity and turn into a devil.

230
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,310
Then what should I do?

231
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,750
You've been married into Shangqing for over a hundred days.

232
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,650
Did Mingye…

233
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,140
He never tried dual-cultivation with you, right?

234
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,930
No need to lie to me.

235
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,140
If he's willing to do that, he'll be able to neutralize your foul energy with his pure energy.

236
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,180
That way, not only will you not be devoured, you'll be able to maintain your immortal body.

237
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,070
And you can advance your cultivation level.

238
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,750
Back when father insisted that you be married there, he did that partly for this reason.

239
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,440
What?

240
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,310
Did that flood dragon treat you badly?

241
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,260
No.

242
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,880
Mingye is a good person.

243
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,450
A good person?

244
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,920
He left you alone for so long.

245
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,360
What's good about this husband?

246
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,000
A'Jiu, come back.

247
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,920
Father and I will find a way to suppress your demonic energy.

248
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,520
No, I can't go back yet.

249
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,170
You mustn't tell Father about this. You'll make him worry for nothing.

250
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,490
Where are you going?

251
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:58,960
Since you are too shy about it, as your brother, I should naturally visit my new brother-in-law.

252
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,510
I'll ask him properly why he treats you like this.

253
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,440
Why are you so unreasonable?

254
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,410
Since I didn't know about the demonic energy, Mingye must not know it, either.

255
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,920
Now that I know, I'll just talk to him.

256
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,550
Why were you so aggressive?

257
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,020
If I had known you'd be like this, I wouldn't have told you.

258
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,753
I…

259
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:19,250
I was trying to do you justice!

260
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,850
I picked this path by my self.

261
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,510
It was my decision to marry this man.

262
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,810
There's no justice to do me.

263
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,560
What's more, Mingye doesn't treat me badly.

264
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,590
Instead, he taught me swordsmanship and archery.

265
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,740
I've made great progress.

266
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Swordsmanship and archery?

267
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,470
You wouldn't understand anyway.

268
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
It's getting late.

269
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,060
Mingye's probably on his way home.

270
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm going to go back to Shangqing and talk to him about dual-cultivation.

271
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,603
You…

272
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:53,290
You're just going to talk to him about it directly?

273
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,733
Otherwise?

274
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,390
All right. Then go ahead.

275
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,510
Whatever trouble you have, remember to come home, come back to Mo River.

276
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,610
I don't care who's right or wrong, I'll always be by your side.

277
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,680
Why aren't you practicing?

278
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you willing to try dual-cultivation with me?

279
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,423
What?

280
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,830
My demonic energy is devouring me.

281
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,740
I heard dual-cultivation can neutralize foul energy with pure energy.

282
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,870
If you mind it, I'll think of another way.

283
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,660
You do have a lot of foul energy inside.

284
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,130
It's my fault not to realize it sooner.

285
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,180
This place is clear and cool.

286
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,110
It's perfect for dual-cultivation.

287
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,603
Sangjiu, close your eyes.

288
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,460
Breathe in and out with me.

289
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,500
 So this is dual-cultivation, huh? 

290
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,890
 Why was Brother so mysterious about it? 

291
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,970
 I thought it was going to be something embarrassing. 

292
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,443
Sang Jiu.

293
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,330
Get closer to me.

294
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,073
Sang Jiu.

295
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,623
Sang Jiu.

296
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,780
 The Healing Barrier cost quite a lot of treasures. 

297
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,500
Goddess Tian Huan?

298
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,440
Great. I'm going to tell Lord Immortal.

299
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,800
Don't bother. I'll go tell him myself and thank him for healing me.

300
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,821
- But Goddess… 
 - What?

301
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm afraid you can't go now.

302
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,600
Lord Immortal is doing dual-cultivation with his wife.

303
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,213
Wife?

304
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,050
Mingye isn't married yet. What wife?

305
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,450
Goddess Tian Huan… Goddess…

306
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Goddess Tian Huan.

307
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,780
I feel much better now.

308
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,280
This is for you.

309
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,620
Thank you for today.

310
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,550
I'm going to sleep.

311
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,323
Sang Jiu.

312
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,880
Come to me anytime you feel that the foul energy has accumulated.

313
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,183
I will.

314
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,743
Good night.

315
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,413
So, that clam spirit has become the Lady of Yuqing Palace?

316
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:14,420
Sang Jiu married me three months ago.

317
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,133
At that time,

318
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,000
you were still in a coma.

319
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,110
So, my coma was just in time.

320
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,390
Three months ago, it was me who went to war with you.

321
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,790
It was me who took a walk with you here in Yuqing Palace.

322
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,380
It was also me who dug out that Ancient Crystal for you!

323
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,480
You were to one who dug out the Ancient Crystal from the Water-calming Stone?

324
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,030
Yes, but so what?

325
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,040
You were dying. I had to save your life!

326
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,480
If I had known this, I wouldn't have saved you that desperately.

327
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,460
Then I wouldn't lose everything or live under someone else's roof now.

328
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,450
You grew up here.

329
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,980
It's not someone else's roof.

330
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,340
Then tell me, Mingye.

331
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,580
You and that clam spirit stay hereevery day, loving each other.

332
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,490
What am I?

333
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,440
A maid for your wife?

334
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,580
Tian Huan, no one takes you as a maid.

335
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,380
If you really feel bad, I can leave with Sang Jiu and we'll live somewhere else.

336
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,883
Mingye, you're the God of War.

337
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:36,100
And Yuqing Palace is the home of the God of War.

338
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,550
You'll leave your own palace for her?

339
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,480
Why don't you stop being the God of War, too?

340
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,810
Enough. I know you're being too emotional now.

341
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,500
When you calm down tomorrow, I'll talk to you.

342
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,903
Fine.

343
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,023
Very well.

344
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,340
 Mingye, that clam spirit is despicable. 

345
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,760
 She took advantage of your sympathy and tricked you. 

346
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,990
 You just can't see that. 

347
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,610
 How can I make you see her through? 

348
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,140
You two are close to that clam spirit, right?

349
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,870
- Greetings, Goddess. 
 - Greetings, Goddess.

350
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:45,250
Lady… Lady Sang asked us about Lord Immortal's preferences.

351
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,570
So we talked to her.

352
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,600
When Lady Sang first came, she made every attempt to win Lord Immortal's favor.

353
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,890
But Lord Immortal didn't accept her.

354
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,793
Until…

355
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,070
Continue.

356
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,130
Until one day she saw Lord Immortal under the Immortal Tree.

357
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,440
Seeing her climb the tree and pick fruit, Lord Immortal didn't blame her.

358
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,100
Instead…

359
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,110
Instead, he got closer to her.

360
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,170
The Immortal Tree?

361
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,670
Cut the tree down.

362
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,920
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

363
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,840
What a pity.

364
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,380
So, your name is Sang Jiu?

365
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,170
Goddess Tian Huan?

366
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,580
It's so great to see you're awake.

367
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,963
Yeah. I finally woke up.

368
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,030
Thank you for taking care of Mingye by the Mo River.

369
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,360
Or I wouldn't have known what to do.

370
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,280
I also want to thank you for looking after him lately.

371
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,500
I have something to tell you.

372
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,100
I wonder if you're available, Lady Sang.

373
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,490
So, Mingye had the tree cut down?

374
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,630
Yes.

375
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,110
For the sake that you married him so young and are faraway from home, I told you secretly.

376
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,700
Don't let anyone else know it.

377
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,510
Thank you.

378
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,070
I heard every day you put
a Red Immortal Fruit on his desk.

379
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,130
But haven't you heard about that?

380
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:02,780
Mingye, the God of War, hates it most when someone goes into his room, touches his stuff, or pesters him.

381
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,480
 Lord Immortal doesn't seem to have any hobbies. 

382
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,840
 He doesn't like to be close to anyone, either. 

383
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,930
I've heard about that.

384
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,640
- But I thought… 
 - Thought what?

385
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,120
You thought you were special? You thought he liked you?

386
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,120
Fine, I'll be the nice one and tell you something more.

387
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,930
That your father forced Mingye to return his kindness is known to everyone in Shangqing realm.

388
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,530
Mingye helps you remove your foul energy

389
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,150
only because he has to, in case others gossip behind his back.

390
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,280
Besides, Mingye used to be an immortal.

391
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,150
Now, he's a demigod with a pure core.

392
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:48,540
- But… 
 - Your foul demonic energy is terribly harmful to him, especially to his core.

393
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,130
Every day, Mingye leads his army against the Devil's Army, risking his life.

394
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,560
If your demonic energy hurts him so that he gets wounded in the battle, wouldn't you regret it?

395
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,760
I did not realize dual-cultivation had that effect.

396
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
If I had known my demonic energy was harmful, I wouldn't have asked for that.

397
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,740
Now, you know.

398
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,190
I won't do that again.

399
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,340
He should have told me.

400
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,130
He's a man and the God of War.

401
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,360
How could he have the nerve to tell you

402
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,410
even the mere dual-cultivation with you would get him into trouble?

403
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,100
Mingye led his army out before dawn.

404
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,510
I wonder how he's doing now.

405
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,360
You guys only dual-cultivated once.

406
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,180
As the God of War, he can't be that fragile.

407
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,500
You'd better worry about yourself.

408
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,190
Without his help, if your foul energy begins devouring you, what can you do?

409
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,960
I don't know.

410
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,410
I have to think of another way.

411
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,070
Looks like I have to help you more.

412
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,700
Now that I disturbed your dual-cultivation, I should find a solution for you.

413
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,580
Sister Tian Huan, you have a solution?

414
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,640
When your demonic power accumulates, don't bother Mingye.

415
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,410
Come to me.

416
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,580
Thank you, Sister Tian Huan.

417
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,420
 Mingye was unhappy. 

418
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,410
 But why didn't he tell me? 

419
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,540
 Why did he vent his anger on you? 

420
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,643
Ming Ye. Ming Ye.

421
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,113
Thank you. Leave it there.

422
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,480
 This is for you. Thanks for today. 

423
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,860
 Today is the day Sang Jiu and I will dual-cultivate. 

424
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,310
 Yesterday, Sang Jiu should have come for dual-cultivation. 

425
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,710
 I waited the whole day but she didn't come. 

426
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,870
 I wonder if she encountered some trouble. 

427
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,640
Did your clam spirit elope with someone else?

428
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,840
What?

429
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,770
Then why have you pulled a long face, as if you wanted to bite people?

430
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,350
Sang Jiu is a girl. If you ask her directly, she'll be shy.

431
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,880
 We haven't dual-cultivated for days. 

432
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,140
 Her foul energy must have accumulated. She's supposed to come to me. 

433
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,860
 I must clear things up with her. 

434
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,290
 The devouring of demonic energy is serious. 

435
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:55,240
 We agreed to do dual-cultivation every three days. It can't be delayed like this. 

436
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,680
 What a beautiful night! 

437
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,800
 Sang Jiu likes stars. 

438
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,180
 I'll collect some starlight and give it to her. 

439
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,380
 I hope she'll like it. 

440
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,023
Goddess Tian Huan, I…

441
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,820
Your demonic energy is starting to devour you, is that right?

442
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,950
You don't need to tell me.

443
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,540
I smelt the demonic energy from afar.

444
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,500
Don't worry. Come with me.

445
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,740
Don't disturb anyone else.

446
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,500
This is the Marrow-Cleansing Spring.

447
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,240
Your demonic energy will be cleansed when you bathe in it.

448
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,420
There are quite a lot of treasures in the Shangqing God Realm.

449
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,230
But this is a place for immortals.

450
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,920
Why is there a spring for the cleansing of demonic energy?

451
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,940
The Shangqing God Realm is for immortals.

452
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,980
But over thousands of years, a few demons have come occasionally.

453
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,610
The spring is natural.

454
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,050
Who knows why it is here?

455
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,370
The water temperature is perfect. Come have a try.

456
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,760
Sister Sang Jiu, what's wrong?

457
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,920
It… It hurts a lot.

458
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,590
No. It feels good.

459
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:22,510
If I weren't so busy, I would like to bathe in it with you.

460
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,133
Oh, I know.

461
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,190
The spring is for cleansing your demonic energy.

462
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,630
Your foul energy makes you feel the pain.

463
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,480
But it works very well.

464
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,760
Look, your skin bathed in the water has recovered. Right?

465
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,003
Yes, indeed.

466
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:04,360
Get down there.

467
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,080
Sister Sang Jiu, it won't work well unless you bathe for a long time.

468
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,883
I can't hold on.

469
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,910
It hurts too much.

470
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,340
As if my body were burning.

471
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:36,830
Sister Sang Jiu, before you suffer enough, you can't get what you want.

472
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,560
I heard you wanted to join Mingye's army.

473
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,810
How could you before your demonic energy is eliminated?

474
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,560
I wouldn't deceive you.

475
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,290
Bathe in the Spring for a quarter and then you can leave.

476
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,860
You'll be refreshed with no more foul energy.

477
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,880
I've got something else to do. So I'll first take my leave.

478
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:19,510
By the way, Mingye knows about your demonic energy accumulating, he'll ask how you handle it.

479
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,500
You can tell him someone else helped you out.

480
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,520
But don't tell him I was the one.

481
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,770
Mingye hates it when those around him get too close.

482
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,393
I get it. Don't worry.

483
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,200
 It really works. 

484
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,433
 Give it to me. 

485
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,750
 No one else knows. Right? 

486
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,900
 Don't worry, Goddess. I've killed that man from Yiyue tribe. 

487
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,860
 No one knows the whereabouts of his bottle of water. 

488
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:48,100
 For so little Ruo Water, I did quite a lot. 

489
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,060
 No creature, devil or god, can resist the burning of Ruo Water. 

490
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,800
 As long as one touches it, 

491
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,170
 their energy, demonic or immortal, will be disperse. 

492
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,780
 Sadly, I can only apply some in the spring and it won't kill you. 

493
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,203
You…

494
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,393
What do you need?

495
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,580
Mingye, are you waiting for someone?

496
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,020
For your clam spirit wife?

497
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,850
If you're here for the scenery because you have nothing else to do, fine.

498
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:16,960
But if you're waiting for her to do dual-cultivation, let me tell you.

499
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,050
She doesn't need you anymore.

500
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,570
- What's are you trying to say? 
 - Haven't you realized that?

501
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,270
Lately, Sang Jiu has been terribly cold to you.

502
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:32,850
Today, she should have come for dual-cultivation but she's nowhere to be seen.

503
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,730
Even I can tell she's avoiding you.

504
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,613
Why?

505
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,030
Because you were married by force.

506
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,380
It's understandable that you don't love each other.

507
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,980
But don't blame her.

508
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,190
I heard someone else helped her with dual-cultivation.

509
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:00,590
So, she probably doesn't need to use you anymore.

510
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,230
How do you know?

511
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,380
Calm down.

512
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,130
Her demonic energy has increased lately. You also felt that, right?

513
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,420
Today, she should have had dual-cultivation with you.

514
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,080
But she didn't come.

515
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,780
If you don't believe me, ask her when she's back.

516
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:36,090
Brother Mingye, you can't force her.

517
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:40,770
But if you insist, I'll help you persuade her.

518
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,260
As a woman, I can talk better with her, anyway.

519
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,533
No need.

520
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,090
All right. Then, enjoy your time waiting.

521
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,500
   

522

♫   And become devout like the flawless moonlight   ♫

537

♫   Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫
