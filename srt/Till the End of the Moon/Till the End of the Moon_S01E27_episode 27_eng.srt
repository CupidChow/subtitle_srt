00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,060
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,100
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,180
♫  I do not fear   ♫

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,980
♫  How people treat me in this world  ♫

♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

♫  My existence  ♫

16

♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,160
   

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,980
   

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,680
You've been standing here all night, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,590
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

21
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,030
Would she have died if Pianran and Ye Qingyu arrived a little later?

22
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,700
The imperial physician said she had been so close to death.

23
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,650
I ask her to live well,

24
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,340
she should do as she's told.

25
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,380
Her life belongs to me. Without my permission,

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,050
she is not allowed to die.

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,690
Your Majesty, someone asks to see you.

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,660
Ask him to go.

29
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,320
It's Pang Yizhi. He said he had to see you, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,300
Scholar Pang, what did you come for?

31
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Majesty, you've addressed me wrongly. Sheng Kingdom has been conquered,

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,060
so I'm not the Sheng Kindom's Scholar of the Ministry of Ceremonies but a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,880
I came to make a divination for you to exchange for one thing.

34
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,980
What's the thing?

35
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,640
Don't you want to know what the divination is about?

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,243
No.

37
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:47,520
Emperor Jin, I can't hold anything back, so I have to say it

38
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,870
whether it's good or ill luck, or I'll go crazy.

39
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,460
From the divination image,

40
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,960
you'll suddenly lose your love

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,180
and live in pain and regret the rest of your life.

42
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,010
Cannot reclaim your love and be trapped in the underworld.

43
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,450
It seems you don't want your tongue anymore.

44
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,540
Emperor Jin, be patient. I haven't finished my words.

45
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,580
There are two chances showed in the divination image.

46
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,500
One is in thunder. The other is in water.

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,550
What do you mean?

48
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,190
You know, I'm not proficient.

49
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,820
Sorry, I can't explain it.

50
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
What do you want to exchange it for?

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,830
I want a bottle of your heart blood.

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,780
Scholar Pang, what makes you think I would give it to you

53
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,020
after hearing your nonsense?

54
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,460
You have the whole world under you.

55
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,210
Of course, I was not fully confident that you would give it.

56
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,740
However, I have a thunder-series artifact.

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,250
If you give me your heart blood, I'll repay you with it.

58
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,410
What is it?

59
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,380
This is Yin-Yang Twin Bracelets, made from thunder iron. It's an artifact of Xiaoyao Sect.

60
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,210
When two people wear one of the bracelets, the owner of Ying bracelet won't die

61
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,330
if the owner of Yang bracelet is alive.

62
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,210
The reason is that the lifespan of the owner of Yang bracelet

63
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,290
has offset the disasters of the owner of Ying bracelet.

64
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,990
Yet, once you put on the bracelet,

65
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,750
you can't take it off.

66
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,400
 Offset disaster. 

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm willing to offer the artifact in return for your heart blood.

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,873
Pang Yizhi, what do you want the blood for?

69
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,560
It has nothing to do with you, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Your Majesty.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,920
We don't know his purpose. Besides, your heart has been injured.

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,200
I beg you to think well.

73
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,343
Nian Baiyu. Dagger.

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,023
Thank you.

75
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,653
 Martial Nephew, I've been practicing martial arts 

76
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,700
 and learning divination for many years. What is it for? 

77
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,290
 I can't change what has happened or save my friends. 

78
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,480
 You're my friend. 

79
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,900
 Now, I'll make divination for you. 

80
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,250
 Xiao Lin, if you were still alive, 

81
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,520
 you would certainly admonish me from doing this. 

82
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,930
 Now that you're in the underworld, you can't stop me. 

83
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,800
 Just let me do what I want to. 

84
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,830
 From now on, our fates have become one. 

85
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

86
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,540
Take her pulse again.

87
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,740
Your Majesty, her pulse is recovering quickly.

88
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,250
She'll wake up in a few hours.

89
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,150
You can all leave.

90
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,183
Yes.

91
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,320
Your Majesty, are you okay?

92
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,250
When Ye Xiwu wakes up, lock her up in the Cold Palace.

93
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,250
No one is allowed to visit.

94
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,820
She's now my weakness. If she's killed,

95
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,740
my life span will be reduced.

96
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes.

97
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,353
Remember, don't talk about the bracelets to anyone,

98
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,840
including Ye Xiwu.

99
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,493
Yes.

100
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,570
Your Majesty, how do you want to deal with Ye Bingchang?

101
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,810
Have you found why she tried to kill Ye Xiwu?

102
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,360
She said Ye Xiwu caused Xiao Lin's death.

103
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,350
As Xiao Lin's widow, she wanted to avenge his death.

104
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,190
 The person who killed Xiao Lin was not Ye Xiwu 

105
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,420
 but me. 

106
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,410
Don't kill her.

107
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,320
Put her in the dungeon. Don't let her go unless she dies.

108
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,023
Yes.

109
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,663
Your Majesty, why does Pang Yizhi want your heart blood?

110
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,550
I think he's up to no good.

111
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,310
And I'm afraid it will be detrimental to you.

112
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,550
Your Majesty, I beg you. Please take care of your health.

113
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,970
I don't care about it.

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,810
 What did you put in there? 

115
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,280
 Dry mylabris. 

116
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,060
 One tiny sip... 

117
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,930
 is lethal. 

118
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,120
 Did you cook this porridge for me specifically? 

119
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,720
 No, Tantai Jin. I didn't want to kill you. 

120
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,660
 It's all wrong... 

121
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,410
 Li Susu, are you giving up? 

122
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,470
 This is... 

123
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,253
 Barren Abyss. 

124
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,170
 Li Susu. 

125
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,080
 Senior Jize. 

126
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,440
 I failed to kill the Devil Lord. 

127
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,950
 I've let down your trust. 

128
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,000
 I'm sorry. 

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,640
 You not only feel guilty to me, but also feel guilty to Tantai Jin. 

130
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,660
 Right? 

131
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,093
 Guilty? 

132
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:51,020
 I'm surprised that despite being convinced I wanted to fatally poison him, 

133
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,820
 he was still willing to marry me... 

134
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,130
 and be with me forever. 

135
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,573
 Senior, whether he is a demon or a god, since he loves me deeply, 

136
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,340
 how can I not be guilty? 

137
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,970
 Silly... 

138
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,730
 Let me tell you. Even if you and Tantai Jin didn't have such chaotic lives, 

139
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,540
 this would be how you and Tantai Jin end. 

140
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,353
 Li Susu, in this lifetime, 

141
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:26,260
 the fate of you two has already been written. 

142
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,920
 Whatever you do will have the same ending. 

143
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,350
 If you don't want to owe him, you have to owe the world. 

144
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,580
 In Barren Abyss, I mentioned 

145
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,330
 a dream, a teardrop, and a thread. 

146
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,860
 Have you understood them? 

147
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,530
 The tear is Soul-slaying Teardrop. 

148
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,340
 The silk is Tantai Jin's love thread. 

149
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,473
 The dream... 

150
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,650
 Was it Enlightened Life? 

151
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,850
 Since you've guessed right, 

152
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,990
 why haven't you woken up yet? 

153
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,710
 What do you mean? 

154
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,770
 What are you doing? 

155
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,603
 Sang Jiu, I'll take the punishment for you. 

156
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:36,290
 When my immortal body vanishes, 

157
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,730
 my divine essence will replace your devil bone. 

158
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,810
 Mingye, let go of me! 

159
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,300
 My divine essence will replace your devil bone. 

160
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,570
 My divine essence will replace your devil bone. 

161
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,700
 Everything happens for a reason. 

162
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,450
 Don't indulge in foolishness. 

163
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,230
 Seize the chance. 

164
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,490
 My divine essence will replace your devil bone. 

165
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,300
 If he loses the evil bone, Devil Lord won't return to life. 

166
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,690
 With the power of the lightning punishment,  

167
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,910
 Mingye replaced my demon bone with his divine essence. 

168
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,460
 So similarly, I can replace the evil bone with my divine essence. 

169
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,700
 But now my body has no power,  

170
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,270
 let alone divine essence. 

171
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,580
 What should I do? 

172
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,583
 That hurts. 

173
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,190
 With my weak body,  

174
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,020
 how can I build divine essence and trigger the lightning punishment? 

175
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,590
 It's a gem that I forged with the divine essence of the entire Flying Serpent clan. 

176
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,620
 This tiny piece contains the powers of immortals. 

177
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,640
 It's capable of overturning Heaven and Earth. 

178
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,340
 Why don't I call it World-alluring Jade? 

179
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,790
 World-alluring Jade! 

180
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,380
 That explains it. 

181
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,130
 This is the succession of cause and effect. 

182
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,640
 What is this place? 

183
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,170
 This place looks so familiar. 

184
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,420
 I feel I've been here. 

185
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,950
 This is where Tantai Jin lived when he was little. 

186
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,180
 This is the Cold Palace. 

187
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,750
 Have you ever seen your mom? 

188
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,470
 I haven't either. 

189
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,220
 They say I don't have a mom. 

190
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,650
 Yue Ruanruan. 

191
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,873
You're awake.

192
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,870
How are you feeling?

193
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,240
Here. Eat the medicine.

194
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,650
What's this bracelet for? Why can't I take it off?

195
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,840
I don't know it. It looks like a divine weapon or artifact.

196
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,270
Did Tantai Jin put it on you to stop you from escaping?

197
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,980
I won't escape.

198
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,810
Then, eat the medicine and get well.

199
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,700
Being alive is the most important thing.

200
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,240
They said you didn't eat or drink.

201
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,520
I thought you didn't want medicine but wanted to die.

202
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,340
How can it be?

203
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,390
Good. I've lived for so long

204
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,400
and have known that where there is life, there is hope.

205
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,790
Cheer up.

206
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,200
 If I go all out to absorb power from World-alluring Jade,  

207
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,300
 I'll definitely be devoured completely. 

208
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,810
 Even if I die, I mustn't die before completing this thing. 

209
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,320
 Jize's barrier won't last long. I have to hurry.  

210
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,610
 Your Majesty, this is the elixir refined by the warlocks today. 

211
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,250
Your life was reduced for Ye Xiwu.

212
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,700
I'll make the warlocks refine elixirs day and night to extend your life.

213
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,490
This is a drop in the bucket.

214
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,930
But it might be good.

215
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,310
If I'm still alive, Ye Xiwu won't die.

216
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,490
She mustn't die.

217
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm not done with her.

218
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,200
Your Majesty, it seems Ye Xiwu doesn't want to kill herself anymore.

219
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,900
She ate the meals we sent today.

220
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
Did she?

221
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,290
Why don't you go see her?

223
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,680
Ask her about the origin of the spikes,

224
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,480
so that we can find out how to pull them out.

225
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,123
Nian Baiyu.

226
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:22,620
As long as she's alive,

227
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,120
I don't want to know if she has meals or anything trivial like that.

228
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,150
I'm not interested.

229
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,903
Yes.

230
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,973
 What a pity. 

231
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,940
 When I'm devoured by the World-overturning Jade,  

232
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,810
 I won't see the stars clearly. 

233
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,943
 Will I... 

234
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,060
 not be able to see Tantai Jin's face clearly too? 

235
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,680
 Tantai Jin, I owe you in the lifetime. 

236
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,711
 But now my life doesn't belong only to me anymore. 

237
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:13,160
 I will repay you with my life. 

238
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,223
 As expected, with World-alluring Jade,  

239
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,020
 my cultivation has advanced considerably. 

240
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,840
 If I speed it up,  the divine essence should be completed soon. 

241
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,610
 It was almost there. 

242
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,920
His Majesty has been working diligently lately.

243
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,690
Old guys like us can't keep up with him, huh?

244
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,110
But isn't His Majesty too harsh with regulating us officials lately?

245
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,720
    
 I'm afraid His Majesty has been in a terrible mood lately.

246
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,540
    
 It's more than a bad mood.

247
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,860
His Majesty seems to have health issues these days.

248
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,050
Could the rumor be true that His Majesty's meridians are badly injured and will die soon?

249
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't say that. Stop talking nonsense. Let's go.

250
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,800
This puppetry spell is recorded in the Yiyue Tribe's ancient books.

251
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,750
But it usually can only control one person.

252
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,080
After I improve it with Chixiao Sect's instrument forging methods,

253
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,220
you will be able to control thousands.

254
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,430
Mighty Ruo Water,

255
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,230
control the souls.

256
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,710
Wake up.

257
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
Wake up.

258
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,070
Wake up.

259
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,700
These civilians King Sheng sent us

260
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,050
will be your soldiers to fight for you and listen to your commands.

261
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,440
Congratulations, Your Highness.

262
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,860
With the ten thousand Nether Soldiers, our great plan will definitely succeed.

263
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,170
Your Majesty, recently in the southern borders,

264
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,200
suspicious people have been seen again.

265
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,020
They turn civilians into puppet demonic soldiers and wreak havoc everywhere.

266
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,500
They are large in number and are no longer small groups like before.

267
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,430
Did you find out who's behind this?

268
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,500
According to the scouts, the southern borders are covered by miasma.

269
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,920
The source of these demonic soldiers seems to be deep in the poisonous miasma.

270
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,020
They can't probe deeper since only Sheng civilians are involved,

271
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,120
so most ministers think this can be ignored.

272
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,700
Although they are remnants of Sheng, they're people of Jing now.

273
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,400
Go investigate immediately.

274
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,033
Yes.

275
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,873
Your Majesty, there's another thing.

276
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:23,453
What is it?

277
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:26,900
Ye Xiwu was found unconscious on the ground this morning.

278
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
Now she is awake.

279
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,500
We couldn't find out the cause.

280
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
We can only presume it's due to her weak body.

281
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Also, her hearing seems to have declined.

282
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,300
And she has poor eyesight.

283
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,380
It could be due to her being kept inside for a long time.

284
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,990
Your Majesty, please send a doctor to treat her.

285
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,100
No need to report

286
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,740
as long as she's not dead.

287
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,700
Why is the water filled?

288
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,660
When did this happen?

289
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,830
Congratulations, Your Highness, your spell has been completed.

290
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,240
Now with the Ruo Water Puppets to fight for you, you can devour the demonic energy without limit.

291
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
You can definitely kill Tantai Jin and get back to the throne.

292
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
You don't need to comfort me.

293
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,370
I'm perfectly aware.

294
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,960
Swallowing demonic cores and devouring the demonic energy

295
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,510
is the cause of this appearance of being between life and death.

296
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,080
My days are numbered. I'll die soon.

297
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,500
All this is because I won't accept my fate.

298
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,533
I'll do anything...

299
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,220
to fulfill my ambition.

300
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,420
But you... You've been following me since I was young.

301
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,570
I must thank you.

302
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,260
I've been following you since you were young and weren't made the crown prince.

303
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,630
I'm willing to follow you till the end.

304
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,400
Spread the news that I'm on the southern border.

305
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,460
When Tantai Jin knows, he'll definitely come personally.

306
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,630
I'll drag him into hell with me.

307
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,040
This fight between us won't stop till death.

308
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,800
It can never be reconciled.

309
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,810
Since you have such a resolution, you'll definitely succeed.

310
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,430
I'm willing to assist you with my life.

311
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,300
My men, listen! Let's go to war!

312
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,320
 Your Majesty, we've found that the mastermind behind the demonic soldiers is indeed Tantai Minglang. 

313
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,260
 Now he's hiding on the southern border and controlling civilians with demonic spells. 

314
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,760
 He gathered ten thousand puppets and has a demonic woman cultivator with him. 

315
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,680
 According to the chamberlains of Sheng Palace, 

316
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,920
 it was this woman who advised King Sheng to hold rituals with your mother's bones. 

317
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,853
 I shall... 

318
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,333
 personally... 

319
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,340
fight this war.

320
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,980
 Wise decision! 

321
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,080
 Wise decision! 

322
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,180
 Wise decision! 

323
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,190
 Wise decision! 

324
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,120
   

325
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,440
 With the World-alluring Jade's side effects, 

326
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,840
 my body can't last for too long. 

327
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,260
 I'm about to forge the divine essence. 

328
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,700
 With it, I'll be able to trigger the lightning punishment. 

329
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,120
 I hope there's still time. 

330
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,920
Your Majesty, according to the refugees who got out,

331
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
thick fog started to appear a few days ago.

332
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,200
And the people in it will lose contact with the outside world.

333
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,833
This should be...

334
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,790
Tantai Minglang's place of demonic cultivation.

335
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,200
Your Majesty, there should be a lot of trapped civilians inside.

336
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,720
I've sent men go probe in there first.

337
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
The troops will pass after safety is confirmed.

338
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,420
- What is going on? 
 - What's that?

339
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,440
Have them come out now. Something's not right.

340
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,400
- This fog is poisonous. 
 - I'll go rescue them.

341
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,551
The poisonous miasma is too dangerous to go in.

342
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,900
Oh my, Third Brother, you're so alert.

343
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,520
But the entire southern border has been turned into a poisonous fortress.

344
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,220
I guarantee that anyone who enters shall not return.

345
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,360
Your abilities to control little animals won't be of use here.

346
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,610
Let this place be your

347
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,230
burial ground.

348
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,360
 This terrain is quite dangerous. 

349
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,160
 I'm afraid Tantai Minglang has troops waiting in ambush. 

350
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,030
 I must first clear the poisonous miasma to reduce our casualties. 

351
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,080
 What? What's going on? 

352
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,160
 - What happened? 
 - Look! What's that? 

353
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,040
 - It's the miasma. 
 - It has dispersed! 

354
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,580
- Your Majesty. 
 - Looks like the rumor is true. His heart and meridians are truly injured.

355
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,210
Let me see how long your injured heart can last.

356
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,560
Spread my order. Whoever kills Tantai Jin shall be a marquis.

357
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,260
 Kill Tantai Jin! 

358
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,950
 We mustn't fight a protracted war. The southern border is full of danger. 

359
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,190
 We have to keep our morale up by fighting a quick battle. 

360
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,123
Baiyu, follow me closely.

361
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:53,953
Yes. Go.

362
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,980
Protect His Majesty.

363
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,740
 Charge! 

364
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,980
Tantai Jin is eager to save his people.

365
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,310
He's forcing out his power.

366
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,390
Let's just let him show off for now.

367
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,490
When his power runs out,

368
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,650
my preparations should be finished.

369
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,320
Fu Yu, I'll go first.

370
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
You come later.

371
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,090
Tantai Jin,

372
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,830
let's see how much longer you can hide.

373
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,020
You'll regret it

374
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,290
after you occupied the poisonous fortress.

375
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,840
Why isn't General Ye at the battle ground?

376
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,160
His Majesty already secured multiple victories.

377
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,850
But you're here wielding your weapon.

378
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,270
Does His Majesty not trust you?

379
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,170
That's not true.

380
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,520
His Majesty told me to guard the capital in case the rebels launch a sneak attack.

381
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,860
Tantai Minglang is a treacherous one.

382
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,830
His Majesty gives this important mission to me.

383
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,510
It means he trusts me.

384
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,830
It seems General Ye takes the idiom sleeping with your weapon literally. 
  (To be prepared for battle) 

385
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,120
Well, I'm different.

386
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,220
I just want to stay in the capital and shy away from work.

387
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,570
Chief Pianran, how do you know

388
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,430
if I'm sleeping with my weapon or not?

389
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,503
Ye Qingyu,

390
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,550
you've been corrupted.

391
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,160
Focus on your practice.

392
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,560
I'll go check on the city gates.

393
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,030
Look at those dark clouds.

394
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,940
How unusual.

395
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,500
 There's thunder. 

396
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,230
 The lightning punishment is coming. 

397
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,050
 Ye Xiwu, you must hang on. 

398
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,590
 - The sky looks weird. 
 - No, it's not. 

399
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,740
 This seems like an ominous sign. 

400
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,360
 Is His Majesty suffering a defeat in the war? 

401
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,400
 We've only lived a few peaceful days. 

402
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,853
 - Don't tell me...  
 - News of victory!

403
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:43,260
News of victory!

404
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,990
 With His Majesty taking the lead, 

405
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,500
 our troops smashed into enemy territory. 

406
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,030
 We will conquer the poisonous fortress soon. 

407
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,710
 We've captured more than 3,000 rebels and saved over 10,000 civilians. 

408
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,820
Is today some kind of festival?

409
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,010
Why's everybody so excited?

410
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,500
Don't you know it yet?

411
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,020
The rebel Tantai Minglang has been defeated.

412
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,470
 Your Highness, I've found a side door to the old city 

413
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,150
 at the northwest corner of the Jing capital. 

414
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,760
 Since it's recently being renovated, few people go through it 

415
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,750
 and there aren't many guards there. 

416
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,280
What's your business?

417
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
Material delivery.

418
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,500
Stop for a routine inspection.

419
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,990
You don't look familiar.

420
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,290
Are you carrying any prohibited goods?

421
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,653
Enemy attack!

422
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:50,060
 Tantai Jin, I didn't expect there would be someone you actually care for in this world. 

423
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,760
 I'm surprised. 

424
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,600
 It's the thunder. 

425
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,900
 I'm about to succeed. 

426
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,460
 What happened? 

427
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,200
 Run! 

428
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,400
 Tantai Jin, I'm coming. 

429
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,730
Your Highness, the gate to the Jing capital is open.

430
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,240
You'll achieve your ambition very soon.

431
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,180
Well done.

432
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Where do these burglars come from? How dare you trespass my territory?

433
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,260
A fox demon wants to guard Tantai Jin's city?

434
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,270
I like eating black-hearted demons the most.

435
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,620
A mixture of human and demon like you perfectly suits my taste.

436
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,030
Your Highness, the Ruo Water Puppets are ready.

437
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,840
Mighty Ruo Water, control her soul.

438
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,780
Please enter the palace first.

439
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,230
Leave this fox demon to me.

440
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,020
Try your best.

441
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,423
Yes.

442
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,583
Go.

443
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,990
Slay our way in!

444
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,950
 Attack! 

445
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,550
 Don't hurt innocent civilians! 

446
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,820
Are you being serious with me?

447
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,060
Demon-hunting Crossbow!

448
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,040
Fu Yu!

449
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,380
Ye Qingyu!

450
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,033
Ye Qingyu!

451
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,093
Ye Qingyu!

452
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:35,793
Ye Qingyu!

453
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,580
Pianran, look at me.

454
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,960
I have something to say to you.

455
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,980
I've failed my kingdom and family.

456
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,480
Now I die for protecting the civilians

457
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,820
and protecting my loved one.

458
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,600
This death is worth it.

459
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,040
What are you talking about? You won't die.

460
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,470
I won't let you die.

461
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,633
Ye Qingyu.

462
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,000
I thought I would never be as good as Jiang Rao.

463
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,900
Because he's already dead.

464
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,330
He'll live in your heart forever.

465
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,520
I didn't expect that now I'm also...

466
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,640
Ye Qingyu, you're not Jiang Rao.

467
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,460
And don't even think about becoming Jiang Rao.

468
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,640
You are Ye Qingyu.

469
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,620
♫  Ingenuine affection is also enough  ♫

470
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,520
♫  Sincerity makes flirtation hard  ♫

471
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,350
Pianran,

472
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,030
if only I could have met you

473
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,873
earlier.

474
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:45,180
♫  Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed  ♫

475
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,440
♫  But this time, who will be the one  ♫

476
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,030
So I could have fallen in love with you earlier.

477
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,790
To dote on you.

478
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,753
Pianran, demons live much longer than humans.

479
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:05,860
Will you still remember me

480
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,940
after a few hundred years?

481
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,190
You jerk!

482
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,480
If you dare to die,

483
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,470
I'll forget everything about you!

484
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,700
Just forget about me.

485
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
Don't feel sad for me.

486
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,460
After living the best days of my life with you,

487
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,570
there's nothing I regret...

488
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,570
when I leave the world.

489
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,293
What a shame.

490
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,673
We...

491
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,410
can't leave the world together.

492
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:51,760
♫  I no longer take the passing of time seriously  ♫

493
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,400
♫  But I never forget your utterance, "No regrets"  ♫

494
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,780
Ye Qingyu!

495
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,800
Ye Qingyu!

496
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,860
Ye Qingyu!

497
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,333
Ye Qingyu!

498
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,653
Ye Qingyu!

499
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,890
You fool.

500
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,160
You think I'd make the same mistake twice about the same thing?

501
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,960
Losing Jiang Rao made me suffer so much.

502
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,760
I can't lose you again.

503
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,550
 Please forgive my selfishness. 

504
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,360
 If fate has a plan for us, 

505
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,520
we will meet again someday.

506
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,673
 Let me, 

507
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,190
 let your Pianran, 

508
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,570
 leave the world first. 

509
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,133
 Qingyu. 

510
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:12,580
 In the past, I couldn't see my heart 

511
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,110
 because I lost my love thread. 

512
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,973
 Now, my heart belongs to you. 

513
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,740
 It only belongs to you. 

514
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,060
