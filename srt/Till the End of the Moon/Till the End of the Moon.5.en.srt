15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,790
<i>As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power.</i>

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,580
Power.

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,620
So,

18
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,960
this is...

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,110
what power feels like.

20
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,420
<i>Since those demons can give me power,</i>

21
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,960
<i>why don't I live a different life?</i>

22
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,500
<i>Young Devil God almost killed himself in his nightmare.</i>

23
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,630
<i>Could it be he still doesn't want to live now?</i>

24
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,610
Tantai Jin.

25
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,120
What are you doing?

26
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,660
<i>Perfect timing. I'll test my power with you.</i>

27
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,620
Second Young Miss,

28
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,650
what do you think I'm doing?

29
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,239
Miss! Miss!

30
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,050
Miss! Miss!

31
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,950
Someone, please help!

32
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,410
Mr. Tantai killed Miss Xiwu!

33
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,460
Tantai Jin?

34
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,460
Second Young Miss?

35
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,070
What do you think I'm doing?

36
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,700
You're not doing needlework, are you?

37
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,150
Let me borrow your scissors. I have to trim my nails.

38
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,260
Miss, I trimmed your nails just a few days ago.

39
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
You didn't trim them well.

40
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,140
Ye Xiwu, it's you who took away my dagger in my dream.

41
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,189
Of course. Who else do you think it was?

42
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss, the imperial doctor said you almost injured your tendons.

43
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,849
You need to rest properly. Don't trim your nails carelessly.

44
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,620
<i>How am I supposed to convince him?</i>

45
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,700
<i>Tantai Jin, you can't die.</i>

46
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,920
<i>Forget it.</i>

47
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,380
<i>From now on, let's find a way to watch him closely.</i>

48
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,190
<i>And convince him with emotions and reason.</i>

49
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,949
Tantai Jin, I heard my sister has also woken up.

50
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,670
- Do you wanna go see her?
- No.

51
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,580
Taking a walk in the garden will liven your mood.

52
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Let's go.

53
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,950
Come on.

54
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,440
She'll be fine.

55
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,099
From what I see, Miss Ye has the fate of "ivy twining around a tree trunk"

56
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:21,619
With you, the tall tree, as her shield, she will be blessed and survive the crisis to live a life in peace.

57
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,229
Since you care for her so much, why don't you ask His Highness to grant your wish?

58
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,600
I do have my concerns about not giving my word to Bingchang.

59
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,140
In people's eyes, I'm the luckiest man alive.

60
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,280
I can have everything without moving my hands.

61
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,670
But everything isn't as simple as it seems.

62
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,900
You're worried that being the Sixth Prince,

63
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,139
if you marry a Ye who controls the army, there will only be more suspicion.

64
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,040
You read my mind, Junior Martial Uncle.

65
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,789
But this is indeed difficult.

66
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,690
But you've already decided, haven't you?

67
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,550
<i>Sixth Prince.</i>

68
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,120
Sixth Prince, Eldest Young Miss has awakened.

69
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,860
Your Highness, when I was taken by that demon,

70
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,370
I was so scared of not being able to see you again.

71
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,530
Bingchang.

72
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,070
Since I first saw you at that banquet,

73
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,340
I had something I wanted to say to you.

74
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,300
How I regret that I didn't say it earlier.

75
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,220
What did you want to say?

76
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,950
“I'm willing to die if we can be together.

77
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,760
I'd rather be lovers than envy immortals"

78
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,480
Don't cry. I'm also in love with you.

79
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,469
You're a distinguished prince, but I'm just a concubine's daughter.

80
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,740
When I gave my heart to you, I'll never love anyone else in this life.

81
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,580
Rest assured. I won't fail your love.

82
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,670
I'll have a proper arrangement for you.

83
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,180
We're both each other's love.

84
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,490
You deserve a justifiable status.

85
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,990
Bingchang, get some good rest and get better.

86
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll be back for you.

87
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,670
Okay... I'll be waiting for you, Your Highness.

88
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,110
<i>He might feel happier when he meets his loved one.</i>

89
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,980
<i>Oh no.</i>

90
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,580
<i>How come Sixth Prince is here, too?</i>

91
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,970
<i>Wouldn't the love rivals make things worse?</i>

92
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,790
<i>I'd better take Young Devil Lord out of here.</i>

93
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,500
Prince Tantai.

94
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,640
Second Young Miss. You're awake.

95
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
How are you feeling?

96
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,650
I'm okay.

97
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,770
Nothing serious now.

98
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,819
Thank you and Secret Dragon Guard for sending us back. Bye.

99
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,640
Second Young Miss... there's something...

100
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,320
I need to talk about with you alone.

101
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Prince Tantai, would you excuse us?

102
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay.

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,470
Don't go too far.

104
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,630
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

105
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,530
The dream demon crisis helped me see clearly my love for Bingchang.

106
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,269
After I return to the palace today, I'll report this to His Majesty and ask him to grant our marriage.

107
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,499
I'm flattered that you're fond of me, but I hope that in the future, you will…

108
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,550
Accept this reality and stop badgering you?

109
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,180
Actually, I…

110
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,079
Never mind, it's too complicated.

111
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,900
Anyway, you may rest assured, Sixth Prince.

112
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,650
We won't disturb each other's lives.

113
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,849
We'll go our separate ways. There'll be nothing shady.

114
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,980
I hope you can keep your word.

115
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,750
Got it.

116
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,210
<i>This Ye Xiwu really seems to be a different person.</i>

117
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,270
<i>She's not obsessed with Xiao Lin.</i>

118
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,979
<i>She even specially cares about my life.</i>

119
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,700
<i>[Don't freeze to death]</i>

120
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,549
<i>There's another thing. It's about Prince Tantai.</i>

121
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,490
Tantai Jin? What's up with him?

122
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,199
It's really lucky for Prince Tantai to be able to return unharmed.

123
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,190
If something happened to him, not only the Ye family, but the whole world could be in trouble.

124
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,010
Why are you saying so?

125
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,290
Looks like Miss Xiwu knows little about state affairs.

126
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,669
Tantai Jin is a hostage from the Jing Kingdom.

127
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,139
As a Tantai, his life is bonded with the fate of his nation.

128
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,199
If anything happens to him, it'll give the Jing Kingdom an excuse to attack us.

129
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,540
The Sheng Kingdom has been losing military talents these years.

130
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,630
It's definitely not a good time for war.

131
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,119
By then, even if His Majesty doesn't punish the Ye family for dereliction of duty,

132
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:38,570
once the war breaks out, all males of the Ye family must go to the frontline,

133
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,800
which is a disaster for your own family.

134
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,490
Once the fire of war ravages the field,

135
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,380
poverty and desolation will be a catastrophe for everyone.

136
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm going to keep an eye on him.

137
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,320
So that's how it is.

138
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,469
<i>Prince Tantai left his home country to be a guest in our kingdom..</i>

139
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,199
<i>He did it for the peace of the two kingdoms.</i>

140
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,479
<i>And also for keeping the civilians free from the pains of war.</i>

141
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,199
<i>We should treat him politely.</i>

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,999
<i>How can you bully him without any scruples?</i>

143
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,450
Turns out, Xiao Lin only cared about me

144
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,480
because he was afraid I would bring disaster to his kingdom.

145
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,840
Ye Xiwu cares about me...

146
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,670
because she was afraid I would bring disaster to her family.

147
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,420
In their eyes, I'm just a jinx who only brings disasters.

148
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,680
Do you mean anything more when you say, "keep an eye on him"?

149
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,790
Sixth Prince,

150
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,290
I don't want to lie to you.

151
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,150
But I can't explain it to you further.

152
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:03,000
Honestly, I hate Tantai Jin more than anyone else.

153
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,140
<i>I wanna kill him even in my dreams.</i>

154
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,340
<i>I even wished...</i>

155
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,070
<i>he never existed in this world.</i>

156
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,050
But rest assured, I won't let him die.

157
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,840
But if you want me to truly care about him, it's impossible.

158
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,060
Ye Xiwu,

159
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,550
you finally told the truth.

160
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:49,040
All your performance in front of me was just for your own benefit.

161
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,890
Turns out...

162
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,720
you're no different from them.

163
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>I actually thought...</i>

164
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,220
<i>someone would really care about me.</i>

165
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,470
Royal Father, the eldest daughter of General Ye and I have been in love.

166
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,730
Would you grant my wish to marry her?

167
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,900
Do you really love her?

168
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,940
I'll love her for the rest of my life.

169
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,490
Lin'er, don't say it too soon.

170
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,769
What exactly do you love about her?

171
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,500
Her looks or her heart?

172
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,609
Looks will eventually fade away, and people's hearts will also change.

173
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:08,349
Nothing in this world can let love last.

174
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,500
Royal Father, I don't know exactly why I love Bingchang.

175
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,750
Since childhood, everything I did had a proper reason, except falling in love with her.

176
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,110
I am following my heart with no other reason.

177
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,020
What a surprise.

178
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,749
There's actually someone in this world who can break you out of your norm.

179
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,670
All right, let me think about it.

180
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,020
Thank you, Royal Father.

181
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,500
Miss.

182
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,479
Miss, I got some news.

183
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,300
What is it?

184
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,419
There's an edict from the palace asking Madam Ye to see His Majesty.

185
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,439
Eldest Young Miss, could it be about your marriage?

186
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,389
After Sixth Prince went back, he must have asked His Majesty to grant marriage to you two.

187
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,950
But Her Ladyship favors Second Young Miss, if she says something in front of His Majesty…

188
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,390
Jiahui, don't say it like that.

189
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,109
Second Sister is already married.

190
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,140
It's a done deal.

191
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,489
No matter how much Grandmother favors her, there's no reason for her to stop my marriage.

192
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,940
Miss, you are thinking too simply.

193
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,159
Think about it. Ever since you were a child, be it clothes, jewelry, food, or things to enjoy,

194
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,069
when Second Young Miss gets something, you don't necessarily get it, too.

195
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:50,339
But if it's something even she can't have, have you ever had it?

196
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,980
Miss…

197
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,920
<i>[Ye's Residence]</i>
You, Great General Ye Xiao's eldest daughter

198
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,480
who's known for her graceful appearance,

199
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,850
gentle character, kind heart,

200
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,180
and etiquette-conforming behaviors;

201
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,070
therefore, I grant her the title of Side Consort of Prince Xuancheng.

202
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,050
The end.

203
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,209
I accept and thank His Majesty's graciousness.

204
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,790
General Ye and Grand Princess Royal, please rise now.

205
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:41,240
Mr. Attendant, I wonder who this Prince Xuancheng is.

206
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,239
His Majesty issued two edicts today.

207
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,530
The other one is to grant Sixth Prince the title of Prince Xuancheng.

208
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,030
Blessings come in pairs, right?

209
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,960
I see.

210
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,500
Mother, look. Our Bingchang is such a lucky girl.

211
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,200
Even His Majesty cares about her.

212
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,519
Thanks for coming. Please come in and have some tea. Please.

213
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,020
Ye Bingchang is truly gentle and virtuous.

214
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,880
No wonder Lin'er likes her so much.

215
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,240
Isn't this a good thing?

216
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,670
Why did you sigh, Your Majesty?

217
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,980
Good thing?

218
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,510
Ye Xiao holds a high reputation in the army.

219
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,109
His second son, Ye Qingyu, who guards Jia Pass, is not to be underestimated.

220
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,580
How can I not be worried?

221
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,270
It's rare for Lin'er to ask something from me.

222
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:56,509
If this Ye woman becomes his official wife, she's probably going to be the Queen of Sheng.

223
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,880
He doesn't want to fail his woman, but I must consider the future of the Sheng Kingdom.

224
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,450
This is the dilemma of being a king.

225
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,190
<i>I'm telling you Ye Bingchang, no matter what you do,</i>

226
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,740
<i>you'll always be the daughter of a concubine.</i>

227
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,150
<i>I just need to have a word with Grandma, and you will only deserve to be a concubine.</i>

228
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,489
<i>Young Miss, ever since you were a child, when Second Young Miss gets something, you don't necessarily get it, too.</i>

229
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:39,570
<i>But if it's something even she can't have, have you ever had it?</i>

230
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,780
Miss, don't be upset.

231
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,550
Jiahui,

232
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,010
I really don't understand.

233
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,100
I've studied hard for years.

234
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm good at needlework.

235
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,350
Every word I say, every movement I make,

236
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,310
I can't be more cautious about them.

237
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm as obedient as I can possibly be.

238
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,230
But what exactly have I done wrong?

239
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,300
Why?

240
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,000
Why have things ended up the way they are today?

241
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,140
Miss, you haven't done anything wrong.

242
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,400
You can only blame the foul difference between a wife and a concubine.

243
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,850
I don't understand.

244
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,539
I don't understand. We're both daughters of the Ye family.

245
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,000
Why do this to me?

246
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,150
<i>So I must be Xiao Lin's official wife.</i>

247
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,610
<i>I must.</i>

248
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,860
Your Highness, please allow me to inform her.

249
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,830
Your Highness, you can't…

250
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,580
Your Highness, how come…

251
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,240
Bingchang, I obviously requested to marry you as my wife.

252
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,990
- But I didn't expect…
- Your Highness, Bingchang knows her place.

253
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,230
Actually, being able to marry you, is already enough for me.

254
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,580
Bingchang, you really don't have to force a smile with me.

255
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,089
You can just tell me you're disappointed that you can't be my official wife.

256
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:14,350
Bingchang, although you never cried or complained to me, I always knew

257
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,749
how you'd been treated in Ye Mansion and how you concealed your grievances.

258
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:22,210
Now seeing an edict like this, you must be really sad.

259
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't you think that I'm asking for things that are not mine?

260
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,580
That I desire too much?

261
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,290
So what if you do? Isn't love a kind of desire?

262
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,639
No woman in this world doesn't want to be the wife of their loved one.

263
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,210
Besides, you never harmed anyone else.

264
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,159
I want to be the husband of you rather than the husband of a saint.

265
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,179
All your depression and disappointment are your true feelings, which I can't cherish enough.

266
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,450
Why would I blame you for that?

267
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,120
♫ <i> No more talk of leaving or staying </i> ♫

268
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,980

270
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,200
Your Highness.

271
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,590
Bingchang.

272
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,160
Actually, I'm not worth you doing this.

273
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,910
No more thoughts like that.

274
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,300
You're the kindest and most beautiful girl in the world.

275
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,539
The position of my official wife will always be reserved for you.

276
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,310
I will give you a wedding just as grand as marrying an official wife.

277
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,080
From now on, be it happiness or hardships, we're in this together.

278
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,270
<i>A grand wedding.</i>

<i>Hello, welcome.</i>

<i>Please come inside.</i>

- Lord Ye, you're here.
- Greetings.

00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,020
- Thank you for your congratulation.
<i>You've gotten brash with your masters now?</i>

Tantai Jin! I finally found you.

300
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,749
Where have you been? I haven't seen you for quite a while.

301
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,030
<i>I hate Tantai Jin more than anyone else.</i>

302
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,390
<i>I want to kill him even in my dreams.</i>

303
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,190
Why are you looking at me like this? Is there anything on my face?

306
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,100
All the high officials and nobles in the capital are here.

307
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,310
There's one missing.

308
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,900
Who?

309
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,250
<i>He's coming.</i>

310
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,939
Whose little brat is this? How dare you block my way?

311
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,790
Get lost.

312
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,830
My Lord, she's still a child.

313
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,809
Sorry for getting in your way. Please have mercy and let us go.

314
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,250
All right. I won't mind that she blocked my way.

315
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,370
- I'll kowtow to you.
- But...

316
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,549
today's the big day for my sixth brother.

317
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,480
And there's someone crying out loud in front of his gate.

318
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,650
This is so unlucky.

319
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,220
It's our fault.

320
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,540

321
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,039
My Lord, please spare my life!

322

Dad!

323
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,510

- That's lucky!
- Dad!

328
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,260
Terrific. Let's go.

Did I come later or did you guys come early?

334
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,920
Of course, it's us who came early.

335
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,880
Well, well, Hostage Prince Tantai is also here!

336
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,850
And Second Young Miss, too!

337
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,500
Ever since you and the hostage got married,

338
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,400
you look prettier than before, Second Young Miss!

339
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,770
Greetings, Prince Wuning.

340
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,720
Forego the formalities.

341
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,619
Hostage, the Jing Kingdom regards black as the noble color. You're all dressed up today.

342
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:49,550
Are you here on behalf of the wife's family?

343
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,050
Today seems like a fun day!

344
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,580
Where is the fun?

345
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,549
I've seen how you desperately pursued Ye Bingchang.

346
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,870
How does it feel?

347
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,539
Seeing the woman you love becoming someone else's bride?

348
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,499
You must feel terrible, huh?

349
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,159
Xiao Lin is a prince.

350
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,280
You are also a prince.

351
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,549
He gets both power and beauty.

352
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,630
But your life is worse than a dog's.

353
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:27,529
I'm sure at this moment you must feel like hell in there, right?

354
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,450
<i>Is Young Devil Lord going to lose it?</i>

355
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,159
Prince Wuning, did you eat pickles for breakfast?

356
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,399
Why is your mouth so foul?

357
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,789
Ye Xiwu!

358
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,240
You!

359
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,720
How dare you talk to me like this?

360
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,000
Fifth Prince, you asked how I felt just now.

361
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,100
I feel happy for them, of course.

362
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,349
Coward.

363
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,550
Even a dog from the Jing Kingdom has more guts than you!

364
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,960
Farewell.

365
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,250
What did you say?

366
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,360
I said, Fifth Prince, farewell.

367
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,719
You do know the rules better than before.

368
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,340
Let's go.

369
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,749
Tantai Jin, don't take his words to heart.

370
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,130
He's just a despicable person.

371
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,380
Second Young Miss, there you are.

372
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,170
Scholar Pang.

373
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,770
What good stuff are you holding?

374
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,569
It's a wedding gift from the sect leader of Xiaoyao Sect, who told me to send this to Sixth Prince.

375
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,640
Heart-Guarding Scale?

376
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,199
Second Young Miss, you even know about this?

377
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,689
It's a scale from the chest of someone from the dragon race.

378
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,290
It's super tough.

379
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,250
It can protect you from all evil when worn.

380
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,700
This is a secret treasure of our sect.

381
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,340
I wonder why the old man is so generous this time.

382
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,620
Tan…

383
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,080
The auspicious time has come.

384
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,890
Please welcome Prince Xuancheng, and Consort of Prince Xuancheng!

385
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,820
<i>First bow to Heaven and Earth!</i>

386
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,400
<i>Second bow to thank His Majesty!</i>

387
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,910
<i>Husband and wife bow to each other!</i>

388
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,600
The ritual is finished!

389
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,580
<i>Good!</i>

390
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,470
<i>What a perfect couple! So wonderful!</i>

391
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,210
<i>Where does this crow come from?</i>

392
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,590
Why is there a crow here?

393
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,780
<i>Miserable people of a dying kingdom, how long will your good days last?</i>

394
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,320
<i>The crows are about to land.</i>

395
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,980
<i>Whose roof will they land on?</i>

396
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,089
What does this mean?

397
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,100
I don't know.

398
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,089
How can it talk?

399
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,770
This beast can talk?

400
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,730
Fifth Prince, are you all right?

401
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,149
<i>Crows everywhere! Run!</i>

402
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,760
<i>Quickly!</i>

403
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,760
<i>[Ye Xiwu, Xiao Liang, Ye Zeyu, Gao Jie, Qiu Yu, Cheng Peng]</i>

404
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,820
<i>[Xiao Liang]</i>

405
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,280
<i>[Xiao Liang]</i>

406
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,160
- Father!
- Watch out!

407
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,319
Your Highness, take the Heart-Guarding Scale!

408
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,319
Escort Consort out first! Leave here to me. Now!

409
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:08,329
Thanks, Junior Martial Uncle! Let's go, Bingchang.

410
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,400
<i>[Gao Jie, Qiu Yu, Cheng Peng]</i>

411
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,839
Wait here for a while in this side hall.

412
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,510
I'll come back for you when I save the guests.

413
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,759
Your Highness, please don't go! I'm scared!

414
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,289
- But the people outside…
- I don't care.

415
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,740
I just want you by my side.

416
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,500
Bingchang, listen to me.

417
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,189
The people outside are either guests attending our wedding or my guards and servants.

418
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:57,669
I can't just leave them in danger.

419
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,629
Are they more important than me?

420
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:01,629
I'm your newly-married wife!

421
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,500
How can you leave me behind to save others?

422
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,030
Bingchang, trust me.

423
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,580
You're going to be fine.

424
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,320
Wait for me.

425
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,420
<i>[Ye Xiwu]</i>

426
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,780
<i>[Ye Xiwu]</i>

427
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,230
<i>My face!</i>

428
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,230
Help me!

429
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,920
Zeyu!

430
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,810
<i>You actually know how to use charms.</i>

431
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,750
<i>Go!</i>

432
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,060
<i>Ye Xiwu, you really surprise me.</i>

433
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,999
<i>[Prince Xuancheng Mansion]</i>

434
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,860
It's fine.

435
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,630
- Come on.
- My legs!

436
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,360
Go now, Zeyu! Faster!

437
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,669
Zeyu!

438
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,180
- What happened to you?
- It hurts!

439
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,409
<i>Where's Young Devil Lord? Was he not able to escape?</i>
Dad, I'm disfigured!

440
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,799
You'll be fine. Let's go!

441
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,669
- <i>If anything happens to Young Devil Lord,</i>
- Come on!

442
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,190
- <i>we'll be doomed.</i>
- Listen to me!

443
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,170
- Come on!
- My legs hurt. I can't walk, Dad!

444
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,580
What? What's wrong with your legs?

445
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,260
- Xiwu, you can't…
- Dad!

446
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,119
- I can't let Xiwu go in there!
- I'm already dying! Dad!

447
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,980
So this is the taste of vengeance, huh?

448
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,000
Doesn't feel like too much fun.

449
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,810
Tantai Jin!

450
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,980
You did this!

451
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,530
This is the Heart-Guarding Scale.

452
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,860
Miss Bingchang,

453
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,140
keep your wedding gift.

454
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,870
I wish you...

455
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,180
a happy wedding.

456
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,360
Okay.

457
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,740
<i>Oh no. I've used up all my charms.</i>

458
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,650
<i>Even if I had the power to kill anyone,</i>

459
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,770
<i>I didn't feel any fluctuation in my heart.</i>

460
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,740
<i>Except at that moment,</i>

461
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,050
<i>in which I felt something different.</i>
<i>[Ye Xiwu]</i>

462
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,610
Tantai Jin!

463
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,940
<i>Ye Xiwu?</i>

464
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,480
<i>I've let you go. But you won't let me go?</i>

465
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,379
♫ <i> I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky </i> ♫

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,260

Tantai Jin, you're not dead and I'm not dead.

477
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,629
We both survived!

478
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,199

481
00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>How could you sacrifice your life in order to save me?</i>

482
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,559
This is such a serious incident, but the culprit is still unknown!

483
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,380
Your Majesty, this matter is quite weird.

484
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,369
The crows were conjured by some demon. They were quite fierce, but none of the guests were killed.

485
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,250
Most of them fainted or got pecked on their faces.

486
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,500
These creatures must have been secretly manipulated by someone.

487
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,809
This culprit harbors evil designs. I shall never tolerate him!

488
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:32,819
Investigate!

489
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,439
Keep investigating!

490
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,940
The culprit must be found!

491
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,260
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

492
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,299
<i>So, the power I devoured from the demons will eventually run out.</i>

493
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:54,330
<i>If I knew how to cultivate like Xiao Lin does,</i>

494
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,480
<i>I'd be able to sustain my power without devouring demons.</i>

495
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,259
<i>I wonder if that sect…</i>

496
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:01,860
Tantai Jin!

497
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,529
Tantai Jin! Did you get injured somewhere? Let me check.

498
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:10,349
We've been through life and death. Don't be shy.

499
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm not injured.

500
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,079
Even Xiao Lin, who has excellent swordsmanship, has multiple injuries.

501
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,550
While you remain unharmed?

502
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,510
Are you suspecting me?

503
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,780
No.

504
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,030
I was just saying you're lucky.

505
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:43,270
Because I know if you want to live, you have to hide.

506
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:48,720
Unlike someone who ran around like a headless fly.

507
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,360
I did that to save you!

508
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,440
You little ingrate!

509
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,730
If I didn't run faster, you'd have been killed by those birds.

510
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,820
Why did you come back for me?

511
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,669
Because I'm kind.

512
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,090
I'd do the same for anyone else.

513
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,279
Back then everyone was running out of the mansion.

514
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,200
Did you especially come back just to save me?

515
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,190
I…

516
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,090
Because I like you, all right?

517
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,359
Love lingers even after only being married for a day.

518
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,630
Saving you is what I'm supposed to do, huh?

519
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,260
- You love me?
- Yeah.

520
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,409
Just like in the novels. In the beginning, we didn't see eye to eye, but eventually, we grew fond of each other.

521
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,480
You saved me because of love?

522
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,380
What is love exactly?

523
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,439
Love is… Love is you don't want him to die.

524
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,319
You want to stay with him.

525
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:12,919
You'll be worried if you don't see him.

526
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,880
You'll be happy if you do.

527
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,180
<i>I'm sorry, Young Devil Lord. I didn't mean to lie to you.</i>

528
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:29,880
<i>Love, compared with power, is truly something not worth mentioning.</i>

529
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,010
All right.

530
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,629
If you love me, why don't you teach me how to draw charms?

531
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,160
This way, we can spend more time together.

532
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,859
Why do you want to learn that?

533
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:50,710
Because I want to be like you, capable of protecting my loved one.

534
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,630
<i>Young Devil Lord actually has someone he wants to protect now.</i>

535
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,180
Okay.

536
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,559
I'll teach you how to draw charms, and you promise me to live on.

537
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,100
I don't want to have to risk my life to save you again.

538
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,280
Okay.

539
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,640
<i>[Ye Xiwu]</i>

540
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,980
<i>[Ye Xiwu]</i>

541
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,380
What are you doing here?

542
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,859
I keep my word.

543
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:19,380
I'm here to fulfill my promise, of course.

544
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,380
Teach me.

545
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,569
What should I teach you…

546
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:33,059
The one you used to repel the crows at Xiao Lin's that day.

547
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:35,820
Not that one. That spell is too dangerous.

548
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,199
You're just an amateur, and if you mess the charm up, you might blow up the house.

549
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,109
<i>It's always wise to play it safe.</i>

550
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,929
<i>Because you are Tantai Jin, I will never teach you spells that can kill.</i>

551
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,090
Then, what are you going to teach me?

552
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,050
<i>[Till The End of The Moon]</i>

553
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:13,760
<i>[Black Moonlight - Zhang Bichen and Mao Buyi]</i>

554
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:21,519
♫ <i> Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon </i> ♫

555
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:29,219
♫ <i> The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm </i> ♫

556
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:37,040
♫ <i> Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain </i> ♫

557
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,619
♫ <i> Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain </i> ♫

558
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,120
♫ <i> We'll never meet again </i> ♫

559
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,279
♫ <i> I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words </i> ♫

560
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:54,120
♫ <i> Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense </i> ♫

561
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,299
♫ <i> Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof </i> ♫

562
00:50:58,299 --> 00:51:02,120
♫ <i> Embracing the endless lingering fear </i> ♫

563
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,659
♫ <i> I've admired you through the myriad of years </i> ♫

564
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,919
♫ <i> I believed I have been loved for a moment </i> ♫

565
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:13,439
♫ <i> I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil </i> ♫

566
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:21,400
♫ <i> And become devout like the flawless moonlight </i> ♫

567
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,119
♫ <i> Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

568
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,820
♫ <i> and how they are just like any other creature </i> ♫

♫ <i> The moonlight is my armor </i> ♫

571
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,499
♫ <i> I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars </i> ♫

572
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,619
♫ <i> And willingness to live a life in peace </i> ♫

573
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,239
♫ <i> You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil </i> ♫

574
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:58,379
♫ <i> And learned to love what you used to resent </i> ♫

575
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:05,979
♫ <i> Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky </i> ♫

576
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:14,320
♫ <i> And we'll make it something to remember us by </i> ♫
