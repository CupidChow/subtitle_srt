00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,400
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,140
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,280
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,720
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,139
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:07,180
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,239
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, to heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,280
♫  My existence  ♫

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,790
 As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power. 

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,580
Power.

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,620
So,

19
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,960
this is...

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,110
what power feels like.

21
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,420
 Since those demons can give me power, 

22
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,960
 why don't I live a different life? 

23
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,500
 Young Devil God almost killed himself in his nightmare. 

24
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,630
 Could it be he still doesn't want to live now? 

25
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,610
Tantai Jin.

26
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,120
What are you doing?

27
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,660
 Perfect timing. I'll test my power with you. 

28
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,620
Second Young Miss,

29
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,650
what do you think I'm doing?

30
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,239
Miss! Miss!

31
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,050
Miss! Miss!

32
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,950
Someone, please help!

33
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,410
Mr. Tantai killed Miss Xiwu!

34
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,460
Tantai Jin?

35
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,460
Second Young Miss?

36
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,070
What do you think I'm doing?

37
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,700
You're not doing needlework, are you?

38
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,150
Let me borrow your scissors. I have to trim my nails.

39
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,260
Miss, I trimmed your nails just a few days ago.

40
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
You didn't trim them well.

41
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,140
Ye Xiwu, it's you who took away my dagger in my dream.

42
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,189
Of course. Who else do you think it was?

43
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss, the imperial doctor said you almost injured your tendons.

44
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,849
You need to rest properly. Don't trim your nails carelessly.

45
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,620
 How am I supposed to convince him? 

46
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,700
 Tantai Jin, you can't die. 

47
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,920
 Forget it. 

48
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,380
 From now on, let's find a way to watch him closely. 

49
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,190
 And convince him with emotions and reason. 

50
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,949
Tantai Jin, I heard my sister has also woken up.

51
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,670
- Do you wanna go see her? 
 - No.

52
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,580
Taking a walk in the garden will liven your mood.

53
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Let's go.

54
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,950
Come on.

55
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,440
She'll be fine.

56
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,099
From what I see, Miss Ye has the fate of "ivy twining around a tree trunk"

57
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:21,619
With you, the tall tree, as her shield, she will be blessed and survive the crisis to live a life in peace.

58
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,229
Since you care for her so much, why don't you ask His Highness to grant your wish?

59
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,600
I do have my concerns about not giving my word to Bingchang.

60
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,140
In people's eyes, I'm the luckiest man alive.

61
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,280
I can have everything without moving my hands.

62
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,670
But everything isn't as simple as it seems.

63
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,900
You're worried that being the Sixth Prince,

64
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,139
if you marry a Ye who controls the army, there will only be more suspicion.

65
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,040
You read my mind, Junior Martial Uncle.

66
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,789
But this is indeed difficult.

67
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,690
But you've already decided, haven't you?

68
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,550
 Sixth Prince. 

69
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,120
Sixth Prince, Eldest Young Miss has awakened.

70
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,860
Your Highness, when I was taken by that demon,

71
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,370
I was so scared of not being able to see you again.

72
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,530
Bingchang.

73
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,070
Since I first saw you at that banquet,

74
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,340
I had something I wanted to say to you.

75
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,300
How I regret that I didn't say it earlier.

76
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,220
What did you want to say?

77
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,950
“I'm willing to die if we can be together.

78
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,760
I'd rather be lovers than envy immortals"

79
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,480
Don't cry. I'm also in love with you.

80
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,469
You're a distinguished prince, but I'm just a concubine's daughter.

81
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,740
When I gave my heart to you, I'll never love anyone else in this life.

82
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,580
Rest assured. I won't fail your love.

83
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,670
I'll have a proper arrangement for you.

84
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,180
We're both each other's love.

85
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,490
You deserve a justifiable status.

86
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,990
Bingchang, get some good rest and get better.

87
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll be back for you.

88
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,670
Okay... I'll be waiting for you, Your Highness.

89
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,110
 He might feel happier when he meets his loved one. 

90
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,980
 Oh no. 

91
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,580
 How come Sixth Prince is here, too? 

92
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,970
 Wouldn't the love rivals make things worse? 

93
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,790
 I'd better take Young Devil Lord out of here. 

94
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,500
Prince Tantai.

95
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,640
Second Young Miss. You're awake.

96
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
How are you feeling?

97
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,650
I'm okay.

98
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,770
Nothing serious now.

99
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,819
Thank you and  Secret Dragon Guard for sending us back. Bye.

100
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,640
Second Young Miss... there's something...

101
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,320
I need to talk about with you alone.

102
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Prince Tantai, would you excuse us?

103
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay.

104
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,470
Don't go too far.

105
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,630
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

106
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,530
The dream demon crisis helped me see clearly my love for Bingchang.

107
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,269
After I return to the palace today, I'll report this to His Majesty and ask him to grant our marriage.

108
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,499
I'm flattered that you're fond of me, but I hope that in the future, you will…

109
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,550
Accept this reality and stop badgering you?

110
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,180
Actually, I…

111
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,079
Never mind, it's too complicated.

112
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,900
Anyway, you may rest assured, Sixth Prince.

113
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,650
We won't disturb each other's lives.

114
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,849
We'll go our separate ways. There'll be nothing shady.

115
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,980
I hope you can keep your word.

116
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,750
Got it.

117
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,210
 This Ye Xiwu really seems to be a different person. 

118
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,270
 She's not obsessed with Xiao Lin. 

119
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,979
 She even specially cares about my life. 

120
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,700
   

121
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,549
 There's another thing. It's about Prince Tantai. 

122
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,490
Tantai Jin? What's up with him?

123
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,199
It's really lucky for Prince Tantai to be able to return unharmed.

124
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,190
If something happened to him, not only the Ye family, but the whole world could be in trouble.

125
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,010
Why are you saying so?

126
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,290
Looks like Miss Xiwu knows little about state affairs.

127
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,669
Tantai Jin is a hostage from the Jing Kingdom.

128
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,139
As a Tantai, his life is bonded with the fate of his nation.

129
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,199
If anything happens to him, it'll give the Jing Kingdom an excuse to attack us.

130
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,540
The Sheng Kingdom has been losing military talents these years.

131
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,630
It's definitely not a good time for war.

132
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,119
By then, even if His Majesty doesn't punish the Ye family for dereliction of duty,

133
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:38,570
once the war breaks out, all males of the Ye family must go to the frontline,

134
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,800
which is a disaster for your own family.

135
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,490
Once the fire of war ravages the field,

136
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,380
poverty and desolation will be a catastrophe for everyone.

137
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm going to keep an eye on him.

138
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,320
So that's how it is.

139
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,469
 Prince Tantai left his home country to be a guest in our kingdom.. 

140
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,199
 He did it for the peace of the two kingdoms. 

141
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,479
 And also for keeping the civilians free from the pains of war. 

142
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,199
 We should treat him politely. 

143
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,999
 How can you bully him without any scruples? 

144
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,450
Turns out, Xiao Lin only cared about me

145
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,480
because he was afraid I would bring disaster to his kingdom.

146
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,840
Ye Xiwu cares about me...

147
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,670
because she was afraid I would bring disaster to her family.

148
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,420
In their eyes, I'm just a jinx who only brings disasters.

149
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,680
Do you mean anything more when you say, "keep an eye on him"?

150
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,790
Sixth Prince,

151
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,290
I don't want to lie to you.

152
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,150
But I can't explain it to you further.

153
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:03,000
Honestly, I hate Tantai Jin more than anyone else.

154
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,140
 I wanna kill him even in my dreams. 

155
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,340
 I even wished... 

156
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,070
 he never existed in this world. 

157
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,050
But rest assured, I won't let him die.

158
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,840
But if you want me to truly care about him, it's impossible.

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,060
Ye Xiwu,

160
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,550
you finally told the truth.

161
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:49,040
All your performance in front of me was just for your own benefit.

162
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,890
Turns out...

163
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,720
you're no different from them.

164
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,930
 I actually thought... 

165
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,220
 someone would really care about me. 

166
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,470
Royal Father, the eldest daughter of General Ye and I have been in love.

167
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,730
Would you grant my wish to marry her?

168
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,900
Do you really love her?

169
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,940
I'll love her for the rest of my life.

170
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,490
Lin'er, don't say it too soon.

171
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,769
What exactly do you love about her?

172
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,500
Her looks or her heart?

173
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,609
Looks will eventually fade away, and people's hearts will also change.

174
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:08,349
Nothing in this world can let love last.

175
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,500
Royal Father, I don't know exactly why I love Bingchang.

176
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,750
Since childhood, everything I did had a proper reason, except falling in love with her.

177
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,110
I am following my heart with no other reason.

178
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,020
What a surprise.

179
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,749
There's actually someone in this world who can break you out of your norm.

180
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,670
All right, let me think about it.

181
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,020
Thank you, Royal Father.

182
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,500
Miss.

183
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,479
Miss, I got some news.

184
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,300
What is it?

185
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,419
There's an edict from the palace asking Madam Ye to see His Majesty.

186
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,439
Eldest Young Miss, could it be about your marriage?

187
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,389
After Sixth Prince went back, he must have asked His Majesty to grant marriage to you two.

188
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,950
But Her Ladyship favors Second Young Miss, if she says something in front of His Majesty…

189
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,390
Jiahui, don't say it like that.

190
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,109
Second Sister is already married.

191
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,140
It's a done deal.

192
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,489
No matter how much Grandmother favors her, there's no reason for her to stop my marriage.

193
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,940
Miss, you are thinking too simply.

194
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,159
Think about it. Ever since you were a child, be it clothes, jewelry, food, or things to enjoy,

195
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,069
when Second Young Miss gets something, you don't necessarily get it, too.

196
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:50,339
But if it's something even she can't have, have you ever had it?

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,980
Miss…

198
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,920
    
 You, Great General Ye Xiao's eldest daughter

199
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,480
who's known for her graceful appearance,

200
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,850
gentle character, kind heart,

201
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,180
and etiquette-conforming behaviors;

202
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,070
therefore, I grant her the title of Side Consort of Prince Xuancheng.

203
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,050
The end.

204
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,209
I accept and thank His Majesty's graciousness.

205
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,790
General Ye and Grand Princess Royal, please rise now.

206
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:41,240
Mr. Attendant, I wonder who this Prince Xuancheng is.

207
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,239
His Majesty issued two edicts today.

208
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,530
The other one is to grant Sixth Prince the title of Prince Xuancheng.

209
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,030
Blessings come in pairs, right?

210
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,960
I see.

211
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,500
Mother, look. Our Bingchang is such a lucky girl.

212
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,200
Even His Majesty cares about her.

213
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,519
Thanks for coming. Please come in and have some tea. Please.

214
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,020
Ye Bingchang is truly gentle and virtuous.

215
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,880
No wonder Lin'er likes her so much.

216
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,240
Isn't this a good thing?

217
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,670
Why did you sigh, Your Majesty?

218
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,980
Good thing?

219
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,510
Ye Xiao holds a high reputation in the army.

220
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,109
His second son, Ye Qingyu, who guards Jia Pass, is not to be underestimated.

221
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,580
How can I not be worried?

222
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,270
It's rare for Lin'er to ask something from me.

223
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:56,509
If this Ye woman becomes his official wife, she's probably going to be the Queen of Sheng.

224
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,880
He doesn't want to fail his woman, but I must consider the future of the Sheng Kingdom.

225
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,450
This is the dilemma of being a king.

226
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,190
 I'm telling you Ye Bingchang, no matter what you do, 

227
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,740
 you'll always be the daughter of a concubine. 

228
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,150
 I just need to have a word with Grandma, and you will only deserve to be a concubine. 

229
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,489
 Young Miss, ever since you were a child, when Second Young Miss gets something, you don't necessarily get it, too. 

230
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:39,570
 But if it's something even she can't have, have you ever had it? 

231
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,780
Miss, don't be upset.

232
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,550
Jiahui,

233
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,010
I really don't understand.

234
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,100
I've studied hard for years.

235
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm good at needlework.

236
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,350
Every word I say, every movement I make,

237
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,310
I can't be more cautious about them.

238
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm as obedient as I can possibly be.

239
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,230
But what exactly have I done wrong?

240
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,300
Why?

241
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,000
Why have things ended up the way they are today?

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,140
Miss, you haven't done anything wrong.

243
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,400
You can only blame the foul difference between a wife and a concubine.

244
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,850
I don't understand.

245
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,539
I don't understand. We're both daughters of the Ye family.

246
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,000
Why do this to me?

247
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,150
 So I must be Xiao Lin's official wife. 

248
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,610
 I must. 

249
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,860
Your Highness, please allow me to inform her.

250
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,830
Your Highness, you can't…

251
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,580
Your Highness, how come…

252
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,240
Bingchang, I obviously requested to marry you as my wife.

253
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,990
- But I didn't expect… 
 - Your Highness, Bingchang knows her place.

254
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,230
Actually, being able to marry you, is already enough for me.

255
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,580
Bingchang, you really don't have to force a smile with me.

256
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,089
You can just tell me you're disappointed that you can't be my official wife.

257
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:14,350
Bingchang, although you never cried or complained to me, I always knew

258
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,749
how you'd been treated in Ye Mansion and how you concealed your grievances.

259
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:22,210
Now seeing an edict like this, you must be really sad.

260
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't you think that I'm asking for things that are not mine?

261
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,580
That I desire too much?

262
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,290
So what if you do? Isn't love a kind of desire?

263
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,639
No woman in this world doesn't want to be the wife of their loved one.

264
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,210
Besides, you never harmed anyone else.

265
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,159
I want to be the husband of you rather than the husband of a saint.

266
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,179
All your depression and disappointment are your true feelings, which I can't cherish enough.

267
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,450
Why would I blame you for that?

268
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,120
♫   No more talk of leaving or staying   ♫

269
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,980
♫   Silence is the most comforting   ♫

270
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,820
♫    Why need alcohol when one can get oneself drunk?  ♫

271
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,200
Your Highness.

272
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,590
Bingchang.

273
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,160
Actually, I'm not worth you doing this.

274
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,910
No more thoughts like that.

275
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,300
You're the kindest and most beautiful girl in the world.

276
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,539
The position of my official wife will always be reserved for you.

277
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,310
I will give you a wedding just as grand as marrying an official wife.

278
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,080
From now on, be it happiness or hardships, we're in this together.

279
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,270
 A grand wedding. 

280
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:07,250
   

281
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,410
 "Enemies don't live under the same sky." 

282
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,120
 Time to settle the scores. 

283
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,210
   
 Congrats! 

284
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,070
 Congratulations. 

285
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,230
 Hello, welcome. 

286
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
 Please come inside. 

287
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,060
 - Here. 
 - Please, go ahead. 

288
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,650
 Emperor's Son-in-law, Gao Jie. 

289
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,040
   

290
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,180
 Marquis of Jinling, Qiu Yu. 

291
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,860
   

292
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,880
 Princess Yongxing's son, Cheng Peng. 

293
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,980
   

294
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,480
 Pillar of the State Great General is here! 

295
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,150
- Lord Ye, you're here. 
 - Greetings.

296
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,020
- Thank you for your congratulation. 
  You've gotten brash with your masters now? 

297
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,720
 I'm going to beat you up right now! 

298
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,640
 Pillar of the State Great General's son, Ye Zeyu. 

299
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,660
   

300
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,820
Tantai Jin! I finally found you.

301
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,749
Where have you been? I haven't seen you for quite a while.

302
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,030
 I hate Tantai Jin more than anyone else. 

303
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,390
 I want to kill him even in my dreams. 

304
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,190
Why are you looking at me like this? Is there anything on my face?

305
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,209
 Pillar of the State Great General's daughter, Ye Xiwu.  
    

306
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,450
What a lively day today.

307
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,100
All the high officials and nobles in the capital are here.

308
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,310
There's one missing.

309
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,900
Who?

310
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,250
 He's coming. 

311
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,939
Whose little brat is this? How dare you block my way?

312
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,790
Get lost.

313
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,830
My Lord, she's still a child.

314
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,809
Sorry for getting in your way. Please have mercy and let us go.

315
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,250
All right. I won't mind that she blocked my way.

316
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,370
- I'll kowtow to you. 
 - But...

317
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,549
today's the big day for my sixth brother.

318
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,480
And there's someone crying out loud in front of his gate.

319
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,650
This is so unlucky.

320
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,220
It's our fault.

321
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,540
Guards, do something!

322
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,039
My Lord, please spare my life!

323
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,550
Dad!

324
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,510
Please spare my dad!

325
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,599
 Prince Wuning, Xiao Liang.  
    

326
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,840
 Dad! 

327
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,100
He's bleeding!

328
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,179
- That's lucky! 
 - Dad!

329
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,260
Terrific. Let's go.

330
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,090
Greetings, Fifth Prince.

331
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,600
Prince Wuning is here!

332
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,790
Greetings, Fifth Prince.

333
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,970
Forego the formalities.

334
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,280
 He's the Fifth Prince who has been bullying Tantai Jin.  
 Did I come later or did you guys come early?

335
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,920
Of course, it's us who came early.

336
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,880
Well, well, Hostage Prince Tantai is also here!

337
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,850
And Second Young Miss, too!

338
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,500
Ever since you and the hostage got married,

339
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,400
you look prettier than before, Second Young Miss!

340
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,770
Greetings, Prince Wuning.

341
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,720
Forego the formalities.

342
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,619
Hostage, the Jing Kingdom regards black as the noble color. You're all dressed up today.

343
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:49,550
Are you here on behalf of the wife's family?

344
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,050
Today seems like a fun day!

345
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,580
Where is the fun?

346
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,549
I've seen how you desperately pursued Ye Bingchang.

347
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,870
How does it feel?

348
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,539
Seeing the woman you love becoming someone else's bride?

349
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,499
You must feel terrible, huh?

350
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,159
Xiao Lin is a prince.

351
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,280
You are also a prince.

352
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,549
He gets both power and beauty.

353
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,630
But your life is worse than a dog's.

354
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:27,529
I'm sure at this moment you must feel like hell in there, right?

355
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,450
 Is Young Devil Lord going to lose it? 

356
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,159
Prince Wuning, did you eat pickles for breakfast?

357
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,399
Why is your mouth so foul?

358
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,789
Ye Xiwu!

359
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,240
You!

360
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,720
How dare you talk to me like this?

361
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,000
Fifth Prince, you asked how I felt just now.

362
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,100
I feel happy for them, of course.

363
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,349
Coward.

364
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,550
Even a dog from the Jing Kingdom has more guts than you!

365
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,960
Farewell.

366
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,250
What did you say?

367
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,360
I said, Fifth Prince, farewell.

368
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,719
You do know the rules better than before.

369
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,340
Let's go.

370
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,749
Tantai Jin, don't take his words to heart.

371
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,130
He's just a despicable person.

372
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,380
Second Young Miss, there you are.

373
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,170
Scholar Pang.

374
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,770
What good stuff are you holding?

375
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,569
It's a wedding gift from the sect leader of Xiaoyao Sect, who told me to send this to Sixth Prince.

376
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,640
Heart-Guarding Scale?

377
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,199
Second Young Miss, you even know about this?

378
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,689
It's a scale from the chest of someone from the dragon race.

379
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,290
It's super tough.

380
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,250
It can protect you from all evil when worn.

381
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,700
This is a secret treasure of our sect.

382
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,340
I wonder why the old man is so generous this time.

383
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,620
Tan…

384
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,080
The auspicious time has come.

385
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,890
Please welcome Prince Xuancheng, and Consort of Prince Xuancheng!

386
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,820
 First bow to Heaven and Earth! 

387
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,400
 Second bow to thank His Majesty! 

388
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,910
 Husband and wife bow to each other! 

389
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,600
The ritual is finished!

390
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,580
 Good! 

391
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,470
 What a perfect couple! So wonderful! 

392
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,210
 Where does this crow come from? 

393
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,590
Why is there a crow here?

394
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,780
 Miserable people of a dying kingdom, how long will your good days last? 

395
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,320
 The crows are about to land. 

396
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,980
 Whose roof will they land on? 

397
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,089
What does this mean?

398
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,100
I don't know.

399
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,089
How can it talk?

400
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,770
This beast can talk?

401
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,730
Fifth Prince, are you all right?

402
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,149
 Crows everywhere! Run! 

403
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,760
 Quickly! 

404
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,760
   

405
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,820
   

406
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,280
   

407
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,160
- Father! 
 - Watch out!

408
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,319
Your Highness, take the Heart-Guarding Scale!

409
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,319
Escort Consort out first! Leave here to me. Now!

410
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:08,329
Thanks, Junior Martial Uncle! Let's go, Bingchang.

411
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,400
   

412
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,839
Wait here for a while in this side hall.

413
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,510
I'll come back for you when I save the guests.

414
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,759
Your Highness, please don't go! I'm scared!

415
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,289
- But the people outside… 
 - I don't care.

416
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,740
I just want you by my side.

417
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,500
Bingchang, listen to me.

418
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,189
The people outside are either guests attending our wedding or my guards and servants.

419
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:57,669
I can't just leave them in danger.

420
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,629
Are they more important than me?

421
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:01,629
I'm your newly-married wife!

422
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,500
How can you leave me behind to save others?

423
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,030
Bingchang, trust me.

424
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,580
You're going to be fine.

425
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,320
Wait for me.

426
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,420
   

427
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,780
   

428
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,230
 My face! 

429
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,230
Help me!

430
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,920
Zeyu!

431
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,810
 You actually know how to use charms. 

432
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,750
 Go! 

433
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,060
 Ye Xiwu, you really surprise me. 

434
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,999
   

435
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,860
It's fine.

436
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,630
- Come on. 
 - My legs!

437
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,360
Go now, Zeyu! Faster!

438
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,669
Zeyu!

439
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,180
- What happened to you? 
  - It hurts!

440
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,409
 Where's Young Devil Lord? Was he not able to escape?  
 Dad, I'm disfigured!

441
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,799
You'll be fine. Let's go!

442
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,669
-  If anything happens to Young Devil Lord,   
 - Come on!

443
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,190
-  we'll be doomed.  
 - Listen to me!

444
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,170
- Come on! 
 - My legs hurt. I can't walk, Dad!

445
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,580
What? What's wrong with your legs?

446
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,260
- Xiwu, you can't… 
 - Dad!

447
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,119
- I can't let Xiwu go in there! 
 - I'm already dying! Dad!

448
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,980
So this is the taste of vengeance, huh?

449
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,000
Doesn't feel like too much fun.

450
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,810
Tantai Jin!

451
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,980
You did this!

452
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,530
This is the Heart-Guarding Scale.

453
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,860
Miss Bingchang,

454
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,140
keep your wedding gift.

455
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,870
I wish you...

456
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,180
a happy wedding.

457
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,360
Okay.

458
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,740
 Oh no. I've used up all my charms. 

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,650
 Even if I had the power to kill anyone, 

460
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,770
 I didn't feel any fluctuation in my heart. 

461
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,740
 Except at that moment, 

462
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,050
 in which I felt something different.  
    

463
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,610
Tantai Jin!

464
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,940
 Ye Xiwu? 

465
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,480
 I've let you go. But you won't let me go? 

466
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,379
♫   I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky   ♫

467
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,260
♫   Suspending the firefly and butterfly until the wind and snow arrive   ♫

468
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:00,300
♫   I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time to forget everything that's occurred   ♫

469
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,079
♫   I want to suspend a dream where I can exchange my tears for your return   ♫

470
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,700
♫   My heart's in flames  ♫

471
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:13,720
♫   Otherwise, we will spend ten thousand years like this   ♫

472
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,960
♫   Let's stop time before we say farewell   ♫

473
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,619
♫   Let the sweetness of your slight smile   ♫

474
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,780
♫   and the saltiness of my tears   ♫

475
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:34,040
♫   be your repayment and my debt   ♫

476
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,860
This is great!

477
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,390
Tantai Jin, you're not dead and I'm not dead.

478
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,629
We both survived!

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,199
♫   A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away   ♫

480
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:51,799
♫  I know that your unforgettable glance is like a sword piercing into the bone  ♫

481
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:55,530
 Ye Xiwu, didn't you hate me? 

482
00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:02,400
 How could you sacrifice your life in order to save me? 

483
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,559
This is such a serious incident, but the culprit is still unknown!

484
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,380
Your Majesty, this matter is quite weird.

485
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,369
The crows were conjured by some demon. They were quite fierce, but none of the guests were killed.

486
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,250
Most of them fainted or got pecked on their faces.

487
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,500
These creatures must have been secretly manipulated by someone.

488
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,809
This culprit harbors evil designs. I shall never tolerate him!

489
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:32,819
Investigate!

490
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,439
Keep investigating!

491
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,940
The culprit must be found!

492
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,260
 - Yes! 
 - Yes! 

493
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,299
 So, the power I devoured from the demons will eventually run out. 

494
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:54,330
 If I knew how to cultivate like Xiao Lin does, 

495
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,480
 I'd be able to sustain my power without devouring demons. 

496
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,259
 I wonder if that sect… 

497
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:01,860
Tantai Jin!

498
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,529
Tantai Jin! Did you get injured somewhere? Let me check.

499
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:10,349
We've been through life and death. Don't be shy.

500
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm not injured.

501
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,079
Even Xiao Lin, who has excellent swordsmanship, has multiple injuries.

502
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,550
While you remain unharmed?

503
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,510
Are you suspecting me?

504
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,780
No.

505
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,030
I was just saying you're lucky.

506
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:43,270
Because I know if you want to live, you have to hide.

507
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:48,720
Unlike someone who ran around like a headless fly.

508
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,360
I did that to save you!

509
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,440
You little ingrate!

510
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,730
If I didn't run faster, you'd have been killed by those birds.

511
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,820
Why did you come back for me?

512
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,669
Because I'm kind.

513
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,090
I'd do the same for anyone else.

514
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,279
Back then everyone was running out of the mansion.

515
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,200
Did you especially come back just to save me?

516
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,190
I…

517
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,090
Because I like you, all right?

518
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,359
Love lingers even after only being married for a day.

519
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,630
Saving you is what I'm supposed to do, huh?

520
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,260
- You love me? 
 - Yeah.

521
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,409
Just like in the novels. In the beginning, we didn't see eye to eye, but eventually, we grew fond of each other.

522
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,480
You saved me because of love?

523
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,380
What is love exactly?

524
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,439
Love is… Love is you don't want him to die.

525
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,319
You want to stay with him.

526
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:12,919
You'll be worried if you don't see him.

527
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,880
You'll be happy if you do.

528
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,180
 I'm sorry, Young Devil Lord. I didn't mean to lie to you. 

529
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:29,880
 Love, compared with power, is truly something not worth mentioning. 

530
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,010
All right.

531
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,629
If you love me, why don't you teach me how to draw charms?

532
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,160
This way, we can spend more time together.

533
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,859
Why do you want to learn that?

534
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:50,710
Because I want to be like you, capable of protecting my loved one.

535
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,630
 Young Devil Lord actually has someone he wants to protect now. 

536
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,180
Okay.

537
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,559
I'll teach you how to draw charms, and you promise me to live on.

538
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,100
I don't want to have to risk my life to save you again.

539
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,280
Okay.

540
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,640
   

541
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,980
   

542
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,380
What are you doing here?

543
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,859
I keep my word.

544
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:19,380
I'm here to fulfill my promise, of course.

545
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,380
Teach me.

546
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,569
What should I teach you…

547
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:33,059
The one you used to repel the crows at Xiao Lin's that day.

548
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:35,820
Not that one. That spell is too dangerous.

549
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,199
You're just an amateur, and if you mess the charm up, you might blow up the house.

550
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,109
 It's always wise to play it safe. 

551
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,929
 Because you are Tantai Jin, I will never teach you spells that can kill. 

552
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,090
Then, what are you going to teach me?

553
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,050
