<i>[Episode 18]</i>

16
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,630
I'm powerful enough to do anything,

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,290
but I still lost to her.

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,120
<i>Ye Bingchang, you're awake, finally.</i>

19
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,090
Who are you? Why are you talking to me?

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,210
<i>After going through Enlightened Life, have you learned anything?</i>

21
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,390
<i>You've been jealous of Ye Xiwu since you were little, but you couldn't do anything about it.</i>

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,130
<i>You could only lie to yourself over and over again, convincing yourself that</i>

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,320
<i>Ye Xiwu was the noble daughter of a legitimate wife</i>

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,800
<i>while you are just a lowly concubine's daughter.</i>

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,850
<i>That's why you were inferior to her</i>

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>and you didn't deserve everything she had.</i>

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,390
<i>How pathetic!</i>

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,570
Nonsense. I don't need to compare myself with her at all.

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,390
<i>Really?</i>

30
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,200
<i>But why did you take someone else's love thread as your own?</i>

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,060
<i>Does your husband Xiao Lin really love you?</i>

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,320
<i>What if you don't have the extra love thread with you?</i>

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,020
How did you know that?

34
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,110
<i>Since having this treasure, you've gained extraordinary charm</i>

35
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,930
<i>that can conquer many men, haven't you?</i>

36
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,070
<i>But fortune and misfortune are two buckets in the same well.</i>

37
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>The dream demon kidnapped you</i>

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,020
<i>because she was attracted by this love thread.</i>

39
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,590
So you're here to kindly remind me?

40
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,290
<i>If you want to defeat Ye Xiwu, you'll need more than love threads.</i>

41
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,460
<i>When in Enlightened Life, even if you were the goddess of the Flying Serpent clan,</i>

42
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,600
<i>didn't she take everything from you again?</i>

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,310
<i>Tian Huan was born so noble.</i>

44
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>If she did not blindly love the wrong man,</i>

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,750
<i>how would she end up in dismay?</i>

46
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,690
What exactly are you trying to say?

47
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,730
<i>Life is short.</i>

48
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,650
<i>If you only rely on your good looks,</i>

49
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,930
<i>bet everything on a man, and fail to seize the chance,</i>

50
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,120
<i>you can only and will always be a loser.</i>

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,960
<i>Tian Huan's tragedy will be your future.</i>

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,830
I'm not Tian Huan, and I have nothing to do with her!

53
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,240
Tian Huan has the power of the flying serpent,

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,850
but all she knows is to be jealous and try to please Mingye.

55
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,510
I'm nothing like her.

56
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,570
<i>What's different about you?</i>

57
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,290
In this world,

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,810
nobody is more worthy of my love than me.

59
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,000
Tian Huan is willing to kill for her man,

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,300
but I will only do that for myself.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,740
<i>Clever girl.</i>

62
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,390
<i>May you be luckier than Tian Huan.</i>

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,430
Tian Huan.

64
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,100
It's the God-slaying Lightning.

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Sang Jiu.

66
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,880
Sang Jiu, what's that?

67
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,660
It's a gem that I forged with the divine essence

68
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,420
of the entire Flying Serpent clan.

69
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,180
This tiny piece contains the powers of immortals.

70
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,100
It's capable of overturning Heaven and Earth.

71
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,130
Why don't I call it World-alluring Jade?

72
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,300
Do you want to use it to revive your father and brother?

73
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,940
What's wrong with that? So are you here to stop me again?

74
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,050
Sang Jiu, don't use it.

75
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,690
You killed immortals for their divine essence and forged this evil object with devil fire.

76
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,130
It has harmed the heavenly harmony.

77
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,780
That's why the lightning punishment has come.

78
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,780
Everything in this world is connected by karma.

79
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Once you use its power, you'll have to repay it someday.

80
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,430
You will be doomed in the end.

81
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,470
Doomed in the end?

82
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,950
From the moment when I drew the Water-calming Sword, I never thought of any good ending!

83
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,540
Mingye, you mind everyone's business too much.

84
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,160
Out of my way!

85
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,510
What?

86
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,400
Do you want me to pay them with my life?

87
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,040
No. I just thought of another way.

88
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,250
Sang Jiu, you don't have to be a female demon anymore.

89
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,810
Everything can still be redeemed.

90
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,620
What's your way? With the so-called Bone-refining Seal?

91
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,950
Or did you borrow any treasure from someone else?

92
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,910
The Bone-refining Seal has been sealed by me in the Divine Platform.

93
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,590
You're right.

94
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:04,700
This shouldn't be a trade or a favor but compensation.

95
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,160
What are you up to?

96
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,270
Sang Jiu, look. This is the God-slaying Lightning.

97
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,230
It is powerful enough to shatter an immortal's soul.

98
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,310
It appeared...

99
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,520
because of your breaking the rules of Heaven and forging the World-alluring Jade.

100
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,130
If it strikes, you may not survive.

101
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,910
Is this lightning punishment for me?

102

Sang Jiu, I'll take the punishment for you.

111
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,470
When my immortal body vanishes,

112
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,790
my divine essence will replace your devil bone.

I never found a chance to apologize to you.

121
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,950
It's my first time being a husband.

122
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,880
I didn't know how to love you.

123
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,960
And for such a long time, I didn't do anything for you.

124
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,430
When I start to understand,

125
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,310
you don't want anything.

126
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,690
It was me who didn't protect you.

127

I'm sorry.

128

You did nothing wrong.

129
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,400
As your husband, I'm not good enough.

130
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,570
It was me...

131
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,090
who made you a demon.

132
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,940

137
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,600
You kept tricking me into picking leaves endlessly.

138
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,110
I'd also think of you.

139
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,020
You were running, jumping, sleeping...

140

If I could choose,

142
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,310
I really hope that I can stay with you in that cottage in the bamboo forest.

143
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,700
I dream of living the rest of our lives in tranquility.

144
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,940

Mingye, actually, I should've died long ago.

157
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,810
My physical body...

158
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,340
had been devoured when I was in Barren Abyss.

159
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>I don't understand.</i>

160
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,230

<i>Why do we have to be bullied but Tian Huan can be forgiven?</i>

163
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,640
Due to the hatred within, I didn't die.

164
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Instead, I transformed into a devil.

165
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,550
That's why...

166
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,060
I won't survive this lightning punishment.

167
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,540
I won't be able to accept your divine essence.

168
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,460
You can never repay me.

169
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,550
You owe this to me.

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,500
Now that you want to devilize,

176
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,330
then I...

177
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,030
will devilize together with you.

178
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,000
<i>Who am I?</i>

179
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,650
<i>Am I Li Susu</i>

180
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,620
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

181
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>or Sang Jiu?</i>

182
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>What's wrong with its eyes?</i>

183
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,890
<i>This flood dragon keeps sleeping to experience dreams in Enlightened Life.</i>

184
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,450
<i>Whether he'll be the devil or god, this is the moment of truth.</i>

185
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,710
<i>No.</i>

186
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,370
<i>If my soul disintegrates like this,</i>

187
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,600
<i>Mingye will surely devilize due to desperation.</i>

188
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,710
<i>Mingye, you must think clearly.</i>

189
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,070
<i>Since you can't pull Sang Jiu out of her devilizing fate,</i>

190
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,000
<i>live on for her.</i>

191
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
<i>The Mingye whom Sang Jiu deeply loved</i>

192
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,130
<i>isn't someone who bows to fate.</i>

193
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,940
<i>He's always been that God of War in armor.</i>

194
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,860
<i>The devil soldiers haven't left,</i>

195
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,190
<i>which means I can still see you today.</i>

196
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,040
<i>If I cultivate hard and enter Shangqing God Realm,</i>

197
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,980
<i>I wonder if I'll get to speak with you.</i>

198
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,410
<i>Will I be able tell you there is</i>

199
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,590

200
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,390
<i>She loved the God of War, who protected</i>

216

you were that God of War who was always protecting others.

Ye Xiwu!

240
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,940
Your Majesty, this is the illusion the flood dragon created.

241
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,410
It carries its memories.

242
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,330
This flood dragon is so wicked.

243
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,860
I've dragged people in here for nothing.

244
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,780
Your Majesty, the water-repelling barrier is about to disappear.

245
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,050
We must go ashore quickly.

246
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,280
<i>Mingye,</i>

247
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,670
<i>why did you choose me to enter your Enlightened Life?</i>

248
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,280
We've finally got out of this damn river and put our feet on the ground.

249
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,900
Xiwu.

250
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,580
<i>Kill her!</i>

251
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,130
Xiwu, I'm your elder sister.

252
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,160
Elder Sister, sorry. I was just…

253
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,240
It's okay. It's in the past.

254
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,930
Bingchang. Second Young Miss. Are you all right?

255
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,340
Where's that sleeping flood dragon?

256
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,720
It had long transcended and died at the bottom of the river.

257
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,050
After ten thousand years, the only thing left is its bones.

258
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,180
But it left a dream to attract people to come.

259
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,110
It managed to make you enter his dream and experience his life.

260
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,910
Why would he do that?

261
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,570
<i>For a prophecy.</i>

262
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,250
<i>To destroy the evil bones,</i>

263
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,860
<i>you'll need three keys.</i>

264
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,840
<i>A dream.</i>

265
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,860
<i>You can only awaken it after entering its dream.</i>

266
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,850
<i>A teardrop.</i>

267
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,530
<i>A thread.</i>

268
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,340
Mingye didn't devilize in the end.

269
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,910
and was lovesick.

270
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,460
So he left this illusion after he died.

271
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,800
It's probably for enlightening the destined ones.

272
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,530
What did you see in there?

273
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,700
How did it enlighten you?

274
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,150
<i>Sang Jiu, I hope that someday</i>

275
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,630
<i>somewhere in this world,</i>

276
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,790
<i>Mingye and you can meet each other again.</i>

277
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,680
Luckily, Tantai Jin didn't get the flood dragon.

278
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,020
Let's go back to the camp first.

279
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,900
I still have some unfinished business.

280
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm not going back with you.

281
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,430
Are you kidding, my Second Young Miss?

282
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,570
What are you going to do again?

283
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm going to Jing Kingdom.

284
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,650
I'll tell you when I make it.

285
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,550
Second Young Miss, do you have a death wish?

286
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,710
You've just ruined Tantai Jin's big plan.

287
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,110
Now if you go back and get caught by him,

288
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,350
he'll have your guts for garters!

289
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,010
Let her go.

290
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,220
Although I don't know what you're going to do,

291
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,430
I believe you'll definitely make it.

292
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,740
Everyone, we shall meet again someday in this big world.

293
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,620
Take care.

294
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,520
By the way, Scholar Pang.

295
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,250
This thing is called the Mirror of the Past.

296
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,330
When you return to the immortal sect someday,

297
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,700
remember to take it back to Xiaoyao Sect.

301

<i>I'll need Devil Lord to grow love threads and fall in love with me.</i>

<i>Then there's only one thing I need to do.</i>

306
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,210
Your Majesty, you seem to be a little absent-minded since getting out of Enlightened Life.

Every day you wait here for quite some time.

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,830
<i>It's already been so many days.</i>

346
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,320
<i>Ye Xiwu and Xiao Lin must've left.</i>

347
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,440
Your Majesty, General Ye brought reinforcement here.

348
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,150
Let's go back to the Jia Pass camp.

349
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,350
<i>Tantai Jin!</i>

350
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,100
Haven't you already left? Why do you come back?

351
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,870
Good or bad, I have to follow my husband.

352
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,790
Well, don't you want me anymore?

353
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,210
Sweet talking.

354
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,790
<i>Why is he cold to me again?</i>

355
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,890
Tie her up.

356
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,170
Wh-What are you doing?

357
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,860
I sincerely came to follow you.

358
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,720
I swam here!

359
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,390
I also walked for days.

360
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,670
My feet are worn out.

361
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,460
Did you swim here?

362
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,450
Give me that.

363
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,530
Chief Pian.

364
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,940
Take her back.

365
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,030
See if she's possessed by something evil.

366
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,220
Remember to check carefully.

367
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,730
Okay.

368
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,260
Wait…

369
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,580
My little darling, what the heck are you doing?

370
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,970
Just stay put in here. Don't play any tricks.

371
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,470
Otherwise, that person will really pull out my fox fur.

372
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm most willing to follow you.

373
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,270
Why would I run away?

374
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,830
They really treat me like a prisoner.

375
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,990
The first step is always the hardest.

376
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,170
It's true that if you let go of your ego,

377
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,650
you'll be able to say anything.

378
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,550
<i>What exactly should I do to let Young Devil Lord love me</i>

379
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,820
<i>and grow love threads?</i>

380
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,210
Just now, when I held his arm by the river,

381
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,790
that Soul-slaying Teardrop seemed to be warming up.

382
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,550
I guess I'll need to take the initiative.

383
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,480
<i>Second Young Miss, hold on.</i>

384
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,340
<i>Miss Xiwu.</i>

385
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,000
Who's there?

386
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,100
It's me!

387
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,230
Let her in.

388
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,500
Can I sleep here tonight?

389
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,330
No.

390
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,630
Did Sang Jiu leave you

391
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,310
some kind of trauma that night?

392
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,890
Shut up.

393
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,180
In this case,

394
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,280
didn't you realize anything after being through Enlightened Life?

395
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,020
Realization?

396
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,440
Ye Xiwu, you're so shameless.

397
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,580
What the hell were you thinking?

398
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,510
What? It's not that.

399
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,900
Why do you always have weird thoughts?

400
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,090
- I…
- I meant sentiments or inspiration.

401
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,080
Sentiments and inspirations.

402
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,730
Sentiments and inspirations?

403
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,620
Of course, I have some.

404
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,530
First. Mingye was such a fool.

405
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,180
He actually gave up the power of a god for a woman.

406
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,150
Second. The ancient Devil Lord is truly mighty.

407
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,960
Someday, I'll replace him.

408
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,140
<i>Oh no! Why are you admiring the Devil Lord?</i>

409
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,930
You know what? Tantai Jin,

410
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,560
for such a sad and sentimental love story,

411
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,040
don't you have any other thoughts?

412
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,000
Like, I'd think that if I loved someone,

413
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,930
I'd never be as humble as Sang Jiu.

414
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,470
I should say it out loud.

415
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,550
Say it out loud?

416
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,650
That was why I came for you.

417
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,240
♫ <i> Spending a lifetime just to see one person </i> ♫

418
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,750
♫ <i> From the first glance to being immersed in passion </i> ♫

419
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,930
Nian Baiyu.

420
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,750
<i>- At your service.</i>
- Drag her out of here.

421
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,760
♫ <i> We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts </i> ♫

422
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,320
Tantai Jin, are you being shy?

423
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,700
Drag her out.

424
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,250
Yes.

425
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,540
- Are-Are you being shy?
- Let's go, Second Young Miss.

426
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,410
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

427
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,680
<i>- You're blushing.</i>
- I…

428
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,500
- Second Young Miss.
- You're definitely being shy!

429
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
<i>It's true. Tantai Jin, you're being shy.</i>

430
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,570
Lock her in the camp. Don't let her bother me again.

431
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,030
If she keeps wandering, you punish her with a beating.

432
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,390
<i>Did Soul-slaying Teardrop warm up again?</i>

433
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,410
Can I even be shy?

434
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,600
<i>It's strange. Whenever I think of Ye Xiwu these days,</i>

435
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,700
<i>I'll have a tickling sensation in my chest.</i>

436
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,330
<i>Like something's about to come out.</i>

437
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,090
Your Highness, are you tired?

438
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,540
No, my mind just wandered.

439
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,670
Are you still thinking about the things in Enlightened Life?

440
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,620
Your Highness, I didn't choose to go into that dream.

441
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,270
I never wanted to do what Tian Huan committed.

442
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,050
That battle I fought with you at the bottom of the Mo River

443
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,550
still gives me the chills when I recall it.

444
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,230
If you're going to blame me for it…

445
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,370
Then I… I'll…

446
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,470
Why would I? You're not Tian Huan.

447
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,420
I'm not Sang You, either.

448
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,230
We both know that it's just a dream.

449
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,890
Your Highness, I'm a vulnerable woman.

450
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,740
I can only live with your protection.

451
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,480
Bingchang, now our kingdom is at stake.

452
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,810
Although I'm the crown prince,

453
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,980
I'm also your husband.

454
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,300
No matter how things will end, I will protect you well.

455
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,580
I won't leave you behind.

456
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,520
Why are you suddenly saying things like this?

457
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,650
A man's misfortune is often due to himself.

458
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,460
But a woman's is often due to her husband.

459
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,100
Just like Sang Jiu who married the wrong man

460
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,540
and eventually became a demon out of hatred.

461
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,370
Although I'd been her brother only in the dream,

462
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,940
my heart still aches when I think of her now.

463
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,340
Your Highness is so kind-hearted.

464
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,910
But my sister has gone to Jing Kingdom.

465
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,400
She'll be the wife of a king,

466
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,360
with limitless wealth and rank.

467
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,550
She won't need love from a fake brother.

468
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,150
Yeah. It's just a dream, after all.

469
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,000
Now the one I'll love and protect is you.

470
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,080
<i>Why did you take someone else's love thread as your own?</i>

471
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,830
<i>Does your husband Xiao Lin really love you?</i>

472
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,650
<i>What if you didn't have that extra love thread on you?</i>

473
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,900
<i>Yeah, without the love thread,</i>

474
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,330
<i>how could he love me so truly like this?</i>

475
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,170
<i>Without the love thread,</i>

476
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,400
<i>I'll still be that bullied and ignored concubine's daughter.</i>

477
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,030
<i>With no one to care about or pity me.</i>

478
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,720
<i>Putting on a smile for others every day.</i>

479
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,000
<i>But everything of mine had already been snatched by them.</i>

480
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,900
<i>This dream really lets me see myself and my so-called family.</i>

481
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,650
<i>Ye Bingchang, you must think more for yourself.</i>

482
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,630
<i>Put this love thread into good use.</i>

483
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,850
Your Majesty, I've sent Second Young Miss back to the camp.

484
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,400
<i>Have some tea.</i>

485
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,000
<i>You…</i>

486
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,350
<i>Drag her out!</i>

487
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,870
<i>- Are-Are you being shy?
- Let's go, Second Young Miss.</i>

488
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,510
<i>You're definitely being shy.</i>

489
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,660
<i>That's true. Tantai Jin, you're being shy.</i>

490
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,030
<i>Why am I happy for no reason when I see her?</i>

491
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,420
<i>[Jia Pass]</i>

492
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,390
Good Pianran, I can undergo manifold ordeals,

493
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,580
but not this one.

494
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,050
You have no choice.

495
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,210
Sending you here to clean the poultry house and look after these military provisions

496
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,810
is the order from His Majesty. Let's go.

497
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,090
How can Tantai Jin be so cruel?

498
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,420
Why are these geese so big?

499
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,470
I can't do this. My head hurts.

500
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,560
I'm sweating and I can't catch my breath.

501
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,930
You think I don't know your little plan?

502
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,420
You came back this time to seduce Tantai Jin, didn't you?

503
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,270
Is that so obvious?

504
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,780
No need to be embarrassed.

505
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,920
However, His Majesty will be back in the capital soon.

506
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,730
If you don't want to be left alone, raising geese in the camp at Jia Pass by then,

507
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,700
just work hard now.

508
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,350
No.

509
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
Don't go.

510
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,380
<i>[Stability for People is a Virtue]</i>

511
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,600
Where's His Majesty?

512
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
He's patrolling the military camp.

513
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,750
Why are you bringing luggage? Where are you headed?

514
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,490
By His Majesty's order, I'm going back to the capital for family affairs.

515
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,900
Fine. You don't feel comfortable staying at the frontline, anyway.

516
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,610
It's better that you go back.

517
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,810
We'll also be back in a few days.

518
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,530
I'll leave first. I'll be waiting for you…

519
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,890
I'll be waiting for you guys to come back.

520
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,130
<i>I'm here to inform you</i>

521
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,660
<i>that your wife's raising geese now.</i>

522
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,600
<i>Men are the cruelest creatures.</i>

523
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,610
<i>Baiyu, go take a look.</i>

524
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,080
No!

525
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,550
Tantai Jin, you're so bad!

526
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,210
<i>Why is Young Devil Lord's smile different?</i>

527
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,560
<i>Did I see it wrong?</i>

528
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,210
Ye Xiwu.

529
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,930
She has a fever. Call the medic.

530
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,140
I'll give her medicine right away.

531
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,830
Get up. Stop faking it.

532
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,290
Do you want me to find some geese to wake you up?

533
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,950
What happened to me?

534
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,770
You caught a cold when you swam across the river.

535
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,880
Plus, you were quite frightened.

536
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,480
It's all your fault.

537
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,550
So many feathered brutes.

538
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,770
They were everywhere.

539
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,150
Get up and eat something.

540
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,690
What do you have?

541
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,870
Boiled goose eggs.

542
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,430
Steamed goose egg custard.

543
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,810
Salted goose meat.

544
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,230
<i>Seriously? You killed them all for one offense?</i>

545
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,200
<i>How horrible.</i>

546
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,930
Come on, dig in.

547
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,740
But I'm so weak.

548
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,880
I can't raise the chopsticks or peel an egg.

549
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,130
Could you feed me?

550
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,470
Ye Xiwu, I'm afraid you not only caught a cold

551
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,520
but also had some other illness in your head.

552
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,500
Medic!

553
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,260
Stop! Why are you so heartless?

554
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,760
Would I never be able to see you if I didn't faint?

555
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,170
I'll count to three.

556
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,330
All right, I'll eat.

557
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,910
Does it taste good?

558
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,560
Not bad.

559
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,930
Tantai Jin,

560
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:53,030
did you think I was funny when I was chased by geese just now?

561
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,990
I saw that you were quite happy.

562
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,970
Did you have a tickle in your heart,

563
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,730
and you couldn't help smiling?

564
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,980
I did.

565
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,460
Is that what happiness feels like?

566
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,220
What happiness? It's clearly unkindness.

567
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,600
You enjoyed watching me suffer.

568
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,800
<i>Young Devil Lord learned to be happy.</i>

569
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,300
<i>Has his love threads started to awaken</i>

570
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,010
<i>after being through Enlightened Life?</i>

571
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,960
<i>Then as long as I put more effort into it,</i>

572
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,480
<i>wouldn't success be in the bag?</i>

573
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,370
Enjoy your meal.

574
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,680
Where are you going?

575
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,900
Since you're already fine, get some good rest, then.

576
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm leaving.

577
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,160
You'll go back to the capital in a few days. Could you take me along?

578
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,650
You want to go back to the Jing Kingdom with me?

579
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:19,190
If not for this, why would I try so hard to swim across the river?

580
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,120
Yeah.

581
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,100
I'm also wondering why.

582
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,250
Don't say anything like "Following your husband everywhere."

583
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,970
On the ship back to the Jing Kingdom, you made it rather clear.

584
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,300
You didn't want to have anything to do with me.

585
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,940
Didn't you leave with Xiao Lin yesterday?

586
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,040
Why didn't you just let him bring you back to the Sheng Kingdom?

587
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,350
I just want to go with you.

588
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:03,630
Ye Xiwu, you've been weird since you left Enlightened life.

589
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,530
I'm telling you. I'm not Mingye.

590
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,830
I'm not as righteous as he is.

591
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,700
I don't want to save the three worlds

592
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,230
or protect all the people out there.

593
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,800
I know you're not Mingye.

594
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
And I'm not Sang Jiu, either.

595
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,230
But they're a couple.

596
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,420
We're also a couple.

597
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,570
Sang Jiu and Mingye couldn't disentangle themselves from their painful relationship.

598
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,480
We still have chances.

599
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,910
What's more, on my way here, I met a lot of civilians.

600
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,050
They don't care who the king is.

601
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,500
They'll go wherever they can to sustain their lives.

602
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,640
You governed your kingdom well.

603
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,910
Not only do I like you and want to follow you,

604
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:47,560
everybody else thinks the same.

605
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,280
Ye Xiwu, you're full of lies.

606
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,690
How can I trust you?

607
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,950
I'm here and at your disposal anyway.

608
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,750
Believe it or not.

609
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,580
At my disposal?

610
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,650
A royal maid?

611
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,170
Yeah.

612
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,480
Didn't you say you're at his disposal?

613
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,560
The royal maid's clothes look good, though.

614
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:44,000
Not bad. A cold monarch versus an unruly handmaid.

615
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,330
This feels so right.

616
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:04,340
Your Highness, Fuyu tried so hard to save you from the brink of death.

617
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,090
Please take good care of your body.

618
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,730
Yeah.

619
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,350
Thanks to you.

620
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,430
I can still live with no dignity in this dark cave.

621
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,520
Any news about Tantai Jin?

622
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,280
I heard Tantai Jin had conquered Jia Pass.

623
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,770
He'll be back in the capital soon.

624
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,710
Those spineless ministers in court

625
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,160
have all paid allegiance to him.

626
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:34,400
How is he qualified to be the King of Jing Kingdom?

627
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,780
Your Highness, whatever they do,

628
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,050
I'll always be by your side.

629
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,100
Did you find the people I told you to look for?

630
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,770
Good. Let them all in.

631
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,340
All of the best sorcerers of Jing Kingdom are here.

632
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,300
<i>Greetings, Your Highness.</i>

633
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,210
You're all experienced and knowledgeable cultivators.

634
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,580
I'll cut to the chase.

635
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,410
Do you know how Tantai Jin obtained the ability to use demonic hexes?

636
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,410
I heard he's been hunting demon creatures to devour demon cores.

637
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,680
<i>- That's right.
- Devouring demon cores is a forbidden way of cultivation.</i>

638
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,630
<i>- It's extremely risky.
- How could Your Highness put yourself in danger?</i>

639
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,710
Enough!

640
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,350
If Tantai Jin can do this, why can't I?

641
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:49,250
I must let him pay for what he did to me.

642
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:53,430
I can't wait one minute longer.

643
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:59,300
