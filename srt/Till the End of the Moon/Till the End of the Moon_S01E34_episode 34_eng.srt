3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,420
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,640
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,000
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,240
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:03,180
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,260
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,560
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad  ♫

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,180
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, to heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

13
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,260
♫  My existence  ♫

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:31,000
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,160
   

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,980
   

17
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,410
I'm afraid. I'm afraid of being exposed one day.

18
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,800
I fear they will discover...

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,430
that I'm the demon fetus that everyone in the immortal sect wants to eradicate so badly.

20
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,310
However, after I confirmed it,

21
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,160
I feel a sense of relief.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,570
It is strange, right?

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,310
Now, I finally know

24
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,690
those nails that were launched into my body then

25
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,260
were not because you hated me.

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,980
You did it because you hated him.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,380
Since I no longer have the evil bone

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,530
I cannot turn into the Devil Lord anymore.

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,900
You changed me completely.

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,770
You gave me...

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,960
a second chance in life.

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,480
Never again will I taint myself with the Devil Lord's power.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,860
For you,

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,530
I will make good on this promise.

35
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,340
I haven't had a chance

36
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,000
to thank you,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,670
whether as Tantai Jin

38
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,970
or Cang Jiumin.

39
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,150
I did not change you.

40
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,190
I just eradicated evil in order to uphold justice.

41
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,320
Anyway, get ready. I have a parade to watch.

42
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,130
 I knew you would pass through here if you left. 

43
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,930
 That's why… 

44
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,750
 That's why you're out here 

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,000
 waiting for me? 

46
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,430
 Did you get hurt? 

47
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,060
 I'm fine. 

48
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,910
 How could it be fine? 

49
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,270
 You're bleeding badly. 

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,980
 I do have some medical skills. 

51
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,210
 Please pardon the physical contact between us. 

52
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,630
 I just couldn't bring myself to leave you unattended. 

53
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,290
 So it was you who subdued the demon that plagued the capital of Jing? 

54
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,030
 That was impressive. 

55
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,190
 It wasn't me. 

56
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,800
 Might be have been a junior sister. 

57
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,740
 You told me you wanted to search for an answer in the capital of Jing. 

58
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,580
 Did you find it? 

59
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,800
 Sort of. 

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,510
 Well, did you 

61
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,160
 put your mind at ease? 

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,040
Miss Mo, th-this…?

63
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,610
Where is Miss Mo?

64
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,090
She isn't out trying to take her own life, is she?

65
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,020
Miss Mo!

66
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,890
Miss Mo!

67
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,030
 She fixed the hole by sewing a camellia? 

68
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,240
Young Master is up early.

69
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,690
Will you leave for your sect?

70
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,680
This is your robe. I dried it out here overnight.

71
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,820
It should be pretty much dry now.

72
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,190
It's very kind of you to mend the hole. I don't deserve it.

73
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,410
My pleasure. I'm glad you like it.

74
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,900
Miss Mo, last night we…

75
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,100
I went to the woods this morning to pick some fresh mushrooms.

76
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,000
Would you care for breakfast before you go?

77
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,770
I hope you don't mind the local cuisine.

78
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,820
It's a mushroom-filled bun.

79
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,170
Growing up in the Hengyang Sect,

80
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,640
I was fed and clothed by the sect.

81
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,710
No one ever made me breakfast

82
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,590
or fixed clothes for me.

83
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,140
I mean, you're benevolent, Miss Mo.

84
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,650
I just did some basic housework that I'd learned in the past.

85
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,410
In the past?

86
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,140
I... I got married before.

87
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,210
I cooked and did house chores for him,

88
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,380
but he passed away.

89
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,410
I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,890
I live alone.

91
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,850
I have long moved on.

92
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,190
Once married, he and I were a family for life.

93
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,420
The mundane life that we used to have

94
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,940
was the most unforgettable.

95
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,810
Who wouldn't linger on those memories?

96
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,020
Sometimes, things do not work out the way you want them to.

97
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,730
If you ever need someone to talk to,

98
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,520
you're welcome to visit here for a meal

99
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,480
or a cup of tea.

100
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm always here.

101
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,750
   

102
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,240
Bravo!

103
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,070
I didn't expect that

104
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,900
that after all these years, the Water Festival in the Jing capital would still be full of joy and excitement.

105
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,060
 Bravo! 

106
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,520
 Since the magician pointed at him, 

107
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,270
 that means he has been chosen as the Devil Lord. 

108
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,360
Bravo!

109
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,130
Bravo!

110
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,760
 Move along. 

111
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,740
 Keep up. 

112
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
It's the Teleportation Array.

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,520
- Report, Junior Sect Leader. 
 - Speak.

114
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,000
Chief brought some disciples to Hengyang Sect today.

115
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,290
The disciples who went said

116
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,560
Li Susu and Cang Jiumin from Xiaoyao Sect were not there.

117
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,500
It was told that they'd gone to the Jing Kingdom and didn't bring anyone else.

118
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,300
Cang Jiumin and Li Susu?

119
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,870
Good.

120
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,330
How dare they make a monkey out of me?

121
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,490
Pick some men with a higher level of cultivation.

122
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,000
Bring enough artifacts

123
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,690
and come with me right away.

124
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,310
Sure.

125
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,910
How dare you devils manifest yourself in broad daylight?

126
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,270
These mortals can neither see us nor hear us.

127
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,630
So? Isn't it interesting?

128
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
What do you want?

129
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,050
Relax. We just want to have a chat with you.

130
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,590
Okay. I'll chat with you.

131
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,110
Shall we go to another place?

132
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,340
No. Let's do it right here.

133
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,540
If we go somewhere else, I'm afraid you will slip away.

134
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,500
Junior Sect Leader, what's the matter?

135
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,870
Something's wrong.

136
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,840
I feel something.

137
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,310
Cang Jiumin, you are addicted to being a disciple of an immortal sect.

138
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,940
Come with us.

139
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,100
The Devil Realm is your home.

140
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,850
After becoming the Devil Lord,

141
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,050
you'll know what real power is.

142
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,800
I don't need that kind of power.

143
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,850
You don't need it?

144
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,920
I forgot that you are not yet the Devil Lord.

145
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,620
You don't know what happened to your lover of the immortal sect last night.

146
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,740
She was almost devoured by us.

147
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,880
Without the Devil Lord's power, you're just like them.

148
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,130
You are a tiny ant that others can trample upon at will.

149
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,870
Are you going to make us kill her

150
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,000
before you regret not accepting the power of the Devil Lord sooner?

151
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,030
Give me the Image-Taking Pearl.

152
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,040
This expression in your eyes is kind of like him.

153
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,510
Did you come just to tell me this?

154
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,220
Cang Jiumin, there are only two paths before you.

155
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,660
If you're willing to leave the immortal sect and return to the Devil Realm,

156
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,570
we'll honor you as our lord and pledge loyalty to you.

157
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,250
If you insist on staying in the immortal sect,

158
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,320
your identity as the demon fetus will be exposed sooner or later.

159
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,370
By then, you'll be on the chopping block at their disposal.

160
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,580
Pledging loyalty to me?

161
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Okay.

162
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Since you want to regard me as your lord,

163
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,510
show me your sincerity.

164
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,040
What do you want us to do?

165
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,980
Kneel down.

166
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,310
It seems that you don't really want me to be your lord.

167
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,110
After you return to the Devil Realm,

168
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,250
we'll naturally pledge loyalty to you.

169
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,750
Really? Just wait patiently.

170
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,290
My Lord, please come back to the Barren Abyss with us.

171
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
Cang Jiumin, how dare of you.

172
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,420
You're meeting devils in secret.

173
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,940
Stay put.

174
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm going to catch him red-handed today.

175
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,910
I'll make my own decision about which path to take.

176
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,030
I appreciate your intention.

177
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,350
You may go now.

178
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,440
When the time comes, I'll go to the Barren Abyss myself.

179
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,660
When the time comes?

180
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,820
When will it be?

181
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,670
Are you questioning me?

182
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,920
 Did he pop out of nowhere? 

183
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,350
 Is it some kind of magic? 

184
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,340
 He suddenly appeared. 

185
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,610
Out of the way.

186
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,190
Move.

187
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,270
Cang Jiumin, I've got you.

188
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,960
If I tell the immortal sects what happened today,

189
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,600
not only will you be ruined tomorrow,

190
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,240
perhaps you'll also be taken to the Devil-Subduing Platform and beaten until your soul disperses.

191
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,070
What a useless Xiaoyao sect genius. Be my dog.

192
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,770
Maybe I'll spare your worthless life.

193
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,430
Go away!

194
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,930
 Murder! Murder! Run! 

195
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,950
 Run! 

196
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,820
Go away quickly!

197
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,800
 Go back to report it. 

198
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,500
 Go away quickly! 

199
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,090
I'm helping you.

200
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,130
If I don't kill them, you'll be the one to die.

201
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,060
You don't know right and wrong,

202
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,620
forcing me to deal with you the hard way.

203
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,050
Sect Leader Cen, thank you for sealing the Bone-refining Seal.

204
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,740
This is Mi's magic weapon.

205
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,170
Why is it here?

206
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,600
 Sect Leader! Bad news! 

207
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,880
Junior Sect Leader was killed by Cang Jiumin!

208
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,670
 Run! Run! 

209
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,440
 Get into the array. Dodge the devil sound. 

210
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,300
 This immortal is protecting us! 

211
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,080
 Quickly hide behind the array! 

212
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,700
Stop.

213
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,700
Cang Jiumin, do you really want to watch them die?

214
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,900
Siying.

215
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,440
- My child. 
 - Stop it. Let go of her.

216
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,780
What do you want? We can talk it out.

217
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,190
What?

218
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,830
You want to talk now?

219
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,660
It's too late.

220
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,710
- My child. 
 - Give it up.

221
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,070
You won't be able to stop us with your cultivation prowess

222
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,220
and speed of wielding the sword.

223
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,080
The Cang Jiumin, a disciple of an immortal sect,  whom you long to be,

224
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
won't be able to save her.

225
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,390
 Mother! 

226
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,180
Besides, she's not the only one you need to save today.

227
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,230
 Please let go of my child. 

228
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:00,120
Now, do you still think you don't need that power?

229
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,070
 Help! 

230
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,030
On the count of three,

231
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,370
these people will all die.

232
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,350
Can you continue to be Cang Jiumin

233
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,190
with a peace of mind

234
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,880
after watching them die?

235
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,870
 Since I joined the immortal sect, 

236
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,960
 I've always heard people talking about the Devil Lord. 

237
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,800
 I'm worried that the person they're talking about is me. 

238
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,340
 And the person mentioned in the prophecy is also me. 

239
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,400
 Three. 

240
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,210
 I'm scared. 

241
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,000
 I'm scared that I'll be exposed. 

242
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,110
 And they'll discover... 

243
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,650
 I'm the demon fetus everyone wants to get rid of in the immortal sect. 

244
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,510
 Two. 

245
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,020
 You changed me completely. 

246
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,660
 You gave me a second chance in life. 

247
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,980
 Never again will I taint myself with Devil Lord's power. 

248
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,170
 For you, I will make good on this promise. 

249
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,540
My child!

250
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,720
Mother!

251
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,750
 One! 

252
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,750
 Sorry. 

253
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,960
 I broke my promise. 

254
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,800
♫  Looking back, I see my fate unfold  ♫

255
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,700
♫  All alone with my own obsession  ♫

256
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,380
♫  I want to break free from the endless night  ♫

257
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,920
♫  If my wish is fulfilled,  ♫

258
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,980
♫  I'm not afraid to burn my body like a flame, flickering like a smoke  ♫

259
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,400
♫  A flash of thought, bright or dark, it's ever-changing  ♫

260
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,580
♫  Looking back, I see my fate unfold  ♫

261
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,060
♫  All alone with my own obsession  ♫

262
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,840
♫  I want to break free from the endless night  ♫

263
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,300
♫  If my wish is fulfilled,  ♫

264
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,160
♫  I'm not afraid to burn my body like a flame, flickering like a smoke  ♫

265
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,080
♫  In one thought  ♫

266
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,650
 Run! 

267
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,400
♫  Our love is deep but not destined, all tied to the present  ♫

268
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,580
♫  If no one is spared the woes of love  ♫

269
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,260
♫  Let's live up to the year that we fall in love  ♫

270
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,360
♫  At a glance  ♫

271
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,980
 Run! 

272
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,590
Mother, help me.

273
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,410
My child.

274
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,300
Let's go.

275
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,250
Run quickly.

276
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,860
 First, it's Bone-Refining Seal, then the God-Slaying Crossbow. 

277
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,310
 You still want to deny you're His Lordship's demon fetus? 

278
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,750
Siying, hurry.

279
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,570
Let's instill devil energy into him while his immortal power is disintegrating.

280
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,440
If we can awaken the evil bone, His Lordship will come back.

281
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,260
 This is weird. Why can't I feel the response of the evil bone? 

282
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,030
 I won't let you have your way. 

283
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,440
Susu.

284
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,440
Susu.

285
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,350
 Why is it in your body? 

286
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:40,000
 Ye Xiwu, you risked your life to seal the evil bone in your body. 

287
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,780
 No one... 

288
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,290
 can know this secret. 

289
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,230
Let go of Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal.

290
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,570
It's him. He killed Sect Leader Cen's son.

291
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,960
 Devil Lord, you carried out a massacre on four Continents and three Realms, 

292
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,040
 causing my wife, Chuhuang, to die miserably 

293
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,950
 and locking me in the Barren Abyss for 10,000 years. 

294
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,040
 Your demon fetus is born into the world. 

295
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,430
 How can I believe he's innocent? 

296
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,850
 I won't be bewitched easily by the demon fetus like Susu 

297
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,200
 and watch her make a grave mistake. 

298
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,880
 For Susu's sake, 

299
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,050
 I'll eliminate your demon fetus at all cost. 

300
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,370
Damn. He is clearly His Lordship's demon fetus.

301
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,080
Why didn't the evil bone respond

302
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,570
after we instilled our ten-thousand-year power into him.

303
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,690
Could it be that we found the wrong person?

304
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,630
Even if we did,

305
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,900
would His Lordship's Bone-Refining Seal and God-Slaying Crossbow make a mistake?

306
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,010
But so many mortals have died.

307
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,470
Cang Jiumin will definitely get into big trouble.

308
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,610
Why don't we go to Hengyang Sect to see what happens?

309
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,540
Let's go.

310
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
It is supposed to be a sunny day.

311
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,920
But the minute we set foot on Devil-Subduing Peak, dark clouds gather.

312
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,310
How can you not know?

313
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,000
Devil-Subduing Peak thunders all year round.

314
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,660
Look!  That Devil-Subduing Pillar will direct thunder to the offender.

315
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,640
What crime did Cang Jiumin commit?

316
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,090
It's such a big scene.

317
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,300
I heard he colluded with devils to slaughter mortal people

318
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,270
and killed Sect Leader Cen's son.

319
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,890
As a disciple of an immortal sect, isn't it a heinous crime?

320
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,870
Isn't Cang Jiumin Immortal Zhaoyou's favorite disciple?

321
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,700
Does Sect Leader Zhaoyou have anything to do with it?

322
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,670
I don't think so.

323
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,760
I heard from the seniors of Xiaoyao Sect that Brother Cang is an upright person.

324
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,600
Perhaps it's a misunderstanding.

325
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,180
- Maybe. 
 - Yeah.

326
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,430
Jiumin.

327
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,220
Master.

328
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,890
Jiumin, I just want to ask you.

329
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,400
Did you do it?

330
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,360
No.

331
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,080
Okay. I trust you.

332
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Sect Leader Cen lost his son in his old age.

333
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,060
He is devastated. He wants to convict and punish you.

334
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,260
I'm afraid he won't spare you.

335
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,800
Master, I've caused trouble to the Xiaoyao Sect.

336
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,310
- I'm sorry. 
 - There's justice in the world.

337
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,740
I believe the truth will speak for itself.

338
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,820
Master.

339
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,510
How is Susu?

340
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,630
 Her body is eroded by a large amount of devil energy. 

341
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,130
 She hasn't woken up. 

342
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,110
Susu has a pure-spirit body.

343
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,930
Why is there so much devil energy accumulating in her body?

344
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,040
Little Martial Aunt is still unconscious.

345
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,860
And Sect Leader has been summoned to Xiaoyao Sect.

346
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,240
Master, what should we do?

347
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,140
She is fine for now.

348
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,120
But the devil energy in her body can't be expelled.

349
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't know when she'll come around.

350
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,350
As expected,

351
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,160
those stupid Taoists started blaming him without investigating the truth.

352
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,620
He brought it upon himself.

353
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,500
Had he minded his own business at the Water Festival,

354
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,740
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

355
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,890
Cang Jiumin, today, you killed my son in the capital of Jing,

356
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,110
injured my disciples, and hurt innocent people.

357
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,300
Do you admit to your crimes?

358
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,180
I didn't kill him.

359
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,350
The murderers who killed him and disciples of Chixiao Sect were

360
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,510
Demon of Drought, Siying,

361
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,820
and the evil cultivator, Jingmie.

362
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,550
Since Cang Jiumin is determined to be an immortal-sect disciple,

363
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,940
we should just let him suffer.

364
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,290
So he'll know how disappointing it is to be an immortal disciple.

365
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,680
You stubborn lad.

366
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,970
What's done is done, yet you're still arguing.

367
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,130
This is the evidence of his crime.

368
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,650
Let's see how you'll defend yourself.

369
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,540
Everyone, please watch.

370
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,380
My Lord, please come back to the Barren Abyss with us.

371
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,680
I'll make my own decision about which path to take.

372
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,930
I appreciate your intention.

373
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:09,590
You may go now. When the time comes, I'll go to the Barren Abyss myself.

374
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,860
When the time comes? When will it be?

375
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,690
Cang Jiumin, how daring of you.

376
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,750
Cang Jiumin, I've got you.

377
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,920
If I tell the immortal sects what happened today,

378
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,500
not only will you be ruined tomorrow,

379
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,790
perhaps you also be taken to the Devil-Subduing Platform and beaten until your soul disperses.

380
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,470
Go away!

381
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,820
He really killed Cen Mi.

382
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,690
It's really Jiumin.

383
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,420
He killed Junior Sect Leader. It's him.

384
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,070
He colluded with devils and killed his fellow disciple.

385
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,340
What's going on?

386
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,170
Is that really Jiumin in the Image-Taking Pearl?

387
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,760
I feel so bad for Junior Sect Leader.

388
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,670
We can't let go of the culprit.

389
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,160
Did you all see it?

390
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,880
If my son hadn't exposed him today,

391
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm afraid the immortal sects

392
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,900
would've been in the dark,

393
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,390
unaware that Xiaoyao Sect is harboring a devil.

394
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,910
In the Immortal Sect Competition,

395
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,870
I thought it was strange

396
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,520
that the two devils were able to sabotage our plan,

397
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,460
which was only revealed to the sect leaders.

398
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,900
It turns out there's a mole in the immortal sects.

399
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,520
Sect Leader Cen, before the truth is uncovered,

400
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,790
how could you assert that my disciple is a devil?

401
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,130
Jiumin, don't let this bother you.

402
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,400
What was happening at that time?

403
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,330
At that time,

404
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,550
Siying and Jingmie stopped me in the capital.

405
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,650
They wanted me as their lord. I rejected them.

406
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,160
Nonsense.

407
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,790
The two devils are second to none in the Devil Realm.

408
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:51,840
Why would they degrade themselves to take you, a beginner of an immortal sect, as their lord?

409
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,220
Does anyone believe it?

410
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,610
 No… 

411
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,480
- Does anyone believe it? 
  - I don't believe it. 

412
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,970
 How could it be impossible? 

413
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,370
Who would believe it?

414
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,370
 We don't. 

415
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,370
 Right. How could it be impossible? 

416
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,510
If the immortal sect won't accept him,

417
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,210
we can take him back to Barren Abyss.

418
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,100
Look at this!

419
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,780
Heaven is seeking justice for me!

420
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,920
Cang Jiumin.

421
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,250
Today, I'll make you pay with your life for my son's death.

422
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,830
Stop!

423
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,260
We're interrogating him today, not punishing him.

424
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,870
Don't be so domineering.

425
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,290
Sect Leader Qu, your daughter was injured by the bastard and her life is uncertain.

426
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,020
How could you speak for him?

427
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Of course, I'm heartbroken about Susu's injury.

428
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,470
But today, we need to find out the truth

429
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,340
and then make the punishment fit his crime.

430
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,580
I don't know when Susu will wake up.

431
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,760
We can't just wait, doing nothing.

432
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,380
I'm here to take care of Susu.

433
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,200
You go to Devil-Subduing Peak to see what the situation is.

434
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,700
Yes.

435
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,790
Elder Sister Yue Ya, what happened?

436
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,270
I heard about an attack by a devil artifact in the capital of Jing.

437
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,370
They caught Cang Jiumin and will punish him on Devil-Subduing Peak.

438
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,180
Devil-Subduing Peak.

439
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,870
 It's bad. My Lord's identity has been exposed. 

440
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,850
We've witnessed him doing the crime.

441
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,520
What do we need to investigate?

442
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,990
Seeing is not believing.

443
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,420
There are only traces of him in the Image-Taking Pearl.

444
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,860
We don't know the whole story.

445
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,020
There were many civilians present.

446
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,420
We can find them and inquire about it.

447
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,060
We'll see if the truth is as Sect Leader Cen thinks.

448
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,590
 That's right. We can't be so arbitrary. 

449
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,790
 It's a matter of life and death. We have to be careful. 

450
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,670
 Yes. 

451
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,380
I feel sorry for the loss of your son.

452
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,590
But you can't convict my disciple of death solely based on this evidence.

453
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,000
It's a vain hope.

454
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
You…

455
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,290
 Sorry, My Lord. I didn't expect to get you into this. 

456
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,380
Who may you be?

457
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,660
It's bad.

458
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,390
Dimian has come.

459
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,390
This old bastard might have known the demon fetus is here.

460
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,940
What do we do? Should we go and snatch him back?

461
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,050
We have not yet recovered our devil energy.

462
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,800
They're too many for us to fight.

463
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,580
Let's wait.

464
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,300
- Sect Leader Qu. 
  - Why did he come? 

465
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,700
Sect Leader Qu,

466
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,250
it has been years. How have you been?

467
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,450
Thank you for your concern.

468
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,070
I'm fine.

469
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,810
Everyone,

470
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,840
this is the Lord of Monsters, Dimian, who helped to destroy Devil Lord

471
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,590
and made great contributions ten thousands of years ago.

472
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,570
When I was injured and fell into Barren Abyss, he saved me.

473
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,030
The legendary Lord of Monsters is actually still alive.

474
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,070
After Devil Lord was destroyed,

475
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,770
I was sealed in the Barren Abyss and tortured.

476
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,580
The barrier has loosened recently, so I got away with all my strength.

477
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,290
What can we do for you,

478
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,580
Lord of Monsters?

479
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,990
I had taken the wrong path before, having followed Devil Lord for many years.

480
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,050
As a result, I lost my wife.

481
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,940
Since then, I swore to be the Devil Lord's sworn enemy.

482
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,950
I came here to prevent Devil Lord from being reborn

483
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,420
and bringing disasters to Three Realms.

484
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,470
 Boy, your identity as the demon fetus 

485
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,660
will finally be revealed today.

486
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,950
 What? Did I hear that right? 

487
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,750
 How can it be? 

488
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,240
 The demon fetus? 

489
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,000
 Cang Jiumin is the demon fetus! 

490
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,970
 No wonder the two devils want him as their lord. 

491
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,120
 Yeah. How can it be? 

492
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,870
 It makes sense now. 

493
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,020
 He's actually the demon fetus. 

494
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm not.

495
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,970
I'm not.

496
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,570
Of course, you're not the Devil Lord

497
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,660
because the Devil Lord has died.

498
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,830
You shouldn't be alive.

499
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,430
Only if you're dead, the Devil Lord will never be reborn

500
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,380
and all disasters will come to an end.

501
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,080
I found firm evidence that you're the demon fetus.

502
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,390
Just as I thought.

503
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,750
Everyone,

504
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,770
God-Slaying Crossbow and Devil Lord's eyes...

505
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,970
are on him.

506
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,580
 What? 

507
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,440
 - God-Slaying Crossbow has appeared! 
 - God-Slaying Crossbow! 

508
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,720
 It's a devil artifact that didn't appear in the past ten thousand years. 

509
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,710
 God-Slaying Crossbow! 

510
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,500
 Why is he keeping the devil artifact of the Devil Lord on him? 

511
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,960
 It's really unexpected. 

512
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,480
 Who on earth is he? 

513
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,120
God-Slaying Crossbow!

514
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,920
I detected it!

515
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,240
It's God-Slaying Crossbow!

516
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,860
God-Slaying Crossbow is on him!

517
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,680
Jiumin, this is no trivial matter.

518
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,200
You need to be honest. Don't be forced a confession.

519
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,820
Master,

520
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,050
God-Slaying Crossbow...

521
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,850
is on me, indeed.

522
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,540
 How come God-Slaying Crossbow is on Jiumin? 

523
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,000
 He admitted it himself. This is awful. 

524
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,960
 Is he really…? 

525
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,210
 Whether he's guilty or not, dispose of him before he becomes a real problem. 

526
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,390
 Yes. 

527
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,190
 Kill him… 

528
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,240
I won't become the Devil Lord.

529
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,320
I didn't kill anyone with God-Slaying Crossbow.

530
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,790
I didn't kill anyone.

531
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,100
The Devil Lord is immortal.

532
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,030
A devil god won't be destroyed

533
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,800
unless all the lives in Three Realms no longer have hatred and bitterness.

534
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,650
Ruo River is where all the primordial souls return to.

535
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:19,210
That's why the Devil Lord chose Yiyue Tribe.

536
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,070
He made a contract with them

537
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,400
to make them bear and raise the demon fetus.

538
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,240
You... tell us.

539
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,580
What's your relationship with the Yiyue Tribe?

540
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,750
Yiyue Tribe is my home tribe.

541
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,190
- What? 
 - What?

542
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,740
 This matches, too! 

543
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,790
 - It's really terrifying. 
 - Right. 

544
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,660
Now you cannot quibble about it.

545
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,640
So what that the Devil Lord made a contract with Yiyue Tribe.

546
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:15,800
Whatever my destiny is, I'll choose to be righteous or evil on my own.

547
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,930
I...

548
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,700
will never become the Devil Lord.

549
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,080
Won't you?

550
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,110
Let me tell you another secret.

551
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,090
On the day when Devil Lord made the contract with Yiyue Tribe…

552
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:38,730
 My Lord, if that day has come, how can we identify the demon fetus? 

553
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,550
 The evil bone is deeply hidden and not easy to be detected. 

554
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,860
 My demon fetus will surely be out of the ordinary. 

555
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,980
 I heard the mortal people like to compile novels. 

556
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,930
 I will imitate them and make up the fate of my demon fetus. 

557
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,590
   

558
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,890
 He'll kill his mother during birth. 

559
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,990
 He'll grow up in an imperial palace but is left out and bullied. 

560
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,910
 He's a monster. 

561
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,750
 - Bark, like a dog. 
 - Bark… 

562
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,190
 Coward. You don't dare to resist. 

563
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,750
 - Beat him. 
 - Even a dog can bite and fight. 

564
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,710
 You are an eyesore. 

565
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,480
 I want him to be on top of the world 

566
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,470
 - Your Majesty. 
 - and taste a life of superiority to everyone. 

567
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:35,230
 When he's riding high and experiencing the world, 

568
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:41,370
 he'll hit bottom and face betrayal and resentment. 

569
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,970
 Although he has ascended to the throne and expanded the territory, 

570
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,600
 he cannot escape a fratricidal struggle and marital strife. 

571
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,200
 He'll taste all bitterness in the world. 

572
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,270
 Tantai Jin, kill me now. 

573
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:03,030
 - I'll curse you and laugh at you every day. 
 - Ye Xiwu! 

574
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,250
 Kill me! 

575
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,790
No.

576
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,690
Stop saying that…

577
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,640
 They're the closest people in your life. 

578
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,300
 Whatever he does, it'll be in vain. 

579
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,050
 All beautiful things in his life are all illusions. 

580
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:25,890
 What he loves or pursues will disappear. Suffering is the truth for him. 

581
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,180
 Ye Xiwu, speak! 

582
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,650
 He'll lose everything. 

583
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,870
 It's not enough. I want to let him join an immortal sect. 

584
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,850
 He thinks he has taken the so-called right path. 

585
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,000
 He'll feel the warmth from his master and fellows... 

586
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,060
 but he'll find it is an illusion. 

587
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,040
 In the end, he'll kill his master and become a devil. 

588
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:10,340
 What do you think of the story, Dimian? Do you think it is brilliant? 

589
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,910
It is not like that.

590
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:25,000
Tantai Jin! Are you still insisting you're not the demon fetus?

591
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,990
It turns out...

592
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,980
all that I've suffered...

593
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,600
has been arranged.

594
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,940
Everyone, he doesn't deny it.

595
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,890
We can conclude that what I said is true.

596
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,580
Do you want to regret it until you see him kill his master and become a devil?

597
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,610
 Whether it's true or not, he must die if he's a devil. 

598
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,030
 - Yes, he must die! 
 - We must kill him. 

599
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,850
 Will he really bring a terminal disaster as predicted? 

600
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,830
 - I can't believe the demon fetus has been around us. 
 - There is irrefutable evidence. 

601
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:22,670
 Tantai Jin, have you felt that? 

602
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,610
 Suspicion. 

603
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,210
 Fear. 

604
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,810
 Hatred. 

605
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,460
 Disappointment. 

606
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,370
 Are you feeling cold? 

607
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:40,280
 The coldness extended from your heart to your fingertips. Do you find it hard to explain? 

608
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,860
 I made you experience the mortal world and made you have love threads just for today, 

609
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,560
 because I want you to better experience all of this. 

610
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,150
The thunder is booming more frequently.

611
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,820
Is the thunder attracted by the demon fetus?

612
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,860
It's the will of Heaven.

613
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,250
It's the will of Heaven!

614
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:05,190
The Devil-Subduing Pillar of the Xiaoyao Sect has been standing for hundreds of years.

615
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,700
Today, we'll use it to judge you, Cang Jiumin.

616
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,600
We'll see if it'll let go of you, the demon fetus.

617
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,100
Come here.

618
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,970
Take Cang Jiumin up there.

619
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,100
 Look at these people. 

620
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,760
 Would anyone really care who you are? 

621
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,950
 In their eyes, you're always the demon fetus. 

622
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:36,120
 You tried to fit into them and imitated them, but in the end, what's your result? 

623
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,370
 How pathetic you are! 

624
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:53,020
 Will they let go of you 

625
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,120
 because of any word you said or anything you did? 

626
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,570
You rebellious disciple. You've lost control of yourself.

627
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,170
Quick. Kill him first.

628
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,710
If we hesitate, he'll kill us instead.

629
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,230
Immortal Zhaoyou, are you still covering up your disciple?

630
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,170
Kill him! Kill one person and save the Three Realms. It is a good deal.

631
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,920
A good deal? Did Sect Leader Cen talk about a good deal?

632
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,670
- Is Sect Leader Cen… using his position to avenge his son's death? 
 - Jiumin is our brother.

633
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,690
- I can't do this. 
 - Yeah.

634
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,650
Let's stop and get this clear.

635
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,420
The evidence is certain. What are you hesitating about?

636
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,290
The fact is a fact, but you're protecting the demon fetus. What's your purpose?

637
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,690
Everyone, deal with the devil. We can't be soft-hearted!

638
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,950
Help me kill the devil!

639
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:02,620
Cang Jiumin, I still have faith in you. Control your mind.

640
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,520
 Master. 

641
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,220
 Right. I have my master. 

642
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,390
 My master is still willing to trust me. 

643
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,730
 I can't let him down. 

644
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,900
Devil-Subduing Pillar has such a strong reaction.

You have nothing to say now, don't you?

646
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,560
You've witnessed this.

647
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,380
Cang Jiumin is the demon fetus.

648
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,840
 - Kill him… 
 - Don't let go of the demon fetus. 

649
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,400
 - Kill him. 
 - Kill him… 

650

653
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:51,570
♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

654
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:59,270
♫  The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm  ♫

655
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:07,090
♫  Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain  ♫

656
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:11,070
♫  Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain  ♫

657
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:15,570
♫  We'll never meet again  ♫

658
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,430
♫  I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words  ♫

659
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,170
♫  Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense  ♫

660
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,550
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

661
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,270
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

662
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,910
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

663
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:40,090
♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

664
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,690
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

665
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:52,220
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

666
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,150
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

667
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,970
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

668
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:05,330
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

669
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:09,130
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

670
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:12,650
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

671
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,810
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

672
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,390
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

673
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:28,410
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

674
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:36,190
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

675
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:45,050
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
