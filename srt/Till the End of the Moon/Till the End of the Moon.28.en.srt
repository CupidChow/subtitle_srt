<i>Ye Qingyu. Pianran.</i>

19
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,160
<i>Your Highness, please take this bottle of Ruo Water.</i>

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,020
<i>All right.</i>

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,030
<i>What's special about this bottle of Ruo Water?</i>

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,620

24

<i>I still have you, don't I?</i>

28
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,730
<i>If our plan still fails,</i>

29
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>then I will rush into the palace and kill all the people Tantai Jin cares about in front of him.</i>

<i>Fu Yu, you won't die for nothing.</i>

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,180
<i>I will return everything I have suffered back to Tantai Jin.</i>

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,470
<i>Run!</i>

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,770
<i>Run!</i>

34
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,760
<i>Run for your life!</i>

35
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,460
Dad! Dad!

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,830
Dad! Dad!

37
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,340
It's chaos out there.

38
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,160
They said that Tantai Minglang's rebel army have entered the city,

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
and they are killing the civilians.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,900
Let's run!

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,020
Chuntao, pack up some small valuables and money and leave everything else behind.

42
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,610
We have to hurry and run. Go, hurry!

43
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,270
Hurry up!

44
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,830
Dad.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Dad, what are you doing?

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,900
Doing what I should do.

47
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,920
But, Dad, this is the Jing capital,

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,750
and what does this kingdom have to do with us?

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,090
Zeyu, I am already in my old age

50
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,100
and my days are numbered.

51
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,130
I was powerless when our Sheng Kingdom suffered defeat and decline.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,750
That made me disloyal.

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,750
I will never forgive myself even till my death.

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,670
Now that the kingdoms are unified,

55
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,060
the people of every kingdom are all citizens of the same country.

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,890
As someone who practices martial arts,

57
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,750
if I turn a blind eye to the rebels slaughtering innocent people,

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,290
I am unrighteous.

59
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,640
I, Ye Xiao, am not a disloyal and unrighteous person.

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,650
Dad…

61
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,270
Zeyu, take Chuntao with you and escape from the east side as quickly as you can.

62
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,600
No, Dad…

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,130
Dad!

64
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,660
Dad!

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,380
<i>I'll kill Tantai Jin's beloved woman,</i>

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,850
<i>and Fu Yu,</i>

67
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,480
<i>I will have avenged you.</i>

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,100
Dad!

69
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,050
I am also a man from the Ye family, so I must go with you!

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Eldest Young Master! Old Master!

71
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,680
Chuntao, have you packed up the money?

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Don't lose it.

73
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
We may not be able to take care of you in the future.

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,550
You should take good care of yourself.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,860
Indeed, you are a man of Ye family.

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,080
Dad!

77
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,420
Tantai Minglang is so despicable.

78
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,110
He actually used sorcery to control the people.

79
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,200
Dad, are you all right?

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,130
I'm fine.

81
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,490
Son, let's protect the people together!

82
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,770
- Don't kill me!
- Where are Ye Bingchang and Ye Xiwu?

83
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,220
I'll show you the way.

84
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't kill me!

85
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,180
<i>The divine essence has been cultivated.</i>

86
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,940
Old Master! Old Master!

87
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,780
Eldest Young Master! Old Master!

88
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,130
Old Master!

89
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,510
Old Master died in battle to protect the people.

90
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,640
Your Majesty, there are survivors.

91
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,680
Your Majesty, these people have been infused with Spirit Fire by Tantai Minglang,

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,110
and are already dead.

93
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,380
They are here doing this probably to threaten us.

94
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,270
Your Majesty, it's dangerous. Don't go there!

95
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,820
<i>Third Younger Brother, do you like the surprise I gave you?</i>

96
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,360
<i>Hold on.</i>

97
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,380
<i>Things are just starting.</i>

98
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,540
<i>I will make everything you cherish</i>

99
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,540
<i>disappear one by one in front of you.</i>

100
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,180
Tantai Minglang,

101
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,320
<i>I will kill you!</i>

102
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,340
<i>[Sima Gate]</i>

103
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,380
Third Brother!

104
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,140
<i>[Yingtian Gate]</i>

105
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,710
What took you so long?

106
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,890
You kept me waiting for a long time.

107
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,140
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

108
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,540
I got you two great presents.

109
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,550
You are really lucky when it comes to love.

110
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,600
I specially dressed them up nicely for you.

111
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,290
<i>The battle at the southern border almost exhausted my power,</i>

112
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,270
<i>I can't expose any flaws.</i>

113
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,140
Tantai Minglang, I have completely wiped out your subordinates.

114
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,130
You are now undoubtedly defeated.

115
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,260
What's the point of putting up a stiff resistance?

116
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,560
With my current appearance,

117
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,450
what can't I do?

118
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,390
You are right.

119
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,090
I lost to you this time, and I am afraid that I cannot make a comeback.

120
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,880
However, I don't want to go to hell alone.

121
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't, please!

122
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,840
I am reasonable.

123
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,010
Choose one of your beloveds to return to your side,

124
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,000
- and the other will be buried with me.
- No!

125
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,780
How is that?

126
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,410
Tantai Minglang, don't go too far!

127
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,220
Ye Xiwu or Ye Bingchang?

128
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,760
Make a choice.

129
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,770
<i>The Lightning Punishment is getting closer.</i>

130
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,310
<i>Ye Xiwu, at such a critical point,</i>

131
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,860
<i>don't you even want to take a look at me?</i>

132
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,900
If you don't choose, I will take both of them.

133
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,420
No!

134
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,550
<i>I only have one chance to hit.</i>

135
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,760
So, have you decided?

136
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,420
Your Majesty, please, save me!

137
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,450
<i>- Ye Xiwu,</i>
- I don't want to die!

138
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,270
<i>- don't you want me to save you?</i>
- I don't want to die!

139
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,530
<i>When two people are wearing the Yin-Yang Bracelets,</i>

140
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,280
<i>as long as the one wearing the Yang Bracelet doesn't die,</i>

141
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,600
<i>the wearer of the Yin Bracelet won't die.</i>

142
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,190
<i>The principle is that the one wearing the Yang Bracelet is using his lifespan</i>

143
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,610
<i>to resist the fatal disaster for the wearer of the Yin Bracelet.</i>

144
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,670
<i>Ye Xiwu, even if you loathe me,</i>

145
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,720
<i>I will do anything to keep you alive.</i>

146
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,710
Choose!

147
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,870
Or I'll kill both of them!

148
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,840
Save me!

149
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,490
Choose!

150
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,280
Let go of...

151
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,370
Ye Bingchang.

152
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,790
<i>That's good.</i>

153
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,710
<i>This way, I don't owe you anything anymore.</i>

154
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,770
<i>Ye Xiwu, don't you even care?</i>

155
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,340
It looks like you mean very little to him.

156
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,860
Let me relieve you, then.

157
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,080
<i>[Yingtian Gate]</i>

158
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,180
<i>You can never repay me.</i>

159
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,420
No, no way…

160
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,030
Ye Xiwu, what are you doing?

161
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,200
Stop it!

162
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,720
<i>Ye Xiwu, don't you leave me!</i>

163
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>I will not allow you to leave me again, not like how Sang Jiu did.</i>

164
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,300
The World-Alluring Jade?

165
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Ye Xiwu, why do you have it?

166
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,680
This World-Alluring Jade

167
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,960
was exchanged with my left eye from you.

168
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,300
♫ <i>I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time</i> ♫

169
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,740
♫ <i>To forget everything that's occurred</i> ♫

170
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,430
It was you…

171
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,140
♫ <i>...I can exchange my tears for your return; My heart's in flames</i> ♫

172
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,560
This is your eye?

173
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,320
Ye Xiwu, why did you do that?

174
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Because you lost an eye,

175
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,180
and you looked really pitiful.

176
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,400
- You were about to die.
<i>-Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin!</i>

177
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,280
At that time, I thought that you should not bear the curse.

178

179

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,990

181

<i>of the World-Alluring Jade.</i>

182
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You see, now the curse is about to be fulfilled on me.

183
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,330

Tantai Jin, stop wasting your strength.

186
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,110
The Lightning Punishment comes after me.

187
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,110
With your mortal body, you can't block it.

188
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,440
Why did you take matters into your own hands and do these things for me?

189
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
Yes,

190
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,900
Tantai Jin,

191
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,820
because you are the Devil Lord.

192
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,200
You were already the greatest curse in this world,

193
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,760
born with the burden of all beings' sins.

194
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,620
What are you talking about? What Devil Lord?

195
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,270
Ye Xiwu, what the hell are you saying?

196
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,670
Tantai Jin, do you know why you were born to suffer loneliness

197
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,470
with weak family ties?

198
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,310
Why were you born without love threads?

199
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,950
Why do demons fear your blood?

200
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,910
Because you are not an ordinary person.

201
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,800
You were born with an evil bone

202
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
and destined to become the new Devil Lord,

203
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,050
destroying Heaven and Earth and overturning the universe.

204
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,080

209
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,410

I don't mind telling you.

215
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,930
Actually, I am not Ye Xiwu in the first place.

216
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,940
I was born in the immortal sect.

217
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
The reason why I came to you...

218
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
and became your wife, Ye Xiwu,

219
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,760
was to reverse the fate

220
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,800

221
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,070
<i>Now, the Four Continents and Three Realms</i>

222

I don't even know them.

229

I have never killed them.

That's not me, Ye Xiwu.

231
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,100
Who are you?

232
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,980
All these...

233
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,500
have nothing to do with you anymore.

234
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,580
Ye Xiwu, in your mind,

235
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,770
am I really so horrible to the degree

236
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,560
that I am not worthy of your trust?

237
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,010
Trust?

238
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,540
Tantai Jin, why should I gamble the fate of all living beings

239
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,470
on the extremely faint hope that there may still be

240
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,870
a trace of goodness in the heart of the Devil Lord?

241
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,050
I cannot afford to take that risk.

242
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,720
What a high-sounding explanation.

243
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,400
Fine.

244
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,300
You've always been heartless.

245
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,070
I'm not some Devil Lord.

246
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,010
Ye Xiwu,

247
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,580
let me tell you.

248
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,510
I...

249
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,850
will never allow you to leave me.

250
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,530
Even if my soul shatters,

251
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,480
and even if I die under this Lightning Punishment,

252
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,690
I will not let go of you.

253
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,450
Tantai Jin, don't overestimate yourself.

254
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,610
From beginning to end,

255
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,420
you were just a target of my mission.

256
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,490
I shot six Soul-slaying Spikes into you.

257
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,580
I did hurt you,

258
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,640
but I also bore...

259
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,300
the pain from the World-Alluring Jade.

260
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,630
Now I'm taking your evil bone...

261
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,320
and paying you back with the divine essence.

262
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,810
You won't become the Devil Lord anymore.

263
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,760
What did you say?

264
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,930
Now we are even.

265
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,050
You won't be able to keep me.

266

267
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
<i>and I also hate you to the bone.</i>

268
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,720
<i>My divine essence for your evil bone.</i>

269
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
<i>We don't owe each other anything.</i>

270
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,420
Ye Xiwu, I don't want your essence.

271
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,890
I'll return it to you.

272
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,950
Stop it now!

273
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,280

275

♫ <i>The ashes on the moon turned silent</i> ♫

354
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,960
<i>I give you this opportunity... to pick a place you like,</i>

355
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,540
<i>and decide where you want to be buried.</i>

356
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,100
<i>Stop your gloating. I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you?</i>

357
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,840
<i>Mother, she is Ye Xiwu.</i>

358
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,620
<i>I'm your daughter-in-law.</i>

359
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,710
<i>If you saw her for yourself,</i>

360
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,580
<i>you'd love her.</i>

361
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,120
♫ <i>The remaining gentleness</i> ♫

362
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,900
♫ <i>Thaws out my remaining years for you</i> ♫

363
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,080
<i>Are you willing to be with me in the future?</i>

364
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,500
♫ <i>...Is the pain from loving you</i> ♫

365
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,190
<i>Rest assured. From now on,</i>

366
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,350
<i>I'll cling to you every day.</i>

367
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,470
<i>You have no way to get rid of me now.</i>

368
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,140
<i>All right.</i>

369
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,810
♫ <i>My body was broken to pieces at the moment of falling flowers</i> ♫

370
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,770
<i>Once, I was like a blind man living in the dark.</i>

371
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,060
<i>I was trapped in the void for more than 20 years.</i>

372
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,430
<i>People say that the sun is bright and warm.</i>

373
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,030
<i>But I didn't know what true brightness meant...</i>

374
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,630
<i>until I met you.</i>

375
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:48,040
♫ <i>You alone animated the whole mortal world</i> ♫

376
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,830
Dad.

377
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,620
Mom.

378
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,680
Chief, the doctor said, His Majesty's heart was gravely injured, to begin with.

379
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,330
Now he suffers from too much grief. It's hard to tell when he'll wake up.

380
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,860
What about other casualties?

381
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,550
Chief Pianran died on her post. General Ye is being treated.

382
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,470
He hasn't woken up yet.

383
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,170
What about the other Ye family members?

384
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:16,800
Ye Xiao and Ye Zeyu died protecting the civilians when the rebels entered the city.

385
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
They have been encoffined.

386
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
Give them a proper funeral.

387
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,770
Also, Ye Bingchang went missing in the chaos.

388
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,080
We've been searching for her. No results yet.

389
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,760
Keep searching.

390
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,360
Dead or alive, she must be found.

391
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,180
Yes.

392
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,320
<i>This is Ye Xiwu's room.</i>

393
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>Why would it be like this?</i>

394
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,240
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

395
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,720
<i>Tantai Jin, when are you going to be back?</i>

396
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,530
Ye Xiwu.

397
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,230
Where are you?

398
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,290
<i>From now on, I'll cling to you every day.</i>

399
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,110
<i>You have no way to get rid of me now.</i>

400
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,570
Ye Xiwu, come out!

401
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,620
Ye Xiwu, where are you hiding?

402
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,270
Come out!

403
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,380
Ye Xiwu, just come out!

404
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,830
Come out!

405
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,630
Why?

406
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,200
<i>Because she's dead.</i>

407
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,810
<i>She got rid of you forever.</i>

408
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>- In order to leave you,</i>
- Come out.

409
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,060
<i>- she's even willing to die.</i>
- Come out.

410
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,050
Nonsense! Come out now!

411
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,270
<i>She's dead.</i>

412
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:11,800
<i>But I won't die.</i>

413
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Come out!

414
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,120
Just come out!

415
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,510
<i>Is it because of that woman?</i>

416
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,220
<i>What a pity.</i>

417
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,030
Get away from me!

418
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,520
<i>She's dead. Everyone around you will leave you.</i>

419
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,160
That's not true.

420
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,700
<i>You will only bring disaster to those who stay with you.</i>

421
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,660
<i>They all hate you. They'd rather die to get away from you.</i>

422
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,400
<i>Look how your hands are stained with her blood.</i>

423
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,480
<i>From beginning to end, you can only live alone.</i>

424
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,470
What a shame.

425
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,830
I will never...

426
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,530
let you have your way.

427
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,530
Ye Xiwu won't leave me!

428
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,130
Why don't you show up now?

429
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,700
Prove it to him now!

430
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Ye Xiwu!

431
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,360
Ye Xiwu!

432
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,770
Ye Xiwu!

433
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,330
Ye Xiwu!

434
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,200
Ye Xiwu!

435
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,760
Your Majesty!

436
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,910
Your Majesty!

437
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,410
Your Majesty, the doctor said you need to rest.

438
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,060
Just take a good rest, Your Majesty.

439
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,780
Where's Ye Xiwu?

440
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,060
I'm asking you where Ye Xiwu is!

441
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,500
I don't know.

442
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,640
- Scram!
- Your Majesty!

443
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,320
Ye Xiwu.

444
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,320
There you are.

445
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,900
I've been looking everywhere for you.

446
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,810
No.

447
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,500
Why are you here?

448
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,420
It's so cold here.

449
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,300
Wake up. Come back with me.

450
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,230
Ye Xiwu, wake up!

451
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm talking to you, Ye Xiwu!

452
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,840
<i>She's dead.</i>

453
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,390
Ye Xiwu, get up.

454
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,110
<i>- She abandoned you.</i>
- Just get up!

455
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,650
No.

456
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,730
Ye Xiwu, I'm talking to you.

457
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,160
I'm talking to you!

458
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,500
Why don't you answer?

459
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,930
Speak!

460
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,810
Speak!

461
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,840
Didn't you want to kill me?

462
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,510
Weren't you more heartless than me?

463
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,200
I'm right in front of you!

464
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,290
I'm right here!

465
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,140
Get up and keep killing me!

466
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,470
Keep hating me!

467
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,160
Just say one word.

468
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,850
Just one word.

469
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,180
Ye Xiwu.

470
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,260
Ye Xiwu.

471
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,740
I really hate you.

472
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,020
<i>From beginning to end,</i>

473
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,500
<i>you can only live alone.</i>

474
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,790
<i>You won't have it your way.</i>

475
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,670
<i>If I can't save her,</i>

476
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,330
<i>I'll die with her!</i>

477
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,710
The post-war compensations have all been done.

478
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,140
The hardest times are finally over.

479
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,290
But I'm just wondering when His Majesty will get himself together.

480
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,660
If this goes on, I'm afraid his body will…

481
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,680
Send more hands over there.

482
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,400
Including the hall.

483
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,540
Go ahead now.

484
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,220
General Ye.

485
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,220
Can you walk now?

486
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,080
What about His Majesty?

487
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,930
His Majesty has confined himself in the mourning hall.

488
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,500
General Ye, you're the younger brother of Second Young Miss after all.

489
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,230
Please go talk to him.

490
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,640
You're his only family now.

491
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,430
- I'll go see him.
- Hold on.

492
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,070
His Majesty sealed the door with demon power.

493
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,540
Regular people can't get in.

494
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,560
We have to find a way.

495
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,180
It's fine.

496
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,750
I can get in.

497
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,390
Let's go.

498
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,660
What's this?

499
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,900
He melted the original Ruo Water Ice Coffin,

500
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,320
so that he could be sealed with Ye Xiwu forever.

501
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,110
Just like…

502
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,180
Just like amber.

503
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,300
General Ye, one will die of coldness

504
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,350
if he's lying in there for too long.

505
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,560
We must get His Majesty out of it first.

506
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,220
Your Majesty!

507
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,430
Your Majesty!

508
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,270
Your Majesty!

509
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,180
How dare you do this?

510
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,000
Your Majesty.

511
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,390
Get out.

512
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,260
You're courting death.

513
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,060
And you're hindering my sister from leaving the world decently.

514
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,860
Leaving?

515
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,430
She's my wife.

516
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,060
She's my queen!

517
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,740
She can only be with me!

518
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,640
What if I insist on taking her away?

519
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,360
Go ahead if you dare.

520
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,200
Why would she marry you? Don't you know that?

521
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,590
She said she loved me!

522
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,870
Nian Baiyu, stay out of it!

523
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,190
My sister might have loved you, but you?

524
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,670
You used her to kill Xiao Lin with her own hands!

525
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,420
You tortured her so much that she had to kill herself!

526
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,270
<i>Now you're still trying to trap her and to stop her from leaving.</i>

527
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,660
Tantai Jin, you hate her so much, huh?

528
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,030
<i>No. I don't hate her.</i>

529
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,340
<i>She's the only one who's good to me.</i>

530
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,910
<i>The only one who loved me.</i>

531
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,040
<i>Ye Qingyu, do you understand?</i>

532
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,360
<i>You!</i>

533
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,190
Break it off!

534
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,790
Since that's the case, just let my sister go.

535
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,530
No.

00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,980
<i>[Till the End of the Moon]</i>

537
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,490
<i>[Black Moonlight - Zhang Bichen and Mao Buyi]</i>

538
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:43,330
♫ <i>Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon</i> ♫

539
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:51,160
♫ <i>The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm</i> ♫

540
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:58,880
♫ <i>Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain</i> ♫

541
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,760
♫ <i>Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain</i> ♫

542
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,660
♫ <i>We'll never meet again</i> ♫

543
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,120
♫ <i>I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words</i> ♫

544
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,860
♫ <i>Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense</i> ♫

545
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,040
♫ <i>Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof</i> ♫

546
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,960
♫ <i>Embracing the endless lingering fear</i> ♫

547
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,600
♫ <i>I've admired you through the myriad of years</i> ♫

548
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,780
♫ <i>I believed I have been loved for a moment</i> ♫

549
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,280
♫ <i>I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil</i> ♫

550
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:43,240
♫ <i>And become devout like the flawless moonlight</i> ♫

551
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,840
♫ <i>Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

552
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,660
♫ <i>and how they are just like any other creature</i> ♫

553
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,020
♫ <i>No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars</i> ♫

554
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,720
♫ <i>The moonlight is my armor</i> ♫

555
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,340
♫ <i>I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars</i> ♫

556
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,460
♫ <i>And willingness to live a life in peace</i> ♫

557
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,080
♫ <i>You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil</i> ♫

558
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,120
♫ <i>And learned to love what you used to resent</i> ♫

559
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:27,820
♫ <i>Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky</i> ♫

560
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:36,660
♫ <i>And we'll make it something to remember us by</i> ♫
