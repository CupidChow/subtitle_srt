00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,660
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,120
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,540
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,180
♫  I do not fear   ♫

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,100
♫  How people treat me in this world  ♫

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,180
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

♫  How to differentiate between good and bad  ♫

♫  My existence  ♫

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,580
   

19
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,820
Ye Qingyu.

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,410
You're awake.

21
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,550
You were drunk last night.

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,360
Do you have a headache?

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,080
I was being impulsive after drinking last night.

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,010
Please don't take it to heart.

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,210
I can tell what's real and what's not.

26
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,640
That's good, then.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,890
Ye Qingyu, I…

28
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,450
You're here to ask me about the antidote, right?

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,360
You can be frank with me.

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,760
I can't stay here any longer.

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,200
Give me the antidote.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
And I'll leave the capital by myself.

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,020
Why? Is it because of me?

34
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,010
I really don't know if I should feel honored

35
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,170
or unfortunate.

36
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,980
Ye Qingyu, it's impossible between us.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,450
What do I have to do for you to give me the antidote?

38
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,040
There is no antidote.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,390
What?

40
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,720
His Majesty told me that the pill he forced you to swallow

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,500
was just a regular tonic pill.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,930
Tantai Jin!

43
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,960
So, you're free.

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,150
Tantai Jin said he gave the antidote to you.

45
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,680
I can never leave your side

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,050
as long as you use that excuse to keep me around.

47
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,570
Why did you tell me the truth?

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,020
You're a woman of your word.

49
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,910
And I enjoyed momentary pleasure with you.

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,790
I dare not expect God to favor me again.

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,130
Pianran, encountering you

52
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,630
was the most fortunate event that has happened to me.

53
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,610
What if I...

54
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,360
feel like staying in the capital again?

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,440
It's okay. You can go wherever you want.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,810
If you don't wish to see me,

57
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,360
I can write to His Majesty and leave the capital myself.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,630
Ye Qingyu, are you truly a fool?

59
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,740
Or are you pretending to be one?

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,970
Forget it. I can't bother to explain it to you.

61
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,560
Anyway, I'm free now.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I can go wherever I want.

63
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,650
Now, I feel like staying in the capital again.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,070
Pianran.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,430
So, we can spend time with each other again.

66
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,140
Right?

67
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,190
I guess.

68
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,310
It depends on your performance.

69
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,950
Xiwu, have you two reconciled with each other?

70
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
There's nothing to reconcile about.

71
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,990
There are no overnight grudges between husband and wife.

72
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,630
Little One, you must tell me if you feel troubled.

73
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,350
Don't hold it in and suffer alone.

74
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm perfectly fine.

75
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,960
How can that be?

76
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,220
Tantai Jin is the emperor now.

77
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
And our family has fallen from grace.

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,580
You may inevitably be subjected to humiliation in front of him.

79
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,430
What humiliation?

80
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,550
I made him sleep on the floor last night.

81
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,630
Second Sister, you're excellent at taming your husband.

82
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,950
Speaking of which, Bingchang hasn't returned home yet

83
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,740
since she arrived in the capital.

84
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,300
Now, Eldest Sister is the noble Madam Xuancheng.

85
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,280
Tantai Jin lets her live in the palace.

86
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,360
I think he's afraid that Xiao Lin may snatch her away.

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,630
It's always safer to hide in the palace.

88
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,950
When she's in the Palace of Jing,

89
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,370
Xiao Lin will have to hold back.

90
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,970
They won't ignore her.

91
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,120
Has Bingchang suffered any grievances then?

92
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
Don't worry, Grandmother.

93
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
Tantai Jin isn't that kind of person.

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
If you're still worried,

95
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,630
I'll visit Eldest Sister after dinner

96
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,600
and ask her if she's willing to move back.

97
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,980
Good.

98
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,530
Come on, eat up.

99
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,540
That's the gist of it.

100
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,270
Sister, you must have suffered for the past few days.

101
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,030
I'll apologize to you on Tantai Jin's behalf.

102
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,860
There's no need to say that, Sister.

103
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,360
How could I make the emperor apologize to me?

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm happy for you that you two have reconciled with each other.

105
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,500
That's typical of Tantai Jin. He's so capricious.

106
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,730
Just don't take it to heart.

107
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,320
If you can't get used to living in the palace,

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,130
I can speak with Tantai Jin and tell him to let you leave.

109
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,690
You can go home and live with Grandmother and Father.

110
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,290
No need.

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, His Majesty must have his reasons to let me stay in the palace.

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Besides, I've already gotten used to it.

113
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,720
I shouldn't go home and disturb Grandmother and Father.

114
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,540
But…

115
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,380
Second Sister, we are both married women.

116
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,760
How can we keep living in our parents' home?

117
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,730
It's good for you that you can stay by His Majesty's side.

118
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,330
But me?

119
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,280
Sixth Prince is still missing.

120
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,780
If I live at home, I'll look like a divorced woman instead.

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,970
Our neighbors will criticize us.

122
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,620
It's better if I live in the palace.

123
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,540
All right.

124
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,100
But Grandmother and Father do miss you very much.

125
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,050
Please visit them when you're free.

126
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,140
All right. Thanks for your concern.

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,220
Then I'll head back first.

128
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,700
 Tantai Jin still loves her deeply despite how Second Sister treated him. 

129
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,940
 If I stay in the palace, I might still have a chance. 

130
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,640
 If I move home, it'll be difficult to see Tantai Jin again. 

131
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,080
 I didn't expect that he had no desire for me. 

132
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
 If I want to live off him, 

133
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,960
 I must be of use to him. 

134
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,770
Your Majesty.

135
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,910
You may speak from there.

136
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,810
I...

137
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,670
I don't know what I have done wrong

138
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,910
to make you dislike me.

139
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,590
You have done nothing wrong.

140
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,460
Once I capture Xiao Lin,

141
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll let you two reunite.

142
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,260
Your Majesty, do you have to capture Prince Xuancheng?

143
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,000
Why did you think I allowed you to stay here in the first place?

144
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,000
Your Majesty, I have something to discuss with you.

145
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,170
The rations I borrowed two days ago will run out in another two days.

146
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,610
We're out of medicine and bandages, too.

147
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,440
What should we do?

148
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Is there any nearby county which we haven't borrowed rations from?

149
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,670
There's none.

150
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,020
Try again then.

151
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,070
Your Highness, you're now a rebel.

152
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,100
We're all wanted criminals.

153
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,850
Forget about borrowing rations.

154
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,640
They have already done us one last favor by not reporting us to the local authorities.

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,470
Junior Martial Uncle, what are our odds of winning

156
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,470
if we keep this up?

157
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,630
Well, you see…

158
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,950
We have no chance of winning. Right?

159
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,010
There's nothing we can do about it.

160
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,970
Do you still remember you, me, and Qingyu

161
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,800
used to discuss state affairs in the capital?

162
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,640
 Common folks always suffer 

163
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,820
 no matter how the kingdom does. 

164
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,580
 It's always been like this. 

165
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,020
 I've engaged the people of Jing in battle on numerous occasions. 

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,520
 Although Jing Kingdom is our enemy, 

167
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,690
 their soldiers and civilians 

168
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,600
 are made of flesh and blood too. 

169
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
Qingyu was right.

170
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,380
To common folks, war is detrimental no matter if it's won or lost.

171
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,450
Now, Tantai Jin fights for peace.

172
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,020
People want him to unite the world.

173
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,630
Maybe I should lead our remaining people southward

174
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,650
and leave this place.

175
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,630
How could you harbor such thoughts?

176
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,200
Your Highness!

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,710
Your Highness, the spy we planted in the Capital of Jing sent us a secret letter.

178
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,550
It's for you.

179
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,340
It's Bingchang's handwriting.

180
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,210
No wonder Tantai Jin allowed her to write to you.

181
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,160
The content of the letter praises his benevolence.

182
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,520
Looks like Tantai Jin is still bent on making you surrender.

183
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,150
   

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,460
Something's not right.

185
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,980
What do you mean?

186
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,500
   

187
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,000
   

188
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,810
Court dismissed.

189
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
General Ye.

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,040
Your Majesty.

191
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,000
Disaster relief impacts many people.

192
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,040
You're from the Sheng Kingdom.

193
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,790
I feel most reassured to let you

194
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,600
help the refugees to settle down.

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,720
I shall not fail you, Your Majesty.

196
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,140
Now, the world is united.

197
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,470
I desire for the people of Sheng Kingdom to settle down and recoup their losses

198
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,880
more than anyone else.

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,830
And I appreciate your kindness more than anyone else.

200
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,250
Today's the Qixi Festival. 
  (Chinese festival similar to Valentine's Day) 

201
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,190
I heard that the night of Qixi in the Capital of Jing is the liveliest.

202
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,830
Why don't you...

203
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,360
leave the palace and go for a stroll with Pianran?

204
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,830
Go ahead.

205
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,360
 Ye Xiwu. 

206
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,740
 Bravo! 

207
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,690
Let's go.

208
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,550
Now, Sheng and Jing are united. The state is in peace.

209
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,860
We can finally have a proper festival.

210
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.

211
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,220
You accomplished a good deed.

212
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,260
I just did what a ruler should do.

213
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,140
Are you all right?

214
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,890
I'm fine.

215
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,450
It's crowded here.

216
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,360
Today's the last day of the Water Festival.

217
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,810
And it's also the Qixi Festival.

218
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,060
The townsfolk are all out on the streets.

219
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,140
The liveliest day of the year is today.

220
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,720
Tantai Jin,

221
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,220
why are they all wearing masks?

222
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,390
It's for the seven-day-long deity parade during the Water Festival.

223
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,480
It is said that it will help exorcise demons and ghosts.

224
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,100
You'll understand if we run into one later.

225
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,340
 Masks for sale! 

226
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,020
Sir, pick one.

227
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,860
Let's get one and follow the customs.

228
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,170
Okay.

229
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,980
Don't just agree verbally. Pay up.

230
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,370
Come. This one suits you.

231
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,070
I want this one.

232
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,640
Okay, thank you.

233
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,130
Thank you.

234
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,860
Let's go.

235
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,470
Masks for sale!

236
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,380
Masks for sale!

237
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,170
Sir, take a look.

238
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,250
I didn't expect that we would be able to enter the Capital of Jing so fast.

239
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,660
Keep your guard up. Stay cautious.

240
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,380
This is enemy territory after all.

241
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,030
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,900
All right.

243
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,410
Let's go.

244
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,410
You scared me.

245
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,890
Please feel free to try.

246
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,640
Try this one. It's freshly made.

247
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,980
- Thanks. 
 - Okay.

248
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,820
- Does it taste good? 
 - Yes.

249
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,770
Take a look at this.

250
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,640
Exquisite craft for sale. It brings you good luck.

251
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,440
Take a look!

252
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
It's so pretty.

253
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,830
It's a white jade scepter.

254
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,020
   

255
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,260
Excuse me.

256
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,620
   

257
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,020
   

258
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,770
 Bravo! 

259
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,410
Like this.

260
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,810
 Bravo! 

261
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,370
 Bravo! 

262
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,680
 Pick me! 

263
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,330
Me?

264
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,630
Tantai Jin, what is this?

265
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,230
This is a custom of Jing.

266
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,670
When you're picked by the chief magician,

267
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,080
you'll be the goddess of this year's Water Festival.

268
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,620
Go now. You'll be blessed with good luck.

269
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay.

270
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,840
Why did he pick you then?

271
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,950
Are you a goddess, too?

272
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,370
Are you a god then?

273
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,760
Miss, what's with the question?

274
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,260
Have you not celebrated the Water Festival before?

275
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,390
I'm from the Sheng Kingdom.

276
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,330
No wonder.

277
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,850
Since the magician pointed at him,

278
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,270
that means he has been chosen as the Devil Lord.

279
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,330
You heard of the war between the devils and gods that happened 10,000 years ago. Right?

280
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,260
He has been chosen as the Devil Lord to join the parade with you.

281
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,960
Go now.

282
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,380
You were picked by the magician to pray for the world.

283
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,810
You'll be blessed with peace and happiness, too.

284
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,700
You need to finish the sword dance rite with the Devil Lord.

285
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,780
After that, you have to kill the Devil Lord.

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,730
 You aren't anyone else. 

328
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,060
 You are just Tantai Jin. 

329
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,960
♫  Only because of that cool and dark night  ♫

330
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,350
♫  I always remember the blooming flowers before they whither  ♫

331
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:14,260
♫  A young man once persuaded me with a kiss  ♫

332
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:25,920
♫  to berth my love before everything turned to ashes  ♫

333
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,750
It's such a beautiful night.

334
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,650
Wouldn't it be a waste if we were to get drunk?

335
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,710
How about…

336
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,140
What were you thinking?

337
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,540
I…

338
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,330
The moon is clear and bright tonight.

339
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,850
It's perfect for fox demons to cultivate their powers.

340
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,160
I actually forgot about that.

341
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,620
If I don't absorb enough moon essence in time,

342
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,160
even demons like us will grow old.

343
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,220
By then, you'll be scared to death when my hair turns gray...

344
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,270
and my face is full of wrinkles.

345
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,570
Even so, you'll still be the cutest to me.

346
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,470
But I'm a mortal. At most, I can live a hundred years.

347
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,530
I'm afraid I have no chance to witness that moment.

348
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,090
Actually, there's a simple solution to it. There's a legend among fox spirits.

349
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,700
Legend has it that if you're married to your true love, with a bite on the arm as an oath and a drop of blood as a vow,

350
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,340
even if one of them dies, their soul will not head to the underworld.

351
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,560
This way, they can be together forever.

352
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,220
Really?

353
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,190
I haven't tried it before. How would I know?

354
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:37,310
Even if that day does comes, I won't give it a try.

355
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll drink a lot of wine, find another man,

356
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,800
and forget about you completely.

357
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,400
If so, I can rest at ease.

358
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:58,530
♫  Let the sweetness of your slight smile and the saltiness of my tears  ♫

359
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,710
♫  be your repayment and my debt  ♫

360
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:11,730
♫  Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?  ♫

361
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,970
♫  A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away  ♫

362
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:26,210
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

363
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,660
 Your Majesty! 

364
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,400
 Your Majesty! 

365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,840
 Your Majesty! 

366
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,640
Miss.

367
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,640
Do you guys want to buy some candy?

368
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,690
Little Sister, were you separated from your parents?

369
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,550
You're so young. Why are you selling things alone here?

370
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,560
Stop right there.

371
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,360
What are you doing?

372
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,370
I'll buy the whole basket.

373
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,570
Where are your parents?

374
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,680
They're dead.

375
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,160
Come.

376
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,790
Take this pouch and go to the new orphanage located at the East Palace Gate.

377
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,200
Find the manager there. He'll find you a new place to live.

378
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,490
- Thank you, Brother. 
 - Go now.

379
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,160
Why did you buy so much candy?

380
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,060
To eat.

381
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,830
 Your Majesty! 

382
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,370
Let's go.

383
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,830
Your Highness, Tantai Jin hasn't returned to the palace yet.

384
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,370
Okay. Let's split up and execute the plan.

385
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,100
 Your Majesty! 

386
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,530
 Over there! 

387
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,470
 Your Majesty! 

388
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,760
They almost caught us.

389
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,050
Why were they chasing you?

390
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,360
I guess they want to see me.

391
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,610
See you for what?

392
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,470
I heard that Tantai Wuji was unable to win over civilians' hearts,

393
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,470
Tantai Minglang was tyrannical and was killed by a swarm of mice.

394
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,390
The day I entered the capital, countless mice fled, and the tyrant died.

395
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,390
The news spread and people regarded it as an auspicious sign.

396
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,530
Later, they even said that I was a god sent from above.

397
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,030
See, everyone does love you.

398
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,110
They're just following the herd.

399
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,580
Now, they see me as a god.

400
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,100
But they might see me as a devil later.

401
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,390
Why are you belittling yourself like this?

402
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,230
You deserve to be liked by people after accomplishing a good deed.

403
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,140
I think you just lack compliments.

404
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,310
You'll get used to it after being praised by us for a few more years.

405
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,560
 No, I'm afraid he won't have a few more years. 

406
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,940
 I must destroy the evil bone within one year. 

407
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,990
I don't care...

408
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,460
whether people like me or not.

409
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,330
It's enough as long as you are willing to like me.

410
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,640
You should have this.

411
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,560
I don't like it.

412
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,020
If so, why did you buy so many of them?

413
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,140
Do you still remember the previous New Year's Eve?

414
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,260
That was my first time strolling through the street.

415
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,290
You bought me a new coat.

416
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,980
It was snowing that day.

417
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,770
And it got dark pretty soon.

418
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,750
On our way home,

419
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,020
we met a woman selling firecrackers.

420
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,710
 Sister, I'll buy all the firecrackers in your basket. 

421
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,540
 Miss, 

422
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,870
 I made these firecrackers with my own hands. 

423
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,020
 I'm afraid they are not very good-looking. 

424
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,740
 Don't worry. I like ones like that.  

425
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,400
 Miss... 

426
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,280
 You can have this, too.. 

427
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,170
 Happy New Year, sister. 

428
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,940
  Miss! 

429
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,810
♫  Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave  ♫

430
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,420
Back then, I couldn't understand why you did so.

431
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,820
But now, I can understand why.

432
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,400
Understand what?

433
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,650
♫  I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish  ♫

434
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,050
I understand how tough it is for the sick.

435
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,740
I understand how miserable it is for the poor.

436
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,470
I understand sympathy.

437
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,730
And I understand the desire to do good.

438
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,810
♫  I would send ashes and brightness to the moon  ♫

439
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,890
I can feel their pain and hardships.

440
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,230
Now,

441
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,550
I just want to do everything I can to help more people.

442
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,160
For some reason,

443
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,610
ever since I came back from the bottom of the Mo River

444
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,020
♫  A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears  ♫

445
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,210
...and had you by my side, it seemed like...

446
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,100
I was able to feel more and more emotions.

447
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,260
Suddenly, I was able to appreciate...

448
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,350
how beautiful this world is.

449
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,400
 What will happen if I tell him about the evil bone? 

450
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,650
 Maybe he won't turn into the Devil Lord on his initiative 

451
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,590
 once he knows the truth. 

452
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,330
 And I'll be able to be with him forever and protect him. 

453
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,370
 I won't need to turn my Soul-slaying Teardrop into spikes 

454
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,900
 and stab his heart with them. 

455
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,070
What's wrong?

456
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,760
Tantai Jin,

457
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,070
I think...

458
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,630
there's something...

459
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,530
you have to know.

460
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,400
What is it?

461
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,050
 - Your Majesty!  
 - I…

462
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,600
Your Majesty! There you are!

463
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,930
How could you leave the palace without telling me?

464
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,310
Even if you forbade me from following you,

465
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,670
at least you should notify me.

466
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,460
Second Young Miss, you're also here.

467
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,930
I guess I'll leave.

468
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,610
Never mind.

469
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,530
It's getting late. I'll return with you.

470
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,320
 Forget it. I'll find another chance to tell him. 

471
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,460
 Your Majesty, I have something to discuss with you. 

472
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,050
 Will you let me stay by your side 

473
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,830
 if I assist you in capturing Prince Xuancheng? 

474
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,950
 The city gates are open on the night of the Water Festival. 

475
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,870
 Tonight's the only night Xiao Lin can enter the city. 

476
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,390
 If he succeeds, my safety will be guaranteed. 

477
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,420
 If he fails, this will be my gift to Tantai Jin. 

478
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,200
 Either way, it's my win. 

479
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,460
 Seems like the show's about to begin. 

480
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,610
No need to hide. Show yourself.

481
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,380
Eldest Young Miss Ye, stay quiet. It's me.

482
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,450
Scholar Pang?

483
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,590
We're running out of time. Let's go!

484
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,990
 If Pang Yizhi is here, that means the plan worked. 

485
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,020
 Xiao Lin is definitely here. 

486
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,070
Xiao Lin, now, you're the only survivor of the Sheng Kingdom.

487
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,380
You should cherish your life.

488
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,340
My life means nothing compared to the calamity my kingdom is facing.

489
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,590
Is it a calamity your kingdom is facing or is it a personal affair?

490
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,090
Eldest Young Miss Ye, what's wrong?

491
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,860
 The final winner is still unknown. 

492
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,160
 I can't leave yet. 

493
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,830
Scholar Pang, I can't walk.

494
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,090
You guys should hurry and escape. Don't worry about me.

495
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,570
His Highness entrusted you to me. How could I leave you behind?

496
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,150
Zhong Tai!

497
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,620
- Scholar Pang. 
 - Escort Eldest Young Miss Ye out of here.

498
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,180
Yes, sir.

499
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,210
Someone! Help!

500
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,470
- Help! 
 - Stop!

501
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,470
What happened?

502
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,560
There are assassins in the palace!

503
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,020
You must be careful!

504
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,340
Someone's trying to assassinate Tantai Jin?

505
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,220
Let them go.

506
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,300
Are you going to kill me?

507
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,460
Xiao Lin, the conflict between the two kingdoms just ended not long ago.

508
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,480
The world is gradually regaining peace.

509
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,340
If you kill me today,

510
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,240
the two kingdoms will descend into chaos again.

511
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,280
Countless people will die.

512
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,030
You know that...

513
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,240
better than anyone.

514
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,240
That's why you won't kill me.

515
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,590
Why are you here today?

516
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,720
I want you to pull back your troops and end the war.

517
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,170
A fair request.

518
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,680
But it's a shame.

519
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,670
Today,

520
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,270
you don't get to bargain with me.

521
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,430
You knew I was going to assassinate you tonight?

522
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,160
Every inch of land is my territory now.

523
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,740
Now, my eyes and ears are everywhere.

524
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,570
My informant will tell me everything, including when you made your plan

525
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,780
and when you will set off.

526
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,740
Today, Prince Xuancheng, you came here uninvited.

527
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,540
It would be rude of me not to give you a warm welcome.

528
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,360
I admit defeat.

529
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,430
Kneel.

530
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,280
Xiao Lin, is this all that's left of the Secret Dragon Guards?

531
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,040
Where are your two trusted followers?

532
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,140
Madam Xuancheng, where are you going in the middle of the night?

533
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,030
 Seems like Xiao Lin failed. 

534
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,410
How dare you kidnap me?

535
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,000
Chief Pian, they wanted to kidnap me.

536
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,790
Save me!

537
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,300
You guys heard that, right?

538
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,340
What a bunch of foolish men.

539
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,750
You all can't even figure this out?

540
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,040
Tantai Jin!

541
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,040
Tantai Jin!

542
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,500
Why are you here at such a late hour?

543
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,410
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

544
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,990
Don't worry. I'm fine.

545
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,650
I was terrified.

546
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,760
Look at you. Your hands are freezing.

547
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,050
Do you feel better now?

548
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,490
Xiao Lin?

549
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,830
 Xiao Lin was the one who tried to assassinate Tantai Jin? 

550
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,060
 What should I do? 

551
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,250
It's been a long time, Second Young Miss.

552
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,650
- Well… 
 - You'd better not ask me

553
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,920
to show him mercy at this moment.

554
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,410
Thank you for your kindness, Second Young Miss.

555
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,130
I was aware of the consequences.

556
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,830
 Report! 

557
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:47,470
Report!

558
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,730
Chief Pianran has intercepted the rebels who kidnapped Madam Xuancheng.

559
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,750
Your Majesty, don't worry. Madam Xuancheng is fine.

560
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,220
Good. Tell Pianran to bring her here.

561
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,670
I need to ask her something.

562
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,570
Run!

564
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,530
What?

565
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,090
Don't tell me you want me to help you up?

566
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,030
I wasn't on their side.

567
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,930
Please clarify the truth in front of His Majesty on my behalf.

568
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,900
Is that so?

569
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,150
Why do you possess it?

570
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,230
What do you mean?

571
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,300
Speak!

572
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,050
Why do you possess that love thread?

573
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,260
I don't know!

574
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,810
Let go of me!

575
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,030
I'm a distinguished guest of His Majesty.

576
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,800
I'm going to ask you one last time.

577
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,300
Where did you get that love thread?

578
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,080
Do you really think I'm as stupid as them?

579
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,360
You think I can't do anything to you if you don't talk?

580
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,980
Let go.

581
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,580
Pianran, calm down.

582
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,180
There's no need for violence.

583
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,950
Qingyu, she's trying to kill me.

584
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,430
Qingyu.

585
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,080
No matter what my sister has done,

586
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,600
I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

587
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,990
Let's straighten things out first.

588
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,320
I've got nothing to straighten out with you.

589
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,880
Out of my way!

590
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,950
Get lost.

591
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,480
Get lost!

592
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,950
Pianran, I heard you mention something about a love thread just now.

593
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,020
What exactly is going on?

594
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,780
It's none of your business.

595
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,980
How could that be?

596
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,350
Chief, His Majesty has ordered you to bring Madam Xuancheng to the main hall.

597
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,540
Sir, I failed to complete my mission.

598
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,380
How come?

599
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,220
Eldest Young Miss Ye claimed that we kidnapped her.

600
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,300
She was unwilling to leave with us.

601
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,220
Why would Xiao Lin fall for someone like her?

602
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,460
Scholar Pang, what should we do now?

603
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,960
Leave the capital in small groups as per His Highness's instruction.

604
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,970
After that, join up with Chen Xian's main force.

605
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,370
Yes, sir.

606
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,940
Let's go.

607
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Prince Xuancheng, it might be too sentimental for you to meet your wife in a foreign land.

608
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,570
Why don't you wait behind the hall for a while?

609
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,380
Please.

610
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,860
What's the matter?

611
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,350
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

612
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,990
Were you hurt?

613
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,690
Out of all the things to do, why did you put your neck into the noose?

614
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,610
Report!

615
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,500
Report! Chief Pianran, General Ye, and Madam Xuancheng are here to seek an audience.

616
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,190
Let them in.

617
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

618
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,350
 In the end, Bingchang still couldn't make it out. 

619
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,810
Madam Xuancheng contributed the most to the assassins' capture tonight.

620
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,940
She deserves the highest award.

621
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

622
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,340
I'm honored to resolve your troubles for you.

623
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,250
I…

624
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,280
dare not take credit for it.

625
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,320
What does that mean?

626
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,260
What has Eldest Sister got to do with this operation?

627
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,960
You had the idea to send Xiao Lin a letter with encrypted messages

628
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,870
to make him believe that your life was in danger.

629
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,120
You asked for his help urgently with the letter you wrote.

630
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:27,820
A chivalrous man like Xiao Lin would definitely come to your rescue personally.

631
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,980
This is a devious scheme that takes advantage of human nature.

632
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,250
You have outdone most of my advisers.

633
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,140
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

634
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,600
But I'm curious about something.

635
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,880
What if Xiao Lin succeeded in assassinating me tonight?

636
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,870
Would you swim with the current and leave together with him?

637
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,800
Your Majesty, please give us your wise judgment.

638
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,830
I had cut off all ties with Xiao Lin ever since I came back from the Sheng Kingdom.

639
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,880
Eldest Sister, you…

640
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:18,320

♫  Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense  ♫

650
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,660
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

651
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,380
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

652
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,020
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

653
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,200
♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

654
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,800
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

655
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:39,860
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

656
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,360
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

657
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,080
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

658
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,440
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

659
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,240
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

660
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,760
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

661
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,720
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

662
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,600
 You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

663
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:16,540
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

664
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:24,340
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

665
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:33,980
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
