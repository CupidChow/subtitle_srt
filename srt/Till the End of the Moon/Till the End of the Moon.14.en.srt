<i>[Episode 14]</i>

15
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,230
<i>It hurts badly.</i>

16
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,443
<i>It's not right.</i>

17
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:04,260
<i>If my injury is healed, will the demonic energy come back?</i>

18
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Forget it, I can't hold back Mingye.</i>

19
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,650
<i>But will Mingye care about my sincerity?</i>

20
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,290
<i>The two gods wanted to test the king's sincerity.</i>

21
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,540
<i>One transformed into a small white dove and the other transformed into a hawk.</i>

22
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,860
<i>The hawk chased the white dove and the dove pounced into the arms of the king.</i>

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,620
<i>The white dove pleaded with the king, "Please save me, save me quickly."</i>

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,260
<i>The king, being a sincere person, said to the hawk, "You can eat my flesh."</i>

25
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,060
<i>The hawk said, "I can eat your flesh,</i>

26
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,370
<i>but I want to eat the amount of flesh that is the same weight as the dove.</i>

27
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,680
<i>Otherwise, won't I get the short end of the stick?"</i>

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,850
<i>The king agreed, so he had someone bring a scale.</i>

29
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,760
<i>He put the dove on one end of the scale and cut a piece of flesh</i>

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,430
<i>from his leg and placed it on the other end.</i>

31
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>Guess what happened?</i>

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,190
<i>The weight of the flesh was not enough.</i>

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,200
<i>So the king cut another piece of flesh from his leg and placed it on the scale. But it was still not enough.</i>

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,390
<i>He cut all the flesh from both legs, but it was still not enough.</i>

35
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,540
<i>Why? I have seen doves before.</i>

36
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,870
<i>Doves are much smaller than the herring in our river.</i>

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,990
<i>That's because these two gods wanted to test the king's sincerity.</i>

38
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,480
<i>However, what they didn't expect was that the king stood up with difficulty</i>

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,800
<i>and threw his entire body onto the scale to exchange the dove's life.</i>

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,960
<i>As a result, it was the king's sincerity that moved the gods.</i>

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,690
<i>The king's body was completely restored, and he ascended to become a god.</i>

42
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>However, I still don't understand why someone's sincerity needs to be tested by cutting their flesh and blood.</i>

43
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,900
<i>So many people pray to the gods, claiming that they are sincere.</i>

44
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,830
<i>If he is not faced with unbearable suffering,</i>

45
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,120
<i>how can we know if he is truly sincere?</i>

46
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,820
<i>I can't give in.</i>

47
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,100
<i>I can't let Mingye worry about me.</i>

48
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,980
<i>I haven't seen Sang Jiu these days.</i>

49
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,120
<i>Where is she?</i>

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>Could it be true, as Tian Huan said?</i>

51
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,210
<i>No. I have to go and ask her.</i>

52
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,750
<i>Mingye, I'm going back to the Mo River for a few days.</i>

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,950
<i>No need to worry about me.</i>

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,500
<i>Is she avoiding me?</i>

55
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,680
♫ <i>I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky</i> ♫

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,850
<i>Wars have been frequent recently.</i>

57
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,950
<i>I wonder if Sang Jiu has returned from the Mo River.</i>

58
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,440
<i>Why can't I meet her?</i>

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,820
<i>I miss Mingye so much, but I can't go to him.</i>

<i>Mingye, I heard that you went to battle again.</i>

63
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,750
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

64
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,160

<i>Mingye, when can you see my sincerity?</i>

74
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:42,790
<i>Before, my nanny always said when she couldn't sleep at night,</i>

75
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,590
<i>she had to gather demonic energy to make pearls so as to pass the time.</i>

76
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,430
<i>She actually accumulated a full bag of pearls.</i>

77
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,600
<i>I once made fun of her,</i>

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,380
<i>but I didn't expect that I am doing the same so soon.</i>

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,140
<i>When my shift is over, I must go back and find Sang Jiu.</i>

80
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,790
<i>Even if she is really avoiding me, I must see her.</i>

81
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,830
Report! The traces of a demon group have been found 300 miles away, but they don't have any intention to attack.

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,220
They are gathering towards the Demon Realm.

83
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,320
Towards the Demon Realm?

84
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,653
Yes.

85
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,370
Follow me.

86
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,820
Let's go spy on them.

87
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,153
Yes.

88
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,670
All gods arrive.

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,360
Mingye, did you find any information during your search in the Demon Realm?

90
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,970
The Devil Lord did take action and has sinister intentions.

91
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,900
Therefore, I have summoned everyone to discuss a solution.

92
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,900
This time, I sneaked into Barren Abyss

93
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,220
and discovered that the Devil Lord is practicing am array called All-in-Distress Way.

94
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,790
It seems that this array can devour all pure energy in the world,

95
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,910
causing all living beings to die and demons to thrive.

96
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,850
If he succeeds, wouldn't this world become purgatory?

97
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,660
We mustn't allow him to open the All-in-Distress Way!

98
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,470
But now, it seems that the Devil Lord is like an arrow on the bow, ready to be released.

99
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,440
How can we stop him?

100
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,700
Is there no way to kill the Devil Lord?

101
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,660
Mingye, since you called us here, do you have any good ideas?

102
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,343
Yes.

103
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,640
When the Devil God practices the array, he will extract the evil bone

104
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,640
and personally guide the foul energy of Heaven and Earth.

105
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,700
As long as the evil bone is not destroyed, the Devil Lord won't die.

106
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,833
So, when the evil bone leaves his body, the Devil Lord can be killed.

107
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,920
This will be the only chance.

108
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,360
But the evil bone connects the Devil Lord and the All-in-Distress Way.

109
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
How can we get it?

110
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,460
That's right, Mingye.

111
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,220
How should we assist you?

112
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,270
And what do you plan to do?

113
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,130
We can set up an ambush near the Devil Palace.

114
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,810
When the array is activated, the Devil Lord has to defend the center of the array.

115
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,680
At that time, I will do my best to force him away from the center and stop the array.

116
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,770
Then I will go with you.

117
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,610
There are many demon soldiers in the palace, but I can use the power of the God of the Cosmos to freeze time

118
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,700
and separate the demon soldiers with the Time Freeze Trap.

119
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,000
This way, you only need to deal with the Devil Lord alone.

120
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm the God of the Universe.

121
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,620
I can be anywhere in the universe, so I can take advantage of the Devil Lord's unpreparedness

122
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,870
to take the evil bone away from the Devil Palace and seal it in the Heavenly Pillar.

123
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,350
The Heavenly Pillar is the supreme place in the universe, where the spiritual veins of Heaven and Earth converge.

124
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,870
It is indeed capable of sealing the evil bone.

125
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,330
The God of the Sun, please grant the Nine Celestial Bodies and Big Dipper Array.

126
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,150
It seems that it's time to use this array.

127
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,710
Indeed. To trap the Devil Lord, we can only use this array.

128
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,080
The Nine Celestial Bodies and Big Dipper Array are granted by the heavens.

129
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,500
This array was created to imprison demons. Once it is activated, both gods and demons will be trapped

130
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,320
and unable to escape, except for Chuhuang who can control space.

131
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,833
Mingye, are you sure about this?

132
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,370
The Devil Lord was born from the foul energy of Heaven and Earth.

133
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,030
What nurtures him is the endless pain, sadness, and hatred in this world.

134
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,680
As long as there is pain and sorrow in this world, the Devil Lord will be immortal.

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,560
Even as gods like us, we cannot match him.

136
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,950
Now we can only gamble on this last chance.

137
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,970
When Jize and Chuhuang leave,

138
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,280
I will use my true form to hold the Devil Lord, trapping myself with him in the array.

139
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,290
I won't give up until death.

140
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,950
You don't have to worry about me. Even if I'm trapped in the array, it's nothing.

141
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,630
I can just risk my divine body to fight until death.

142
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,430
It's not a big deal to me.

143
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,040
Since you are so brave and risking your lives, why should we save our divine power?

144
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,460
If necessary, we can burn up all of our divine power.

145
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,540
When the nine celestial bodies are in alignment, I will move them

146
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,420
and rain down celestial punishment to assist you in killing the Devil Lord.

147
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,150
Under the punishment, everything will be destroyed and the Devil Lord will not be able to escape.

148
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,460
Even if we exhaust all gods' divine power, we can only activate the celestial punishment once,

149
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,490
so we must aim carefully.

150
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,580
I might not come back from this journey.

151
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,530
I bid my farewell.

152
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,610
From now on, the survival of all living beings in the Three Realms will depend on you.

153
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,510
Little Mingye, you can go.

154
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,843
Don't worry, we will take this responsibility.

155
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,600
I, Jize, am honored to know you all.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,770
I have lived a fulfilling life in the Shangqing God Realm for tens of thousands of years.

157
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,790
Now, I have no regrets.

158
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,620
After seeing you off this time, I don't know how many of you will return.

159
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,150
Maybe after this battle, there will be no more gods in the world.

160
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,190
It will be a new start.

161
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,853
Everyone, hopefully, we will meet again.

162
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,750
<i>I heard that someone is assisting her in dual-cultivation outside.</i>

163
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,040
<i>So, she probably doesn't need you anymore.</i>

164
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,790
<i>I might not come back from this journey.</i>

165
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,590
<i>I bid my farewell.</i>

166
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:59,700
<i>From now on, the survival of all living beings in the Three Realms will depend on you.</i>

167
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,973
<i>So be it.</i>

168
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:07,200
<i>I will die and my soul will be destroyed on this journey.</i>

169
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,980
<i>If Sang Jiu has found the person she loves and stays with,</i>

170
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,120
<i>it's better than being alone in Yuqing Palace for the rest of her life.</i>

171
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
<i>[Divorce Letter]</i>

172
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,033
<i>Sang Jiu, I'll let you go.</i>

173
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,260
<i>After I kill the Devil Lord,</i>

174
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:29,990
<i>and then you can live with the one you love safely and happily ever after.</i>

175
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,670
Did Mingye ask you to give it to me?

176
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,890
Yes, Lady.

177
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,373
Lady!

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,533
Lady!

179
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,890
Ruby.

180
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,523
Goddess.

181
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,480
Send it to Lady Sang now.

182
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,013
Yes.

183
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,053
Mingye.

184
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,763
Mingye!

185
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,680
Mingye. Mingye!

186
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,483
Mingye!

187
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,810
What's the point of sending a piece of paper?

188
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,500
If you really don't want to see me again, just tell me face-to-face.

189
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,560
Mingye. Mingye.

190
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,343
Mingye!

191
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,300
Mingye, say something!

192
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,543
Mingye!

193
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:49,590
Sang Jiu, you have 24 hours to pack up and leave the Yuqing Palace.

194
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,150
Leave Shangqing God Realm.

195
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,900
What are you talking about? Are you crazy?

196
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,630
What did I do to piss you off?

197
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:13,340
For so many days, I dare not say or do anything.

198
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,210
I was even afraid to look at you and talk to you for a few moments.

199
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,360
And now you don't even want to look at me. Are you planning to use a piece of paper to drive me away?

200
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,270
From the beginning, it was your father who forced me.

201
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,510
I didn't have any affection for you.

202
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,400
The safety and stability of the Four Continents and Three Realms rely on me,

203
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,200
but you won't stop pestering me.

204
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,900
You asked me to teach you swordsmanship and clear your foul energy.

205
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,760
I'm already tired of these things.

206
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,610
Now, I can only abandon you.

207
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,560
Because I...

208
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,550
bothered you?

209
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,343
Yes.

210
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,430
I did not expect...

211
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,300
♫ <i>Seeing all the colors of the wind, being drowned by the sea of clouds</i> ♫

212
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,160
I tried to avoid you...

213
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,503
and not to bother you, but things still ended up like this.

214
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,830
♫ <i>Tides are outlined by the waxes and wanes of the moon</i> ♫

215
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,840
My dad once told me a story about a king saving a white dove.

216
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,060
♫ <i>Waiting to speak, but thoughts only remain in silence</i> ♫

217
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:49,260
He told me that the king cut off his flesh to feed the hawk in order to save the dove.

218
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,050
<i>But it was still not enough.</i>

219
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,130
<i>The gods are so unreasonable.</i>

220
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,620
<i>However, I still don't understand why someone's sincerity needs to be tested by cutting their flesh and blood.</i>

221
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:04,660
<i>That's because these two gods wanted to test the king's sincerity.</i>

222
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,280
<i>However, what they didn't expect was that</i>

223
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>the king stood up with difficulty and threw his entire body</i>

224
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,640
<i>onto the scale to exchange the dove's life.</i>

225
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,150
<i>As long as you have sincerity, the gods will definitely be moved.</i>

226
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:30,410
I thought I had enough sincerity, but the god never turned his head towards me.

227
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,113
Mingye,

228
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,220
I will go back to pack my luggage.

229
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
And I will leave...

230
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,650
before the sun is out.

231
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,610
Sang…

232
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,060
♫ <i>I still remember your figure is outlined by the stars</i> ♫

233
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,700
Mingye...

234
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,160
♫ <i>It shines so brightly that I am not able to touch</i> ♫

235
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,780
♫ <i>My crush is frozen by streamers of light</i> ♫

236
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,513
Mingye...

237
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,810
I want to ask you one thing.

238
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,540
Have you ever,

239
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,920
♫ <i>With one glance, my soul was fettered</i> ♫

240
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,090
...even a little bit,

241
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,840
for even one second,

242
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,830
♫ <i>I pray that the rest of my life is only for this moment</i> ♫

243
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,060
had any feelings for me?

244

♫ <i>I cannot escape fate's rules</i> ♫

245
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,750

♫ <i>Maybe, the only way to solve a catastrophe is to make my love into a sword and break the connection between the sky and the water</i> ♫

252
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,260
<i>Why don't you have one, too?</i>

253

<i>Why are you eating everything you see?</i>

254

I'm leaving.

284
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,490
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

285
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,533
All right.

286
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,440
I didn't know you could drink.

287
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,543
Okay, it's just what I want.

288
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:14,263
Sang Jiu, you have something you want to say to me?

289
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,213
No.

290
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,690
Before I go,

291
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,060
I just want to get what you owe me.

292
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,580
What?

293
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,730
You owe me...

294
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,510
a wedding night.

295
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,423
Relax.

296
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,480
I created this toxic orb myself.

297
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,830
It weakens a person momentarily

298
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,820
but not lethal.

299
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,503
Sang…

300
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,150
Sang Jiu…

301
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,663
Oh, it also takes away your voice.

302
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,970
<i>After tonight,</i>

303
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,820
<i>we let go of our grievances...</i>

304
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,330
<i>and go our separate ways.</i>

305
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,513
<i>Sang Jiu,</i>

306
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,420
<i>you and I did not bid farewell properly.</i>

307
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,620
<i>After all, I let you down.</i>

308
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,933
<i>Today...</i>

309
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,960
<i>Right, it is this very day…</i>

310
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,490
<i>We pay a huge price</i>

311
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,680
<i>and prepare for so long.</i>

312
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,513
<i>It's all…</i>

313
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,720
<i>for this fight today.</i>

314
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,500
The Devil's Army has gathered near the Devil Palace.

315
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,340
The Devil Lord is planning to cast All-in-Distress Way over all three realms.

316
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,110
If his plan works, it causes the destruction of all lives.

317
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,590
A complete annihilation.

318
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,990
Are you willing to join me to kill devils?

319
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,170
<i>We will gladly join the fight!</i>

320
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,700
<i>We will gladly join the fight! We will gladly join the fight!</i>

321
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,900
<i>We will gladly join the fight!</i>

322
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:06,340
<i>Lord of Monsters! Lord of Monsters! Lord of Monsters!</i>

323
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,540
Lord of Monsters, you have control over 100,000 evil cultivators.

324
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,890
That's a crazy number of followers.

325
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,680
We are all at the Devil Lord's disposal.

326
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,980
You two do not need to call me Lord of Monsters.

327
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,780
Please, call me Dimian.

328
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,720
Oh, you truly care about your own kind, don't you?

329
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,180
Now I see why you fell out with your wife to cross over to the Devil Lord.

330
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,780
I can't imagine what it would be if you ran into her in the battle.

331
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,070
Right now, we have bigger fish to fry.

332
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,480
We need to think of a way to complete our mission.

333
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,030
Greetings, My Lord.

334
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,530
Today, I will unite all three realms.

335
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,400
The array of All-in-Distress Way will suck all the pure energy out of the universe.

336
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,590
and fill the world with foul energy.

337
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,730
Before long, all living things will turn evil.

338
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,400
We will come together to share the everlasting desolateness.

339
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:23,650
Siying, Jingmie, Dimian, offer your devil energy.

340
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,710
Use the devil artifact as a medium and assist me to create the array.

341
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,180
<i>So that's the Devil Lord's ultimate weapon of mass destruction, huh?</i>

342
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,370
It is your great honor to protect the initiation of the All-in-Distress Way.

343
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,120
Let all things be desolate.

344
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,050
<i>Chuhuang, I'll leave it to you.</i>

345
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,630
<i>Mingye, how are you holding up?</i>

346
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,730
<i>Where are you now?</i>

347
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,530
<i>What have you been up to since we parted ways?</i>

348
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,900
<i>The war must be still occupying your time, I guess?</i>

349
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,260
<i>I cannot help myself from thinking about you sometimes.</i>

350
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,580
<i>I'm worried that you might be injured.</i>

351
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,130
<i>I just hope you live well.</i>

352
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,693
Mingye.

353
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:45,110
You're still alive.

354
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,860
I dare not to die since demons are not yet destroyed.

355
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,610
<i>We have to stop the Devil Lord before the array is successfully executed.</i>

356
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,030
<i>Time is of the essence.</i>

357
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,510
<i>I'll be off to the Demon Realm first.</i>

358
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,440
<i>The Devil Lord isn't our only problem there.</i>

359
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,000
<i>There are also three other Devils and tens of millions of soldiers.</i>

360
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,570
<i>You're hopelessly outnumbered.</i>

361
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,800
<i>You cannot stop the Devil Lord if you go by yourself first.</i>

362
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,900
<i>That's all the more reason for me to go first.</i>

363
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,490
<i>I can lure away those three sidekicks of his, leaving him all alone.</i>

364
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,030
This is outrageous.

365
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
Jingmie, step aside.

366
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,540
Mingye did manage to keep them off the offering altar.

367
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,760
Let's just hope everything goes as planned.

368
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,980
<i>Mingye, I'm ready.</i>

369
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,313
<i>Devil Lord, your turn.</i>

370
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,370
- How dare you disrespect His Lordship?
- Kill him.

371
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,590
This is the Cage of Time Freeze.

372
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:40,100
If you want to go back in time and lose your powers, by all means, go ahead.

373
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,590
- Attention, heavenly soldiers.
<i>- Yes.</i>

374
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,960
Today, follow me to kill all demons.

375
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,110
We will purge the Demon Realm. No retreat until death!

376
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,690
<i>No retreat until death!</i>

377
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,830
<i>Devil Lord, you actually created such an evil array against Heaven.</i>

378
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,080
<i>If the array is activated, it will lead to the annihilation of all three realms.</i>

379
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,350
<i>With everything gone, so are all sins.</i>

380
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,170
<i>And I will return to nothingness.</i>

381
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:15,860
<i>Such a shame your followers are under the wrong impression that you'll be ruling the realms with them.</i>

382
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,500
<i>Turns out it's a suicide mission for them.</i>

383
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,600
Jingmie, ignore their soldiers. Break the Cage of Time Freeze.

384
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,710
<i>The truth is, your hands are tied, whatever my real intention is.</i>

385
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,650
<i>The God of the Cosmos' Cage of Time Freeze isn't strong enough to take on my demon soldiers.</i>

386
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,720
<i>Not to mention your divine power.</i>

387
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,560
<i>It can't harm me one bit.</i>

388
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,780
<i>I cannot harm you but our combined powers can.</i>

389
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,130
A portal?

390
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,910
Very good.

391
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:29,260
I indeed did not expect that blow.

392
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,910
The God of the Universe?

393
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,370
<i>You see, to me,</i>

394
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:44,540
<i>it doesn't make a difference how many of them die for my cause.</i>

395
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,190
<i>The All-in-Distress Way has been broken and the foul energy has cleared.</i>

396
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,770
<i>Everyone, send in a backup to support heavenly soldiers quickly.</i>

397
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,780
You can stop the All-in-Distress Way.

398
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,500
I see you people came prepared.

399
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,410
Little flood dragon, what else do you want to do?

400
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,860
Oh, I didn't think the Devil Lord felt fear, too.

401
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,940
Aren't you full of surprises?

402
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,610
I'm not letting you get away with it this time.

403
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,310
Today, whether I live or die.

404
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,920
I will kill you.

405
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,883
Oh, yeah?

406
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,410
Well then, show me

407
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,540
what else you're capable of.

408
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,400
<i>I knew it. Removing the evil bone from his body makes him vulnerable.</i>

409
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,640
<i>And once this bone is sealed, we'll be able to take him out, once and for all.</i>

410
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,410
<i>Chuhuang, it's almost time.</i>

411
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,000
I got you.

412
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,280
No, I got you.

413
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,200
It is not over yet.

414
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,590
It's time.

415
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,213
Nine Celestial Bodies and Big Dipper Array, initiate!

416
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,493
Initiate!

417
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,280
What's that?

418
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,590
It's the Nine Celestial Bodies and Big Dipper Array.

419
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:47,000
As long as it stays intact, no one, not even Lord, can get out of here.

420
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,650
Chuhuang, the evil bone's all yours!

421
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,280
Oh no, my evil bone.

422
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,480
Catch up with His Lordship. Kill all the heavenly soldiers.

423
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,480
The Devil Lord is trying to break through the array. Hold on.

424
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,490
No, he's trapped.

425
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,070
<i>We did it.</i>

426
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,840
Mingye, are you okay?

427
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,473
I'm fine.

428
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,280
The barrier of the array has been cast. Nobody leaves the Demon Realm.

429
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,250
Together, you and I can finish off the Devil Lord.

430
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,800
<i>Stripping him of the evil bone didn't seem to do enough damage to slow him down.</i>

431
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,090
<i>This is going to be a fierce battle.</i>

432
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,210
<i>Fortunately, with the barrier of the array being cast, once the evil bone is sealed,</i>

433
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,330
<i>it's only a matter of time before we eliminate the Devil Lord.</i>

434
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,380
<i>Damn it. I'm stuck in here.</i>

435
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,590
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

436
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,890
That's the trace of Chuhuang's divine power.

437
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,550
Where'd Dimian go?

438
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,250
I thought we couldn't get out of this array.

439
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Follow His Lordship.

440
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,173
What's going on?

441
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:05,540
Jize, your divine power is drying up because of freezing time.

442
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,820
You have to stop or you're going to burn out of divine essence.

443
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,950
The Devil Lord is gone. What are you waiting for?

444
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:17,660
- But you…
- Mingye, don't be silly. We both bear a heavy burden.

445
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,790
If one of us has to stay, it'll be me in the limelight. All right?

446
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,833
Trust me.

447
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,963
Jize!

448
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,213
Jize…

449
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,960
<i>I want you to have this phoenix feather. It holds all my divine powers.</i>

450
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,550
<i>No matter where you are, if you want to see me, it will bring you to me at once.</i>

451
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,030
Give me the evil bone.

452
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:46,570
Unless you walk over my dead body. Don't even think about it.

453
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,053
Chuhuang, hand over the evil bone.

454
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:19,530
With it, I will become the Devil Lord.

455
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:25,060
And when I become the lord of all three realms, I can rule the whole universe with you.

456
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:32,063
Dimian, I thought you were deceived by the Devil Lord, making you untrue to yourself.

457
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:38,700
But now you're telling me you want the evil bone for your own benefit?

458
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,770
It is for our benefit.

459
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,970
You are the Goddess of the Phoenix Clan.

460
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,770
If I am not the lord of all three realms,

461
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,960
how can I deserve you?

462
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,223
It is absurd.

463
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:56,110
Don't use me as an excuse to cover up your despicable ambition. It makes me sick.

464
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,120
To my surprise, the dignified God of the Universe

465
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:30,680
stole from my realm. It was unexpected!

466
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,303
Mingye.
