3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,340
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,650
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,000
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,180
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,410
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,150
♫  I do not fear   ♫

10
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,100
♫  How people treat me in this world  ♫

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,180
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape.    ♫

12
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,520
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,240
♫   There are times when I'm fragile  ♫

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,200
♫   To heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,220
♫  My existence  ♫

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:31,000
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,220
   

18
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,280
   

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,230
His Majesty lives there.

20
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,650
Just do as we agreed. Go in and take a look.

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,700
Take one look and come back. I'll ask someone to send you back.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,770
Got it. Where are you going?

23
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,500
I'll go see Ye Qingyu.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,380
I'm afraid he injured his head.

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,960
His head must have already been injured; otherwise, how could he like you?

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,960
 Be quick and neat. 

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
 Come on… 

28
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,300
Keep practicing.

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,900
How is your injury?

30
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,610
It's fine, thanks.

31
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,540
You're just in time. There's a thing that's been bothering me.

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,760
- Chief Pian. 
 - Chief Pian.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,530
- What did I teach you? 
 - Chief Pian.

34
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,010
You've forgotten everything in just a few days.

35
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't care whatever kind of imps you were before.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,010
Even I have to carry my tail between my legs since I joined.

37
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,680
If you keep going on like this,

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,430
the king might kill you for your cores.

39
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,870
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,370
 Young Devil Lord looks fine. 

41
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,820
- How's your assignment going so far? 
  - It looks like he isn't seriously injured. 

42
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,970
 Has he recovered? 

43
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,010
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,020
 Thankfully, he's fine. 

45
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,940
If something goes wrong…

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,050
 But why is my head so heavy? 

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,200
What's that sound?

48
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,480
Are the chefs killing pigs?

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,210
No.

50
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,600
Your Majesty, the crow said it had just seen the female devil

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,610
who asked them to deliver letters eight times a day.

52
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,050
 I fled fast. Young Devil Lord couldn't have seen me. 

53
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,530
Ye Xiwu.

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,110
Why are you here?

55
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,110
I hid in the troops.

56
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,460
Pianran doesn't know this. Don't punish her.

57
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,680
I just wanted to see you. I heard you were injured.

58
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,870
And I haven't heard from you for days.

59
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,480
I…

60
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,070
 A nail. 

61
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,680
Ye Xiwu.

62
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,090
You smell rancid.

63
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,090
This dress looks nice. Quite beautiful.

64
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,440
Baiyu, ask the doctor to bring some medicine.

65
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,290
Got it.

66
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,520
♫   When your gaze comes a little closer   ♫

67
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,080
♫    My heart beats faster taking root in the void  ♫

68
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,920
♫    The stars scattered in the sky   ♫

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,180
♫   Quietly falling on your brow   ♫

70
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,760
♫    As my heart sets its direction, time passes and deepens   ♫

71
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,240
♫   Using the Milky Way as a pillow, the moonlight as a kiss   ♫

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,060
♫    I want to enter your dreams   ♫

73
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,300
♫   To explore the spring in your eyes   ♫

74
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,900
♫   We are devoutly turning the gears of fate   ♫

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,390
The camp isn't as good as the palace.

76
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,620
If your wound is not treated timely, it will worsen.

77
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,540
Understand?

78
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,120
♫   We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts   ♫

79
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,640
♫   Wishing to see only one person in this lifetime   ♫

80
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,280
♫   Only hoping to be moved; Not afraid to call each other's name   ♫

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,660
♫   The traces of my innermost feelings, don't ask if they are worth it   ♫

82
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,120
♫   Just believe that it's the right time   ♫

83
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,770
It's done.

84
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,540
Is there anywhere else you feel unwell?

85
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,270
No.

86
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,920
Thank you.

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,800
I feel… I feel much better.

88
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,630
I'll go back now…

89
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,090
Be careful.

90
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,910
 The demon soldiers at the border couldn't have shown up coincidentally. 

91
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,950
 What exactly is Xiao Yi up to? 

92
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,690
I can't wait for your demon soldiers to be ready.

93
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,150
Do you have a faster way?

94
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,650
Your Majesty, if you're willing to take risks, My Lord has a way.

95
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,690
Take the bones of a close relative of Tantai Jin as a medicine inducer and nine pairs of boys and girls

96
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,130
as well as Tantai Jin's loved one as sacrificial offers.

97
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,750
Only in that way, will your wish come true.

98
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,380
However, the conjuration requires the bones of his close relative.

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,110
Okay, that's easy. I'll send someone to get it.

100
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,890
As to Tantai Jin's loved one, I have the insane maid here.

101
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,420
There is a sign of thunder for tonight.

102
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,350
It's a good time for the conjuration.

103
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,850
Once the conjuration is finished, Tantai Jin will die for sure.

104
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,020
 These tents all look the same. 

105
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,660
 Why do I feel like I've been circling this place? 

106
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,240
The military region has a complex topography.

107
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,790
If you're lost, you can follow the Three-Legged Golden Crow.

108
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,900
Tantai Jin.

109
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,800
Do you not blame me for leaving the capital

110
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,320
and secretly coming to the military camp?

111
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,320
Why did you have to walk here?

112
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,440
That fox was deliberately giving you a hard time to make you quit.

113
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,740
Didn't you see that?

114
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,600
So what? Should I go back?

115
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,340
I never backtrack.

116
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,730
I said I would come to see you. I kept my word.

117
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,600
But you're late.

118
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,670
My injury...

119
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,050
has been healed.

120
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,710
 What did Pianran tell me? 

121
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,570
 I should play hard to get. 

122
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,030
Since you're well, I'll go back tomorrow.

123
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,720
Unless your foot recovers, you're not allowed to go anywhere.

124
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,270
That makes no sense.

125
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,840
You didn't want me to come but won't allow me to leave now.

126
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,420
Do you think I'm such an easy person to control?

127
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,080
You…

128
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,390
Ye Xiwu, don't push your luck.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,080
You were the one who left without saying goodbye and coming to Jia Pass,

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,210
leaving me alone in the Palace of Jing

131
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,450
and making me worry about you.

132
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,570
All right, I won't do it again.

133
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,430
Okay.

134
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,740
 Pianran's method worked. 

135
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,380
 The Soul-slaying Teardrop is burning again. 

136
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,160
Then I'll go back to sleep.

137
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
Be careful.

138
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,740
 Why do I feel unsettled tonight? 

139
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,960
   

140
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,340
   

141
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,620
Ye Xiwu.

142
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,270
Ye Xiwu!

143
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,800
Young Lady, you…

144
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,430
Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Every minute of tonight is precious.

145
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,470
What are you doing in my bed?

146
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,900
Do you want me to be assassinated by Tantai Jin?

147
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,480
You go to his bed.

148
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,830
I'm not going.

149
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,430
- You told me to play hard to get. 
 -  I…

150
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,310
As we're in the army, we must always be on guard.

151
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,530
Tantai Jin is the leader of the army and should set an example for his soldiers.

152
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,350
Ye Xiwu, you…

153
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,900
I…

154
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,050
You're really something else.

155
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,090
I thought...

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,300
you would run back in tears calling for your parents.

157
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,200
I didn't expect you to stick it out.

158
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,740
Ye Xiwu, you really like Tantai Jin, don't you?

159
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,270
I…

160
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,540
Not very genuinely. I'm lacking morality.

161
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,800
I mean...

162
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,190
I'm lacking common sense.

163
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,130
Sister Fox, let's sleep.

164
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,630
Good night.

165
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,290
Your Majesty.

166
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,670
What's going on?

167
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,400
King Sheng, Xiao Yi, stole the skeleton of Queen Dowager.

168
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,630
 Quick… Hurry up. 

169
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,620
 Quick. 

170
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,070
Pianran.

171
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,000
Tantai Jin.

172
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,050
Tantai Jin

173
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,730
Ye Xiwu.

174
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,060
Why is Tantai Jin suddenly leaving the camp? What happened?

175
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,630
I have no idea. I haven't been told, either.

176
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,970
Obediently stay in your tent. Don't come out, understand?

177
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,750
How much longer?

178
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,010
Your Majesty, the spell will be done in a quarter of an hour.

179
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,120
Is your spell really as good as you say?

180
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,130
I dare not lie to you, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,480
The spell is super powerful.

182
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,460
No one can get rid of it.

183
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,200
The skeleton of Yue Ruanruan has been crushed into ashes.

184
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,000
With Tantai Jin's crazed maid as the sacrifice offering,

185
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,670
I will burn them all together when the time comes.

186
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,350
Tantai Jin will head for his doom.

187
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,740
He'll die of a sudden illness in three months.

188
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,120
Three months is too long.

189
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,200
This is already the fastest way.

190
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,770
All right. Be quick. It's thundering.

191
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,550
Yes.

192
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,100
Your Majesty, what's that?

193
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,410
Your Highness, there's a woman outside wanting to see you for something important.

194
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,620
Let her in.

195
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

196
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
Xiao Lin.

197
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,680
Second Young Miss.

198
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,900
Are you all right?

199
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,320
What do you mean?

200
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,750
Did anything unusual happen tonight?

201
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,550
Did you come to send a message?

202
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,450
I'm afraid...

203
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,570
the Sheng Kingdom will lose another battle tonight.

204
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,450
Your army is the last army of the Sheng Kingdom.

205
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,020
I heard they had followed my dad in many battles.

206
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,050
If they're killed,

207
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,170
I'm afraid the Sheng Kingdom will…

208
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,540
Did Tantai Jin make any movements tonight?

209
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,250
He left the camp an hour ago.

210
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,120
I thought he would make a night attack.

211
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,850
I've sent out all the scouts but received nothing from them.

212
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,150
The Jing Kingdom's military is quiet, too.

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,890
Why?

214
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,290
 Tantai Jin, what exactly are you trying to do? 

215
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,960
Oh no.

216
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,170
Second Young Miss, get on your horse.

217
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,690
I'll ask Pang Yizhi to escort you back.

218
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,880
We can't let Tantai Jin know you've come here.

219
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,510
Zhong Tai. Chen Xian.

220
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,500
- Ask Secret Dragon Guards to defend the capital. 
 - The Palace of Sheng.

221
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,440
It has been a long time.

222
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,840
How did you get in?

223
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,360
What's this demonic magic?

224
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,010
Xiao Yi.

225
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,340
You ordered someone to excavate the graveyard of my mother

226
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,840
and bring her skeleton to the Sheng Kingdom.

227
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,000
Tantai Jin, you want to beat me.

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,940
Do you think I didn't know you colluded with Prince Xuancheng?

229
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,000
Given your crime, how can I forgive you?

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,750
When you killed your brother to seize power, had you thought of getting punished?

231
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,510
It seems like

232
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,600
it was really you who gave the order.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,560
These magicians.

234
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,770
You asked them to cast a spell on my mom's skeleton to kill me.

235
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,870
I'm not paying you to stand around. Keep on.

236
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,710
Kill them.

237
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,250
Xiao Yi.

238
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,350
For your own prestige, you caused the deaths of innocent civilians.

239
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,750
Protection!

240
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,020
In order to kill me, you sacrificed your own people.

241
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,270
What's the difference between you and the devils?

242
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,400
I was planning on letting you live a few more days.

243
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,790
Unfortunately, you've been anxiously seeking death.

244
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,880
Shut up!

245
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,550
The Sheng Kingdom is thriving now and needs your head as a sacrifice.

246
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,760
Since you delivered yourself up, I'll dispose of you.

247
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,450
At dawn, the army of Sheng will conquer the Capital of Jing,

248
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,860
and I'll rule the world.

249
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,550
You want to kill me?

250
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,270
Arrest him.

251
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,640
What's wrong with you? Go!

252
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,330
Demonic cultivation. You learned demonic cultivation!

253
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,920
No wonder Tantai Wuji had kept you in the palace and left you for death.

254
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,780
Tantai Jin, you would have been killed by Tantai Wuji

255
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,610
if you hadn't been a hostage in the Capital of Sheng.

256
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,000
Is this how you repay your debt to me?

257
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,720
I extraordinarily regret having shown mercy to you.

258
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,470
I raised you in the palace.

259
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,680
Instead of feeling grateful to me, you're actually being aggressive to me.

260
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,300
Xiao Yi, you're mistaken.

261
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,760
There's not even a trace of affection between us.

262
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,940
In the Palace of Sheng, I had been living like livestock.

263
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,670
If there's someone I hate, the person I hate the most is you.

264
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,040
Xiao Yi, kneel.

265
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,020
Kowtow three times to my mother and apologize to her.

266
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,740
Then I'll leave your corpse whole.

267
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,340
No way!

268
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,060
Drop to your knees!

269
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,730
Dream on!

270
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,220
Stop! I'll kneel...

271
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,270
and apologize.

272
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,350
Tantai Jin, you'll die a miserable death.

273
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,600
You monster, why did you come back?

274
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,100
Why are you still alive?

275
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,890
You want me to apologize to her.

276
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,930
But it's you who should apologize.

277
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,840
Everybody knows that your mother died giving birth to you.

278
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,600
You caused her death!

279
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,460
Tantai Jin, have you forgotten it?

280
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,060
You should thank me for calling for the rain and washing up everything.

281
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,880
Mother.

282
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,920
You are left with nothing.

283
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,710
You jinx, you'll die a miserable death.

284
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,650
Go to hell! You monster!

285
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,380
 You promised my mother to take care of me. 

286
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,740
 I'll repay you with this stab. 

287
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,860
 Yingxin, you've suffered too much. 

288
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,360
 Death is a merciful release 

289
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,960
 for you. 

290
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,180
   

291
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,540
Miss.

292
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,640
Miss, where can we go?

293
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,000
You're right.

294
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,240
The Sheng Kingdom has been conquered. Where can I go?

295
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,460
Give me your valuable things, or I'll kill you.

296
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,150
We don't have anything valuable.

297
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,780
Please let us go.

298
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,440
Miss.

299
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,600
I wanted to rob you, not kill her.

300
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,000
 In this entire world, besides Ye Xiwu, 

301
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,500
 there's actually no one I care about. 

302
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,550
Your Majesty, watch out.

303
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,780
Secret Dragon Guards. You work for Xiao Lin.

304
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,270
Prince Xuancheng will be here in a second.

305
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,020
Tantai Jin, you can't escape.

306
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,210
News surely spreads fast.

307
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,730
But…

308
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,200
it's not your place to decide my fate.

309
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,270
Today, I won't kill you.

310
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,410
Xiao Yi is dead.

311
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,740
I'll definitely rule the world.

312
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,930
Your Majesty.

313
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,230
 Tantai Jin. 

314
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,700
 The most powerful person in the world is Tantai Jin. 

315
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,240
 Ye Bingchang… Why hadn't I thought of it earlier? 

316
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,680
 The safest place 

317
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,250
 is his Palace of Jing. 

318
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,240
Your Majesty, I'm Bingchang.

319
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,560
Your Majesty.

320
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,350
Back off.

321
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,860
Your Majesty, I'm Bingchang.

322
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,360
Ye Bingchang, what do you want?

323
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,000
Your Majesty, now that the Sheng Kingdom has been conquered,

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,320
the world is yours.

325
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,220
I'm a weak woman who has no one to depend on.

326
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,100
Your Majesty, I beg for your mercy. Please take me with you.

327
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,350
All right.

328
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,630
Take her away.

329
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,560
Sixth Prince, they all fainted.

330
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,720
 I'm late. 

331
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,440
 Royal Father. 

332
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,760
 Your Majesty, there's another thing. 

333
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,710
 The crow reported that Second Young Miss Ye went to 

334
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,880
 Xiao Lin's camp alone after we set off. 

335
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,480
 After that, we encountered the Secret Dragon Guards. 

336
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,530
 Second Young Miss is suspected 

337
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,440
 of treason. 

338
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,410
 Ye Xiwu… 

339
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,220
 Did you 

340
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,580
 write to me every day because you were worried about the Sheng Kingdom? 

341
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,270
 Did you hurry to the military camp 

342
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,430
 to protect Xiao Lin? 

343
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,060
 I can't believe you 

344
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,020
 betrayed me for Xiao Lin. 

345
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,450
Why is Eldest Sister here?

346
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,990
 Right. Young Devil Lord is fond of her. 

347
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,600
Did you see my medicine for metal inflicted wounds?

348
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,250
Pian Ran, what happened last night? Did you find out about it?

349
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,160
They went deep into Sheng territory to attack the city.

350
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,600
The Sheng Kingdom will fall soon.

351
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,110
By that time, Tantai Jin probably won't need me anymore

352
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,160
and will let me go.

353
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,780
Do I sound too delighted?

354
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,340
I forgot you were from the Sheng Kingdom.

355
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,160
It's okay.

356
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,400
By the way,

357
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,870
I heard Tantai Jin came back with a woman.

358
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,860
A pretty one.

359
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,940
You should be careful.

360
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,830
All men are unreliable.

361
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:17,570
You know, Ye Qingyu got himself bruised from head to foot

362
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,590
and got wet in the rain. I found it.

363
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,820
 Tantai Jin went to the Capital of Sheng. 

364
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,270
 What exactly happened last night? 

365
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,950
 Why did he become like this? 

366
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,130
Tantai Jin.

367
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,690
Were you waiting for me in the camp last night after I left?

368
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,950
Were you worried about me?

369
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,490
You left the camp abruptly last night. What happened?

370
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,960
Do you want to know what happened to me...

371
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,550
or what happened to Xiao Lin

372
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,890
or what happened to the Sheng Kingdom?

373
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,230
Yes. Tell me everything.

374
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,320
Okay.... I'll tell you.

375
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,780
Last night, I went to the Palace of Sheng

376
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,390
and killed someone.

377
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,360
Ye Xiwu, you're afraid of me.

378
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,120
I'm not afraid of you.

379
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,200
Why should I be afraid of you?

380
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,350
Look into my eyes.

381
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,490
Don't lie.

382
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
Who did you kill?

383
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,760
A lot of people, some of whom are familiar to you.

384
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,710
Let me think.

385
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,690
 King Sheng, Xiao Yi. 

386
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,520
 Go to hell! You monster! 

387
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,650
 And Yingxin. 

388
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,500
- You… 
 - I cut Xiao Yi to pieces

389
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,800
and summoned the blood crows.

390
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
The crows gnawed him clean and didn't even leave any bones.

391
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,300
I sliced Yingxin's neck and burned her to ashes.

392
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,690
By the way, I want to thank you for tipping off Xiao Lin and bringing him to the city's gate.

393
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,490
I was so close to killing him last night

394
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,140
and feeding him to the blood crows.

395
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,010
Tantai Jin.

396
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,760
I thought…

397
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,930
What did you think of me?

398
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,780
Did you think I was a righteous person?

399
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,990
Did you think I was not insidious or calculating?

400
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,280
Did you think I wouldn't kill anyone?

401
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,080
Did you think I would forgive them

402
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,870
and let them go?

403
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,800
Or did you think

404
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,770
I was not a heartless freak?

405
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,270
 Right. Devil Lord was born to be heartless. 

406
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,530
 I actually thought he would mend his way 

407
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,880
 and become a beloved and wise ruler. 

408
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,300
It's true.

409
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,700
You've always been you.

410
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,480
You've always been that Tantai Jin.

411
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,260
So do you regret it?

412
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,970
You regret staying with me.

413
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,170
You regret saying you liked me.

414
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,760
Yes. I was blind.

415
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,890
How could I believe one's innate nature can be changed?

416
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,190
Nature? What nature?

417
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,120
I was being so stupid

418
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,690
for wanting to be with you,

419
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,930
cook for you every day, and serve you.

420
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,920
Yet you went out in the middle of the night to kill someone!

421
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,440
I would rather...

422
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,020
feed a dog than you!

423
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,070
Well said.

424
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,230
That's well said!

425
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,750
I've told you.

426
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,030
I was born to be heartless.

427
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,960
Now I get it.

428
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,510
 Tantai Jin. 

429
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,540
Whoever is around me,

430
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,760
whoever serves me,

431
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,200
and whether they are you or others, or there's no one,

432
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,710
it makes no difference to me.

433
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,380
Do you think I'm willing to serve you?

434
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,000
Then you get out of here!

435
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,640
Ye Xiwu, don't be too arrogant.

436
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,560
Watch your tongue.

437
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,540
Don't think I will spare your life only.

438
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,230
Your Majesty.

439
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,730
Please don't move, Your Majesty.

440
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,260
You're seriously injured.

441
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,650
Yingxin almost stabbed your heart.

442
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,050
Take the medicine.

443
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,330
We'll get an imperial physician after arriving in the capital.

444
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,910
Keep it a secret.

445
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,230
The imperial physician can't cure the injury.

446
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Her sword had a spell cast on it.

447
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,360
What can we do?

448
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,280
It'll be scabbed after eight to ten days.

449
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,020
Put down the medicine and leave.

450
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,570
Yes.

451
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,270
Is he here?

452
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,760
Yes… Do you want to go inside?

453
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,610
Who said I would go inside?

454
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,260
The ointment is very effective for external injuries.

455
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,780
- Yes… 
 - Don't tell him I brought it.

456
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,890
Why can't I tell him you brought it?

457
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,860
Just do as you're told. Don't be so curious.

458
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,410
If General Ye asks me about it,

459
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,170
I…

460
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,520
You tell him you found it on the ground or got it out of water or it dropped from the clouds.

461
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,500
Why?

462
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,480
You're just as obtuse as your general.

463
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,130
 Who's outside? 

464
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,060
Who is it?

465
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,640
Don't misunderstand. General Ye's eldest sister came to visit on His Majesty's order.

466
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,400
Why does she have to see her brother by order?

467
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,700
General Ye.

468
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,440
 It's her. 

469
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,530
General Ye, Chief Pian brought you an ointment.

470
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,280
Thanks. Keep it.

471
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,720
Yes.

472
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,970
Pianran, this is my eldest sister. Her name is Bingchang.

473
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,790
Eldest Sister, this is Pianran. She's my…

474
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,440
My comrade.

475
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,300
Are you dumb?

476
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,880
Eldest Sister, thank you for visiting me.

477
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,310
You must be tired after the trip. Get some good rest.

478
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,980
Your Highness, the troops of Jing outflanked us last night. We got caught up.

479
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,570
After the capital was conquered, we had to escape here with civilians.

480
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,600
Did you count our troops?

481
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,950
Yes. Casualties account for nearly one-half.

482
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,480
The wounded have been captured. Luckily half of our army is still remains.

483
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,120
They're our last soldiers.

484
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,230
The scout reported the captured soldiers had been disbanded.

485
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,800
Side Consort Ye is safe, too.

486
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,640
Tantai Jin brought her to his camp and accommodated her.

487
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,710
She is a woman.

488
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,110
I guess she was forced into going with him.

489
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,490
You don't need to comfort me.

490
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,380
I'm glad Bingchang wasn't blindsided. This war has nothing to do with them.

491
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,810
No matter whom she took refuge, she's lucky to have survived.

492
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,410
Her family is in Jing Kingdom.

493
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,190
She can reunite with her family there.

494
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,580
Let's forget about these annoying matters.

495
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,410
His Majesty has died.

496
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,660
What's your plan?

497
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,800
That's right, Your Highness. The Sheng Kingdom is at stake.

498
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,280
We can't do without a mainstay.

499
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,830
That's right.

500
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,170
The Sheng Kingdom doesn't need a king anymore.

501
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,180
Where are the civilians who escaped with the army?

502
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,340
 Your Highness. 

503
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,330
I have failed to defend the capital. I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

504
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,480
Your Highness, don't feel guilty.

505
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,120
Every country has a destiny. It's not your fault.

506
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,440
 Yes, Your Highness. 

507
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,700
Your Highness, we have news.

508
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,860
Speak.

509
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,130
We got a secret report that King Sheng has failed.

510
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,780
He failed the formation and infuriated Tantai Jin.

511
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,870
He was killed in his palace last night and burned to ashes.

512
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,810
He's dead, which is none of my business.

513
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,120
Yes.

514
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,280
I gave demon soldiers to that idiot Xiao Yi

515
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,770
because I needed him to cover for my formation on the southern border

516
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,370
and needed him to start the war to pin down Tantai Jin for a while.

517
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,460
It's okay that he's dead.

518
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,700
The two countries are against each other.

519
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,540
No matter who's defeated, it's not a bad thing.

520
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,490
Now that the formation is almost done,

521
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,910
the entire southern border will soon become a poison fortress and no life will survive.

522
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:56,030
Although Tantai Jin can understand the animal language, there won't be any messengers.

523
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,220
It's brilliant, Your Highness.

524
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:08,440
Let's go to see our inventions.

525
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,790
Yes.

526
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,620
 Have a taste. It took a long time to make. 

527
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,810
Please make an exception for me.

528
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,290
I want to thank His Majesty in person.

529
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,810
 You can't. 

530
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,240
I left Sheng in a hurry and didn't have much money with me.

531
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,430
You have worked hard, buy yourself something.

532
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,310
No.

533
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,980
Nian Baiyu, let her in.

534
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,200
Yes.

535
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,470
Your Majesty.

536
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,480
Are you feeling unwell, Your Majesty?

537
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,810
I came to thank you in person.

538
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,230
I'm much obliged to you for rescuing me from disaster.

539
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,540
I really don't know how to show my gratitude.

540
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,270
Your Majesty, since you're in a bad mood, I won't disturb you.

541
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,400
If you want to repay me,

542
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,820
stay with me,

543
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:48,500
accompany me day and night,

544
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,710
and never leave me.

545
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

546
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,610
 I didn't expect this to go so smoothly. 

547
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,520
Now go and make white fungus soup.

548
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,700
From today on,

549
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,670
you...

550
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,150
make me a meal once a day.

551
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,380
I'll go right away, Your Majesty.

552
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,840
 Tantai Jin still has feelings for me. 

553
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,600
 Ye Bingchang, you can make any man love you if you want to, 

554
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,110
 including a monster like Tantai Jin. 

555
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,610
 I'll try to please him 

556
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,480
 to gain his trust and become his concubine. Then I'll plan for my future. 

557
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,810
 But I mustn't let the secret of the love threads be discovered. 

558
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,630
 Only one spike is left. 

559
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,410
 Luckily, not all of them have dissipated. 

560
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,660
 No, Li Susu. 

561
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,600
 You're here not to have a quarrel with Tantai Jin. 

562
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:07,580
   

563
