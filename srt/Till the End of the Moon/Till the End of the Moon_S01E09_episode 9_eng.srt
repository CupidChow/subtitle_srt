00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,340
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:39,100
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,180
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,900
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,100
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,080
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,520
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,000
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,230
♫  My existence  ♫

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,060
   

16
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,250
 Father. Senior Brother. I'm so useless. 

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,900
 I couldn't save the Four Continents and Three Realms. And I didn't stop Devil Lord from resurging. 

18
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,940
 This is… 

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,120
 The ancient divine artifact, World-Alluring Jade? 

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,270
 Martial Uncle once told me, it's an ominous object lost tens of thousands of years ago. 

21
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,630
 It was forged by a female devil with tens of thousands of immortal bones. 

22
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,890
 Why is it at the bottom of the Mo River? 

23
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,310
 And why would it save me? 

24
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,440
 Forget it. I'll just keep it and get out of here first. 

25
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,680
 Congratulations, Your Highness! 

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,380
This time we wiped out Tantai Jin because of Your Highness's leadership.

27
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,770
I'm willing to die for Your Highness without hesitation!

28
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,280
What's your name?

29
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Qi Shuang. I used to be the deputy leader of the Moonshadow Guard.

30
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,200
The demon core Tantai Jin consumed was arranged by me.

31
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,440
Qi Shuang. I will remember this name.

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,930
And you just said you're really willing to…

33
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,010
I'm willing to die for Your Highness without hesitation!

34
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,580
Good.

35
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,070
Your Highness, what are you…

36
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,950
Someone, take him away.

37
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,510
Feed him to my pets.

38
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,970
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,580
No, Your Highness!

40
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,080
Your Highness! At least I worked hard for you, Your Highness!

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,050
- I won't raise a dog that bites its master. 
  - Your Highness! 

42
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,730
Wise decision, Your Highness!

43
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,000
Those freshly caught demon creatures are starving right now.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
By the way, you must raise them properly.

45
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Someday they'll be of great use.

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
I shall do my best.

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
If Tantai Jin can manipulate demon power,

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,820
I should be able to, as well.

49
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,190
- Wise decision, Your Highness! 
 - Wise decision, Your Highness!

50
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,840
Leader, I heard this Tantai Minglang enjoys torturing people.

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,830
Just now, Qi Shuang was dragged out.

52
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,040
He's probably been executed.

53
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,130
His Highness needs some Yiyue girls.

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,580
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

55
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,800
All of you, raise your heads!

56
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,580
It's your blessing to be selected by His Highness.

57
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,710
This one and that one. Take them.

58
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,560
Get up!

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,690
- Get up! 
 - Come on. Faster.

60
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,970
Move!

61
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,630
Move! Come on!

62
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,860
Faster!

63
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,930
Go!

64
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,410
Come on!

65
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,050
Sister.

66
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,620
Baiyu.

67
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,970
You two, go save the other girls.

68
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,960
You go find our weapons.

69
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Go.

70
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,840
Let's go.

71
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,700
We've been running for a night.

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,680
Everyone, get some rest.

73
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,440
 Go. 

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Leader, the high priestess betrayed us and His Highness is missing.

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,100
What should we do?

76
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,550
I have sworn to serve His Highness with my life. I will not go back on my word.

77
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm going to find him.

78
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,380
We'll follow you. We'll go wherever you go.

79
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,320
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

80
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,940
My good brothers!

81
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,700
Sister, you take them back to Yiyue tribe first.

82
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Leave the rest to the Moonshadow Guard.

83
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,130
I guess there's no other way.

84
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,570
Baiyu, you must stay safe.

85
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,190
- Moonshadow Guard, listen! 
 - Yes!

86
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,420
You four escort the girls back to the Yiyue tribe.

87
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,470
The rest of you, come with me to find His Highness!

88
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,070
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

89
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,650
I'm freezing.

90
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,800
Tantai Jin, just wait.

91
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,450
 But where should I go next? 

92
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,660
 Back to the Sheng Kingdom? 

93
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
 No. 

94
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,380
 Tantai Jin has clearly gone astray. 

95
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,840
 I have to stop him from becoming a devil. 

96
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,190
 If he goes to the Jing Kingdom, I must follow him there to watch him. 

97
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,200
 Dear Grandmother and Father, wish you are well. 

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,510
 I am safe. 

99
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,500
 I have been doing well. 

100
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,370
 I have enough food and money. 

101
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,100
 Grandmother, don't worry about me. 

102
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,380
 Jing Kingdom is a beautiful place. 

103
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,800
 When I finish sightseeing, I'll go back home. 

104
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,940
 From Xiwu. 

105
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,370
Hi, mister. How long does it take to transport goods to the capital of Sheng?

106
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,840
Less than three days. Rest assured. I'll deliver it personally to your mansion.

107
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,870
Thank you.

108
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,350
My father will reward you when he gets it.

109
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,900
Little girl, why are you hanging around all alone?

110
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,030
Why don't you go home?

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,810
There's something important that I must do.

112
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,420
 Another hundred miles along the river, and then I'll be in the Jing Kingdom. 

113
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,140
 The evil bone is still in Tantai Jin's body. 

114
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,800
 If he degenerates into a devil or dies accidentally, everything will be in vain. 

115
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,670
 Someone's there. 

116
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,550
Hello.

117
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,390
Are you all right?

118
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
Tantai Jin?

119
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,030
Stop playing dead. Don't try and play this trick.

120
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,790
No matter how pitiful you look, I won't fall for it!

121
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,450
Tantai Jin?

122
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,760
Tantai Jin?

123
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,870
He's so cold. Tantai Jin!

124
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,250
Tantai Jin, wake up!

125
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,920
Tantai Jin!

126
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Tantai Jin, wake up!

127
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,650
You can't die.

128
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,760
Tantai Jin, you mustn't die!

129
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,100
Tantai Jin!

130
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,570
Tantai Jin!

131
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,060
Tantai Jin!

132
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,840
Wake up, Tantai Jin!

133
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,430
Tantai Jin!

134
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,830
Karma comes so quickly.

135
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,170
You were alive and kicking when you tried to capture me.

136
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,220
Only a few hours later, you're in my hands half-dead.

137
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,520
What are you looking at?

138
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,840
If not for the sake of my father and my family, I would just slap you to death and bury you right here.

139
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,420
You'd better move as little as possible.

140
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,050
When pressing water out of you,

141
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,380
I accidentally broke a few of your ribs.

142
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,960
How come it's you?

143
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,250
Why did you save me?

144
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,500
None of your business.

145
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,690
Tantai Jin, I'm telling you. Now you're in my hands.

146
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,890
I can save you and I can also kill you.

147
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,790
If you let yourself die without my permission, I'll tear you to pieces and throw you into the wilderness.

148
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,450
 As expected, I can't see. 

149
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,440
All right, now it's my turn.

150
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,420
Whether you like it or not, you must answer my questions honestly.

151
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,220
What questions?

152
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,040
We've only been apart for a few hours.

153
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,620
What exactly happened on the ship?

154
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,910
Why have you washed ashore and lost one eye?

155
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,880
Are you going to answer or not?

156
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,210
I was ambushed by Tantai Minglang.

157
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,170
Tantai Minglang?

158
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,100
Your elder brother from the Jing Kingdom?

159
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
Why would he do that?

160
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,790
You should ask him about it.

161
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
Fine, next question.

162
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,620
did only you escape from there?

163
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,200
Where's Jing Lan'an? Isn't she with you?

164
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,620
She's dead.

165
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,760
Tantai Minglang killed her?

166
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,650
I killed her.

167
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,340
Tantai Jin, this punch is for those who died because of you.

168
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,850
This is both for Jing Lan'an and me.

169
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,190
I tried to treat you sincerely, save and protect you, but now I really regret it.

170
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,950
Jing Lan'an saved your life. She brought you up.

171
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,450
You drank her blood and were taught by her. But you killed her!

172
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,190
 Auntie, 

173
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,310
 let me ask you. Do you regret betraying me? 

174
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,030
 My child, 

175
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,510
 I don't regret it. 

176
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,290
Yes, I killed her.

177
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,030
You've gone insane.

178
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,570
You're right.

179
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,750
She brought me up. She gave me life.

180
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,900
On that New Year's Eve, when she came for me,

181
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,140
I really wished...

182
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,350
she didn't abandon me.

183
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,950
What?

184
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,490
Of all the things she did, she shouldn't have returned after leaving.

185
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,830
She gave me hope but then discarded me like trash.

186
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,100
What did Jing Lan'an do?

187
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,870
Nothing.

188
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,140
It's just betrayal.

189
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,260
She and Yingxin did the same.

190
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,030
She betrayed me.

191
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,940
 Turns out she let me go in order to kill Tantai Jin. 

192
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,410
 Did she collude with Tantai Minglang? 

193
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,740
Tantai Jin, I'm going to escort you back to the Sheng Kingdom.

194
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,600
And then put you in prison to keep you from the outside world.

195
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,350
I'll be watching you every second of every day.

196
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,610
As long as I'm alive, don't ever think of devouring demon cores or killing people.

197
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,720
What are you laughing at?

198
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,180
Ye Xiwu, your stupid words were both strange and funny.

199
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,670
Why don't you just kill me?

200
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,820
Why do you try to be bound with me forever?

201
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,800
Your life and death are not up to you now.

202
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,000
What are you doing?

203
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,130
Roasting fish.

204
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,270
Found it!

205
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,200
There's blood!

206
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,140
Tantai Jin really survived.

207
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,690
He's such a pain in my neck, just like that female demon.

208
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:06,210
Your Highness, although Tantai Jin isn't dead, he's already a spent force.

209
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,460
Please let me tie up this loose end.

210
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,830
Your Highness may return to the capital and wait for my good news.

211
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,110
No. I must see Tantai Jin dead with my own eyes.

212
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,000
Search further away.

213
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,080
Even if we have to dig three feet deep, we must find Tantai Jin!

214
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,080
Your Highness, we'll be entering the Jing territory ahead.

215
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,420
Is there still no news about Tantai Jin?

216
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,980
Your Highness, we have a visual on the Jing soldiers.

217
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,630
Are you sure?

218
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,640
From both their clothes and weapons, they're absolutely soldiers from the Jing Kingdom.

219
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,450
But we're not sure why they are here in large numbers.

220
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,390
Lead the way.

221
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,840
Yes, Sir.

222
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,680
I didn't expect you to be a little helpful.

223
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,840
You have so many schemes, but you're a good cook.

224
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,450
I've been doing this since I was little.

225
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,640
Didn't you grow up in the palace?

226
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,150
You roasted fish in the palace?

227
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,850
Red fish from the Taiye Pond.

228
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,150
Sparrows from the imperial woods.

229
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,580
Rats from the imperial gutters.

230
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,640
All these can be my food.

231
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,440
You just need a few grains of rice.

232
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,550
They'll bite the hook and get themselves killed.

233
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,120
 This is Tantai Jin. Both pitiable and detestable. 

234
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,780
 Fate has been cruel to him. 

235
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,050
 He also fought back with cruelty. 

236
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,040
 Li Susu, you have to see clearly. 

237
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,280
 This is the Devil Lord. 

238
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,840
Eat.

239
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,410
You eat it. When you finish, we'll hit the road.

240
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,030
We don't have time for you to heal.

241
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,340
It's not poisonous.

242
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,150
I know that. Otherwise, why would I let you eat it?

243
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,030
Ye Xiwu, why are you so persistent in not letting me die?

244
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,270
Don't worry.

245
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,580
One day I will tell you.

246
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,630
You'd better pray that day comes later.

247
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,870
 When I destroy the evil bone and kill you, I will tell you. 

248
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,910
What's wrong?

249
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,040
 Without the antidote, it won't be long till the poison kicks in and kills me. 

250
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,950
Nothing.

251
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,290
Tantai Jin.

252
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,080
We have company.

253
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,490
Hurry!

254
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,920
They haven't gone far. Split up and chase!

255
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,580
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

256
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,410
 They can't run far. 

257
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,840
 Search carefully! 

258
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,220
 Anyone who captures Tantai Jin will be rewarded! 

259
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,730
 - Yes! 
 - Yes! 

260
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,430
They are Tantai Minglang's men.

261
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,660
Just hand me over to them.

262
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,250
You can both live and get rewards.

263
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,200
Shut up.

264
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,210
Go in the opposite direction. Don't get caught.

265
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,770
Ye Xiwu.

266
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,310
Over there! After them!

267
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,860
After them!

268
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,660
Come on!

269
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,050
 Tantai Jin, I really must have owed you in my last life. 

270
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,260
 I'm surrounded. 

271
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,470
 No. 

272
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,910
 I haven't found the way to destroy the evil bone yet. 

273
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,040
 I can't die here. 

274
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,370
- Split up. 
 - Yes.

275
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,000
Damn. How come it's a woman?

276
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,780
You must have seen Tantai Jin.

277
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,290
Where is he? Say it!

278
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,690
Oh, that dead man is named Tantai Jin?

279
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,630
He's dead.

280
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,190
Dead?

281
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,180
Then, why were you running?

282
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,620
I stole something from him.

283
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,190
I thought you were here to catch me.

284
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,760
For a damn woman like you, I chased half a day for nothing!

285
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,550
Go die!

286
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,020
This way! After her!

287
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,860
Don't let her get away!

288
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,240
Be quiet.

289
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,250
All of you split up and go search.

290
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,070
 - Yes! 
 - Yes! 

291
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,880
Didn't I tell you to run in the opposite direction? Are you looking to get killed?

292
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,140
I'm worried that if you get caught, you'll sell me out.

293
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,760
Now, it's perfect. Neither of us can get away now.

294
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,050
What's that noise?

295
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,800
Go now!

296
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,690
If you tell me honestly why you came here, I'll spare your lives.

297
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,530
We're here...

298
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,380
to hunt down Tantai Jin.

299
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,740
By whose order? Is it Tantai Minglang? Where is he?

300
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,240
His…

301
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,480
They're all dead.

302
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,310
Your Highness, since they're here for Tantai Jin, he should be around here.

303
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,840
- Please give orders to Secret Dragon Guards to… 
 - Go back.

304
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,820
Your Highness, Tantai Jin is…

305
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,530
Get on the horse.

306
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,740
Take these bodies back to the city.

307
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,160
No one saw Tantai Jin today. Understand?

308
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,860
- Understand! 
 - Understand!

309
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,820
 Tantai Jin, this is as far as I can help you. 

310
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,780
This place is concealed enough.

311
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,150
Let's spend the night here.

312
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,920
Why didn't you leave just now?

313
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,240
Why did you distract the soldiers and save me?

314
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,440
That's just because…

315
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,630
Better to talk about it when we're safe.

316
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,820
No soldiers are chasing us for now.

317
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,320
Give me back my charms.

318
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,020
If we run into them again, at least I have something to defend us.

319
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,870
You drew so many Sketch Charms?

320
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,150
You only taught me this type.

321
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,750
These are useless for the current situation.

322
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,610
And they were soaked in water for too long.

323
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,860
There's no magic on them.

324
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,190
Meeting you is the unluckiest thing.

325
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,040
Tantai Jin, why is your blood black?

326
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,820
What exactly happened to you?

327
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,080
 Once the poison in your left eye spreads throughout your meridians, 

328
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,110
 you'll spit blood three times and die. 

329
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,930
What's going on? Just tell me!

330
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,730
I was poisoned by Tantai Minglang.

331
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,940
Maybe in a bit, it will kick in and I'll be dead.

332
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,350
You scoundrel! Why didn't you tell me earlier?

333
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,530
Would it help if I did?

334
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,180
Are you a doctor? Do you have the antidote?

335
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,650
There must be a way to save you.

336
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,590
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

337
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
Ye Xiwu!

338
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,070
Ye Xiwu! Where are you going?

339
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,570
 Report! 

340
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,490
The men we sent out to search haven't found Tantai Jin yet.

341
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,550
Useless!

342
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,480
Your Highness, urgent news from the capital.

343
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,960
Something happened in the palace. They need you to handle it, Your Highness.

344
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,830
Please return to the capital first. I'll take care of this.

345
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,330
Fine. I've been out for too long this time.

346
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,710
My third brother, when I find you,

347
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,990
I'll crush the bones of you and Yue Ruanruan into powder.

348
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,540
I'll make you disappear for good.

349
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,950
Let's go.

350
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,950
Tantai Jin, you can't hide much longer.

351
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,970
You must be eliminated.

352
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,550
You're awake.

353
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,450
You're back.

354
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,170
Of course. Did you think I'd leave you alone here?

355
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,860
You're badly injured and slept for hours.

356
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,190
I gave you some simple treatment.

357
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,660
Have some fruit first.

358
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,510
You're in luck. I picked up some herbs and came back. They can stop the poison from spreading.

359
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,660
I'll apply them to you in a second.

360
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,770
You should not try to run around out there. You have so many injuries and almost died.

361
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,070
You really scared me. I must owe you in my previous life.

362
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,230
Ye Xiwu, you don't need to try so hard to save me.

363
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,350
You have to live on.

364
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,010
Are you injured somewhere else, too?

365
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,340
Come on.

366
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,210
What are you doing?

367
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,770
You still mind this when you're dying?

368
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:02,080
What's more, we're already married. There's nothing to be shy about.

369
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,690
Ye Xiwu, you said it on the ship.

370
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,870
From now on, we will have nothing to do with each other.

371
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,980
When we get out of here, I will settle scores with you properly.

372
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,140
But now your life is in my hands.

373
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,530
I will decide whether you live or not.

374
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,090
Understand, Tantai Jin?

375
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,010
Okay.

376
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,860
What is this?

377
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,140
Give it back!

378
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,730
It looks like some kind of treasure.

379
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,720
Why haven't I seen it before?

380
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,420
I found it on the road.

381
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,540
I don't know what it is, either. It's probably worthless.

382
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,240
Give it back to me.

383
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,340
Since you found it, technically, it's not yours.

384
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,660
Since it's in my hand, it's mine now.

385
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,380
No! You can't hold it.

386
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,720
Ye Xiwu, be honest with me.

387
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,860
What exactly is this?

388
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,380
It's a lost divine artifact from ancient times.

389
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,650
It's called World-Alluring Jade.

390
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,240
World-Alluring Jade?

391
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,450
You'd better not have any funny ideas about it!

392
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,790
This jade was forged by a female devil ten thousand years ago.

393
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:06,070
 She killed tens of thousands of immortals, and withdrew their immortal bones. 

394
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,480
 Making this jade was an evil deed. 

395
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,260
That's why its users were doomed to end badly.

396
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,710
They'll be short-lived and die violently.

397
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:20,090
Bad endings… Violent death?

398
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Guess you are thinking if you devour it, it'll be more useful than devouring demon cores?

399
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,760
You'd better give up this idea, or you'll die a horrible death.

400
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,460
I'm already deeply poisoned.

401
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,740
The poison might kick in any second.

402
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,860
I can't even keep my life now.

403
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,320
Why would I be afraid of death?

404
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,300
Why would I be afraid of some curse?

405
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,120
There's no difference for me...

406
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,300
whether to die now or later.

407
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,610
I won't let you die here.

408
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,780
Time to apply your medicine.

409
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,810
Don't move. Okay? Otherwise, I might break some more ribs.

410
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,400
Done. Time to sleep.

411
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,740
I'll take you back to the Sheng Kingdom tomorrow morning.

412
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,050
There must be a way to save you.

♫   Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain   ♫

418
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,630
 You saved me because of love? 

419
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,090
 What is love exactly? 

420
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,530
 Love is you don't want him to die. 

421
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,420
 You want to stay with him. 

422
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,090
 You'll be worried if you don't see him. 

423
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,980
 You'll be happy if you do.

431
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,990
Almost there. When we go through the woods ahead, we'll find somewhere to rest.

432
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,880
Tantai Jin, you indeed have not died.

433
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,070
Seems like you also made up with Second Young Miss Ye.

434
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,640
- Who's this? 
 - Tantai Minglang's subordinate.

435
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,060
She's able to use demonic hexes. Be careful.

436
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,950
 Tantai Jin is too weak to take any risk. 

437
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,690
 If he dies, everything will be in vain. 

438
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,420
Tantai Jin, her target is you.

439
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,690
Find a good chance to run first. I'll think of a way to stall her.

440
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,490
What? Are you so deeply poisoned that you don't have energy to fight back?

441
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:39,600
Seeing me means you two lovebirds' tragic ending has come.

442
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,130
What are you going to fight her with?

443
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,880
Just leave it to me.

444
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,460
Shatter!

445
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,840
Tantai Jin!

446
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,280
Are you okay?

447
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:44,910
Tantai Jin, you can even kill Jing Lan'an who brought you up, but care so much about this woman?

448
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,490
You're dying anyway.

449
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,220
I'll catch you back alive for His Highness to vent his hatred.

450
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
Ye Xiwu.

451
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,410
Ye Xiwu! Ye Xiwu!

452
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Ye Xiwu!

453
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,600
She was hit by my Heart-Gnawing Curse. She'll be dead in no time.

454
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,520
Undo this curse right now! Or I'm gonna crush your bones into scattered dust!

455
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,460
You can barely keep standing.

456
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,110
You are barely surviving. How can you afford to save her?

457
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,770
You might as well just surrender.

458
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,650
 Ye Xiwu, we have a lot of unfinished scores to settle. 

459
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,290
 I can't just let you die here. 

460
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,510
The World-Alluring Jade.

461
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,510
 This jade was forged by a female devil ten thousand years ago. 

462
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,370
 Its users were doomed to end badly. 

463
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,220
 They'll be short-lived and die violently. 

464
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:28,020
 As long as I can live now, why should I fear death afterward? 

465
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,830
You demon.

466
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,260
I'll eliminate you for His Highness to spare all trouble later!

467
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,600
Tantai Minglang can't kill me.

468
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,600
One day, I'll go to him!

469
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,850
Ye Xiwu!

470
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,250
 What happened to me? 

471
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,180
 Did Tantai Jin save me? 

472
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,540
Tantai Jin!

473
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,600
This glow?

474
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,290
It's the World-Alluring Jade!

475
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,080
You scoundrel! You devoured the World-Alluring Jade!

476
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,160
You'll die violently! Don't you know?

477
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:11,880
 Chongyu Harp, help me. I must take the jade out. 

478
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,670
Come out!

479
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,080
 Do you want to save this man... 

480
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,650
 who tried to possess the World-Alluring Jade? 

481
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,500
 Who are you? 

482
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,190
 You're the female devil who forged this jade? 

483
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,460
 Do you want to save this man? 

484
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,300
 I have to save him. He can't die! 

485
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,090
 But the World-Alluring Jade has chosen him. 

486
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,340
 Misfortune will fall upon him very soon. 

487
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,750
 He will have a violent death in a foreign land. 

488
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,110
 No! 

489
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,180
 I'll help him get the jade out. Whatever method I must use! 

490
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,020
 Well, there is one. 

491
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,610
 But is this man worth it? 

492
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,620
 Take a good look at what kind of person he is. 

493
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,880
 You are a monster. 

494
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,910
 You will bring disaster to anyone close to you. 

495
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,440
 Look! This kind of person… 

496
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,910
 You were born unworthy of the most common human emotions. 

497
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,950
 He isn't worth your sacrifice. 

498
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:07,430
 If someone had to die, I'm sure anyone would choose you. 

499
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,860
That's not true!

500
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:34,430
 He can't die. If there must be someone to carry his curse, let it be me! 

501
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:43,440
 But before the curse lands upon me, there's one task I must complete. 

502
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,470
 Do you know how to destroy the evil bone? 

503
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,820
 I know what you are after. 

504
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,230
 Maybe you can find the answer in Barren Abyss. 

505
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:03,090
 But now the power of the World-Alluring Jade has condensed into his eye. 

506
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:09,390
 If you want to take it back, you have to trade it with one of your eyes. 

507
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,540
 Fine. 

508
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,580
 I'll do it. 

509
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,240
 How ridiculous. 

510
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,800
 In this world, someone's actually willing to die for others. 

511
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,980
Tantai Jin,

512
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,840
you won't die.

513
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,010
Only if you're alive,

514
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,460
more people will be able to live.

515
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,880
You two, go check over there!

516
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,010
 It's Nian Baiyu. 

517
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,530
Your Highness!

518
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,040
Your Highness!

519
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,010
He's still breathing.

520
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,900
 They're indeed theMoonshadow Guard. It seems like they won't hurt him. 

521
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,330
Someone! Take His Highness to the camp for treatment!

522
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,940
Yes, Sir!

523
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,980
 I couldn't go to Barren Abyss with Tantai Jin heavily injured. 

524
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,490
 I can only leave Young Devil Lord to you. 

525
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,330
 Tantai Jin, when I find the way to destroy the evil bone, I'll be back for you. 

526
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,980
   

527
