3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,439
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,379
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,619
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,980
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:47,150
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:54,720
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,119
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

10
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,159
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,579
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

12
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:19,019
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

13
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,240
♫  My existence  ♫

♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

15

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,379
   

17
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:45,680
 Princess Yue Ruanruan, known for her gentleness and virtues, is hereby granted the title of Consort Rou. 

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,830
 She will be welcomed and greeted with a grand wedding ceremony. 

19
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,430
 A nationwide celebration. 

20
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,730
 May Your Majesty and Her Highness love each other forever, and may your descendants thrive on and on! 

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:14,860
♫  Throughout my life looking into the distance in the hopes of meeting you  ♫

22
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,459
♫  I became the light traveling in darkness  ♫

23
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,159
♫  One teardrop, one inch of ash, one thought repeatedly  ♫

24
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:37,339
♫  Life is short yet a dream is long  ♫

25
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,459
Congrats, Your Majesty! Consort Rou is pregnant!

26
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,090
Auntie.

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,680
 Can you sew? 

28
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,430
 Of course. 

29
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,340
 These are our child's clothes. 

30
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,210
 I must sew them with my own hands. 

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,760
 You were born with high hopes. 

32
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,590
 They loved each other so much. 

33
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,699
 How could King Jing agree to let him be a hostage prince in Sheng Kingdom? 

34
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,489
 Your Majesty, Consort Rou has been in difficult labor for three days. 

35
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,999
 The imperial doctor has tried all methods. 

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,909
 I'm afraid you can only save one of them. 

37
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,629
 Your Majesty, please decide soon. 

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,679
 What's there to decide? Of course, you should save Consort Rou. 

39
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,039
 I just want her to live. Everything else doesn't matter. Go now! 

40
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,399
 - Yes.  
 - Princess. Princess, hang in there.

41
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,399
 His Majesty's order: keep Consort Rou alive is the top priority. 

42
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,030
Princess.

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,360
 Lan'an, you must save this child. 

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,530
 Don't let him die because of me. 

45
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,780
 He will be a kind-hearted child. 

46
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,800
 Please. 

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,850
Monster!

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,749
Princess!

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,839
- Someone! 
 - Princess!

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,940
Someone, please help!

51
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,309
 He shouldn't have been born into this world. 

52
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,720
 He's responsible for Consort Rou's death. 

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,330
 He killed the woman I loved the most. 

54
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,490
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:24,690
Your Majesty, the little prince hasn't had any milk since he was born.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,879
If you banish him to a deserted palace, he won't be able to survive. Your Majesty!

57
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,109
Please have mercy! Please have mercy!

58
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,499
He's not my son!

59
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,160
He's a monster!

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,830
Your Majesty!

61
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,370
The little prince is Her Highness' only bloodline.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,629
Your Majesty!

63
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,560
If the little prince dies, Her Highness will really be gone for good, Your Majesty!

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,200
Please have mercy!

65
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,030
If you insist on protecting him, you shall be his guardian.

66
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,450
You shall fend for yourselves in the palace.

67
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,090
Thanks, Your Majesty!

68
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,569
- Thanks, Your Majesty!  
 - Thanks, Your Majesty!

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,290
Let's go quickly!

70
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,699
Your Majesty, these are all lucky names provided by the Ministry of Rites for the little prince.

71
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,070
Please decide which one it shall be.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
I understand.

73
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,890
 The names of all children bear the expectations of parents.  
    (Jin means ashes.) 

74
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,010
 But Tantai Jin's name was a curse. 

75
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,800
 Why is someone awake? 

76
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,330
Watch out!

77
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,590
Tantai Jin? Tantai Jin?

78
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,630
I only left for a short while, and you two broke free.

79
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
You're quite something.

80
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,060
I was wondering why you didn't have nightmares.

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Turns out you don't have any love threads.

82
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,120
What don't I have?

83
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,209
You were born without love threads.

84
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,300
That's why you can't feel emotions.

85
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,189
You won't feel happy or sad.

86
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,800
You won't feel scared, either.

87
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,189
How can a loveless one have nightmares?

88
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,030
What a waste of all your miserable memories.

89
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,920
However, I finally found your weakness just now.

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,039
Something you do care about in this world.

91
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,679
Even if it's only a little.

92
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,460
But that will suffice.

93
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,410
Enjoy your nightmares!

94
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,270
Where is this place?

95
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,050
How can a baby live here?

96
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,430
He will be frozen to death!

97
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,929
Go find him now.

98
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,480
Find him now!

99
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,150
 It seems that Tantai Jin and I entered different timelines. 

100
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,239
 No. 

101
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,500
 I must find Young Devil Lord soon. 

102
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,479
The divine mirror shines, see through all illusions.

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,030
Shatter!

104
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,629
 Without Chongyu Harp, 

105
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,940
 my power isn't enough to break the barrier. 

106
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,379
 Only after Yingxin's memories end, I can get out. 

107
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,500
- Your Highness. 
 -  I hope Young Devil Lord is fine. 

108
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,020
Your Highness!

109
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Your Highness!

110
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,340
Your Highness! No!

111
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,250
What should we do, Sister Lan'an? He's not breathing.

112
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,120
Don't speak nonsense!

113
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,550
Your Highness! Your Highness!

114
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,100
Why would he wake up after sucking blood?

115
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,420
He's a monster!

116
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,079
Why was he born with teeth?

117
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,430
Don't say anything like this again.

118
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,080
We can't let others know this.

119
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,120
 As expected from Young Devil Lord. 

120
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,800
 But the war of God and Devil happened ten thousand years ago, 

121
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,390
 why would he be born at this very time and place? 

122
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,670
Here it is.

123
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,049
Your Highness, don't cry.

124
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,049
- Don't cry. Here comes the yummy food. 
 - Don't cry.

125
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,490
Come on.

126
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,320
- Don't cry. 
 -  Although he led a hard life, at least some tried their best to take care of him. 

127
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,720
 But how long could they keep living like this? 

128
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,690
Here you are.

129
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,379
It's edible.

130
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,930
See?

131
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,280
Stop crying.

132
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,060
It is fine.

133
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,420
Don't cry.

134
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,569
Kneel!

135
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:03,689
Just kneel!

136
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,719
Today, I'm going to let him be our puppy. How about that?

137
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,139
 Yeah! 

138
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,169
- Bark! 
  - Bark! 

139
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,300
 - Come on. 
 - Bark! 

140
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,590
 - Come on. 
 - Bark! 

141
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,569
 Do it! 

142
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,340
 Bark! 

143
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,909
Come on and bark!

144
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,540
 - Bark!  
 - Come on!

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,380
 Puppy! 

146
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,419
- These little brats! 
 - Come on!

147
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,280
Give it to him.

148
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,149
You can't kneel to those servants.

149
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,350
Let alone bark like a dog, understand?

150
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,859
They said if I barked, they wouldn't beat me.

151
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,930
And even gave me food.

152
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,920
Don't you know what dignity is?

153
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,650
Were you born without a sense of shame?

154
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,079
 As a prince, you're bullied by servants. 

155
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,149
 Do you have no sense of shame at all? 

156
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,840
 Sense of shame? 

157
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,750
 That means nothing to me. 

158
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,620
 Food is clearly more important. 

159
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,839
They keep bullying you like this.

160
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,169
Don't you feel sad?

161
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,859
What's a sense of shame?

162
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,900
What's feeling sad?

163
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,090
They're making fun of you.

164
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,210
Did they not mean to give me food?

165
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,150
No.

166
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,540
I see.

167
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,000
Then, can I kill them?

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,040
 So this is the nature of a devil god? 

169
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,849
I can't take this anymore. His Highness isn't normal at all!

170
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:35,929
He's a monster!

171
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:36,999
What nonsense are you talking about?

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,859
He's only six. He's still a child.

173
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:44,629
You think he's abnormal simply because he has been living in the deserted palace and is constantly bullied.

174
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:45,869
Understand?

175
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,170
But…

176
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,830
We're running out of money and jewelry.

177
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,379
We can't sustain like this.

178
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,359
Here's an idea.

179
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,149
A few days from now is the palace maids' off-day.

180
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,570
I'll try to slip out and ask for help from the Yiyue Tribe.

181
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,330
What about me?

182
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,040
Yingxin, I need you to take care of him alone for a while.

183
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,589
His Highness inherited the ability to communicate with animals.

184
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,379
He's the hope of the Yiyue Tribe.

185
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,400
We must save him!

186
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,450
 Don't worry. 

187
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,470
 I'll be back soon. 

188
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,969
 I'll do my best to bring you and His Highness to the Yiyue Tribe soon. 

189
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,910
 Trust me. 

190
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,150
Does it hurt?

191
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,060
Thanks for caring, Your Highness.

192
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm used to it.

193
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,970
 Where is Tantai Jin? 

194
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,460
Come quickly to hear your edict!

195
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,020
It must be Lan'an coming to save us!

196
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,010
His Highness is here!

197
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,629
Edict from His Majesty:

198
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,909
"Tantai Jin is to set off immediately to be a Sheng hostage."

199
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,669
What do you mean a Sheng hostage?

200
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,599
Do you even have to ask?

201
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,439
We lost the battle with Sheng Kingdom.

202
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,139
To make peace, His Majesty ordered Tantai Jin to be a hostage prince in the Sheng Kingdom.

203
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,269
He shall set off today.

204
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,020
Understand?

205
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,170
You two help them pack things up.

206
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,670
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

207
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,859
Jing Lan'an, you liar!

208
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,239
You escaped to the outside and left me here to die!

209
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,140
Liar!

210
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,740
Liar!

211
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,780
Liar!

212
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,530
 We're in the Sheng Kingdom now. 

213
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,379
Steward Wu.

214
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,549
You're called Yue Yingxin?

215
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,360
You're the maid who came along with the hostage prince of Jing Kingdom?

216
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,710
Are you taking snacks to him?

217
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,269
I'm not going to eat you.

218
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,789
Get in there.

219
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,460
Yes.

220
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,130
 This old turtle is so disgusting! 

221
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,970
Your Highness!

222
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,660
Hold down this lowly maid, too!

223
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,669
What are you doing?

224
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,869
Let go of me! Your Highness!

225
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:41,810
Your Highness! Your Highness!

226
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,499
They say you're a freak.

227
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,440
You don't shed tears.

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,650
I don't believe there's someone who doesn't shed tears.

229
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,719
Cry for me now. And I'll let you go.

230
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,250
I really can't.

231
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,700
Your Highness!

232
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,500
How's that? Does it hurt?

233
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,510
The hostage prince still isn't crying.

234
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,829
Don't stop!

235
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,749
Go ahead and break his other arm off!

236
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,450
Yes.

237
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,120
Stop!

238
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,960
   

239
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,930
 Greetings, Sixth Prince. 

240
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,450
You may all rise.

241
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,959
Fifth Brother, Prince Tantai left his home country to be a guest in our kingdom.

242
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,719
He did it for the peace of the two kingdoms.

243
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,079
And also for keeping the civilians free from the pains of war.

244
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,959
We should treat him politely.

245
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,020
How can you bully him without any scruples?

246
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,570
Such a bummer.

247
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,100
Let's go!

248
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,890
Your Highness.

249
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,170
Thank you, Sixth Prince, for saving us.

250
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,130
No need. My fifth brother was being rude.

251
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,789
Prince Tantai looks pale.

252
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,199
Why don't you go back and rest?

253
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,780
I'll explain it to the teacher for you.

254
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,020
Come on. Thank you, Sixth Prince!

255
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,959
Why would that Sixth Prince tell his brother to stop?

256
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,190
And how could he make them fear him?

257
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,349
I heard that Sixth Prince's mother is the queen.

258
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:40,100
She's also His Majesty's favorite in the inner court.

259
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,239
People in the palace are mostly superficial.

260
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
So naturally they dare not offend him.

261
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,639
Mother?

262
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,069
If he didn't have a mother anymore, would he be the same as me?

263
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,829
Actually, what I said isn't necessarily right.

264
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,740
Besides his mother is important and favored,

265
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,879
Six Prince is also gentle and intelligent.

266
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,970
Who wouldn't like him?

267
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,630
Really?

268
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,039
If I behaved like him, will others like me as well and stop bullying me?

269
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,139
   

270
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,050
"Geography of Four Continents"?

271
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,600
Your Highness, why are you reading this?

272
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,079
It is said that Xiao Lin just went to Mount Buzhao, where he'll cultivate for three years.

273
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,350
I don't know that place. So I wanted to find it in books.

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,909
Someone can't even get out of the palace, but is still dreaming about some immortal mountain.

275
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:40,580
Trying to learn spells to fly out of here?

276
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,590
Fifth Prince.

277
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,589
Take this!

278
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,200
Your Highness!

279
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,339
Are you all right?

280
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:04,310
Fifth Prince, why did you hit me?

281
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,370
Why?

282
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,729
Because your smile looks disgusting.

283
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,679
I tell you what, I've had enough of a freak like you!

284
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,849
Now that Xiao Lin's not around, let's see who will protect you in the palace!

285
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,920
Get him!

286
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Your Highness!

287
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,910
Stop it!

288
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,850
Stop!

289
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,260
Your Highness!

290
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,940
I thought they stopped bullying me all these years because

291
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,639
because I acted like Xiao Lin and learned to be a normal person like Lan'an said before she left.

292
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,370
But I didn't know they were just scared of Xiao Lin.

293
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,890
Sixth Prince, congrats for completing your training and moving into your new mansion!

294
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,159
Good things come in pairs!

295
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,380
Congrats! Congrats!

296
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,310
Prince Tantai?

297
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,100
We haven't met for three years. Thank you for coming today.

298
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,479
Congratulations.

299
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Look! Eldest Miss Ye is here!

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,210
Who is this lady?

301
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,830
She's the daughter of the Pillar of the State Great General.

302
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,060
Miss Ye.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,590
Your Highness.

304
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,500
It's getting chilly.

305
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,550
Be careful not to catch a cold.

306
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

307
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,110
This…

308
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,610
Prince Tantai, why are you here?

309
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,380
Miss Ye.

310
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,620
The weather is chilly. Be careful not to catch a cold.

311
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Your Highness, I don't feel cold.

312
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,640
Please keep the cloak for yourself.

313
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,709
 Could Tantai Jin like Ye Bingchang because he was imitating Xiao Lin? 

314
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,070
Yingxin, is it because my cloak is worn out?

315
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,670
Tantai Jin!

316
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,610
Who are you trying to disgust this time?

317
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,999
Fifth Prince, so many people pass by this corridor.

318
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,039
If you plan on beating me up here, I'm afraid…

319
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,730
You haven't heard?

320
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,069
Now, the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms are at war.

321
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,480
If I beat you like a Jing dog, who's gonna stop me?

322
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,340
Get him!

323
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,549
Your Highness!

324
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,549
Take that!

325
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,100
Your Highness!

326
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,679
Stop it!

327
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,790
 He's been getting beaten so frequently. 

328
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,040
 When does this ever end? 

329
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,900
Yingxin,

330
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,580
what does it feel like to be liked?

331
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,510
You're not answering.

332
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,210
Is it because you don't like me, either?

333
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,539
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

334
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:40,720
I didn't mean that.

335
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:50,130
When I was little, I couldn't understand what the looks on people's faces meant.

336
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,100
But now,

337
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,900
I sort of understand a little.

338
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,810
Actually, you've always resented me.

339
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,200
It's because of me that you're trapped in this dark and remote palace.

340
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,430
Yingxin, I don't blame you.

341
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,220
I resent myself, too.

342
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,399
I know people out there don't like me.

343
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,820
Normally speaking,

344
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,980
I should feel sad inside.

345
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,989
If it were Xiao Lin, he'd be ridden with such guilt that he couldn't eat.

346
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,380
Later on, I started imitating Xiao Lin.

347
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,300
I imitated everything he did,

348
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,260
hoping that I could gradually become him.

349
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,500
To be someone likable just like Xiao Lin.

350
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,510
But Yingxin, I still can't feel a thing.

351
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,980
I was faking it when I smiled like him.

352
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,590
I was faking it when I was being magnanimous.

353
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,550
I was even...

354
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,290
faking it when I cared about others.

355
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,980
Fake things...

356
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,170
deserve to be detested,

357
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,070
to be loathed,

358
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,020
and to be abandoned.

359
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Forget it.

360
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,149
- For someone like me, being alive is a blessing enough. 
 - Your Highness.

361
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:29,070
- Why bother asking too much for being loved? 
 - Your Highness!

362
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,890
 Born with an evil bone… 

363
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,210
 Having no emotions or love… 

364
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,780
 None of it was what he wanted. 

365
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,900
 Nor was it his fault. 

366
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,210
 But once he became Devil Lord, 

367
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,790
 all those victims were indeed slain by him. 

368
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,579
I was ordered to send a verbal message from the Jing Kingdom.

369
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,540
Jing Kingdom?

370
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,799
The hostage prince will soon marry and leave the Palace of Sheng.

371
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,069
But once he does, he might return to the Jing Kingdom.

372
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,220
Once he returns, he'll probably grasp power, and then he'll become untouchable.

373
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,029
That's why Prince Minglang said

374
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,490
the hostage prince should better not leave this palace forever.

375
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,490
 Tantai Minglang? 

376
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,169
 Young Devil Lord's elder brother. 

377
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,480
Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?

378
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,890
Then, what's in it for me?

379
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,420
Even displaced horses and birds miss their home.

380
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,269
Prince Minglang knows that you're getting older.

381
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,309
As long as you're willing to help us,

382
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:53,349
we'll think of a way to help you get out of the palace and return to your hometown.

383
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,630
Really?

384
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,189
You've sacrificed your best years and ruined most of your life just for Tantai Jin.

385
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:05,919
Are you really willing to follow this monster until you die in a foreign land?

386
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,199
Yingxin, don't be tempted!

387
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,029
You watched Tantai Jin growing up.

388
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,209
Although he's weird, he never once hurt you.

389
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,410
Do you really have the heart to do this?

390
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,789
He has no family or friends in Sheng Kingdom.

391
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,269
You're the only person he can trust.

392
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:20,070
You can't betray him!

393
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,490
Yingxin! Yingxin!

394
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,550
Okay, I'll do it.

395
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,990
Very well, then. I'll leave for now.

396
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,540
Even you betrayed him.

397
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:43,570
 In Tantai Jin's whole life, if only there was someone who truly loved him and held his reins, 

398
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,510
 maybe… he wouldn't have been forced to become a devil. 

399
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,860
It's finally over.

400
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,580
We finally found it.

401
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,460
The demon's den is protected by a barrier.

402
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,550
Bingchang's probably here.

403
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,420
I feel that Tantai Jin and Second Young Miss Ye are imprisoned here, too.

404
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,190
We have to rescue them fast.

405
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,489
Go check the border of this barrier.

406
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,180
Have someone guard the roads.

407
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,969
Yes.

408
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:43,859
Let's go.

409
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,280
Hurry!

410
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,140
Now, we must lure the demon out.

411
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,310
I'll do it.

412
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,410
 Demon! We've found your den! 

413
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,849
 Stop hiding! Otherwise, I'll set your woods on fire! 

414
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,440
Free delivery to my doorstep?

415
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,310
 I wonder how Yingxin went crazy after. 

416
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,410
 Tantai Jin. 

417
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,580
Tantai Jin!

418
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,750
Tantai Jin!

419
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,959
Tantai Jin, wake up!

420
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Tantai Jin!

421
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,830
You said you couldn't dream.

422
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,350
But why is there a nightmare blossom sprouting from you?

423
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,789
Tantai Jin!

424
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,600
Tantai Jin, wake up!

425
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,410
Tantai Jin!

426
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,200
 Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin! 

427
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,590
 Tantai Jin, wake up! 

428
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:35,189
I heard Jin is one of the best among the outer disciples of Xiaoyao Sect.

429
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:38,510
And his talents are extraordinary.

430
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,109
He's just doing it for fun.

431
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,480
What? Do you really want Jin to be an immortal?

432
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,510
Let me look at you, dear.

433
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,410
You've really gotten thinner after you left the palace.

434
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,480
Mother.

435
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,950
- Here. 
 - I have something to tell you, my son.

436
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,889
While you were away cultivating, I've arranged you a marriage.

437
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,480
Thank you, Father.

438
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,729
The bride is the daughter of Sheng Kingdom's General Ye Xiao.

439
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,810
Conflicts can never seem to cease between the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms.

440
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:28,279
After we form a marriage alliance this time, we will be more like friends than enemies.

441
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,610
I'll do what as you wish, Father and Mother.

442
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:40,909
Jin, while you were cultivating in Xiaoyao Sect, did you meet any promising young talents?

443
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,210
The Sixth Prince Xiao Lin of Sheng Kingdom got along well with me.

444
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,379
 What a coincidence. 

445
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:51,099
 Xiao Lin happens to be the one escorting the bride to the Jing Kingdom. 

446
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,589
 You can spend time with him and get to know him better. 

447
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,379
 Yes. 

448
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:56,650
Congratulations, Your Highness!

449
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,829
 I didn't want to choose your wife so hastily. 

450
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:03,710
Congratulations, Your Highness!

451
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,000
 But now that you have become the crown prince, 

452
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,539
 your marriage concerns the kingdom's future. 

453
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,880
Congratulations, Your Highness.

454
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,099
  Eldest Young Miss Ye is well-educated. 

455
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,780
 She's also a stunning beauty. 

456
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,590
 I think you'll like her, my son. 

457
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,400
Ye Xiwu?

458
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,280
Why is it you?

459
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,140
Who else?

460
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,700
Who did you think it was?

461
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,030
Mother?

462
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,380
Mother!

463
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,569
Father.

464
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,100
You matricidal bastard!

465
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,680
No.

466
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,060
Father, I didn't kill mother!

467
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,020
Lan'an,

468
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,870
don't go.

469
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,280
 You're a monster. 

470
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,230
Don't go.

471
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,400
In your yellow-millet dream, you had such a perfect family. 
  (A yellow millet dream refers to an unfeasible hope.) 

472
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,090
How did it feel to be loved by everybody?

473
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,560
Xiao Lin, save me!

474
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,900
But that's all fake.

475
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:42,060
Once you wake up from these dreams, no one will care about you, nor will anyone love you.

476
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,340
All this time, you've been imitating me,

477
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,100
hoping you could be like me, to be acknowledged by others.

478
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,459
But in your dream just now, you got everything you ever wanted.

479
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,210
Love from your parents.

480
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,700
Easily ascending to the throne.

481
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,800
Even I'd envy that kind of life.

482
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,800
But can you really feel happiness?

483
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,699
I cannot feel anything.

484
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:23,299
I felt nothing.

485
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:28,200
If not for you, your mother wouldn't have died.

486
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,180
Your father wouldn't have suffered the loss of his beloved.

487
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,630
Lan'an wouldn't have wasted away in that dark palace.

488
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,760
Yingxin wouldn't have been insulted time and time again.

489
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,970
They were all your nearest and dearest.

490
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,760
But they all hate you.

491
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,900
I never intended to do them harm.

492
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,230
Never.

493
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,540
See?

494
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,030
All emotions, affections, and desires mean nothing to you.

495
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,580
All you have ever known was to protect yourself.

496
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,219
You don't understand or care about other people's pain at all.

497
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,690
I understand.

498
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,780
I understand it all.

499
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,489
I just can't feel it.

500
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,000
Tantai Jin, you are really pathetic.

501
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,400
You're alive, but you can't feel the slightest beauty of this mortal world.

502
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,320
You can't even feel the pain of this mortal world.

503
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,789
The only point of your existence is to bring torment to others.

504
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,240
No!

505
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,000
To be despised and hated by others.

506
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,060
Why… are you even alive?

507
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,659
No! That's not true!

508
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:52,690
But at least, your mother never hated you!

509
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,720
She loved you till the very end.

510
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,530
If you could see her and hear her say how much she loved you,

511
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,870
you could break free from this fate.

512
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,320
Do you want to see her?

513
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,170
The chance is right before your eyes.

514
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,380
What are you waiting for?

515
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,119
 You must experience all pain in the world and draw endless hatred. 

516
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,549
 You're carrying the curse of your fate. 

517
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,709
 You're destined to have a bitter end. 

518
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,159
 When your pain reaches its peak, when your life reaches the end, 

519
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,860
 I will come and accept your offering. 

520
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,530
I'm done waiting.

521
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,510
I do not want to wait any longer.

522
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,410
Tantai Jin! You can't die!

523
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,200
 Why is my power weakening? 

524
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,480
Xiao Lin!

525
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,160
Hurry, Junior Martial Uncle.

526
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,090
Ah, whatever. This will do!

527
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,450
We did it!

528
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,320
Where did she go?

529
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,100
So you ruined my vines.

530
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,060
I should've swallowed you and let your soul disperse!

531
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,380
 Tantai Jin. 

532
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,709
 Why not have a taste of this demon? 

533
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,319
What are you talking about?

534
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,710
 Your blood restrains all demons in this world. 

535
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,310
 Your body can bear their demonic powers. 

536
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:18,920
 As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power. 

537
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,680
 Do you feel it? 

538
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,000
 This power is what your body craves. 

539
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,730
 Isn't it more fun than emotions and desires? 

540
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,010
Don't try to fool me again!

541
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,829
 With the whip of power in your hands, you'll be the highest ruler of this world. 

542
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:06,460
 This is the taste of power! 

543
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,680
 I promise you this, once you've tasted it, 

544
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,110
 you'll never want to lose it again. 

545
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,010
Tantai Jin! Tantai Jin!

546
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,250
Your Highness, Eldest Young Miss Ye is over here.

547
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,730
Bingchang!

548
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,630
Where's that demon?

549
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,340
Was she blasted to ashes by the spell I used?

550
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,600
Let's save the people first.

551
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,220
Bingchang!

552
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,100
Bingchang!

553
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,490
No…

554
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,240
No…

555
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,990
Tantai Jin!

556
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,450
 Am I back again? 

557
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,380
Miss!

558
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,229
Miss, you're finally awake!

559
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,129
I was worried sick! I thought you were going to die.

560
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,059
Where's Tantai Jin? Is he dead?

561
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:19,609
Mr. Tantai was placed in the east-wing chamber.

562
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:23,229
He hasn't woken up yet, but he's probably not gonna die.

563
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,810
Chuntao, how did we get back?

564
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,659
I can't remember.

565
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,029
It was Sixth Prince who brought you back.

566
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,579
The imperial doctor said you passed out just because you were too weak.

567
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:44,129
Her Ladyship and Old Master sat by your bed for a whole night and just left to rest.

568
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,179
What about my sister? Is she all right?

569
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:49,509
Eldest Young Miss is okay now.

570
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,880
Sixth Prince is looking after her.

571
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,379
 The damage in the nightmares were real. 

572
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,540
 Thank god I stopped him from slitting his throat. 

573
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,570
 Tantai Jin can't die. 

574
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:16,430
 But who can withstand such a painful life? 

575
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,770
 If I can give him a hand, 

576
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:24,499
 would he be able to live normally and not turn into Devil Lord? 

577
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,049
 Li Susu, you're actually sympathizing with him. 

578
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,649
 He destroyed Hengyang Sect. He killed so many people. 

579
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,779
 He plagued the three realms and four continents. 

580
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:37,710
 He must pay for all these debts. 

581
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,670
 Even if he's suffering so terribly now, it's his fate. 

582
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,109
 But it's now five hundred years ago. 

583
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,699
 He hasn't yet killed anyone, nor is he capable of causing harm. 

584
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,239
 Being constantly bullied is simply cruelty for doing no wrong. 

585
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,989
 Since I was little, Father taught me to be upright and be true to my heart. 

586
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:02,930
 Now that I know all this, and if I'm secretly happy for it, I'll be confusing right from wrong. 

587
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,359
Second Young Miss, please have some rest before you see her.

588
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,839
Even if you are hurried to see Sixth Prince…

589
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,160
- Wait till you can stand properly… 
 - I'm going to see Tantai Jin.

590
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:27,630
 As long as they can't kill you, you can use their power. 

591
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,810
Power.

592
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,050
So,

593
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,900
this is...

594
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:02,060
what power feels like.

595
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,700
