00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,680

<i>[Episode 35]</i>

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,420
Do you all see this?

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,170
Cang Jiumin is the demon fetus.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,810
- Kill him.
<i>- Kill him.</i>

19
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,940
<i>Kill him…</i>

20
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,810
<i>Tantai Jin, you may have extracted the evil bone,</i>

21
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,910
<i>you may have chosen to follow the immortal sect path, but none of that made any difference.</i>

22
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,860
<i>You were born as a demon fetus. The Devil-Subduing Pillar won't spare you!</i>

23
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,930
<i>There's no place for you in the immortal sects!</i>

24
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,270
<i>No matter what you do, you cannot escape your fate!</i>

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,630
Jiumin, wake up!

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,950
Don't let them influence you.

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,850
Immortal Zhaoyou, why are you still partial to your disciple?

28
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,530
Most of the mortals were injured by the devil artifact.

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,040
It would take more than Siying and Jingmie for that to happen.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,970
If it wasn't him who summoned the devil artifact and harmed the mortals,

31
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,680
who else could it have been? His companion, Li Susu?

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>Ye Xiwu…</i>

33
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,410
<i>you risked your life to seal the evil bone in your body.</i>

34
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:18,000
<i>No one can know this secret.</i>

35
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,850
<i>Susu…</i>

36
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,150
Jiumin, I'm going to ask you again.

37
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,380
Was it you who wounded the mortals using the devil artifact?

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,990
I…

39
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,810
<i>They can't find out that the evil bone is inside Susu's body.</i>

40
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>It was supposed to be my fated misfortune.</i>

41
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,640
<i>Let me be the one to bear it all.</i>

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,400
It was me. I used the God-Slaying Crossbow.

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,360
<i>- That's absurd!
- How can that be?</i>

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,500
How did an evil man like him end up being a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect?

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,120
Why did you do that?

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,700
I thought…

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,130
<i>Today, Cang Jiumin, the immortal cultivator, won't be able to save her.</i>

48
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,390
<i>Besides, she's not the only one you need to save today.</i>

49
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,060
I could take control of myself…

50
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,970
I thought…

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,750
<i>One!</i>

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,020
I could change my destiny…

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,350
<i>You can't save them.</i>

54
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,510
and choose my own path in life…

55
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,990
<i>If the Devil Lord is the only one who can stop all of this…</i>

56
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,570
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,650
<i>I'm sorry…</i>

58
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,510
I overestimated myself.

59
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,870
I couldn't control my instincts.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,230
<i>My baby girl!</i>

61
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,870
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,180
If I am fated to become the Devil Lord

63
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,880
Just…

64
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,000
go ahead and kill me.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,350
Cang Jiumin, you will pay for my son's death with blood!

66
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,100
Hang on.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,160
This demon fetus is cunning.

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,870
He still has the devil artifacts and the evil bone.

69
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,730
We'll have to have them removed and locked away with magical seals before he can be annihilated.

70
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:49,080
Otherwise, killing him will cause the evil bone's energy to peak, which will then revive the Devil Lord.

71
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,630
My fellow sect leaders, we, as highly accomplished cultivators, could combine our powers

72
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,410
and force the God-Slaying Crossbow out of him.

73
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,210
I'll do it.

74
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,500
No, I'll do it.

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,130
I'm in. I want to be part of this.

76
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,530
Will Junior Brother Jiumin be able to hold out against them?

77
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,780
<i>It is the Devil God's Eye, the God-slaughtering Crossbow.</i>

78
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,110
<i>What is this place?</i>

79
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,540
<i>It's thick with devil energy.</i>

80
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,500
<i>Susu, wake up!</i>

81
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,670
<i>Why am I back to being Ye Xiwu?</i>

82
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,320
<i>The evil bone has absorbed a large amount of devil energy.</i>

83
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,520
<i>Now it's fighting against your pure-spirit body.</i>

84
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,890
<i>You've got to contain it before it goes out of control.</i>

85
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,400
<i>That was Chongyu.</i>

86
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,480
- <i>It woke me up.</i>
- <i> I did not kill anyone with the God-slaughtering Crossbow.</i>

87
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,060
<i>I'm innocent!</i>

88
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,590
<i>That's Tantai Jin's voice.</i>

89
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,420
<i>The devil energy seems to be able to sense him.</i>

90
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,670
<i>The devil energy is so dense I can't even see what's ahead.</i>

91
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,300
<i>I have hard evidence of you being the demon fetus.</i>

92
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,770
<i>Oh no, Tantai Jin's true identity has been revealed.</i>

93
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,180
<i>He's in danger.</i>

94
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,160
<i>I am not the Devil Lord.</i>

95
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
You've wronged him! It wasn't him!

96
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,030
<i>This isn't good, I have to get to the Devil-Subduing Peak to save him.</i>

97
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,710
<i>He's been wrongly accused.</i>

98
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,970
<i>Chongyu, what do I have to do to wake up?</i>

99
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,080
They're trying to seize His Lordship's evil bone.

100
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,830
We must act now!

101
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,110
They will get their hands on it over my dead body!

102
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,480
<i>Hang in there, Tantai Jin.</i>

103
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,770
<i>I will not let you die like this.</i>

104
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,220
Someone is coming.

105
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,450
♫ <i>Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood</i> ♫

106
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,430

108

♫ <i>I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

109
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,230
♫ <i>Ridiculously wearing shackles of the past</i> ♫

110
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,230
♫ <i>Loneliness is sealed</i> ♫

111
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,110
♫ <i>In the vault of fate</i> ♫

112
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,530
♫ <i>Thousands of years of loneliness</i> ♫

113
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,820
Susu.

114
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,000
Susu.

115
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,940
♫ <i>Ah, living heartlessly without love!</i> ♫

116
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,100
<i>Great. You're safe.</i>

117
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,530
Susu, what are you…

118
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,700
Li Susu, are you trying to defend this demon fetus too?

119
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,280
Sect Leader Cen, Susu hasn't said anything yet.

120
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,090
Don't judge too soon.

121
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,550
Li Susu, what exactly are you up to?

122
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,460
My fellow sect leaders,

123
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,730
Cang Jiumin can't become the Devil Lord.

124
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,980
Li Susu, Cang Jiumin's identity has been confirmed.

125
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,290
Considering that you're young and innocent, I'll repeat it again.

126
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,030
He is the demon fetus.

127
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,280
He stashed away the God-Slaying Crossbow.

128
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,370
Even if he's not the Devil Lord now, he will become one later.

129
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,920
Even his admission into the immortal sect and changing of identity

130
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,870
were planned by the Devil Lord.

131
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,880
Susu, Sect Leader Cen is telling the truth.

132
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,460
Let me tell everyone another story.

133
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,360
Cang Jiumin, formerly known as Tantai Jin,

134
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,700
was the king of the Jing Kingdom 500 years ago.

135
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,740
What?

136
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,700
<i>Really? How could this be?</i>

137
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,740
<i>He was a king?</i>

138
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,700
<i>Is that true?</i>

139
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,450
He was indeed the demon fetus.

140
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,050
He was also the owner of the evil bone chosen by the Devil Lord.

141
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,360
But whatever happens,

142
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,200
he will never become the Devil Lord.

143
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,240
Susu, how do you know?

144
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,550
Li Susu, you speak with such confidence.

145
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,390
How dare you jump to conclusions in front of us?

146
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,880
Aren't we all here to find out the truth about this?

147
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,000
It won't hurt to listen to her.

148
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,200
Because 500 years ago…

149
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,450
No, don't.

150
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,800
I personally...

151
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,410
extracted his evil bone.

152
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,080
<i>- What?
- What?</i>

153
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,050
What?

154
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,520
<i>Nonsense!</i>

155
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,820
<i>You think extracting the evil bone is as easy as that?</i>

156
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

157
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>You have no proof. Why should we trust you?</i>

158
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,470
<i>Yeah, why should we trust you?</i>

159
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,900
<i>Why should we trust you? Never!</i>

160
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,840
It's okay.

161
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,230
My fellow sect leaders, I know I can't persuade you

162
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,900
without presenting proof.

163
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,800
I heard Chixiao Sect has an artifact called the Truth Jade Slip.

164
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,380
It can extract the true memories of anyone.

165
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,430
I beg you to use this artifact to tell if I'm telling the truth.

166
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,600
No.

167
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
Susu, don't do this.

168
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,200
This is the only way to tell what I've been through to everyone here. The only way for everyone to believe me.

169
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,410
I'd like to have a try.

170
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,600
Li Susu, let me see what excuses you can give us.

171
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,350
Don't, Susu.

172
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,360
No.

173
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,340
<i>Susu, we have no time.</i>

174
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,900
<i>You must return to the past right away.</i>

175
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,350
<i>Ten thousand years ago, the God of Cosmos left behind the Light-breaking Array, </i>

176
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,960
<i>which was inherited by leaders of my sect through generations.</i>

177
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,300
<i>I'll send you back to the Sheng Kingdom of 500 years ago.</i>

178
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>That will be the only chance.</i>

179
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,750
<i>Remember. Whatever you see, don't come back!</i>

180
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,180
<i>The Four Continents and Three Realms count on you! Understand?</i>

181
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>Tantai Jin, I swear...</i>

182
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,150
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

183
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,490
<i>So this is what happened.</i>

184
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,320
<i>So this is the truth you wouldn't tell me all along.</i>

185
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,850
<i>You're most afraid of me dying.</i>

186
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,630
<i>Yet you wanted me dead the most.</i>

187
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,600
<i>That's why you approached me and tried to kill me.</i>

188
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,890
<i>Susu, you've done so much for me,</i>

189
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,530
<i>but I didn't know anything.</i>

190
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,870
<i>I didn't know why I did so, either!</i>

191
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,730
<i> It's not fatal.</i>

192
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,910
<i>I won't die for now.</i>

193
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,780
<i>[Yingtian Gate]</i>

194
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,940
<i>The Lightning Punishment is getting closer.</i>

195
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,070
<i>Now I'm taking your evil bone</i>

196
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,280
<i>and paying you back with the divine essence.</i>

197
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,320
<i>You won't become the Devil Lord anymore.</i>

198
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,470
What's going on?

199
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,840
I think I saw you guys

200
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,530
in the Truth Jade Slip.

201
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,850
I…

202
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,580
I've destroyed his evil bone...

203
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,220
with the might of the lightning punishment.

204
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,900
He won't be the Devil Lord anymore.

205
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,140
I've severed the fate

206
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,600
of the destined arrival of the Devil Lord.

207
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,220
This world...

208
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,250
is safe now.

209
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,460
Susu,

210
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,340
so this is the whole truth.

211
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,390
You returned to 500 years ago alone

212
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,450
and did so much for us.

213
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,140
Since I've extracted his evil bone,

214
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,300
this means the prophecy can be reversed.

215
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,220
We can't choose our birth,

216
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,550
but we can choose between good and evil.

217
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,880
Although Tantai Jin is the demon fetus,

218
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,900
he can't become the Devil Lord anymore.

219
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,680
Now,

220
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,310
the six soul-slaying spikes should still be in Tantai Jin's heart.

221
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,130
And there's absolutely no evil bone inside him.

222
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,990
Go ahead and check if you don't believe it.

223
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,750
Now, everyone can rest assured.

224
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,280
I don't care if he's Tantai Jin or Cang Jiumin, he is the demon fetus!

225
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,650
Even without the evil bone, he'll be seduced by evil sooner or later.

226
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,170
We can't afford another massacre.

227
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,290
Leaving him alive will eventually bring disasters!

228
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,160
Being born as the demon fetus isn't his fault.

229
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,360
Even if he's really born a devil, we should give him a chance.

230
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,860
Punishing and accusing someone for something he didn't do is truly the disgrace of immortal sects!

231
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,770
My son died a mysterious death!

232
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,230
And you're still defending him?

233
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,080
Siying the Drought Devil killed Cen Mi.

234
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,600
Cang Jiumin forced himself to activate the God-Slaying Crossbow in order to save civilians.

235
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,480
He even suffered severe injuries for that.

236
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,870
<i>Cang Jiumin used the God-Slaying Crossbow to save the civilians?</i>

237
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,490
<i>Have we really wronged him?</i>

238
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,860
<i>Is… Is this true?</i>

239
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,190
<i>Thankfully we stopped in time.</i>

240
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,200
Cang Jiumin is the demon fetus.

241
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,980
Are we just letting him go like this?

242
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,730
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to ensure

243
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,570
the Devil Lord cannot resurrect again!

244
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,490
Sect Leader Cen, please rest assured.

245
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,340
We will try everything we can to kill Drought Devil Siying and evil cultivator Jingmie

246
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,060
and do your son justice.

247
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,250
As for Cang Jiumin, it was not his will to be born a devil.

248
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,660
Not to mention in times of emergencies, he chose to get hurt to save the civilians.

249
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,220
There's no doubt he's a kind soul.

250
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,350
We cultivators should be able to differentiate between good and evil.

251
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,260
Everyone, the divine energy in our Hengyang Sect

252
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,430
can cleanse devil energy and suppress evil spirits.

253
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,870
Why don't we temporarily put him under house arrest

254
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,800
in my sect to see if the divine energy is effective?

255
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,160
What do you think of this idea?

256
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,140
<i>- This is a good idea!
- Yeah.</i>

257
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,950
<i>With Sect Leader Qu watching him, we'll rest assured.</i>

258
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,490
<i>- Yeah.
- That's right.</i>

259
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,540
Believing in devils is no different from committing suicide!

260
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll put my words in here!

261
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,170
You guys just wait and see!

262
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,350
Get to work!

263
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,770
No wonder the evil bone didn't react to our devil energy in Jing capital last time.

264
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,380
That little girl can only fool the stupid cultivators.

265
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,040
No matter what trick they play, the evil bone can never be destroyed.

266
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,270
Why did His Lordship choose him as the demon fetus anyway?

267
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,120
Not only did he offend His Lordship, but he also lost the evil bone for a woman.

268
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,020
What do you know?

269
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,280
His Lordship has his plans.

270
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,040
But this time, we almost got the demon fetus killed.

271
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,340
We should be more cautious next time.

272
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,170
Report!

273
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,410
My Lords, we've found it!

274
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,030
After digging for 500 years, we've finally found it!

275
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,550
We've found the Devil Palace!

276
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,250
See? His Highness's plan works in mysterious ways.

277
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,980
Devil Palace is where the Devil Lord was born.

278
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,990
With the palace,

279
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,700
wherever the evil bone is,

280
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,390
he'll return sooner or later.

281
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,930
<i>Without the evil bone, the demon fetus will be worthless.</i>

282
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,660
<i>Let's see what those two devils have in mind to revive the Devil Lord.</i>

283
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,810
<i>But the evil bone is missing now.</i>

284
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,790
<i>Where can it be hiding?</i>

285
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,990
Brother Di, we have something to ask you.

286
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,220
Is it about the Demon Subduing Peak?

287
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,020
That day, when I heard that Cang Jiumin had summoned the God-Slaying Crossbow,

288
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,170
I knew I couldn't hesitate anymore.

289
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,840
They're only short of the Sky-Slashing Sword before they can revive the Devil Lord.

290
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,650
I had to tell the truth.

291
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,240
Otherwise, if I hesitated even for an instant, it would be too late.

292
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,940
Then you should have discussed it with us beforehand to get us prepared.

293
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,390
If not for Susu's timely arrival, Jiumin would've died on the peak.

294
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,940
I knew it was a reckless move,

295
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,160
but do you know how much I hate the Devil Lord for sealing me for ten thousand years?

296
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,920
Whenever I thought of Chuhuang, who was killed by the Devil Lord, I lose my sanity out of hatred.

297
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,540
Thanks to this hatred, I managed to hang on till now.

298
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,380
I'm here not only to find my daughter whom I'd never met

299
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,590
but also to help the immortal sects to stop the Devil Lord from resurrection.

300
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,340
Please forgive me if I offended you somewhere.

301
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,860
But after what happened at the peak, we've given Jiumin a chance to prove himself.

302
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,500
I won't make things hard for him or go against him anymore.

303
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,010
I give you my word.

304
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,300
Forget it.

305
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,460
We're not here to criticize you today.

306
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,020
We actually need a favor from you.

307
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,850
Sect Leader Cen, we've asked the Lord of Monsters the method of sealing devil artifacts.

308
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,900
The God-Slaying Crossbow is too dangerous.

309
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Now let's seal it with the power of us three.

310
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,920
Nobody can open the box alone.

311
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,390
Sect Leader Cen, can you rest assured now?

312
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,710
Things have come to this point.

313
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,370
Anything I say would be pointless.

314
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,380
Cang Jiumin is a disciple of my Xiaoyao Sect.

315
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,760
He'll be imprisoned in Hengyang Sect.

316
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,120
For the sake of fairness,

317
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,620
I think it's best to let you take this crossbow back to Chixiao Sect for safekeeping.

318
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,540
Mi'er, I'm so useless.
<i>[Memorial tablet of Loving Son Cen Mi]</i>

319
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,930
Had I worked harder and become the chief of all sects,

320
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,370
you wouldn't have died for no reason.

321
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,750
But today, I've obtained this demonic crossbow.

322
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,800
This is a powerful devil artifact.

323
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:22,030
If I can use it, nobody will dare to bully Chixiao Sect.

324
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,360
Don't worry. I won't let you die in vain.

325
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,520
I want them to pay with their blood!

326
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,640
<i>Raise your head.</i>

327
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,790
<i>Try strangling me..</i>

328
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,570
<i>There better not be leftovers. Finish them.</i>

329
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:13,350
<i>It turns out, starting from that moment it's always been you.</i>

330
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,060
<i>You protected me.</i>

331
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,200
<i>You treated me well.</i>

332
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,950
<i>You wanted to kill me, but you were also afraid of me dying.</i>

333
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>It's been you all along.</i>

334
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,020
<i>Our story lasted for 500 years.</i>

335
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,090
<i>And here we are now.</i>

336
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,700
<i>You saved me from danger despite the risks over and over again.</i>

337
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,670
<i>Thank you for doing so much for me.</i>

338
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,450
<i>I actually didn't know this until now.</i>

339
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,070
Susu,

340
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,110
why are you so foolish?

341
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,880
This time, it's my turn to protect you.

342

420
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,470
I'm not afraid to turn this stone.

All right then.

424
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,960

your origin.

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,860

It's good to meditate down the mountain for a while.

428

00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,420

Yes.

455
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,540
Jiwu,

456
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,880
I've missed you so much.

457
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,180
The two devils of Barren Abyss vanished just like that.

458
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,110
It's rare for the Four Continents and Three Realms to be so peaceful.

459
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,670
As long as the Sky-Slashing Sword is found,

460
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,140
the prediction of the Devil Lord's resurrection will never come true.

461
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,800
God-Slaying Crossbow and Bone-Refining Seal have been sealed.

462
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,520
But would it really make sure that everything is safe?

463
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,400
What if…

464
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,730
Two of the three devil artifacts have been sealed so far.

465
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,810
Besides, the demon fetus has no evil bone now

466
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,050
and is living in Mount Changze

467
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,970
under our immortal sect.

468
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,400
This could be the greatest achievement of all

469
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,660
for our anti-devil cause over the five hundred years.

470
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,080
Lord of Monsters, I think you are worrying too much.

471
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,810
Devil artifacts are very powerful.

472
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm afraid they will fall into Siying and Jingmie's hands again

473
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,340
and bring suffering to the mortal realm.

474
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
The devil artifacts have been sealed.

475
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,150
But Mount Changze isin plain sight, after all.

476
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,200
The enemy can hide, but we can't. It's not safe in the long term.

477
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,310
I'm distressed about it, too.

478
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:27,220
Since you mentioned this, and you've lurked around the Devil Lord for years,

479
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,750
do you think there is a good way to deal with it?

480
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,060
If any formations or spells are more solid and extensive

481
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,080
than common guardian barriers…

482
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,890
Guardian barriers?

483
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,460
Zhaoyou, Xiaoyao Sect has a secret treasure

484
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,970
called the Heart-Guarding Scale. Is it still here?

485
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,890
My sect has a formation.

486
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,190
We can use the infinite divine power to refine and enlarge the artifact.

487
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,670
With this formation and the perfect geographical location of Xiaoyao Sect,

488
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,750
perhaps the barrier Dimian suggested can really work.

489
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,730
We indeed have the Heart-Guarding Scale.

490
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,570
But the sect leader gave it to an outsider disciple of the royal family of the Sheng Kingdom

491
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,720
five hundred years ago as a gift.

492
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,940
For some unknown reason it was brought back by Immortal Buxu.

493
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,590
There are a few cracks on the artifact

494
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,160
which need to be repaired.

495
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,900
We can try the Formation of Melting.

496
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,530
But who should we send?

497
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,710
Let Jiumin go.

498
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,830
Dad, Heart-Guarding Scale has a deep connection with Jiumin.

499
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,900
He is the best person to refine it.

500
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,690
So please let him have this opportunity.

501
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,420
Okay. We'll take your advice.

502
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,890
Jiumin will refine the Heart-Guarding Scale.

503
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>Master, I don't understand.</i>

504
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,460
<i>Why did you leave such an important task with me?</i>

505
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,330
<i>Jiumin, the Heart-Guarding Scale was made and refined by Mingye back then.</i>

506
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:28,740
<i>You and Susu were in Enlightened Life and experienced the life of Mingye as a god.</i>

507
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,360
<i>So you're the best choice to do this.</i>

508
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,770
<i>Yes.</i>

509
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,560
<i>Your master and I made the decision together.</i>

510
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,920
<i>We both believe in you.</i>

511
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,940
<i>Jiumin, I'll leave it to you.</i>

512
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,350
<i>What should I do?</i>

513
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,700
<i>Hold it steady, and find a way to melt it.</i>

514
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,450
<i>Listen carefully. A voice will tell you how to do it.</i>

515
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,840
<i>But I hear nothing.</i>

516
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,310
<i>Listen not with your ears but with your heart.</i>

517
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,130
<i>Mingye, look! The Red Immortal Fruits are blooming.</i>

518
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,760
<i>Thank you, Brother.</i>

519
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,980
<i>Look at that.</i>

520
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,200
I get it.

521
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,430
I've been thinking the wrong way all this time.

522
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,300
I avoided my nature, was afraid of the power I was born with,

523
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,090
and dreaded my origin and the fate awaiting me.

524
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,350
But these are not about others.

525
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,820
It's all about me.

526
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,830
I have full control over it.

527
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,050
Today, I finally found the answer beyond the trivial matters.

528
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,920
I know that I am myself.

529
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,510
Jiumin, you are a demon fetus, the seed of the Devil Lord.

530
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,430
But as long as your heart is pure and bright,

531
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,790
and you believe in the goodness of this world, the Devil Lord won't awaken.

532
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,200
And the Four Continents and Three Realms can finally be saved.

533
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,870
- I've reached a breakthrough.
- Yes.

534
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,520
You feared to indulge in your powers.

535
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,750
So, you couldn't achieve a breakthrough.

536
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,550
How do you feel now?

537
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,180
I'm no longer afraid.

538
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,850
Jiumin, good or evil, has nothing to do with being an immortal or a devil.

539
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,000
It's up to your heart.

540
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,830
Thank you, Master.

541
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,200
Jiumin, the Mountain Protecting Formation has been completed,

542
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,610
and the Heart-Guarding Scale has a deep connection with you. So, I'll leave it to you.

543
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,550
Jiumin, I have a question for you.

544
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,170
Susu has the evil bone, doesn't she?

545
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,850
What happened in Demon Subduing Peak isn't obvious to outsiders

546
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,640
How could Old Qu not know what his own daughter is thinking?

547
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,410
He simply didn't want to expose her.

548
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,920
If the evil bone cannot be removed,

549
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,050
I'm afraid that Susu will have to stay in Heaven Lake for her lifetime.

550
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:35,120
Are you willing to stay here with her forever?

551
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,630
Master, the evil bone was originally in my body.

552
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,900
Susu took the suffering for me.

553
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:50,890
Even if I must stay in Hengyang Sect for the rest of my life, I won't regret it.

554
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,610
From now on, I will watch over the evil bone with Susu.

555
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:04,280
All right. Good.

556
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,750
Since you're willing to do this, just settle down in Hengyang Sect.

557
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,900
I've finally got a good disciple. Yet you got yourself a bargain.

558
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,520
Somehow, he has become a live-in son-in-law of Hengyang Sect.

559
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,850
It's a great loss for me!

560
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,950
Senior Sister Susu, I just want to know if I survived back then.

561
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't think so.

562
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,730
What?

563
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,760
Senior Sister, what about me?

564
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,850
I think you were eaten by a demon while you were out on patrol.

565
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,810
- Eaten by a demon?
- Thank you, Senior Sister.

566
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,700
What about me?

567
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,490
Here he comes. Stop asking. Go, go, go.

568
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,220
- Bye, Senior Sister.
- Bye, Senior Sister.

569
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,460
- Go, hurry!
- Go, go, go.

570
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,420
- Go, go.
- Go, go, go.

571
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,240
Did I disturb you guys?

572
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,860
We're not talking about anything important. It was just idle chatter.

573
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,140
Were you guys talking about the Devil Lord?

574
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,570
They're afraid of the Devil Lord, not you.

575
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,650
I know.

576
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,570
But...

577
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:52,510
Only by getting rid of the Devil Lord can they feel at ease.

578
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,940
And only then...

579
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,290
can I live with you in peace.

580
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,840
I'll work hard with you, and I'll always be there for you.

581
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,710
Don't worry.

582
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,060
Li Susu, Spirit-Nurtured Female Immortal, and Cang Jiumin, a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect,

583
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,940
will have plenty of time to solve these problems later.

584
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,520
We have a long future ahead of us.

585
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,860
Okay.

586
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,750
Come on! Go with me to Heaven Lake for a walk and let's clear our minds.

587
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,260
Sure.

588
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,390
So, Dad and the others already know the evil bone is in my body.

589
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,300
So, they didn't do this to cleanse my devil energy with the divine power of Heaven Lake.

590
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,980
They're doing this all for you.

591
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,910
Tantai Jin, actually, it's still not too late for you to leave now.

592
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,830
Where would I leave to?

593
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,010
The world is big. You can go anywhere.

594
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,770
Getting stuck in Mount Changze for the rest of your life and missing all the beautiful scenery out there…

595
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,580
It's such a pity.

596
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,460
Remember you taught me this?

597
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,160
Sketch Spell?

598
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,960
The universe manifests in an inch of land.

599
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,680
The soul follows the mind.

600
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,620
Susu, even if we're stuck here forever in Hengyang Sect,

601
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,320
I will stay here...

602
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,170
and enjoy the mountains and rivers as well as sunsets and mornings with you.

603
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,330
No scenery is better than being with you for all eternity.

604
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:13,360
This doesn't sound like what Tantai Jin would say,

605
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,870
but rather something like Cang Jiumin, a disciple of Uncle Zhaoyou, would say.

606
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,170
Come to think of it,

607
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,520
I've been searching for you for 500 years.

608
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,560
Every day throughout these 500 years, I've been wondering...

609
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:37,340
what I could do to make you happy if the heavens had mercy on me...

610
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,310
and gave me a chance to meet you again.

611
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,500
So,

612
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,070
I am Tantai Jin and also Cang Jiumin.

613
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,690
I will do whatever as long as it makes you happy.

614
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:07,290
Tantai Jin, what kind of nonsense did you learn in Xiaoyao Sect?

615
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,220
I learned a lot.

616
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,530
You just said it.

617
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,980
Make sure you don't regret it.

618
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,550
I won't.

619
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,390
If I, Tantai Jin, go back on my word,

620
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,330
Heaven and Earth will slay me.

621
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,400
My body and soul will perish.

622
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,980
Don't say such things!

623

I put a mark on you.

641
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,660
I used a unique spell.

642
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,030
You can't get rid of it even if you want to.

643
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,100
And you can't regret it even if you want to.

644
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,550
My mark is in the shape of a phoenix feather. It's very beautiful.

645
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,830
- Let me see how it looks.
- Susu.

646
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,680
These are all old wounds. I recovered a long time ago.

647
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,990
Since they won't disappear, let's cover them.

648
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:54,640
Don't worry. As long as it's yours,

649
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,890
