♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

♫  My existence  ♫

Grandma.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,373
Ye Xiwu.

21
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,883
Ye Xiwu.

22
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,743
You're awake.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,973
What?

24
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm thirsty.

25
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,923
Wait for me.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,493
Come on.

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,263
Ye Xiwu.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From now on, whatever you want,

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,810
just tell me.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,270
I'll grant your every wish.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,933
Tantai Jin,

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,910
marry me.

33
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,680
I want to be your queen.

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,753
Okay.

35
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,543
Okay.

36
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,580
It's like she's possessed after coming back.

37
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,310
We sent men to ask her to go home to pay respects, but she drove them away.

38
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,170
I barely even know her now.

39
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,830
General Ye, I'd like to ask a favor from you.

40
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,660
It's my pleasure, Your Majesty. Please just say it.

41
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,870
I'd like to ask you not to mention this in front of her again.

42
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,800
At least not before our wedding.

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Let no one agitate her.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,660
But Grandma…

45
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiwu loves her no less than you.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,390
You can't imagine how sad she is.

47
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,270
Besides, she loved Xiao Lin for years.

48
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,090
But she watched him die.

49
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,210
These things came one after another.

50
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,500
How can she take it?

51
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,000
But whether Father will forgive her or not,

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
she has to come back to meet us.

53
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,490
Last night, Xiwu told me that she wanted to cut all ties with the Ye family.

54
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,190
General Ye, please erase her name from your genealogy book when you return.

55
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,190
Your Majesty, the one she wanted to murder was you.

56
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,260
Why do you still make her queen?

57
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,240
Do you really have no ill feelings?

58
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,160
Now, in this world, only she hasn't abandoned me.

59
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,330
Only she's willing to return to me.

60
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,950
Willing to keep me company.

61
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,290
Willing to love me.

62
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,170
I can ask for nothing more.

63
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,600
Your Majesty, I've calculated.

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,460
The 10th of next month will be an auspicious day.

65
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,510
Nonsense.

66
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,530
It's clearly the last day of this month!

67
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,160
How dare you talk nonsense?

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,340
How dare you accuse me of talking nonsense before His Majesty?

69
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,970
What proof have you got?

70
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,380
I derived it from the observation of stars and from the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

71
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,950
So what if you derive from that?

72
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,530
I've even looked into the records of history!

73
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,600
Enough. Stop fighting.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
The earlier, the better.

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,850
I don't want to keep her waiting.

76
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,510
- Your Majesty, but… 
 - No buts.

77
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,950
How soon can we complete it?

78
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,370
Your Majesty, three days at most to arrange everything.

79
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,140
It's August 24, three days later.

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,930
It's settled then.

81
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,091
    
 Yes.

82
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:15,160
   

83
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,050
 Come on, this way. 

84
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,653
 Watch it. 

85
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,783
 Move faster. 

86
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,343
 Faster. 

87
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,400
 Ye Xiwu! Ye Xiwu, come out! 

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,220
Ye Xiwu! Come out! You!

89
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,800
 Ye Xiwu! 

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,530
 Let me go! 

91
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,480
 Ye Xiwu, you come out to make it clear. 

92
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,241
 - You left the Ye family when things went wrong. 
 - Ye Xiwu...  

93
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,780
 Do you even have a conscience? 

94
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,100
 - ...don't be soft-hearted. 
 - Let me go! 

95
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,060
 - Don't be soft-hearted. 
 - Ye Xiwu! Come out! 

96
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,310
Ye Xiwu! Come out!

97
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,480
Ye Xiwu!

98
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Drag him away.

99
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,320
You! Are you even a human?

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,860
Of all juniors, Grandma loved you the most!

101
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,080
Are you still a human?

102
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,370
Ye Xiwu, you bastard… Ye Xiwu…

103
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,103
Stop.

104
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Sister, what's this all about?

105
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,630
You've been hiding from us since you returned.

106
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,770
What exactly is this for?

107
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,730
Ye Qingyu, you think you can talk to me like this

108
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,240
because you're a general?

109
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,960
If I go talk to Tantai Jin and ask him to relieve you of your post,

110
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,240
do you think he'll listen to me?

111
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,540
You're not Ye Xiwu.

112
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,640
You're nothing like my elder sister.

113
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,620
Perfect. I've officially disowned the Ye family.

114
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,610
Is there anything else?

115
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,723
 Tantai Jin, I want to be your queen. 

116
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,433

119
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,040
 The twin lotus flowers on your red bridal veil should be embroidered personally by the bride and the groom. 

120
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,080
 Only with this sincerity, can you have good fortune and grow old together with your loved one.

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,380
♫   You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil   ♫

160
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,680
♫   And learned to love what you used to resent   ♫

161
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,650
 I still have something that I haven't finished. 

162
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,440
 This time,  

163
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,260
 I must finish it. 

164
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,793
 Xiao Lin, goodbye. 

165
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,890
 Tantai Jin can also have such vivid expressions. 

166
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,830
 He must be... very happy today. 

167
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,380
 I have been waiting... 

168
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,280
 for this day for too, too long. 

169
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,800
 All the hard work I've been doing... 

170
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,920
 is just for today. 

171
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,043
Thank you.

172
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,030
We are a married couple,

173
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,040
and you are my wife.

174
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,260
You don't need to thank me.

175
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,410
I want to give you a gift.

176
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,313
What gift?

177
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,150
World-Alluring Jade.

178
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,323
Ye Xiwu, what are you doing?

179
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,383
Ye Xiwu.

180
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,510
Ye Xiwu…

181
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,400
Why?

182
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,183
Tantai Jin,

183
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,590
my purpose in the first place

184
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,030
was to kill you.

185
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,703
Don't tell me...

186
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,680
that you came back to me just to kill me?

187
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,183
Yes.

188
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,713
So,

189
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,690
all the things you said to me were lies.

190
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,340
♫  Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave  ♫

191
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,280
♫  Flip through the written fabulous years in books  ♫

192
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,880
♫  Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret  ♫

193
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,620
♫  I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish  ♫

194
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,800
But I still...

195
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,040
♫  To smooth the frivolous face  ♫

196
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,160
♫  I was already tired of bidding farewell  ♫

197
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,420
...love you.

198
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:53,140
♫  I would send ashes and brightness to the moon  ♫

199
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
♫  My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

200
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,000
♫  My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

201
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,980
♫  I couldn't experience endless sorrows or worries  ♫

202
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,553
Do you?

203
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,010
Tantai Jin, I have never loved you.

204
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,040
♫  Sincerity makes flirtation hard  ♫

205
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,300
♫  I still believe in the touched feelings that you gave me  ♫

206
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,640
♫  Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed  ♫

207
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,620
♫  But this time, who will be the one  ♫

208
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,153
Great.

209
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,743
Great.

210
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,280
♫  I once thought that joys and sorrows  ♫

211
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,090
♫  were just unfinished preludes  ♫

212
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,450
Farewell,

213
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,553
Tantai Jin.

214
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,300
♫  Have been pushed away several times by fate  ♫

215
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,150
The Heart-Guarding Scale…

216
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,150
♫  I no longer take the passing of time seriously  ♫

217
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:45,340
♫  But I never forget your utterance, "No regrets"  ♫

218
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,660
♫  My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

219
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,840
♫  My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

220
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,920
♫  I couldn't experience endless sorrows or worries  ♫

221
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,280
♫  A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears  ♫

222
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,690
♫  I only wish to exchange this life with eternity  ♫

223
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:14,010
♫  Ingenuine affection is also enough  ♫

224
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,540
♫  Sincerity makes flirtation hard  ♫

225
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,423
Ye Xiwu...

226
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,820
♫  Only this time, who will be waiting?  ♫

227
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,280
♫  Who is not willing to let go?  ♫

228
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,160
♫  Who dare not to insist?  ♫

229
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,213
Why?

230
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,880
Why would you fool me like this?

231
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,090
♫  Looking back again, all grudges and kindnesses are just fleeting   ♫

232
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:57,020
♫  No more talk of leaving or staying. Silence is the most comforting  ♫

233
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,040
♫  Why need alcohol when one can get oneself drunk?  ♫

234
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,360
♫  I only ask if the world won't change  ♫

235
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,570
♫  I don't want to change the world, only your heart  ♫

236
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,720
♫  The longing never ends  ♫

237
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,930
Dad...

238
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,913
 Go. 

239
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,010
Eldest Senior Brother,

240
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,070
Dad, my eye hurts.

241
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,370
 What happened to your eye? 

242
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,360
Daddy, my eye is in so much pain.

243
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,550
It hurts.

244
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,720
 Sorry. 

245
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,900
 I failed. 

246
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,140
 The energy concealed in this jade may be comparable to that of a god  

247
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,790
 but making this jade was an evil deed. That is why its users were doomed to end badly. 

248
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,940
 They will be short-lived and die violently. 

249
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,890
 Dad, Eldest Senior Brother, and Uncle Zhaoyou, 

250
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,370
 I have tried my best. 

251
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,180
I have tried my best.

252
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,490
I'm truly sorry.

253
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,613
Ye Qingyu, your sister did that out of nowhere.

254
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:29,430
Do you really have no idea?

255
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,720
If I knew, I would've stopped her.

256
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,430
I wonder if His Majesty will blame the Ye family when he wakes up.

257
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,270
 Last night, Xiwu told me that 

258
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,830
 she wanted to cut all ties with the Ye family. 

259
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,620
 General Ye, please erase her name from your genealogy book 

260
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,130
 when you return. 

261
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,730
That's what she was doing!

262
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,740
Second Elder Sister had planned the assassination long ago,

263
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,570
so that's why she wanted to cut all ties with us. I didn't realize this sooner.

264
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,270
But what is she doing this for?

265
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,160
Is it for Xiao Lin?

266
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't know. The news of His Majesty's injury has been blocked

267
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,200
both inside and outside the palace.

268
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,960
I have to go home and inform my father and the others to get prepared.

269
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,480
 The incident of Ye Xiwu drugging His Majesty has been glossed over so easily. 

270
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,110
 She is indeed lucky. 

271
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,460
 But Tantai Jin clearly knows everything, and still kept her alive. 

272
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,783
 No, 

273
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,440
 I can't give Ye Xiwu the chance to tell the truth. 

274
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,940
Qingyu, it's so late. Why are you suddenly back?

275
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,240
It's good that you are here, Eldest Sister. Let's go to see Father together.

276
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,750
- Get Eldest Brother here, too. 
 - Yes.

277
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,410
What?

278
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,240
Xiwu tried to assassin Tantai Jin?

279
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,510
The crime of assassinating the king is punishable by death.

280
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,790
Once the killing order is made, Second Elder Sister will certainly die.

281
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,070
Well, Qingyu, what should we do?

282
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,140
I will try to convince His Majesty

283
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,230
to turn her over to the Three Judicial Departments for questioning before the trial.

284
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,710
 What if she tells them about the drugging when she was inquired by the Three Judicial Departments? 

285
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,600
Now Second Elder Sister's life is at stake. I came back today to persuade you to leave home to avoid trouble.

286
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,790
Although Second Elder Sister has severed ties with the Ye family,

287
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,440
His Majesty may take his anger on us.

288
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,643
Take his anger on us?

289
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:32,220
So what?

290
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,900
Xiwu is the daughter of the Ye family.

291
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,770
As her father, although I cannot exonerate her,

292
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,680
I can't abandon her at this time.

293
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,210
Father, I…

294
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,400
Life and death are decreed by fate.

295
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,100
This time, I won't escape.

296
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,300
Great General Ye.

297
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,300
Please.

298
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,240
Father, you…

299
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,860
Since you have made up your mind, I will not persuade you.

300
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,510
Please take care of your health, Father.

301
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,183
Eldest Brother, please take care of our family.

302
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,440
 Ye Xiwu, 

303
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,100
 since you didn't cherish it and signed your own death warrant, don't blame me. 

304
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,253
Your Majesty.

305
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:12,283
Your Majesty.

306
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:14,870
Hurry up. His Majesty is awake.

307
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,720
Your Majesty, you are awake.

308
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,920
Get out, all of you!

309
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,613
Yes.

310
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:23,430
- Get out, all of you! 
 - Yes.

311
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,883
You Majesty.

312
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,750
What did the doctor say?

313
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,200
He said he had never seen such a strange concealed weapon before.

314
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,893
It grows in the veins of your heart within a moment and...

315
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,860
it cannot be removed by external force.

316
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,633
Really?

317
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,270
It's fine to keep it in my body.

318
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,120
But, Your Majesty, these nails growing in the flesh will be extremely painful.

319
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,070
Then let it be painful.

320
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,943
Your Majesty.

321
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,590
How long will I live?

322
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,100
As long as Your Majesty recuperates well,

323
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,410
you will definitely get better.

324
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,060
Nian Baiyu.

325
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,400
You are not good at lying.

326
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,840
The doctor said

327
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,200
Your Majesty's heart is damaged.

328
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Even if you recuperate well,

329
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,490
you will not live more than three years.

330
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,063
So long.

331
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,570
It's really unbearable.

332
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,930
- Where is Ye Xiwu? 
 - She's in the dungeon.

333
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:35,360
The jailer came to report that from yesterday to now,

334
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,710
she did not eat nor drink.

335
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,150
Dress for me.

336
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,010
But, Your Majesty, your injuries are still fresh.

337
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,943
Dress for me.

338
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,113
Yes.

339
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,150
 Because I like you, all right? 

340
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,610
  Love lingers even after only being married for a day. 

341
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,980
 Saving you is what I am supposed to do, huh? 

342
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,980
 So you've been lying to me since then. 

343
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,210
 What is love exactly? 

344
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,630
  Love is... Love is you don't want him to die. You want to stay with him. 

345
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,690
 You will be worried if you don't see him. You will be happy if you do. 

346
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,050
 Everything was fake. 

347
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,380
 Everything was my wishful thinking. 

348
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,110
 I was blind 

349
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,640
 to fall in love with you! 

350
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,143
 Tantai Jin. 

351
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:05,890
 My purpose in the first place was to kill you. 

352
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,830
 Ye Xiwu, 

353
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,130
 you are really the most heartless person in the world. 

354
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,210
 I can barely see. 

355
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,230
 This is also the backlash of the World-Alluring Jade. 

356
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:57,500
Ye Xiwu, do you think I'm stupid and ridiculous?

357
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,110
You are locked in here.

358
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,900
You can only see a beam of light when you look up.

359
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,780
You feel very scared, right?

360
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:13,550
My days and nights...

361
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,810
were all like this.

362
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,150
Even when I was embroidering that veil for you,

363
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,980
I was very scared.

364
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,410
When people stay in the dark for a long time,

365
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,920
they always hope to see the light tomorrow.

366
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,800
But once they see it,

367
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,150
they fear that they may lose it at any moment.

368
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,910
It's truly a self-fulfilling prophecy.

369
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,110
Now, in the world, nobody can save me.

370
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,190
Just like what you are in now,

371
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,400
nobody can save you.

372
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,230
Even if no one can save me, I don't regret it.

373
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,013
Tantai Jin, I once naively thought that...

374
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,320
maybe I could be that light in your darkness.

375
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,560
And I could make you a human.

376
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,190
But I was wrong after all.

377
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,100
Some people in darkness

378
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,620
do not deserve light.

379
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,460
Unworthy.

380
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,070
What a word, unworthy!

381
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,850
Ye Xiwu, have a look.

382
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,070
I, Tantai Jin, an idiot.

383
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,900
You used to beat him, scold him, torment him.

384
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,300
and you even wanted to kill him. But even so,

385
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,600
he still can't bear to kill you.

386
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,300
He was even full of joy to marry you as his queen.

387
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,820
He looked forward to joining hands and

388
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,470
growing old with you.

389
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,960
He is extremely stupid.

390
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,430
Until you nailed him with those six nails,

391
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,450
he first came to his senses.

392
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,530
He really has no dignity.

393
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,520
 There are no Soul-slaying spikes. 

394
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,990
 The only chance to change the fate of the Three Realms 

395
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,490
 was screwed up by me. 

396
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,610
 There is no point for me to live any longer 

397
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,990
 except to be humiliated. 

398
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,223
Yes.

399
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:41,260
You have no dignity.

400
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,210
So I hate you.

401
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,290
Shut up!

402
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,410
I've done this to you!

403
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,700
Why don't you kill me immediately?

404
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,420
Do you not have dignity?

405
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,400
Ye Xiwu.

406
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,920
How do you feel, Ye Xiwu?

407
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,800
This heartbreaking feeling is very painful, right?

408
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,660
Let me tell you.

409
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,280
This is not even a fraction of the pain I feel.

410
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,213
Tantai Jin.

411
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,390
Kill me.

412
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,830
Kill me now.

413
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,380
Although it is interesting to toy with you, I'm tired of it.

414
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,623
Kill me, or…

415
00:40:44,623 --> 00:40:45,900
In your dreams.

416
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,080
Did you think I would let you off the hook so easily?

417
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,583
No.

418
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,900
I will keep your alive.

419
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,420
I will take you apart little by little

420
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,240
to have a good look

421
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,000
at what kind of heart you have in there.

422
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,360
Kill me.

423
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,433
Since...

424
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,700
you do not cherish my love,

425
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,170
then you can have a taste of my hatred.

426
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:53,990
   

427
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,200
Your Majesty, the doctors are outside.

428
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,570
Send them away.

429
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,183
Your Majesty.

430
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,880
No.

431
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,180
Send them to check if Ye Xiwu is dead in the prison.

432
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,040
If you really hate Second Young Miss so much,

433
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,680
why would you keep her in the palace?

434
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,940
I hate her.

435
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,590
So I won't let her get what she wants.

436
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,360
She wants to run away.

437
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,280
She wants to die.

438
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,060
 Kill me. 

439
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,000
 Kill me now. 

440
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,530
So I'll make sure she lives.

441
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,120
 I once naively thought that 

442
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,820
 maybe I could be the light in your darkness, 

443
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,760
 and I could make you a human. 

444
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,080
 Tantai Jin. 

445
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,020
 Life is indeed tough, but you still have to live on. 

446
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,280
 You are not dead and I am not dead. 

447
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,090
 We both survived. 

448
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,290
 Your promise me to live on. 

449
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,630
 I won't let you die. 

450
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,710
 But I was wrong after all. 

451
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,110
 Some people in darkness do not deserve light. 

452
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,060
 Since I'm alive, she has to stay alive, too. 

453
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:59,270
 Why should I be left alone in such darkness? 

454
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,843
Nian Baiyu,

455
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:12,740
summon Ye Qingyu here.

456
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,890
I have things to instruct him.

457
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,413
Understood.

458
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,670
- How is His Majesty? 
 - How is he?

459
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,120
He's in great pain but has to bear with it.

460
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,220
What about Ye Xiwu?

461
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,350
His Majesty told me that he wouldn't kill her.

462
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,900
She is safe for now.

463
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,550
But the prison gets humid and suffocating with pests everywhere in summer.

464
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,000
If she stays there and refuses to have food or drinks, she won't make it.

465
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,880
This silly girl is determined to die.

466
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,710
Mr. Nian, can I visit her?

467
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,210
Since His Majesty wants her alive,

468
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,693
go ahead.

469
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,290
Thank you for your kindness.

470
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,810
With my little sister in jail, the whole family is worried.

471
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,680
That's why they sent me here. We'll just talk a bit.

472
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,480
It's fine if you're only here to talk.

473
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,580
As long as...

474
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,160
you didn't bring any prohibited items.

475
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,220
Sir, how can a flimsy young lady like me possibly help her break free?

476
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,820
Fine. Come with me.

477
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,120
Ye Bingchang.

478
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,083
Yes, it's me.

479
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,360
Why did you come?

480
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,093
Second Younger Sister,

481
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,930
you've suffered.

482
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,060
Of course, I have to visit you.

483
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,140
You know.

484
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,860
I've always hated you for being so condescending.

485
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,760
Since you don't want small talk, let's get down to business.

486
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,650
My sweet younger sister,

487
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,540
I would like to know

488
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,440
if Tantai Jin had tasted that bowl of porridge?

489
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,320
Why didn't he die?

490
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,100
You know the porridge…

491
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,380
That's right. You thought...

492
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,110
you were the only one who added things in there.

493
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,900
What did you put in there?

494
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,033
Dry mylabris.

495
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,120
One tiny sip...

496
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,510
is lethal.

497
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,673
 Ye Xiwu, 

498
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:54,703
 did you 

499
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:57,740
 cook this porridge for me specifically? 

500
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:03,460
 Tantai Jin thought I wanted to poison him to save Xiao Lin. 

501
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,100
Why would you do that?

502
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,910
Xiao Lin was doomed because of that, you know?

503
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,880
Don't mention that name.

504
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,010
You don't deserve it.

505
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,890
You know? I had all my hopes up that day.

506
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:24,150
I thought I would hear about Tantai Jin and that old woman getting poisoned.

507
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,610
But it never crossed my mind that Tantai Jin didn't have the porridge.

508
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,700
He didn't die.

509
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:39,340
You killed Grandma, too.

510
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,130
Ye Xiwu, you won't be sad for long.

511
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,590
I will do you a favor

512
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:53,230
and let you get reunited with her in the underworld.

513
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,630
 Tantai Jin. 

514
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,110
 Do you want me to eat it? 

515
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,983
 What's the matter? 

516
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,600
 I guess I'll have some 

517
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,500
 if you feed me. 

518
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,770
 From now on, whatever you want, 

519
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,900
 just tell me. 

520
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,040
 What are you doing? 

521
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,473
Second Elder Sister.

522
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,633
Second Elder Sister.

523
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,720
   

524
