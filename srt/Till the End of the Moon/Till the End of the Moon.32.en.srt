Ye Xiwu,

17
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,460
is that you?

18
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,820
<i>Sect Leader Qu, have you heard about a lady named Ye Xiwu?</i>

19
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,310
<i>We haven't heard about her in our immortal sect.</i>

20
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,300
<i>Is she a disciple of the Hengyang Sect?</i>

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
<i>Jiwu has no parents.</i>

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,260
<i>He's not even a "normal" human.</i>

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,120
<i>Are you the real Ye Xiwu or another fake Xiao Lin?</i>

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,210
Hello, friend.

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,930
You've got the wrong person.

26
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,650
I don't know you.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,580
Sorry. I am rude.

28
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,630
I'm Cang Jiumin, a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect.

29
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,663
May I know your name?

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,610
So, you're Junior Brother Cang.

31
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,050
I'm Li Susu from Hengyang Sect.

32
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,790
Junior Brother Cang, if there's nothing else,

33
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll make a move first.

34
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,303
Wait.

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,300
Senior Brother Jiwu mentions you often.

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,240
However, I couldn't get a chance to greet you.

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,760
So, I'm lucky to meet you today.

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,683
Senior Sister, why were you not together with Senior Brother Jiwu?

39
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,460
He has something important to do.

40
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,310
That's why he didn't join me.

41
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,220
Why don't we go find him together?

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,940
Maybe we can gather some Red Immortal Fruit on our way there.

43
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,243
Okay. I can take the chance to stroll around.

44
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,180
It's my first time visiting the Shangqing God Realm.

45
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,760
These halls, painted pillars, and carved beams are magnificent.

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
We can admire them on our way there.

47
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,230
If you are interested in the Shangqing God realm,

48
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,560
I heard a story about it before.

49
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
10,000 years ago,

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,840
there was a God of War. His name was Mingye.

51
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,540
He married a smart and lovely princess from the Unionidae Tribe

52
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,530
♫ <i>I still bet my life on you</i> ♫

53
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,900
Her name was Sang Jiu.

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
♫ <i>...love threads twine around the remaining warmth</i> ♫

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,590
♫ <i>Our love has taken root</i> ♫

56
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,900
Though Mingye disliked the marriage at first, he fell for her gradually.

57
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,430
Before he had time to respond to her love,

58
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,830
Sang Jiu mistakenly thought that Mingye didn't love her.

59
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,770
So she left the Shangqing God Realm.

60
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,170
Why didn't he go after her since he regretted it?

61
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,820
How did you know he didn't do that?

62
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,630
There was a battle between gods and devils back then.

63
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,510
Even the Heavenly Pillar was destroyed.

64
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,210
Ming Ye was the God of War of this god realm.

65
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,630
He was afraid that he might lose his life in battle

66
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,370
and Sang Jiu would be sad about this.

67
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,463
That's why he reluctantly decided not to look for her.

68
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:35,770
But everything was fine to Mingye as long as Sang Jiu was happy

69
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,550
and safe.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,633
All right.

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I am done telling the story.

72
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's go and find Xiao Lin.

73
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,463
Sure.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,960
♫ <i>Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?</i> ♫

75
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,773
Ye Xiwu.

76
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,280
♫ <i>...refuses to fly away</i> ♫

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,280
It is truly you!

78
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,580
♫ <i>...like piercing my bone with a sword</i> ♫

79
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,970
I don't understand what you're talking about.

80
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,403
I said, you've mistaken me for another person.

81
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,880
<i>Why did you have to show up at this particular time?</i>

82
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,420
<i>I cannot acknowledge you yet.</i>

83
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,700
<i>Sorry.</i>

84
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,400
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,720
♫ <i>My turbulent years</i> ♫

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,260
♫ <i>To dream in an illusion of staying together</i> ♫

87
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,100
♫ <i>Why is the age of my heart a myriad?</i> ♫

88
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,840
Over there.

89
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,160
Unexpectedly, the Water Mirror has dried up after 10,000 years

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,630
and the Bone-refining Seal appears.

91
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,170
Otherwise, we would never have been able to find it even if we searched here for another ten years.

92
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,003
Let's do it.

93
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,213
Wait.

94
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:24,420
It's disadvantageous for us to fight in the Shangqing God Realm.

95
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,000
We need to use the diversion tactic.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,870
Go and distract them

97
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,820
so that they won't spoil our plan.

98
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,270
Yemei and Fengshi were on standby down the mountain.

99
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,770
I'm going to rendezvous with them

100
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,090
and engage Hengyang Sect in a huge fight.

101
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,260
Isn't that good, too?

102
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm Yue Fuya from Hengyang Sect.

103
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
I finally got a chance to engage devious demons like you all!

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I'll annihilate you guys, even at the expense of my life!

105
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,940
Watch out. Have you come to rescue me?

106
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,860
What's your name?

107
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,760
Where are you going? Can I go with you?

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
This place is scary.

109
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,363
Go now.

110
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,370
They've finally arrived.

111
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,620
Cast the Mountain Protection Array!

112
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,750
Taste my sword!

113
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,240
You'll never escape alive!

114
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Xiaoyao Sword Array! Ten Views of Cloud Mountain!

115
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,573
Stop!

116
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,970
Your primordial soul looks tasty.

117
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,380
Demon, stop!

118
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,860
Surrender immediately.

119
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,920
The Subduing Devil Array? So much for your trap!

120
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,930
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

121
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,633
Cast the array!

122
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,290
I thought you guys were capable.

123
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm disappointed.

124
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,410
When I served the Devil Lord,

125
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,230
only Jize and Chuhuang

126
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,310
were foes I deemed worthy!

127
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,800
Jingmie, stop talking arrogantly!

128
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,530
You are bound to die here today!

129
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,980
Where is Siying? Why is Jingmie the only one here today?

130
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,440
<i>There's a huge commotion out there.</i>

131
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,130
<i>I'm afraid Jingmie can't stall them for too long.</i>

132
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,150
<i>I need to hurry up. </i>

133
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,900
<i>I remember that in Enlightened Life, </i>

134
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,460
<i>Mingye had sealed the Bone-refining Seal in the Divine Platform.</i>

135
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,560
<i>The Bone-refining Seal is connected to the Devil Lord's energy and is very powerful.</i>

136
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,370
<i>Since it couldn't be destroyed,</i>

137
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,080
<i>the only solution now is to seal it under the Water Mirror</i>

138
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,480
<i>and keep it here forever with the help of divine power.</i>

139
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,720
This is bad. Something strange is happening on the Divine Platform!

140
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,700
Old Qu, stand still!

141
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,690
All of our disciples have returned. This may be a diversion.

142
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,120
Let's kill this demon first.

143
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Do not fall for their trick!

144
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,763
Stop, demon!

145
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,440
As long as I'm here, you are not allowed to take the Bone-refining Seal away.

146
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,980
<i>It's her.</i>

147
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,200
Then I will take your life.

148
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,100
<i>You won't get your way at the former divine residence.</i>

149
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,060
<i>Just by yourself?</i>

150
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,820
<i>The 12 gods couldn't stop His Lordship even when they risked their lives to battle him.</i>

151
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,130
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

152
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,010
<i>The Bone-refining Seal, the heart of the Devil Lord,</i>

153
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,960
<i>will be returned to His Lordship eventually.</i>

154
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,920
<i>You are born with the evil bone</i>

155
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,850
<i>and doomed to be the Devil Lord.</i>

156
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,380
<i>You're the Devil Lord.</i>

157
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,300
<i>You were already the greatest curse...</i>

158
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,960
<i>in the world.</i>

159
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,440
<i>This is your destiny.</i>

160
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,970
<i>To be a devil or a god,</i>

161
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,150
<i>it all depends on your one thought.</i>

162
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,433
<i>Mingye,</i>

163
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,950
<i>why did you choose me to enter your Enlightened Life?</i>

164
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,030
You won't be able to take the Bone-refining Seal today.

165
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,450
An insignificant disciple of an immortal sect like you

166
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,480
could actually seal the Bone-refining Seal?

167
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,803
Xiaoyao Swordplay, shatter!

168
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,150
No. Something's wrong with the Divine Platform.

169
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,790
Cang Jiumin!

170
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,173
<i>Is this</i>

171
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,970
<i>His Lordship?</i>

172
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,923
Cang Jiumin! Don't succumb to the demonic energy!

173
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,860
Wake up quickly!

174
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,330
It's been 500 hundred years.

175
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,210
I've finally found the demon fetus.

176
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,960
<i>It looks like they have found it.</i>

177
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,160
<i>They've finally inserted the charm.</i>

178
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,960
<i>Devil Lord, I'm sure you didn't expect this.</i>

179
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,060
<i>The ones who unsealed me</i>

180
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,940
<i>were two of your most loyal subordinates.</i>

181
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,850
<i>I have regained the freedom</i>

182
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,580
<i>that was deprived by you.</i>

183
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:13,820
<i>Tantai Jin, you are the demon fetus.</i>

184
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,350
<i>How could you defy my will?</i>

185
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,100
<i>Once the Bone-refining Seal merges with your heart,</i>

186
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,263
<i>I...</i>

187
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,660
<i>will be awakened.</i>

188
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,870
Cang Jiumin,

189
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,800
wake up quickly!

190
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,780
Wake up!

191
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,953
No.

192
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:47,010
No way!

193
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,920
<i>It's His Lordship's power.</i>

194
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,090
Cang Jiumin! Calm down.

195
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,460
Don't be possessed by the Devil.

196
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,650
<i>His Lordship's plan is mysterious indeed.</i>

197
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,710
<i>This is a confusing situation. I should leave while I can.</i>

198
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,450
<i>I can take His Lordship back to Barren Abyss once the demon fetus is fully awakened.</i>

199
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,590
Fine, Your Lordship. The Bone-refining Seal was yours in the first place.

200
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,810
<i>I shall take my leave.</i>

201
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,710
<i>Is this demonic energy from the Bone-refining Seal that merged with his heart?</i>

202
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,430
Cang Jiumin! Don't be bewitched by the demon artifact! Wake up quickly!

203
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,490
The Bone-refining Seal is already connected to your heart!

204
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,620
Do you want to die?

205
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,043
Cang Jiumin! Wake up!

206
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,960
Cang Jiumin!

207
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,243
Siying?

208
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,693
Great timing.

209
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:33,040
Let's annihilate both of them today!

210
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,980
Jingmie, cease the needless fighting. Let's go.

211
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,650
I didn't expect them to escape.

212
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,400
<i>Could it be that someone leaked our plan?</i>

213
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,300
Information about the Immortal Sect Competition was actually leaked.

214
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,590
The two devils took advantage of it. It's my mistake.

215
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,350
To my surprise, they came to the Shangqing God Realm

216
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,750
to steal the devil artifact.

217
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,220
Forget it. Old Qu, it's not your fault.

218
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
It's called darkness under the light.

219
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,210
Nobody expected the Bone-refining Seal to be hidden in the Divine Platform.

220
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:35,410
Luckily, Jiumin and Susu fought desperately to retrieve the devil's seal.

221
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,620
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

222
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,210
Supposedly, the two devils...

223
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,720
would come up with new tricks to snatch the seal again.

224
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,170
<i>Master, abnormal movements were detected at the barrier outside of the mountain.</i>

225
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,720
<i>It seems the devils are invading us.</i>

226
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,170
- Who are you?
- How dare you intrude on our immortal realm!

227
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,690
All of you may leave.

228
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,373
My brother, long time no see.

229
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,130
Brother Dimian, you were imprisoned by the Devil Lord for 10,000 years.

230
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,050
You finally made it back today. Congratulations.

231
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,700
The past 10,000 years were fleeting.

232
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,650
I think your immortal attire fits you well.

233
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,820
Why not stay here temporarily?

234
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,580
You two can be reunited.

235
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,280
Father, why did you summon me?

236
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,230
If it's about Cang Jiumin's injury, I have handed him to Uncle Zhaoyou

237
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,160
for him to recuperate at his sect per your instruction.

238
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,453
My child.

239
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,580
<i>Susu.</i>

240
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,880
<i>Who are you?</i>

241
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,590
<i>Come to me.</i>

242
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,030
<i>How come you know my name?</i>

243
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,110
It's you.

244
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,100
Susu, do you two know each other?

245
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,170
I had been to Barren Abyss and spoken with him.

246
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,820
You fell in rashly at that time.

247
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,010
You would've perished if I didn't notice you in time.

248
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,190
I'm very thankful to you for saving my life.

249
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,790
It seems that you two were fated to know each other.

250
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,813
Susu, come here.

251
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,050
Get down on your knees and kowtow to your father to repay him for giving you life.

252
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,173
No.

253
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,070
I may be her biological father; however,

254
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,100
I haven't raised her for one day.

255
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,680
God has been nice to me for us to reunite here.

256
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,910
My father?

257
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,790
Dad, what's going on?

258
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,210
It's a long story.

259
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,970
During our routing of the devils 10,000 years ago, the Lord of Monsters defected and wounded the Devil Lord grievously.

260
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,220
However, he was sealed in Barren Abyss by the Devil Lord.

261
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,590
<i>Decades ago, I had an arduous struggle with evil cultivators.</i>

262
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,010
<i>I was seriously wounded and fell into the Barren Abyss. I was almost devoured by demons.</i>

263
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,960
<i>Fortunately, I fell outside Dimian's cave.</i>

264
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,780
<i>He tried his best to cover me with his devil power and repelled demons.</i>

265
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,910
<i>That's how I managed to survive.</i>

266
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:20,540
<i>To repay his favor, I promised him to find the spirit egg he had with his late wife, Chuhuang.</i>

267
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,340
<i>- I haven't seen it.
- No.</i>

268
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,500
<i>I haven't heard of it.</i>

269
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,253
<i>Thank you.</i>

270
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,270
<i>Luckily, Heaven rewards one who put forth great effort.</i>

271
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,050
<i>I found the spirit egg eventually.</i>

272
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,240
<i>It was very difficult to hatch the spirit egg.</i>

273
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,480
<i>Then I put it on top of the Magic Well of Sumeru Base.</i>

274
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,510
<i>It was nourished by the pure essence of Heaven and Earth.</i>

275
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,320
<i>Later, there was movement in the egg.</i>

276
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,080
<i>Then I cast its soul into the mortal world.</i>

277
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,690
It went through life cycles and tribulations constantly.

278
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:25,400
I hoped that one day it could find a chance to hatch.

279
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,230
<i>She was born on the Magic Well of Heaven Lake and was nourished by the pure essence of Heaven and Earth.</i>

280
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,860
<i>Thus, I named her Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal.</i>

281
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,800
<i>When Chuhuang died back then, her body turned into the Chongyu Harp, a precious treasure of Hengyang Sect.</i>

282
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,060
<i>I gave the Chongyu Harp to that child</i>

283
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:51,530
<i>in hopes that she could be protected by her mother somehow.</i>

284
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,560
<i>So, the person I encountered was my mother.</i>

285
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,620
<i>Dad sent my primordial soul into the mortal world to undergo tribulations constantly.</i>

286
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,550
<i>That's why Ye Xiwu existed 500 years ago and looked just like me.</i>

287
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,610
<i>Maybe she is the evil part of my soul.</i>

288
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,710
<i>My primordial soul should have been restored after the trials of a lifetime, </i>

289
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,590
<i>but it was damaged by the Lightning Punishment.</i>

290
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:25,450
<i>As a result, after 500 years, my physical body will spontaneously combust without any external flames</i>

291
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,100
<i>and rest for ten years in the Sumeru Base.</i>

292
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,670
<i>Only when the tribulations end can I truly wake up.</i>

293
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,600
That's what happened.

294
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,590
Susu, I hid the truth from you for a long time.

295
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,840
You won't blame me, will you?

296
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,660
I…

297
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,203
Susu, you don't have to force yourself.

298
00:35:57,203 --> 00:36:02,460
It's understandable if you don't want to accept me as your father or even hate me.

299
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,650
I don't hate you.

300
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,170
I just don't know what to do.

301
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,880
That's fine.

302
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,180
No matter if you accept me or not, Chief Qu will always be your father.

303
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,280
Nobody can replace the love and care your dad did to bring you up.

304
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,413
All right. No matter if you are willing to call me father or not,

305
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:26,350
we will take care of you together.

306
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,113
Father.

307
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,910
Get up.

308
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,540
It's really strange when I think about it.

309
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,130
My mother is from the Phoenix Clan, but I was born to be afraid of birds and chickens.

310
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,520
It seems that fate is predetermined.

311
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,390
It turns out that I'm afraid of myself.

312
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,450
This is great.

313
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,500
You two have finally reunited today.

314
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,300
A huge burden in my heart has been lifted.

315
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,200
By the way, Brother Dimian, your identity is special.

316
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,220
Please reside in our sect for the time being.

317
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,470
When I find a suitable opportunity, I will invite all sects, clarify this matter,

318
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,210
and let you reestablish yourself in the world with honor and dignity.

319
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,863
Thank you.

320
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,880
Have you heard?

321
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,381
The person who trespassed into our sect was the Lord of Monsters, Dimian,

322
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,100
who commanded thousands of demons 10,000 years ago.

323
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,760
I guess you have no idea.

324
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
His wife is the Goddess of the Universe, Chuhuang.

325
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,310
He risked his life to work for the Devil Lord in order to find his weakness.

326
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,660
That's right. It is said in the legend that he was the one who defeated and killed the Devil Lord

327
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,200
It seems that he has been through a lot and endured many hardships, too.

328
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,590
Finally, he was able to restore his reputation and identity.

329
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,670
All immortal sects should treat him kindly and with respect.

330
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,341
For sure. He was the hero who killed Devil Lord!

331
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,710
<i>When the seal of His Lordship's Bone-refining Seal was broken, Elder Sister's primordial soul was gathered by accident.</i>

332
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,900
Elder Sister! You're finally awake!

333
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,770
His Lordship has saved you again!

334
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,340
Elder Sister?

335
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,313
Elder Sister!

336
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,780
I am Siying!

337
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,870
Siying?

338
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:51,450
Your soul was damaged 10,000 years ago.

339
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,940
That's why His Lordship cast you into the mortal realm to suffer tribulations.

340
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,660
Now that your soul has been restored,

341
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,480
we can finally be reunited.

342
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,370
Younger Sister!

343
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,333
Elder Sister!

344
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,410
Susu,
<i>[Unification of Heaven and Earth]</i>

345
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,710
since you now know your true identity,

346
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,540
naturally, you have answers to the changes

347
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,600
that you have undergone since emerging from the retreat.

348
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,220
The Phoenix Clan has a natural affinity for practicing the Heartless Path,

349
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,340
which is considered a shortcut to becoming a god.

350
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,740
However, it is ultimately up to your decision whether or not to pursue this path.

351
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,593
Dad, knowing my origins has strengthened my resolve to pursue my goal.

352
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:54,550
My mother was slain by the Devil Lord,

353
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,840
and my father was imprisoned by him as well.

354
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,020
Whether for public or private reasons,

355
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,920
it's my mission to fight against the Devil Lord.

356
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,460
If the Devil Lord were to be resurrected, only a true god would be able to...

357
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,820
go against him in the Four Continents and Three Realms.

358
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,970
It is quite a heavy burden to be shouldered by you.

359
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,703
It's…

360
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,900
Dad, rest assured. I promise.

361
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,150
The Devil Lord will never be resurrected.

362
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,940
<i>Although Tantai Jin's evil bone has been extracted,</i>

363
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,380
<i>the identity of the demon fetus is still highly sensitive.</i>

364
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,580
<i>It would be best to inform them</i>

365
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,210
<i>only after I have truly destroyed the evil bone.</i>

366
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,470
<i>It's just my practice of the Heartless Path is too…</i>

367
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,580
Junior Brother Cang, why are you here?

368
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,860
I have come to ask you for a favor today.

369
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,410
I'm all ears.

370
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,860
Actually, I was born in Jing Kingdom 500 years ago.

371
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,060
When I was young, I was loathed by my father

372
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,780
and bullied by others.

373
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,590
I had never felt the warmth of this world...

374
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,500
until a girl suddenly came into my life one day.

375
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,180
At first, she kept saying that she wanted to kill me.

376
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,140
But she saved me repeatedly.

377
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,970
It was she who showed me the joy

378
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,010
and warmth in life, as well as the pain,

379
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,910
the sorrow, and all the beauty that comes with it.

380
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,753
Later,

381
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,190
she told me that she liked me.

382
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,030
I was over the moon at that time.

383
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,160
It would be perfect if time was frozen...

384
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,210
at that moment.

385
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,170
<i>[Spirit is Clear as Water]</i>

386
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,660
Who was that girl?

387
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,220
Her name was Ye Xiwu.

388
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,023
Sadly,

389
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:40,180
I made an irreparable mistake.

390
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,850
She died because of it.

391
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,830
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

392
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,090
Please accept my condolences.

393
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,240
I originally wanted to...

394
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,690
die with her.

395
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,960
But someone told me

396
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,360
that there was a Nether River in this world that converged the souls of the three realms.

397
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,910
In order to see her again,

398
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,410
I found the Nether River

399
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,300
and searched for her for 500 years.

400
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,560
Every day, my flesh and bones were scorched by the Ruo Water,

401
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,030
and the pain was unbearable.

402
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,880
Later on, I couldn't feel the pain anymore.

403
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,890
I felt that I was no longer alive.

404
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,500
Even so, I still couldn't locate her soul.

405
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,580
What happened after that?

406
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,180
Until one day,

407
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,510
I felt that I was about to die.

408
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,940
Fortunately, Immortal Zhaoyou saved me.

409
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,930
I became a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect.

410
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,930
That was what I'd gone through over the past 500 years.

411
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:10,530
Junior Brother Jiumin, why are you telling me all of this?

412
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,600
The Nether River didn't help me to find Ye Xiwu.

413
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,580
However, I read about a Soul-Gathering Array that could help me find Ye Xiwu's soul.

414
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:30,490
However, this array requires the blood of a pure-spirit body as a primer.

415
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,090
Miss Li, can you help me to locate my beloved?

416
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,520
If I do find her,

417
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,990
I am willing to give everything I have...

418
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,260
to make it up to her.

419
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,793
Even if she wants my life,

420
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,030
I will give it to her.

421
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,880
I can't help you. She has already passed away.

422
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,330
Since you've changed your name and started anew,

423
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,640
why not forget about past events completely?

424
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,480
The Ye Xiwu in your heart no longer exists.

425
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,630
She no longer exists?

426
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,870
What do you mean by that?

427
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,570
You have the same face and the same temperament.

428
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,620
Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal, you are Ye Xiwu.

429
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,200
Why don't you dare to admit it?

430
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,050
Do you know something?

431
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,960
You don't even dare to look at me.

432
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,860
Have you heard of Zhuangzi's Dream of the Butterfly?
<i>(The dreamer dreamed of himself to be a butterfly that he couldn't tell who he was.)</i>

433
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,693
What?

434
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:56,920
You can think of Ye Xiwu as that butterfly.

435
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,760
Everything is but a dream.

436
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,130
When you wake up, it should all be dispersed.

437
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,193
Dispersed? How?

438
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,130
It's been 500 years.

439
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,680
I have never forgotten about her.

440
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,960
I have seen her smile and cry.

441
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,600
She hugged me and protected me.

442
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,920
She loved me and hated me.

443
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,930
Even if this is really just a dream, how can I easily wake up from it

444
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,310
if you abandon me in the dream?

445
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,310
I don't understand what you are saying.

446
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,660
I have woken up from my dream.

447
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,230
It has nothing to do with me whether you wake up or not.

448
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,380
Tantai Jin,

449
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,880
if you really wish to make amends,

450
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,960
you should forget about the past and be Cang Jiumin.

00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,300
I am too ashamed to see anyone now.

516
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:23,510
When can you bring me glory like Cang Jiumin and Gongye Jiwu did?

517
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,480
I want to be like them, too.

518
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,400
But I'm not as gifted as them.

519
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,070
You always tell me to work hard.

520
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,340
But why don't you work hard to give birth to a kid like them

521
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,690
if you're that capable?

522
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,730
Nonsense!

523
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,480
You!

524
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,040
Kneel and reflect upon your actions for 24 hours!

525
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,700
<i>Cang Jiumin, </i>

526
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,200
<i>just you wait!</i>

527
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,960
<i>I'll destroy your reputation</i>

528
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
<i>sooner or later.</i>

529
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,060
So, Cang Jiumin and you knew each other 500 years ago.

530
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,010
You two were even a couple in your mortal life.

531
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,940
The reasons behind it are complicated.

532
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,290
Please forgive me for not being able to explain it to you.

533
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,670
In short,

534
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,220
Cang Jiumin was a part of the tribulation in my past life 500 years ago.

535
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,820
No wonder you have been melancholic ever since you came out of the retreat.

536
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,130
It felt like you changed.

537
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,913
Senior Brother, I don't want to deceive you.

538
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:55,080
What happened between Tantai Jin and me is now in the past.

539
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,640
But after reuniting with him,

540
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,590
I realize...

541
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,580
that even if we can't continue our past relationship,

542
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,610
there is no room...

543
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,810
for anyone else in my heart.

544
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,063
Susu, you are telling me this just to…

545
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,880
Because if I continue to be indecisive,

546
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,130
I will only feel more sorry to you.

547
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,980
I understand now.

548
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,363
Susu,

549
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,620
you don't have to feel guilty.

550
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,940
I failed to realize it earlier as I was not thoughtful enough.

551
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,750
That caused you to suffer alone for a long time.

552
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,120
Although I am not willing to give up,

553
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,220
no matter what,

554
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,230
I hope you can find happiness

555
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,220
according to your heart's desire.

556
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,570
It is not easy to move on from someone.

557
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,400
Give me some time.

558
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,310
In the next few days,

559
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,070
I will ask Master for permission to leave the sect to catch demons.

560
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,640
I hope that when I see you again,

561
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,000
I will be able to face you with an open and calm heart.

562
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,450
And be your Eldest Senior Brother.

563
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,460
Eldest Senior Brother…

564
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,110
Get some good rest.

565
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,860
I'll make a move first.

566
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,860
<i>I'm sorry, Eldest Senior Brother.</i>

567
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,110
<i>A quick decision may incur short-term pain but will save you from long-term suffering.</i>

568
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,760
<i>This is the best choice for you and me.</i>

569
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:09,780
<i>If you really wish to make amends, you should forget about the past</i>

570
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,550
<i>and be Cang Jiumin.</i>

571
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,280
<i>As for me,</i>

572
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,290
<i>I am Li Susu, daughter of Sect Leader Qu.</i>

573
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,980
<i>Now that the Devil Lord is about to descend upon the world.</i>

574
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,700
<i>I have decided to pursue the Heartless Path</i>

575
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,160
<i>for the rest of my life and eradicate evil in order to uphold justice.</i>

576
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,230
<i>It's the Devil Lord again?</i>

577
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,030
<i>When the demon fetus reappears</i>

578
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,320
<i>and the devil artifacts find their owner,</i>

579
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,510
<i>the Devil Lord will be resurrected.</i>

580
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,630
<i>The three realms will face destruction by then.</i>

581
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,230
<i>I heard that the battle of Barren Abyss happened</i>

582
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,360
<i>because Siying and Jingmie, the two remnants of the Devil Lord,</i>

583
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,020
<i>lost the demon fetus.</i>

584
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,840
<i>That's why they wreaked havoc everywhere.</i>

585
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,030
<i>They're trying to find the fetus through the guidance of the devil artifacts.</i>
