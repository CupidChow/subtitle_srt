It has been a few days since we met. You have found yourself a job?

27
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,420
It's all because of that stupid Tantai Jin.

28
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,510
- He insisted on making me his maid.
- Hey!

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,030
She was a very picky young girl.

36
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,420

My precious Little One, you must have endured a lot of hardships out there.

You mean this? It's nothing.

61
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,260
Don't worry. I am doing fine.

I was just putting on an act.

63
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,020
Tantai Jin insisted on making me come out of retirement.

64
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,140
I told Zeyu to report to him that I was injured

65
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,930
and that I could only lie in bed and drool all day long.

66
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,410
I acted like I was paralyzed.

67
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,460
Anyway, I won't come out of retirement anytime soon.

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,730
I did not need to tell you all of that. You must be starving.

Come. Let's have our meal.

- Come. Come
- Don't forget. You should tell your grandmother and me

72

Father, you were a mighty general back then.

77
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,650
But now, you are sitting idly by in our mansion wasting the rest of your life away.

<i>I do not want people to criticize me after my death.</i>

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,290
You are a grown-up and are tall and imposing.

92
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,723
What's wrong?

93
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:56,270
Don't tell me you cannot survive without your grandmother and father.

94
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,410
My parents chased me out of the house right after I acquired my form.

95
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,940
There's nothing to cry about.

96
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,850
I didn't cry.

97
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,070
You look even worse than crying.

98
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,260
Enough already. I have finally returned to the wonderful capital.

99
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,460
I am in a great mood today.

100
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,360
Why don't we take a walk together?

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
What do you think? The night market in the capital of Jing is just as good as the ones in Sheng Kingdom. Right?

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
Let's head there.

103
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,460
Please take a look. Top-quality fabric for sale.

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,560
Mister, what about buying one for your wife?

105
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,390
She…

106
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,970
He is a dummy.

107
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,090
I shall pick one on his behalf.

108
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,170
I assume these fabrics were woven with Sheng Kingdom's way of weaving. Am I right?

109
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,040
That's right. Madam, you have sharp eyes indeed.

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,160
Many refugees from Sheng Kingdom came to our capital.

111
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,070
They wove these fabrics.

112
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:03,390
Look. Although His Majesty is decisive, he is a benevolent ruler.

113
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,430
Some of the refugees lost their homes because of the war.

114
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,220
But more of them came here as they were unsatisfied with

115
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,930
<i>[Recruitment]</i>
the Sheng Kingdom's strict political regiment.

116
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,121
His Majesty has already issued an order to treat the prisoners of war nicely and help the refugees out.
<i>[Grain Mill]</i>

117
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,930
They were taught how to read, write, and weave so that they could make a living.

118
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,560
<i>Excellent!</i>

119
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,710
You are worried that you have made the wrong choice.

120
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,960
In my opinion, you do not need to feel this way.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,460
After all, you know better than anyone else

122
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,160
how tyrannical the ruler of Sheng Kingdom is.

123
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,890
Once Jing Kingdom wins the war,

124
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,340
the lives of the people of Sheng Kingdom will only get better and better.

125
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,760
I only decided to settle down here because...

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
His Majesty wasn't a bad person.

127
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,050
Thank you, mister. Take care.

128
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,180
So, for generals like you who had surrendered to him,

129
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,440
maybe His Majesty will let you marry an official's daughter

130
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,290
when you contribute to the kingdom and make him happy.

131
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,980
Thank you. I have finally seen the light.

132
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,130
I spent a lot of my time trying to convince you,

133
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,960
yet you always dwell on the same thing.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,180
But you were enlightened right away when I mentioned someone's daughter, huh?

135
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,290
Wait, no, I…

136
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,770
Enough. I was just trying to help a fellow colleague clear their doubts.

137
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,220
Foxes like us are loyal friends.

138
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,870
I heard that a group of acrobats from the Sheng Kingdom is performing in front.

139
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,170
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.

140
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,850
<i>Xiwu, there are conflicts everywhere.</i>

141
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,840
<i>Men like them have no choices.</i>

142
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,600
<i>Between you and Bingchang, one married Tantai Jin,</i>

143
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,650
<i>the other Xiao Lin.</i>

144
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,620
<i>You guys have no choice but to wander.</i>

145
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,990
<i>Your father could not cope with that fact.</i>

146
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,670
<i>Now that I have reached a certain age, I have straightened out my thoughts.</i>

147
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,200
<i>I just hope that the younger generations like you all</i>

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,870
<i>can stay safe.</i>

149
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,570
I never expected our family to reunite in Jing Kingdom.

150
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,820
Eldest Sister is the only missing member now.

151
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,610
I hope Xiao Lin can protect her and not let her suffer any grievances.

152
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,300
Miss, you are worrying too much.

153
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,460
Even if Prince Xuancheng is gone, plenty of men will

154
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,110
protect Eldest Young Miss.

155
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,820
Hey, why do you always sound so jealous when we talk about my eldest sister?

156
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,250
Did she offend you?

157
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,550
Is it her fault for being likable?

158
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,250
Eldest Young Miss wasn't this popular back then.

159
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,650
However, the number of admirers has increased considerablyin the past few years.

160
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,810
I just thought it was strange.

161
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,423
Is that so?

162
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,813
Second Sister.

163
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,130
Eldest Brother, is Father asleep?

164
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,460
It has been a long time since our family was this happy.

165
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,650
You have no idea.

166
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,220
Our trip here was hectic.

167
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,540
Aunt and the maids were scattered as they escaped for their lives.

168
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,060
The soldiers of the Sheng Kingdom were on our tails.

169
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,120
It was excruciating.

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,800
However, we were lucky that Tantai Jin dispatched a group of soldiers to escort us.

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,070
That was how we were able to survive.

172
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,170
He gave us this mansion, too.

173
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,160
So, Tantai Jin escorted you guys here?

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,980
That's right. Our family would have been massacred

175
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,950
if we had to rely on that petty Xiao.

176
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,480
He also had the imperial physicians treat our grandmother and father,

177
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,650
but Father drove them away.

178
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,900
But in the past, you used to hit and scold Tantai Jin, and I often bullied him too.

179
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,140
However, he didn't retaliate against our family.

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,850
Why is he being like this?

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes. Why?

182
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,320
Girl, where are you going?

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Taking a stroll in the palace.

184
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,170
<i>Moreover, on my journey I had encountered many civilians, </i>

185
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,290
<i>and they don't care about what the ruler's surname is.</i>

186
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,790
<i>They simply go wherever there is a livelihood.</i>

187
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,960
<i>You have great governing skills, </i>

188
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,150
<i>Not only do I like you and want to follow you, </i>

189
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,900
<i>but everyone else likes you and wants to follow you, too.</i>

190
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,900
<i>I have also experienced the humiliation</i>

191
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,720
<i>of being dependent on others.</i>

192
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,770
<i>If I can prevent the people from experiencing such suffering, </i>

193
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>as a ruler, I would be satisfied with my work.</i>

194
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,490
Your Majesty, Maid Ye is here.

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,490
Let her in.

196
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,923
Yes.

197
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,280
Why aren't you bowing when you come to see the king?

198
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,240
Tantai Jin, thank you.

199
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,770
For what?

200
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,390
Thank you for the surprise you gave me, for treating my family well,

201
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,220
and for providing a way out for my brother and his subordinates.

202
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,130
Easy for you to say.

203
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,463
What?

204
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:10,670
Are you just going to say thank you and move on?

205
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,643
Is that enough?

206
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,620
- You…
- You asked me to show more gratitude than just words.

207
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,020

You should go back to go to bed.

217

What's wrong?

218
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,730
Don't you have to wake up for duty tomorrow morning?

219
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,770
No problem, Your Majesty. Leaving now.

Ye Xiwu,

224
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,450
I've never seen you so happy before.

225
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,310
You are happy because of your family, but not me.

226
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,430
Is that right?

227
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,310
I…

228
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,500
I guessed so.

229
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,770
In fact, you don't have to go to such lengths

230
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,440
to please me by enduring

231
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,180
hardships and humiliations for them.

232
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,620
<i>My spike...</i>

233
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,663
Leave!

234
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,440
Don't bother me anymore.

235
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,100
I said, get out of here!

236
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,100
<i>Men's hearts are so unpredictable.</i>

238
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,720
<i>or how guarded he is, </i>

239
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,110
<i>I cannot give up.</i>

240
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,650
<i>Why did I throw a tantrum last night?</i>

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,620
<i>Ye Xiwu's reunion with her family brought her joy, </i>

242
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,240
<i>and wasn't that what I wanted to see?</i>

243
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,820
<i>Even if the reason for her joy was not related to me, </i>

244
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,620
<i>why would I…</i>

245
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,530
From Shangyuan City to Kou City.

246
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,690
Have you kept that in mind?

247
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,023
Yes.

248
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,933
Baiyu, I remember that you have a mother and a sister

249
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:19,350
at your home in the Yiyue tribe. Right?

250
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
You should go home and visit them.

252
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,693
You Majesty, do you not need me anymore?

253
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,920
That's not what I mean.

254
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,490
I'm just allowing you to take leave and reunite with your family,

255
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,780
or if you prefer, you can bring them back to Jing Kingdom.

256
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,100
From now on, all Moonshadow Guards will have the same privilege.

257
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,930
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

258
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,860
I'm just not sure why

259
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,720
you suddenly became interested in this matter.

260
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,830
<i>Thank you for treating my family well.</i>

261
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,680
No reason. You are excused.

262
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,243
Yes.

263
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,943
Family…

264
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,340
Ye Xiwu, you are now a maid to His Majesty.

265
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,920
There are so many rules and customs in the palace.

266
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
Have you learned them all?

267
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,350
And how do you have time to read novels?

268
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,020
I don't want to learn. I can't remember anything.

269
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,780
These rules are nonsense.

270
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,290
No talking, no moving, no burping, no farting.

271
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,790
I have more important things to do.

272
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,410
What things?

273
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,950
Making Tantai Jin fall for me, of course.

274
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:45,880
- Don't tell me that you are reading romance novels for…
- Of course!

275
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,350
I have memorized all the lines of the stories,

276
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,450
so you can wait and see me perform perfectly.

277
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,210
What is that ugly thing?

278
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,260
This is the wishing lantern I personally made.

279
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,740
Would you like to release it together tonight?

280
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,080
Wishing lantern?

281
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,450
Is it some kind of psychic sorcery?

282
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
Not sorcery.

283
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,440
It's a romantic gesture.

284
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,850
Just imagine. Two people releasing lanterns together under the moonlight,

285
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,020
making wishes and watching the lanterns slowly disappear into the night sky

286
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,580
while silently hoping for a bright future and expressing their feelings for each other.

287
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,450
It's so beautiful.

288
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,970
In other words, it's useless.

289
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,763
Right?

290
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,580
Nian Baiyu,

291
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,450
drag her out.

292
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,083
Yes.

293
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,030
Second Young Miss, this way please.

294
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,670
<i>Young Devil Lord, I have been here playing for 6 hours,</i>

295
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,550
<i>so please come and talk to me.</i>

296
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,570
<i>I can chat so much with you, from sentimental things to life philosophy.</i>

297
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,680
<i>Hurry up.</i>

298
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,170
What?

299
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,610
His Majesty complains that you are too noisy,

300
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,690
and you have been constantly playing off-key.

301
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,110
If you still haven't played enough,

302
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,130
I will send you out of the city so you can play until dawn.

303
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,080
You can come back after you have had enough fun.

304
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,890
No need. I'm done.

305
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,323
Bye.

306
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,700
Your Majesty, the morning drizzle is cold.

307
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,270
Shall we go back?

308
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,240
You've been standing here for a long time.

309
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,190
It will be time for the morning court soon.

310
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,350

311
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,773
Your Majesty.

312
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,403
Nothing.

313
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,360

Tantai Jin, who do you think you are?

324
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,170
Just because you're a ruler of a country

325

with the power of life and death and good looks,

326
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,240
you think you can be arrogant and controlling?

Shut your mouth!

1,300 catties of green grass, and 500 catties of dry hay.

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,640
However, there have been two brawls that occurred.

349
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,590
How did you deal with the demon beasts involved in the brawls?

350
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,680
They refused to change their behavior, so I ate them.

351
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,140
Great.

352
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,560
This month, you can forget about having days off.

353
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,880
Tantai Jin... why are you so inhumane?

354
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,290
What? Do you want to disobey my orders?

355
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,740
Tantai Jin, you are the ruler of the country, and the whole of Jing is yours.

356
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,130
You don't need to rest, but we staff need it!

357
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,380
I've been working without rest for 80 days!

358
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,440
It's only 80 days. Calm down.

359
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,930
I have an opportunity just for you.

360
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,340
Go deal with the demons on the west end,

361
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,580
and then I'll give you half a day off.

362
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,800
We demons have dignity, too.

363
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,910
You're expecting me, a demon, to catch other demons?

364
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,550
You're now a leader of Jing guiding the Firewing Army.

365
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,240
You're responsible for protecting the people.

366
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,370
Understand?

367
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,100
Yes, Tantai Jin. Loud and clear.

368
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,630
I'll be on my way.

369
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,860
You better keep your word. Half a day off.

370
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,910
Write your report once you're done. Run along now.

371
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,030
Just you wait. I'll escape as soon as I get the antidote.

372
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,380
It's been 80 days?

373
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,953
Sister Fox!

374
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,610
W-Why are you sneaking around?

375
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,480
You scared me!

376
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,680
Sister Pian Ran, my dear friend, I've tried all the tricks in the book.

377
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,930
Can you teach me a couple more?

378
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,480
Those tricks should be enough for you to deal with His Majesty.

379
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,150
Just repeat them again and again.

380
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,920
It's not enough! I want him to really like me.

381
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,070
How real?

382
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,880
At least his heart to flutter for me nine times.

383
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,250
What a specific number of times.

384
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,880
I just want him to like me more.

385
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,830
Better yet, fall in love with me.

386
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,680
Come on, Sister Pian Ran. Help me out here.

387
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,240
You really want to learn from me?

388
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,310
Then we'll need some real moves!

389
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,110
- General Ye.
- Ah!

390
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,590
P-Pian Ran…

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,420
There's a bug on your ear.

392
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,430
I'll help you blow it away.

393
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,710
Okay, it can't hurt you now.

394
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,563
You can go.

395
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,720
See? That's how men are like.

396
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,060
You get up close to them, and their brain freezes.

397
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,533
I'll pass.

398
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,720
Tantai Jin might feed me to the tigers.

399
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,950
You won't take my advice?

400
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,350
Well, it's your loss.

401
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,040
Come on. Help me come up with something else, please?

402
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,880
Xiwu, what are you the least good at?

403
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,290
What am I the least good at?

404
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
I'm the least good at…

405
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,780
I'm really bad at cooking.

406
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,650
Yes, that's it!

407
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,910
Let me tell you. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

408
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,620
You can just cook for him.

409
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Even dogs won't eat what I cook.

410
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,670
It's not about the taste, but your heart.

411
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:33,600
You must feed him with your own hands, every day, every meal.

412
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
That will double the results with half the work.

413
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,500
And the worse it looks and taste, the better.

414
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,590
Are you serious?

415
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,740
Have I ever lied to you?

416
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,090
Go on, get to it! I'm a busy woman you know.

417
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,320
Tantai Jin, I finally found someone to get back at you.

418
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,170
Wickedness befalls the wicked.

419
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,470
Wait till you get a taste of Ye Xiwu's awful cooking.

420
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,763
Baiyu.

421
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,950
What does this character mean?

422
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,120
It's pronounced as "tao", to describe river surging water.

423
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,730
Baiyu, why don't you go get some rest?

424
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,240
What "Huh?" Just go.

425
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,873
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,930
What are you reading?

427
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,270
An ancient book of the Yiyue tribe.

428
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,450
No wonder. I can't read a single character of it.

429
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
What are you doing?

430
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,650
This character looks so strange.

431
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,370
It's like a worm crawling out from the earth.

432
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,170
What does it mean?

433
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,250
It means to sprout.

434
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
What about this one?

435
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,033
To smelt.

436
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,960
And this one? Kill two birds with one stone?

437
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,653
It means…

438
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,470
It means…

439
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,440
You don't know either?

440
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,270
Should we get Nian Baiyu to come back?

441
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,720
I think he might know better.

442
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,473
It means "love".

443
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,440
Oh, that's it?

444
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,860
What's there to be shy about?

445
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,520
What are you doing here at night?

446
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,140
Can't I come just to see you?

447
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Are you hungry?

448
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,370
Get out.

449
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,210
Come on, at least take a bite.

450
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,300
I spent so much time and even burned my hand.

451
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,920
Ye Xiwu, serves you right.

452
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,300
Don't cook if you can't.

453
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,290
But I want you to like me.

454
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,420
Give it to me.

455
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,250
This is the first time I actually cooked for someone.

456
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,000
I hope you won't mind my lack of experience.

457
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,560
I'm sure I'll improve with practice.

458
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,480
Does it taste really bad?

459
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,580
Not really…

460
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,730
<i>Looks like I screwed up again.</i>

461
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,590
<i>I need to try something else.</i>

462
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,020
Just spit it out.

463
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,360
I won't cook anymore.

464
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,380
Why?

465
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,500
Why won't you cook anymore?

466
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,660
Persistence makes the man.

467
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,423
Besides, I don't think it tastes that bad.

468
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:12,000
<i>Fox was right.</i>

469
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,190
<i>The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.</i>

470
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,960
<i>It worked just like magic.</i>

471
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,260
<i>He can't even taste how awful it is.</i>

472
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,730
If you like, I can cook for you again tomorrow.

473
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,243
Sure.

474
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,990
Here are two more dishes. Try them.

475
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,260
Maybe you'll like them better.

476
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,900
<i>The Soul-Slaying Teardrop is heating up.</i>

477
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,560
<i>Sister Fox wasn't lying after all.</i>

478
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,440
I'll leave you to it then.

479
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,860
<i>If there's a will, there's a way!</i>

480
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,410
<i>I will definitely be able to gather all the spikes I need.</i>

481
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Your Highness, this is the demonic core just crafted by our warlocks.

482
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,183
Your Highness!

483
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,160
Why is it so easy for Tantai Jin to refine demonic core,

484
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,210
yet so difficult for me?

485
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,250
Perhaps we are simply built differently from one another.

486
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,100
But Your Highness is as much a mortal as Tantai Jin is.

487
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
You're no different in nature.

488
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,960
So…

489
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,320
If Tantai Jin can master the Firewing Army, then so can I.

490
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,250
Fu Yu, pay a visit to our allies for me.

491
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,220
Allies?

492
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm not the only one

493
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,670
who wants Tantai Jin dead.

494
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,910
Don't give yourself away since Emperor Sheng is already suspicious.

495
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,990
General Ye, I know that when I was a hostage in Sheng,

497
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,280
Xiao Yi was often paranoid and distrustful of others.

498
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,400
He even distrusted Xiao Lin, his only legitimate son.

499
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,670
The Sheng Kingdom has suffered heavy casualties since the beginning of the war.

500
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,930
Xiao Yi must be feeling extremely anxious by now.

501
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,130
If I push him further now, he will be determined to exhaust his troops

502
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,630
and become a burden to Xiao Lin.

503
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,870
Am I despicable for doing so?

504
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,760
All is fair in war.

505
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,040
The sooner we end the war,

506
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,700
the sooner the people of both kingdoms can live in peace.

507
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,010
General Ye, since you grew up in court,

508
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,700
who do you think is the far superior between the Sheng's princes

509
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,170
and me?

510
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,460
Feel free to speak at ease.

511
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,040
In terms of strategy and wisdom,

512
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,840
Your Majesty is inferior to none.

513
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,300
But since Xiao Lin and his brothers have been educated well by knowledgeable scholars,

514
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,560
Your Majesty may be inferior to them...

515
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,980
in terms of state affairs.

516
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,210
Nian Baiyu.

517
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,600
At your service.

518
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,250
Summon all great scholars in the nation

519
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,980
to give me lessons starting tomorrow.

520
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,460
Your Majesty, these old scholars have served the Jing nation all their lives.

521
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,770
They can be obstinate.

522
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,670
I'm afraid they won't come.

523
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,720
Those who disobey shall be sentenced to death.

524
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,360
Your Majesty, are you absolutely certain?

525
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
Only to scare them.

526
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,370
Will do.

527
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,300
If there are no objections, let the lessons begin.

528
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,130
Your Late Majesty!

529
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,940
Your Late Majesty!

530
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,770
I've been faithful all my life, yet I shall lose my loyalty today!

531
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,960
I would rather die than be dishonorable!

532
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,090
Are you okay, sir?

533
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,840
Your head certainly is hard.

534
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,090
You must have mastered the Iron Head.

535
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,770
Nian Baiyu, serve the gentlemen some refreshments.

536
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,230
We can start classes once this gentleman has cried enough.

537
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,750
Tantai Jin! You vicious monster!

539
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,690
You've oppressed the loyal commoners, murdered your brothers, and taken innocent lives!

540
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,560
You are an outrage to the gods and people!

541
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,010
Heaven forbid!

542
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,040
Well said. Well said indeed.

543
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,500
If what you say is true that I am so unfaithful, unfilial,

544
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,830
ungrateful, and unrighteous, then maybe you should educate me

545
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,780
and make it a great achievement

546
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,040
to pass on to your descendants.

547
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,750
Y-You… You make my blood boil!

548
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,920
What should we do?

549
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,060
I'm so infuriated I could die!

550
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,030
We've let His Late Majesty down.

551
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,480
Y-You're angering me to death.

552
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,820
<i>From the emperor to the masses,</i>

553
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,160

<i>If the root is ungoverned, all of which that follows shall be chaos.</i>

<i>Resentment by whom respect is shown and respect by whom resentment is shown</i>

556

<i>can never cease to exist.</i>

557
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,180
<i>Our ancestors who illustrated virtue throughout the kingdom,</i>

558
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,820
<i>had to first govern their own states.</i>

559
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:30,960
<i>In order to govern a state, they first had to manage well their homes.</i>

560
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,080
<i>In order to manage their homes…</i>

561
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,163
I'm sorry!

562
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,710
Why are you stopping? Go on.

563
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

564
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,490
<i>- From the emperor to the masses,</i>
- You too, continue.

565
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,510
<i>if the root is ungoverned, all of which that follows shall be chaos.</i>

566
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,300
Watch it.

567
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,180
His Majesty's work relief policy is simply wonderful!

568
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,880
Now the king and his ministers' policies are in good order.

569
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,770
His Majesty merely applies what he learns immediately.

570
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,710
<i>Before, Tantai Minglang's severe laws</i>

571
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,380
<i>made the people boil with resentment.</i>

572
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,260
<i>Now they've been abolished by Your Majesty's order.</i>

573
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:32,100
<i>His Majesty has decreed that as the neighboring nations of Jing and Sheng...</i>

574
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,110
<i>were once unified with the same streets and the same writing,</i>

575
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,860
<i>yet due to the tyrannical rule in Sheng today their people have taken refuge in Jing,</i>

576
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,170
<i>local officials must welcome the refugees kindly without exceptions.</i>

577
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,320
<i>Anyone from Sheng can settle down in the Jing.</i>

578
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,170
<i>May our kingdom be in peace and stability!</i>

579
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,640
Tantai Jin! You've gone too far!

580
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,280
I will make you pay!

581
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,780
Your Majesty, a woman has presented a token.

582
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,110
She has a proposition for Your Majesty.

583
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,940
This pattern of the three-legged Golden Crow is the symbol of the Jing's royal family.

584
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,680
Let her in.

585
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,770
Your Majesty.

586
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,460
Tantai Minglang has lost his power.

587
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,260
What can he do for me?

588
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,680
Has Your Majesty ever heard of the puppeteering spell?

589
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,020
My master has mastered the craft of building a puppet army.

590
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,730
All we need now is men.

591
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,580
What we have most in Sheng are men.

592
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

593
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,920
In time, I guarantee this puppet army

594
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,720

597
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,660
Tantai Jin has been working so hard lately.

598
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,960
He toils away from day to night.

599
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,780
Even the clothes on his body have become loose.

600
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,210
I should make more good food to replenish his energy.

601
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,030
Tantai Jin.

602
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:41,970

612
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,880
I knew it. It's useless for you to dangle in front of him like this every day.

613
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,360
From tomorrow on, you can just stay away from him.

614
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,810
That's how men are. If you ignore him, he will care for you more.

615
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,860
Will I seem mean for that?

616
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,010

I certainly don't mean it.

620
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,170
But I have to make him like me. The more, the better.

632
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,440
And when can I have that half-a-day off?

633
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,150
I call you here today to consult you about something.

634
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,020
If you well answer it, you can have a day off tomorrow.

635

Okay, spit it out.

636
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,580
In this world, what can make you feel so embarrassed?

637
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,440
Go ahead and say it.

638
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,460
Ye Xiwu hasn't served me for two days.

639
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,210
Oh? You miss her?

640
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,880
Ye Xiwu is a royal maid and is fed by the court.

641
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,840
Shouldn't she fulfill her duties?

642
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,760
Then you should reach out to her, not me.

643
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,970
I'm off, and I'm busy.

644
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,703
Halt!

645
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,590
She told me a few days ago that she likes me.

646
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,460
That's why she cooked for me day after day.

647
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,840
Now since she's been absent,

648
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,640
does that mean she doesn't like me anymore?

649
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,950
Very likely.

650
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,900
I thought… I thought she liked being around me.

651
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,350
My god.

652
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,340
You bad men…

653
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:47,840
You men are just too self-absorbed, aren't you?

654
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,273
Let me ask you.

655
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:54,520
If you want her to be like a mom who likes you and serves you every day,

656
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,390
then what have you done for her?

657
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,730
What gifts have you given her?

658
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,430
How many sweet words have you expressed to her?

659
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:06,380
See? This is the problem.

660
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,510
But there is always a way out.

661
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,970
So, what should I do?

662
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,760
If she isn't pursuing you, you can pursue her. Right?

663
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,080
Don't you really like her?

664
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:30,210
