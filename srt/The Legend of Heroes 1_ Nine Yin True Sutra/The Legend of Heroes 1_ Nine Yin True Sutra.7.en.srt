Xuanfeng?

Xuanfeng?

00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,808
Xuanfeng?

00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,296
Xuanfeng!

00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,720
Xuanfeng?

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,776
Xuanfeng?

12
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,656
Xuanfeng.

13
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Why would you do that?

14
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,919
I just fell asleep.

15
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,479
Must be overexerting in training.

16
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,968
Don't lie to me.

17
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,479
You took arsenic.

18
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,159
I...

19
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,152
I'm using it to boost

20
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,719
my internal strength.

21
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,120
Taking arsenic to boost

22
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,439
internal strength?

23
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,759
It's all about the Nine Yin True Sutra.

24
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,599
So you've been taking arsenic recently?

25
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,680
Any mistake could cost you your life.

26
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,120
I just want you to know,

27
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,464
for you,

28
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I would do anything.

29
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,912
Xuanfeng.

30
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,879
Thank you for everything.

31
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
I possess nothing of value,

32
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,440
and you can take

33
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,104
whatever you desire.

34
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,280
But I just want

35
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,479
to revenge.

36
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
You misunderstand me.

37
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,720
This isn't as dangerous as you imagine.

38
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,839
With proper application

39
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,920
and precise dosage,

40
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,839
one can rapidly

41
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,759
boost internal strength

42
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,160
without causing bodily harm.

43
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,120
Through recent experiments,

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,199
I know

45
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,319
the proper arsenic dosage.

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,199
I'll take it with you.

47
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
Why are you here again?

48
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
Don't exert yourself.

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Master is in seclusion.

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,720
What if you trigger premature labor?

51
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,848
My Lady.

52
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,839
I must write down
Nine Yin True Sutra once more.

53
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Only it can save Yaoshi.

54
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,968
My Lady.

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,592

56

57
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,280
My Lady!

58
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,040
Save the child.

61
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,240
Save the mother or the child?

62
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,800
Mother.

63
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,784
Yes.

64
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,439
Save the child.

65
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
My time is limited.

66
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Save the child.

67
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Try standing up.

68
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,680
Slowly.

69
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,376
Try again.

(when a daughter is born,)

00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,639

(would Huang Yaoshi)

83
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,399
(exist then?)

you've recovered.

93
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,360
Nine Yin True Sutra is amazing.

94
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,136
From now on,

95
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,759
we may start practicing

96
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
advanced techniques.

97
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,799
The martial arts recorded

98
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,856
are numerous.

99
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,000
Where shall we begin?

100
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,960
I've studied it.

101
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,512
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw,
Heart-Breaking Palm,

102
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,112
and White Serpent Whip.

103
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,240
These three require
no foundation of mental method.

104
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,656
We can master them fast.

105
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,519
However, cultivating these techniques

106
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
demands an unorthodox method.

107
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,759
Unorthodox method?

108
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
I thought you feared nothing.

109
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,720
Seems I was wrong.

110
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Why brought me here?

111
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,944
Ghosts!

112
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,032
Not funny.

113
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
The sutra says,

114
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,600
those practicing
the Nine Yin Skeleton Claw

115
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,480
focus all internal strength
on ten fingers,

116
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,519
to grasp hard objects.

117
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,392
Human skulls are the optimal.

118
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
If one pierces holes on them
without fracturing them,

119
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,159
then one masters

120
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,336
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

121
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,279
I brought you here

122
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,399
because we need skulls.

123
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,976
(Living in Drunken Haze)

124
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,224
Beautiful.

125
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,039
Who is there?

126
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,496
Identify yourselves!

127
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
Our identities don't matter.

128
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,599
You two

129
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
provoked Yunhai Manor.

130
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,839
Now there's a 100-tael bounty

131
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,319
for your heads.

132
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,440
So you're Qiu Yunhai's lapdogs.

133
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,440
A 100-tael bounty?

134
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,072
Let's see if you

135
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,160
are capable to get it.

136
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,240
What a sinister technique!

137
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,720
No wonder you are here for skulls.

138
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,448
You've been tracking us?

139
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,759
Using skulls for practicing.

140
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,519
Must be up to nothing good.

141
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,960
Kill Mei Chaofeng.

142
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,839
Xuanfeng.

143
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,039
Why my Nine Yin Skeleton Claw

144
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,880
works well against torsos and limbs,

145
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,640
yet my energy flow

146
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,799
gets obstructed

147
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,136
when striking heads,

148
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,319
causing me stuck?

149
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:29,799
The human skull

150
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,200
is the hardest armor,

151
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
and the hardest part to break through.

152
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,839
You're still new to it.

153
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,319
It's normal to find it hard.

154
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,079
But when I practice with skulls,

155
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,720
why energy flows smoothly?

156
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,496
Perhaps

157
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,960
because they are lifeless objects,

158
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,880
while living foes reinforce with qi.

159
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,680
Though your control

160
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,799
remains imperfect,

161
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,079
your current progress

162
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,576
is already remarkable.

163
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,519
I must practice harder

164
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,039
to achieve breakthrough.

165
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,000
No.

166
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,032
Haste breeds failure.

167
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,504
Breakthrough requires

168
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
patience and opportunity.

169
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,240
Just recuperate for now.

170
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,519
Don't rush.

171
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,944
I have an idea.

172
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,640
I'll take you out to relax.

173
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,208
Come take a look.

174
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,408
Do you like it?

175
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,640
I know nothing of art.

176
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,640
But I think Lingfeng might like it.

177
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,119
Let's buy it for him.

178
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,279
Mister.

179
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,344
We'll take this painting.

180
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,880
Alright.

181
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,359
This Go set for Chengfeng.

182
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,759
This silver scale

183
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,152
for Mianfeng.

184
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,359
Mofeng loves mechanisms.

185
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,559
This turtledove

186
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,592
will suit him well.

187
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,079
Madam must look good

188
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,144
with it.

189
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:15,520
(Variety Store)

190
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,016
This longevity locket...

191
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
When we return,

192
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,400
the child of Master and Madam

193
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
must have been born.

194
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,119
It's a perfect gift.

195
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,368
(Sun's Tailor Shop)

196
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,960
To boost internal strength

197
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,839
with drugs bears hidden costs.

198
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,640
Will it heal?

199
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,744
Unless

200
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,759
we cease practicing.

201
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,880
We can't.

202
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,160
Even if we

203
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,519
offer these gifts as an apology,

204
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,680
will they forgive us?

205
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,319
We're just deceiving ourselves.

206
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,759
Don't ladies adore such things?

207
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,519
Yet you never use them.

208
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,599
I don't know how.

209
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,088
I can help.

210
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
As a child,

211
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,160
I saw Mother apply makeup

212
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,480
and picked up basics.

213
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,039
(So it was him playing the flute)

214
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,559
(on Taohua Island that lulls me)

215
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,119
(to sleep.)

216
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,880
Back on Taohua Island,

217
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,359
I never knew you could play the flute.

218
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,039
Xuanfeng.

219
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
Tomorrow we'll seek
revenge against Qiu Yunhai.

220
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
I'll make you dumplings.

221
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,784
What filling do you like?

222
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,952
Well...

223
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm fine with anything.

224
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,839
Then we'll use whatever we have.

225
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,720
Go get some fresh vinegar.

226
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,352
Xuanfeng.

227
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
We're also out of ginger.

228
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,599
Buy some.

229
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,968
Xuanfeng.

230
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,272
Xuanfeng?

231
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,792
Cousin.

232
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:22,680
(Chen Zhihe of Yingchuan)
Long time no see.

233
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,559
Are you alone?

234
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,560
As you see.

235
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,400
You used a secret code.

236
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,856
What's the matter?

237
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,680
Lu Chengfeng sent a letter to the Chens,

238
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
saying you stole
Nine Yin True Sutra with Mei Chaofeng

239
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,680
and betrayed them.

240
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,560
Is that true?

241
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,359
I didn't betray them.

242
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,920
So the theft did happen.

243
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,896
In that case,

244
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
our elders

245
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,279
have a message for you.

246
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:53,248
(Chen)
Heed the command.

247
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,920
Kill Mei Chaofeng immediately

248
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,359
and return with the Nine Yin True Sutra.

249
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,799
What do they want it for?

250
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,200
Rumors say

251
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,119
the Nine Yin True Sutra
has supreme techniques.

252
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,279
Master it and one'll be invincible.

253
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,480
Our clan isn't a martial arts sect.

254
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
Why meddle in it?

255
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The clan wants

256
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,680
to master various techniques,

257
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,640
hoping to

258
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,519
restore our former glory.

259
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,799
That's why they sent you to Huang Yaoshi

260
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,800
back then.

261
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,519
It can't restore the family's glory.

262
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
The elders have their own calculations.

263
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,039
As the young master,

264
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,200
you must obey.

265
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,559
Unless you've forgotten

266
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,759
our family teachings and the cause.

267
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,888
Or rather,

268
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,640
you no longer consider yourself a Chen.

269
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,360
I haven't forgotten.

270
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,960
Let me think about it.

271
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,336
Wait for my news.

272
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,799
I'll come for it tonight.

273
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,279
(Heed the command.)

274
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,480
(Kill Mei Chaofeng immediately)

275
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,920
(and return
with the Nine Yin True Sutra.)

276
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,119
(Xuanfeng)

277
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,680
may appear

278
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,119
unrestrained,

279
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,000
but deep down,

280
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
(he carries
an unresolved burden from the past.)

281
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,680
(He's one of the Chens of Yingchuan.)

282
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,279
(After their decline,)

283
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,400
(the family hoped he)

284
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,839
could restore its past glory.

285
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,119
Xuanfeng believes

286
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,119
this is but a pipe dream,

287
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,119
destined to vanish.

288
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,640
Yet in reality,

289
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,359
he can't fully let it go.

290
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,799
(Unless you've forgotten)

291
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,880
(Chen)
our family teachings

292
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,168
and the cause.

293
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:36,279
I haven't forgotten.

294
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,312
Let me think about it.

295
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,640
Everything's ready?

296
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,928
You bought wine?

297
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
And the outfit you liked.

298
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,808
Let's eat.

299
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,840
Tomorrow,

300
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,240
we'll set off to Yunhai Manor.

301
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,519
We've been waiting so long.

302
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,384
We deserve a toast.

303
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,279
The two of us drank cup after cup

304
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,640
among the blooming mountain flowers.

305
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,920
I'm already drowsy from drinking,
and you can leave.

306
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,279
Come back with the qin tomorrow morning.

307
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,519
After we left the island,

308
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,680
I thought

309
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,799
to follow you

310
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:00,759
wherever you go

311
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,599
all my life.

312
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,839
Master once told me

313
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,119
not to fear forgetting.

314
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,119
With no one or nothing else

315
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,416
deserves remembering,

316
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,160
then you won't forget.

317
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,039
He was right.

318
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,008
Chaofeng.

319
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,120
What do you mean?

320
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,504
Xuanfeng.

321
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,519
Thank you for

322
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,584
being with me.

323
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,312
Without you,

324
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,319
I couldn't have obtained the sutra,

325
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,752
healed my legs,

326
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,359
or learned Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

327
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,480
Sadly,

328
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,400
it remains incomplete.

329
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,839
But that's okay.

330
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,440
It's enough to kill

331
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,976
Qiu Yunhai.

332
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,024
- Chaofeng.
- Xuanfeng.

333
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,079
I haven't finished.

334
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,680
Thank you for accompanying me this far.

335
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,839
I'll walk alone

336
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,359
in the future.

337
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Don't follow me anymore.

338
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,759
Chaofeng.

339
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,920
You're abandoning me?

340
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,000
Since I met Master

341
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,128
and you,

342
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,039
this journey has felt

343
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,200
like nothing's changed,

344
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,079
yet everything has.

345
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,079
Life can never be smooth.

346
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,119
Just go all out in everything.

347
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,080
Xuanfeng.

348
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,680
You deserve your own path.

349
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,279
Anyway,

350
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,040
thank you.

You won't see him again.

372
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,280
He has

373
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,920
gone to Taohua Island

374
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
for years,

375
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,639
and we knew

376
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
he'd achieve nothing.

377
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,119
If he obtained the Nine Yin True Sutra,

378
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,679
I would kill him

379
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,719
for the Chens.

380
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,280
The Chens

381
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:30,760
must never

382
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,960
be destroyed by him.

383
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,719
Now you killed him first.

384
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,440
Saves us the trouble.

385
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,664
Mr. Chen.

386
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,320
Stop wasting time.

387
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,119
Mei Ruohua,

388
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,159
be smart

389
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,800
and hand over the Nine Yin True Sutra.

390
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,408
You've been watching me?

391
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,559
Wouldn't dare.

392
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,159
She's cunning.

393
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,679
You're being frank.

394
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,960
And I feared you might

395
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,312
make a mistake.

396
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,136
Chen Zhihe.

397
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,760
You've allied with Qiu Yunhai?

398
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,400
None of your business!

399
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Hand over the sutra!

400
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,559
Those who side with Qiu Yunhai

401
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,888
deserve death.

402
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,519
Want the Nine Yin True Sutra?

403
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,679
Pay with your life!

404
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:53,920
Chen Xuansheng.

405
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,199
You'd betray the Chen family

406
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,880
for this woman?

407
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm not Xuansheng,

408
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,239
but Xuanfeng.

409
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,119
You!

410
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,039
I achieve nothing.

411
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,679
I've been abandoned by you all.

412
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,760
The Chens

413
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,559
must never be destroyed by me.

414
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,536
I heard everything.

415
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,856
Zhihe.

416
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,119
Go home.

417
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,888
You're helping him?

418
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,800
He rejects me,

419
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,079
but he's still my blood.

420
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,599
Then you're my enemy.

421
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,559
No more excuse.

422
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:54,880
Chaofeng.

423
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,968
You've broken through.

424
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,688
Zhihe.

425
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,920
Just go.

426
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,880
From now on,

427
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
I sever ties with the Chen family!

428
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,096
You...

429
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
You dare defy us?

430
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,039
Traitor!

431
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,408
Xuansheng.

432
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,599
We've allied with Yunhai Manor.

433
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,079
With Yunhai Manor's support,

434
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,400
we now have the Jurchens.

435
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,679
We will

436
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,519
soon restore former glory.

437
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,280
Don't be foolish!

438
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,400
What did the Chens want in exchange?

439
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,920
Kill Mei Chaofeng and obtain

440
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,000
the Nine Yin True Sutra.

441
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,920
Zhihe.

442
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
One last chance.

443
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,168
Zhihe,

444
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,504
leave now.

445
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,039
I advise you

446
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,239
to stay away from Qiu Yunhai.

447
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,840
Otherwise,

448
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,960
I won't hold back.

449
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:22,360
Xuanfeng.

450
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,239
Enough.

451
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,632
Tomorrow,

452
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,584
Yunhai Manor.

453
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,312
(Yunhai Manor)

454
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:42,679
Manor Lord Qiu, congratulations.

455
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,808
Thank you.

456
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,312
Manor Lord Qiu.

457
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,624
May you enjoy longevity.

458
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,808
Thank you.

459
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,719
Manor Lord Qiu, congratulations.

460
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,559
Welcome! Please come in.

461
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,752
Manor Lord Qiu.

462
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,000
Congratulations.

463
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,928
Long time no see.

464
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,079
Pleased to meet you.

465
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,144
Pleased to meet you.

466
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,599
Thank you for coming

467
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,800
to my birthday banquet.

468
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,719
Today, heroes are gathered here

469
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,400
to discuss great matters.

470
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,360
As martial artists,

471
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,079
we should be chivalrous

472
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
and concern the people.

473
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,079
I, Qiu Yunhai,

474
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
will dare what others shun

475
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,599
to support the Jin forces.

476
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,760
So I want to discuss with you all

477
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,440
how to support the Jurchens

478
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,880
in stopping
the imperial northern campaign

479
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,159
and ensuring peace for our people.

480
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,480
Well said!

481
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,519
Manor Lord Qiu
is courageous and righteousness,

482
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,440
setting an example for us all.

483
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,599
We follow Manor Lord Qiu's lead,

484
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,079
to stop the imperial northern campaign!

485
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,159
What?

486
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,960
You're all treacherous villains!

487
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,119
I thought

488
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,320
it's for against the Jurchens.

489
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,840
Instead,

490
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,360
it's a gathering

491
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,079
of lowly and treacherous

492
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,119
beasts...

493
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,776
This person

494
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,920
is an imperial spy,

495
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,280
spreading lies among us!

496
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,599
Don't mind it.

497
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:15,968
Please continue.

498
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,639
We follow Manor Lord Qiu's lead,

499
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,960
to stop the imperial northern campaign!

500
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,360
We follow Manor Lord Qiu's lead,

501
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,639
to stop the imperial northern campaign!

502
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,760
Everyone,

503
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,639
today,

504
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,719
we shall

505
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,760
all ally

506
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,039
and strategize here!

507
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,519
Those who comply prosper.

508
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,639
Those who defy perish.

509
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,264
Qiu Yunhai!

510
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,480
You collude with enemies

511
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,320
for glory, shameless!

512
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:51,599
Today

513
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,639
marks your demise!

514
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,608
Mei Chaofeng.

515
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,119
You're like a haunting ghost!

516
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,679
Today,

517
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,039
you'll leave here in a coffin!

518
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,199
Qiu Yunhai.

519
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,320
You ungrateful monster

520
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,639
murdered my parents.

521
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,079
Today,

522
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,480
I'll avenge them!
