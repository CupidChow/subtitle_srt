00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:12,679
(Liubo Island)

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,880
This island is really strange.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,520
There's no one

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,359
or a bird in sight.

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,640
There's something you don't know.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,879
This is one of

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,519
the volcanic islands in the East Sea.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,879
Lava eruptions
leave no vegetation alive.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,199
Its Master Xue Qingyi
keeps a low profile.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,039
Few hear about him.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,359
You're pretty knowledgeable.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,880
This place is quite peculiar.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Stay alert.

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,679
I feel someone's been following us.

15
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,799
From the moment we landed,

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
we've been trailed.

17
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,608

00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,208
(Xue Qingyi, Master of Liubo Island)

22
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,080
Are you really

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
disciples of Huang Yaoshi,

24
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,599
the Eastern Evil from Taohua Island?

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,879
Mr. Xue.

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
We indeed come from Taohua Island.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I have

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,159
long admired Mr. Huang.

29
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,319
Anyway, what brings

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,879
you all here?

31
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,879
We hear Liubo Island

32
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,919
abounds with exotic plants.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,000
We came for a Tinder Flower.

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,159
You're quite well-informed.

35
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,759
The Tinder Flower only grows

36
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,759
on Liubo Island.

37
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,439
However,

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,879
since Mr. Huang wants it,

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,879
I shall present it.

40
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,800
We didn't come in vain.

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
The juice of the Tinder Flower

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
is medicinal.

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,080
The juice should be extracted

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,039
upon the flower blooms.

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,159
The flower will bloom

46
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,520
in two or three days.

47
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,520
You may stay here temporarily

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
and await the blooming.

49
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,600
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,399
We'll trouble you then.

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,879
Take these guests to rest.

52
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,456
- Yes.
- Yes.

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,279
The smell is overwhelming.

54
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,600
I've never seen them.

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,160
It's kind of bleak.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
You guys must be tired from travelling.

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
The food is ready.

58
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,959
Thank you

59
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,439
for your warm hospitality.

60
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,488
(Feng Mofeng)

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
Please enjoy your meal.

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Thank you.

63
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,720
He is so hospitable.

64
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,160
He prepared all this food for us.

65
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,480
Let's...

66
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,848
Chaofeng.

67
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you doing?

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,199
Don't you find this strange?

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,008
Why would he

70
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,839
give us the Tinder Flower freely?

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Because he admires our Master,

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
the Eastern Evil,

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,399
and wants to befriend him.

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,104
You believe whatever he says?

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,519
- That's true.
- Chaofeng.

76
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,952
It's just a flower.

77
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:02,879
Moreover,

78
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,279
no matter what it is,

79
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,920
our Master deserves to have it.

80
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,199
Mr. Xue

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,360
has remained secluded on Liubo Island.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,079
Few hear about him.

83
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,120
But he has no notorious reputation.

84
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,920
Chaofeng,

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,759
you needn't suspect everyone

86
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,160
of being evil.

87
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,279
This world

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,959
is full of hypocritical people.

89
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,439
You haven't encountered them

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,504
because you're lucky.

91
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,720
Once it happens, you'll be doomed.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,959
Stop arguing.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,399
This place is strange.

94
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,519
Stay cautious.

95
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,792
I've tested the food.

96
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:34,639
It's not poisonous.

97
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,560
See?

98
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,519
I was right.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,360
Chaofeng.

100
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,120
Chengfeng, how could you speak
to her like that?

101
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,519
What I said wasn't wrong.

102
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,360
The food was tested.

103
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,360
It's not poisonous.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,639
But some poisons can't

105
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,199
be detected by silver needles.

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,839
We can't be too careful.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Chaofeng's suspicion isn't unfounded.

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,279
I'll go check.

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,279
Why didn't you tell me before?

110
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,560
You didn't ask.

111
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,959
In such a short time,

112
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,360
your martial arts skills

113
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,519
have improved a lot.

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,959
Why are you here?

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't you talk
about my malicious speculation

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,399
with them?

117
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
I agree with your guess.

118
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,839
I don't think Xue Qingyi is a good man.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,199
To gain something,

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,519
you must first give.

121
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,439
If he truly admired our Master,

122
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,360
why hasn't he visited Taohua Island?

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,959
Exactly!

124
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,240
When dealing with hypocrites,

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,519
we can't be too careful.

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,319
Sometimes, naive kindness

127
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,639
could kill us.

128
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,199
They grew up

129
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,519
on isolated Taohua Island.

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,959
They remain simple,

131
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
while you and I have experienced a lot.

132
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,519
You haven't

133
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,920
eaten anything yet.

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm not hungry.

135
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,279
Take this as Chengfeng's apology.

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,199
Don't be angry anymore.

137
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,272
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,048
Slow down.

139
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,279
Slow down, and don't choke.

140
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,000
So annoying!

141
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,679
So, are we eating or not?

142
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,096
Take a gamble!

143
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,919
Perhaps we should take antidotes

144
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,919
before we eat.

145
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,840
It would ensure safety.

146
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,120
Lingfeng, take it.

147
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,240
Are you crazy?

148
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,240
Who takes antidotes

149
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,159
before eating poison?

150
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
In my opinion,

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,799
let's eat without suspicion.

152
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,720
If they think

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,679
we distrust them,

154
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,919
it'll jeopardize our mission.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,919
If we eat

156
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,799
and get poisoned...

157
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,728
Stop arguing!

158
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
We'll eat in turn.

159
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,279
If anything happens,

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,879
someone can assist.

161
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,168
Good idea!

162
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,399
- Me first!
- Me first!

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,159
Fine! You first!

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Let's eat then. No fear!

165
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,272
Go ahead.

166
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,256
Sure.

167
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,536
I'll eat too.

168
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
Why are you staring at me?

169
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,528
Want to escape?

170
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,000
How dare you!

171
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,759
You're doomed.

172
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
Where can you run to?

173
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,039
You'll be Master's slave forever.

174
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,456
Who's there?

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
Two adults bully a child?

176
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,376
Shame on you!

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,039
Thank you so much.

178
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,760
Who are you?

179
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm Feng Mofeng.

180
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,519
Where's your family?

181
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,039
My entire family

182
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,399
was enslaved by the Xue Qingyi.

183
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,559
Later,

184
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,399
they all died horribly as drug testers.

185
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,639
My escape attempts all failed.

186
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,679
Your companions

187
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,799
have been taken as drug testers.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,320
Go save them quickly!

189
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,759
Mianfeng.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Chengfeng.

191
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
Xue Qingyi!

192
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,960
Let us out!

193
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,360
Welcome to my place.

194
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,840
Chaofeng was right.

195
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,360
You're no good person.

196
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
There was clearly no poison

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
in the food.

198
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,720
How did you manage it then?

199
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,559
My Master is known
as the Unorthodox Herbalist.

200
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
He poisons without a trace.

201
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Poisoning food

202
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
is beneath his methods.

203
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
It disgusts him.

204
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,904
Exactly!

205
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
The real poison source

206
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,399
is the Evil Flower.

207
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,159
The meal itself is good.

208
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,720
When combined
with the flower's fragrance,

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,639
(Ancient Herb)

210
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,399
it becomes the most potent drug.

211
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
That's a cheap shot.

212
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,639
You are so despicable.

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,039
My title as Unorthodox Herbalist

214
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
isn't earned through healing the sick.

215
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,399
If you want something,

216
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,559
you must pay the price.

217
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
What do you want?

218
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,159
The greatest poison
lies in mental manipulation.

219
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,559
I'm developing the Emotions Powder.

220
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,879
Anyone poisoned by this,

221
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,559
even the greatest martial masters,

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,519
will fall under my mental control.

223
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,120
This formula
contains 49 toxic ingredients.

224
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,360
These seven poisonous herbs
are just the first layer.

225
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,600
Ordinary people can't even withstand it.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Only powerful martial artists

227
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
can endure it.

228
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,039
Only they qualify to be my drug testers.

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,679
The three of them

230
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,600
are imprisoned in the poison lab
for experimentation.

231
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,960
Mofeng,

232
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
we have to rescue them.

233
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,840
How do we enter that lab?

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The poison lab

235
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,559
is heavily guarded.

236
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,399
It's filled with poison traps inside.

237
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,919
To prevent outsiders,

238
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
apart from Xue Qingyi,

239
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,919
Qinghong and Qingpeng,

240
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
no one can enter freely.

241
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,240
Qinghong and Qingpeng aren't threats.

242
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,519
If we lure Xue Qingyi away
from the poison lab,

243
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,039
we'll be able to save them.

244
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,519
How do we lure Xue Qingyi

245
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,519
away from the poison lab?

246
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,408
If I want to fight,

247
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,840
enemies in defensible places

248
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
will have to take it

249
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,840
when I attack their vital points.

250
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,799
We'll strike where he must defend.

251
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
I thought you were merely

252
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,639
ordinary martial artists,

253
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,159
but I didn't expect

254
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,799
your martial arts

255
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,679
to be so unique.

256
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,159
This makes you

257
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,159
perfect drug testers.

258
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,639
How dare you commit

259
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,840
such heinous acts!

260
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,039
You're unworthy to be a healer!

261
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,559
What are you doing?

262
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,864
- What are you doing?
- Lingfeng.

263
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,120
Lingfeng! What are you doing?

264
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,480
What do you want?

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,320
I haven't felt fear in a long time.

266
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,616
Besides the poison lab,

267
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
what else does Xue Qingyi value?

268
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
Apart from the poison lab,

269
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,624
he values the alchemy chamber.

270
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:55,960
That's where he keeps

271
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,559
his most precious herbs and formulas.

272
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,879
But the alchemy chamber

273
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
is like an iron rampart.

274
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,960
Not even a fly can enter.

275
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,672
Alchemy?

276
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,328
(Ancient Herb)

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,240
One day,

278
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,039
I'll create the most potent poison

279
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,360
in the entire world.

280
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,559
I'll make the entire martial world

281
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,120
submit to me.

282
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:30,840
- Found them?
- No.

283
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:52,960
Take him to our Master.

284
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,176
Yes.

285
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,759
Master, the alchemy chamber is
in trouble!

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,682
The furnace must have exploded.

287
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,159
Master, I've caught a guy.

288
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
The other won't escape.

289
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,120
Take him in first. Guard this place.

290
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
- You guys, come fight the fire!
- Yes!

292
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,840
- You two stay here.
- Yes.

293
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,816
Come on.

294
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,432
Get inside.

295
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,240
My Master's poison lab

296
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,360
is the most secure place in the world.

297
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,919
You want to rescue people?

298
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,879
That's pure delusion.

299
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,000
So what if you saw it?

300
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,159
Do you think you'll leave alive?

301
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,848
Go!

302
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
Are you okay?

303
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,920
Your invention actually worked.

304
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,279
Without getting close,

305
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,504
I blew up the alchemy chamber.

306
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,079
It's simple.

307
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,599
The sulfur and saltpeter

308
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,759
were mixed with charcoal.

309
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's go save them now!

310
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,119
Lingfeng, are you there?

311
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,599
- Can you hear me?
- Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

312
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Lingfeng.

313
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,984
Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

314
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,432
Lingfeng.

315
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,672
Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

316
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:54,160
Chengfeng.

317
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,079
Save them!

318
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,519
Chengfeng.

319
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,279
Mianfeng.

320
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,160
Wake up!

321
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,064
Mianfeng.

322
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,839
Lingfeng.

323
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,960
Mianfeng. Wake up!

324
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:05,184
- Mianfeng.
- Lingfeng.

325
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,240
- Mianfeng.
- Lingfeng.

326
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,744
Chaofeng.

327
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,440
Xuanfeng.

328
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,160
They'll return soon.

329
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,039
We need to leave quickly.

330
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
Come back to rescue them later.

331
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,856
Alright.

332
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Take those drugs with us

333
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,472
in case they harm people.

334
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,624
Let's go.

335
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,128
Go!

336
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,640
Thankfully, you two arrived in time.

337
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680
Otherwise,

338
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,696
we would've...

339
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,672
Chaofeng.

340
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,519
I made a mistake.

342
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,039
I trusted

343
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,559
that hypocritical man,

344
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,960
endangering Lingfeng and Mianfeng.

345
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,880
In the end,

346
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,960
you put aside past grudges.

347
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,759
We're doing what we should.

348
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,079
Fellow disciples are like siblings.

349
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,440
Supporting each other is our duty.

350
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,744
No need to thank us.

351
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
His poison techniques are formidable.

352
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,160
What should we do?

353
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,359
We can't return empty-handed.

354
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,119
Let's eliminate the scum together,

355
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,519
get the Tinder Flower,

356
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,079
and return.

357
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,799
Among them,

358
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,359
only Xue Qingyi uses poison

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,279
in unpredictable ways.

360
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,039
If we can subdue Xue Qingyi,

361
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
success will be ours.

362
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,400
Xuanfeng.

363
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,584
Can you

364
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,200
modify the explosives for close combat?

365
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,079
Well...

366
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,519
Perhaps Chengfeng can do it.

367
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:11,400
Master.

368
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
Found them?

369
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
They are quite cunning.

370
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,039
We've searched the island,

371
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,279
but we found no trace of them.

372
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,240
No boats are missing.

373
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,240
They haven't left.

374
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,039
Search everywhere

375
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,559
to find them!

376
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,792
Attack!

377
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,200
Kill them.

378
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,759
What did you do to them?

379
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,000
I tested

380
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,960
my newly developed poison on them.

381
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,079
Now, their combat power is enhanced.

382
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
They're obedient

383
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,160
and fearless of death.

384
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,000
They're perfect killing machines.

385
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,680
They are your disciples.

386
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,240
They should be proud

387
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,279
of being my drug testers.

388
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,759
You're insane!

389
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,599
For this alone,

390
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,720
you deserve death.

391
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,240
Show me what you've got.

392
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:15,720
A whistle signal!

393
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,799
Their minds are controlled.

394
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,368
Mianfeng, sleeve arrows!

395
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,536
Xue Qingyi escaped.

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Thankfully, we're safe.

397
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,160
We are

398
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,039
finally free.

399
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,160
We'll never be separated.

400
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,920
We must pursue Xue Qingyi.

401
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,472
The Tinder Flower's blooming.

402
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,200
We need to obtain it swiftly.

403
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,799
Is this the Tinder Flower?

404
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,216
Chaofeng, let me do it.

405
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,448
Be careful!

406
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,400
According to my intelligence,

407
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,359
Mount Hua

408
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,799
honors Huang Yaoshi
as one of the Five Greats.

409
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,720
After seeing you all,

410
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,839
I think Huang Yaoshi
is not that powerful.

411
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,519
We play fair

412
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,680
to get what we have.

413
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,559
A sneaky man like you

414
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,240
who uses poison has no right to judge.

415
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,599
You came

416
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
for the Tinder Flower.

417
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,599
Stop pretending to be righteous.

418
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,032
That's the Tinder Flower.

419
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,960
Come and take it yourselves.

420
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,680
This door and lock were crafted

421
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,240
with iron by Feng Asan.

422
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,880
I have the key.

423
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,400
Apart from me,

424
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,799
Feng Asan was the other one
who could open it.

425
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,599
Yet he's already dead.

426
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,640
You'll never get in.

427
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,000
We can't go in, and you can't get out.

428
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Let's see who will win.

429
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,599
The Tinder Flower is blooming.

430
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:46,640
This flower

431
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,200
blossoms once every 19 years.

432
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,000
That's because on my island,

433
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,720
the magma below only surges

434
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
once every 19 years.

435
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,839
Only the intense heat

436
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,799
of this magma

437
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,200
can make the Tinder Flower bloom.

438
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,359
The underground magma

439
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,960
is about to erupt.

440
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,359
You all

441
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,599
either give up the Tinder Flower

442
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,559
and leave immediately

443
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,279
or stay here and await death!

444
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,168
Xue Qingyi!

445
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,319
Open this door if you dare!

446
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,119
Only the area behind this door is safe.

447
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,920
I can open up this lock.

448
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,079
How do you have a key?

449
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
My grandfather gave it to me.

450
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,480
My grandfather was Feng Asan.

451
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,440
He anticipated you'd silence him,

452
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,359
so he secretly made a duplicate for me.

453
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,559
The Tinder Flower is mine!

454
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,824
It's...

455
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,928
Come here!

456
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Oh no! The volcano's erupting!

457
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Reborn through fire.

458
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,400
This is the Tinder Flower.

459
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,599
Give it to me!

460
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,624
Here you go.

461
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,776
Grandfather.

462
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,696
Mother, Father.

463
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,039
I've avenged your death.

464
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Hurry up!

465
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,599
Master's wife can't wait.

466
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,000
- Done. Let's go!
- Go!

467
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:56,440
- Quick!
- Go!

468
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,088
Whose idea was this?

469
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,824
Mine.

470
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,000
Master.

471
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,312
I'm to blame.

472
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,799
It was my idea.

473
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Master.

474
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,559
I led them.

475
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,640
I forced them to go.

476
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,039
Punish me, please.

477
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,000
Master.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
As the first disciple, punish me.

479
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,200
Master, I forced them
to accompany me to Liubo Island.

480
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,296
It's all...

481
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,480
It's all my fault.

482
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,000
Master,

483
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,559
the root cause lies with me.

484
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
I secretly read your letter.

485
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,039
You all stop arguing.

486
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,816
Master,

487
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,720
we were anxious to save Master's wife.

488
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,599
After Mianfeng learned from the letter

489
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,759
about the Tinder Flower,

490
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,319
we all felt

491
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,359
that no matter what,

492
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,720
we should get the flower for her.

493
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,200
Master,

494
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,024
I admit

495
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,039
I had selfish motives.

496
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,440
I thought if I could get this flower,

497
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,776
perhaps you

498
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,279
would personally teach me.

499
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,264
Madam.

500
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,192
I made a mistake.

501
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,680
Please punish me.

502
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,104
Master,

503
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,319
we were in danger

504
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,216
and nearly died.

505
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,519
Chaofeng saved us.

506
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,839
Without her warning,

507
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:13,519
we'd have fallen into Xue Qingyi's trap.

508
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,359
That's true, Master.

509
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,448
If Chaofeng hadn't been alert,

510
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,400
we'd have become drug testers

511
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,544
and died.

512
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,728
Master.

513
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,279
Although Chaofeng is a woman,

514
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,759
her courage

515
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,880
impresses us.

516
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
That's true, Master.

517
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
Chaofeng is amazing.

518
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,680
How did you suspect Xue Qingyi?

519
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,359
You're much better than Xuanfeng.

520
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,248
Wu Mianfeng.

521
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,720
Are you holding a victory celebration?

522
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,560
Master.

523
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,576
Who are you?

524
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,079
I...

525
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,000
Master, he is Feng Mofeng.

526
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,880
Thanks to him,

527
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,440
we came back alive.

528
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
My name is Feng Mofeng.

529
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,519
Sir, please accept me as your disciple.

530
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,119
Call him Master.

531
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,880
Master, please take me as your disciple.

532
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,776
Master.

533
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,344
Master.

534
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,000
Master, Madam has recovered.

535
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,880
What did you say your name was?

536
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,000
Feng Mofeng.

537
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,519
That's good.

538
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,880
No need to change your name.

539
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Why still kneeling? All rise.

540
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:01,599
What does this mean?

541
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,200
He just left us like this?

542
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Has Master forgiven us?

543
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
Master said
he didn't need to change his name.

544
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,208
So?

545
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:11,880
Mofeng's accepted.

546
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Accepted?

547
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,600
Accepted.

548
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,279
Should we keep kneeling?

549
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,839
Rise. It's settled.

550
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,519
I'm a senior now!

551
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,200
- I have a junior now!
- Me too!

552
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,216
- Mofeng.
- Mofeng.

553
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,464
Mofeng.

554
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,720
You're Master's disciple now.

555
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,048
You're now my junior.

556
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:27,000
Really?

557
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
- I have a junior!
- Yes.

558
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm now his disciple?

559
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I have a junior brother!

560
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,240
He

561
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,200
accepted me!

562
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,184
I have a master now!

563
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,576
Chaofeng.

564
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Thank you.

565
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,440
The Tinder Flower

566
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,880
has greatly improved my condition.

567
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,039
Tell me

568
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,359
what you experienced

569
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,519
on Liubo Island.

570
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,039
Nothing, Madam.

571
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,119
I never imagined

572
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,248
that I could

573
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,799
quietly

574
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,160
take a hot bath

575
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,519
like this.

576
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,160
Meeting you all

577
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
must be a blessing from my past life.

578
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,960
To repay your kindness,

579
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,599
even partially,

580
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,319
I, Mei Ruohua,

581
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,000
will do my best.

582
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,599
Mei Chaofeng.

583
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Mei Chaofeng.

584
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,279
Chaofeng.

585
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,799
Let the past

586
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,839
remain in the past.

587
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,440
All previous suffering

588
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
has gone.

589
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,368
Here,

590
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,839
you may allow yourself vulnerability.

591
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,119
Wherever you go in the future,

592
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,239
remember

593
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,239
that the past is false.

594
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,224
There's no end

595
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,440
to memories.

596
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,639
I know

597
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,760
your former home is gone.

598
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,559
But from now on,

599
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,719
Taohua Island

600
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,840
will be your home.

601
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,120
We

602
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
will be your family.

603
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,719
(This attire really suits you.)

604
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
(You're pretty.)

605
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,679
(Dressed like this, you glow brighter.)

606
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,440
(Young ladies)

607
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,079
(shouldn't always fight and kill.)

608
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,480
(Relax properly)

609
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,400
(and dress up.)

610
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840
(Make yourselves radiant.)

611
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,679
(It makes your life much more fun.)

612
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,559
Come on. Cheers.

613
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,440
- Come on.
- Come on.

614
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,312
Bottoms up!

615
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,240
Chaofeng is here.

616
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:16,192
- Chaofeng.
- Come quick!

617
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,639
Come on. Have a seat!

618
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,752
Come on.

619
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
Chaofeng.

620
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,599
You should smile more often.

621
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,679
It makes you look lovely.

622
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,159
Xuanfeng, that's my seat.

623
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,199
- Sit.
- Chaofeng.

624
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,719
We owe our success to you.

625
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,880
Without you,

626
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,920
we might've been dead.

627
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,599
If any of them ever offended you before,

628
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,039
I'll apologize on their behalf.

629
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,320
What are you talking about?

630
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
We would apologize ourselves

631
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,519
if we made any mistake.

632
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,456
We don't need you.

633
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:40,880
Exactly! Come on!

634
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,400
To celebrate our adventure

635
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,400
and narrow escape!

636
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,559
And Master's wife finally

637
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,639
got the Tinder Flower.

638
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,616
Most importantly,

639
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,960
she's recovered.

640
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,039
What's more,

641
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,360
we have a new junior brother!

642
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,800
We also owe thanks to Mofeng.

643
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

644
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,360
- Let's drink!
- Cheers!

645
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,440
Kids shouldn't drink alcohol.

646
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,519
Don't worry.

647
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,440
I can drink.

648
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,320
You can't.

649
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,688
- Just one sip! Please!
- No way.

650
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,280
Getting the Tinder Flower wasn't

651
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,960
just my achievement alone.

652
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,719
Xuanfeng helped greatly.

653
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,199
Lingfeng and Chengfeng

654
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,400
also helped.

655
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
This mission

656
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,480
couldn't have succeeded
without you guys.

657
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,128
Of course,

658
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,400
Mofeng helped too.

659
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,480
It's my pleasure.

660
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,400
Speaking of which,

661
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,760
raise your cup too, Mofeng.

662
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,800
Right!

663
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,776
Chen Xuanfeng.

664
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,599
What's wrong with men drinking?

665
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,880
- Cheers!
- Alright, cheers!

666
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Chen Xuanfeng.

667
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,039
He has water.

668
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,599
- That's not important.
- Let's drink!

669
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,440
You guys,

670
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm so glad to meet you all.

671
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,760
Drink at your pace. I'm finishing mine.

672
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,239
At our pace?

673
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,672
Yaoshi,

674
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,760
look how happy they have been

675
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,000
since Chaofeng came to the island.

676
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,239
Lingfeng never drinks casually.

677
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,599
Normally, he drinks

678
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
- out of jars!
- Exactly!

679
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,024
- Xuanfeng.
- Good.

680
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:58,239
You drink with Lingfeng.

681
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,199
Let's drink out of jars.

682
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,119
We won't drink.

683
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,440
How about you two drink together?

684
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,280
Let's drink!

685
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,639
I just want you to be happy.

686
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,432
That's all I want.

687
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:09,088
Exactly!

688
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:10,788
- Come on.
- Cheers!

689
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,068
Drink up!

690
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:13,568
Let's drink!

691
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,199
Lingfeng, I'll drink with you.

692
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,760
I truly love days like this.

693
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,336
Come on, drink!

694
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,280
Don't blame the kids too much.

695
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,440
Mofeng, come on.

696
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,360
Raise your cup! Drink!

697
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,519
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

698
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,039
- Let's drink!
- Cheers!

699
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:26,976
I don't blame them.

700
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,320
They did it all for you.

701
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,639
Mofeng.

702
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,000
Taohua Island is your home.

703
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:43,639
If anything happens,

704
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,719
come find me or Lingfeng.

705
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,824
I'm also here for you.

706
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,440
You're a big kid now.

707
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,599
Learn to take care of yourself.

708
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,920
Don't worry.

709
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm tough.

710
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
I won't kick off my quilt.

711
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,248
Good.

712
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,720
Go to sleep now.

713
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Let her go!

714
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,599
What's wrong?

715
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,536
What happened?

716
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
Aren't you a tough kid?

717
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,320
You're already a big kid.

718
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,119
Why are you crying?

719
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm not crying.

720
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,272
I'm leaving.

721
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,888
Chaofeng.

722
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,559
Can you sing a song for me?

723
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,639
When there was thunder before,

724
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,920
my sister always sang to me.

725
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,920
That's how I could fall asleep.

726
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,519
Your sister could sing.

727
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,816
But I can't.

What are you doing here so late?

742
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,320
To check on Mofeng.

743
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,800
Are you worried
I can't take care of Mofeng?

744
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,119
I did think that way before.

745
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,448
But now,

746
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,920
I realize how terribly wrong I was.

747
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,200
Chaofeng.

749
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,000
I have to go. Good night.

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,639
the song you sang is lovely.

752
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,504
