1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,280
You scheming viper!

2
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,679
I'll kill you!

3
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,256
(Honey!)

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,408
Honey!

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,000
Let go of them.

6
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,640
How ungrateful!

7
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,879
Mother!

8
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,319
Mother!

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
Mother!

Father.

15

Mother.

16
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,759
I will surely

17
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,080
avenge you both.

18
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Chengfeng, your sword thrust

19
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,400
need to strike fiercer.

20
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,599
You might not take it.

21
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,680
You!

22
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,560
Chaofeng.

23
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,872
Morning.

24
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,879
What are you practicing?

25
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,552
Can you teach me?

26
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
What have you practiced?

27
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,840
Sword dancing.

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
It differs from real martial arts.

29
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
What Lingfeng

30
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,639
and I practice

31
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,680
is real martial arts.

32
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,480
Right.

33
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,984
I want to learn

34
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,879
killing techniques.

35
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,079
What?

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,952
Lingfeng.

37
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,959
Anyone's skilled in music here?

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,376
Music?

39
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
You mean the flute?

40
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,639
Master's flute playing is great.

41
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,208
Master?

42
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,360
Master isn't just
peerless in martial arts,

43
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,496
also versed in astronomy and geography,

44
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,720
Wuxing, Bagua,

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,639
mystical stratagems,

46
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,519
music, chess,

47
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,800
calligraphy, and painting.

48
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,120
Tell me

49
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,680
more about Master.

50
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,800
Actually, he

51
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,279
is quite strict.

52
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,519
No, no.

53
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,639
You're wrong.

54
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,208
Master

55
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,519
is a kind-hearted man.

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
When has he ever been kind?

57
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,279
Master

58
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,279
is just a weirdo.

59
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,720
Nothing.

60
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,839
I said nothing.

61
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Chaofeng.

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,759
Anyway,

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
you'll understand.

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,224
Miss Chaofeng.

65
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,759
You skipped breakfast,

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,168
so I brought you this.

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,800
What did you call me?

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
Miss

69
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,352
Chaofeng.

70
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,879
These pastries

71
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,040
were made by Madam.

72
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,456
You can't buy them.

73
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,439
Look, your face is all red
from the beating.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,656
Brat!

75
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,279
Daring to challenge me?

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,759
You reject proper meals,

77
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,240
so today I'll properly

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
teach you a lesson.

79
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:08,639
Don't move.

80
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,664
Eat it.

81
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,296
Eat it.

82
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,304
Master.

83
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:21,800
Master.

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
- Master.
- Master.

85
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,320
Where's Xuanfeng?

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,424
Xuanfeng...

87
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,376
Xuanfeng

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,920
must sleep in by practicing

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
late last night.

90
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,279
Chen Xuanfeng

91
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,319
practiced late last night?

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,319
He is lying.

93
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,504
Master.

94
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,000
This is a technique

95
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,240
I've developed

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
and practiced.

97
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,568
You've

98
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,040
exhausted your efforts

99
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,480
in slacking off, drinking,

100
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,959
and then developed

101
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,120
such a trick,

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
feeling proud?

103
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,768
Master.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,879
The world holds countless wonders.

105
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,000
Flowers in spring, moon in autumn,

106
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,879
breezes in summer, and snow in winter.

107
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,399
If we focus on practice

108
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,839
and ignore such pretty scenery,

109
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,600
wouldn't that be a waste?

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,128
Exactly.

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,439
This world holds countless wonders.

112
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,199
You have to go see it

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,680
with your own eyes.

114
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,264
Master.

115
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,376
I was wrong.

116
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,264
You weren't wrong,

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,152
but I was.

118
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,016
Taohua Island

119
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,360
is a place of freedom.

120
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,160
Whenever

121
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,000
you wish to leave,

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,000
you may leave at will.

123
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,600
Where is he going?

124
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,279
Won't he teach us?

125
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Class dismissed.

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
That's just Master's way.

127
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:32,440
Alright.

128
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,759
- Master has gone. Get up.
- Don't get Xuanfeng in trouble.

129
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
- Xuanfeng.
- You...

130
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,000
Master didn't tell you to get up.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,240
- Let me get up.
- Kneel longer.

132
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,624
You did that on purpose?

133
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,679
You're the slacker.
What's that to do with me?

134
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
Xuanfeng, take it.

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,679
No. I'm not as obedient as you.

136
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,559
Go find Master at Luori Cliff
if you dare.

137
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,519
I don't dare?

138
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,408
Because of you,

139
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,080
I can't learn from Master today.

140
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,039
Troublemaker.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
Here, troublemaker.

142
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,992
What's wrong?

143
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,536
Master.

144
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,879
I want to learn the supreme technique.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,760
Please teach me.

146
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,480
You must start with basics.

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,399
The basic technique is Bibo Palm.

148
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,840
Xuanfeng masters it best.

149
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,672
Go find him.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,039
I want to learn from you.

151
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,880
Go.

152
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,384
Xuanfeng.

153
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,680
Come to laugh at me?

154
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,559
I'm here to learn from you.

155
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,759
I am a troublemaker.

156
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
How could I teach you?

157
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,039
I offended you earlier.

158
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,799
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,440
Master said

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,799
you master

161
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
Bibo Palm best.

162
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
He

163
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
told me to learn from you.

164
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,720
Xuanfeng, please teach me.

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,480
To learn Bibo Palm,

166
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,679
first sweep all fallen blossoms.

167
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm here to learn from you.

168
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,919
And I'm teaching you.

169
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,080
Under the bodhi tree,

170
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,159
Buddha meditated 49 days,

171
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,240
attaining supreme enlightenment.

172
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,720
Understand?

173
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,624
Sweep properly.

174
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,600
There are more.

175
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,000
Bibo Palm's essence

176
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
lies in these sweeping motions.

177
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,552
Keep going.

178
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,759
Sweep all fallen blossoms.

179
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,000
Patience matters

180
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,519
most.

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,559
You're fooling me!

182
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,720
With such impatience,

183
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,624
how could you learn?

184
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,360
I know you dislike me.

185
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,559
If you don't want to teach me, fine.

186
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why fool me?

187
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Who is it?

188
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,536
Coming.

189
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,519
Is this how you ask me for a favor?

190
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
No time for word games.

191
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
You begged me by day,

192
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,360
yet you make that face now?

193
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,600
Are you from Kuizhou?

194
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,639
How fickle.

195
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,840
What's the matter?

196
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,919
Don't want to learn Bibo Palm?

197
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,679
I don't want to waste my time.

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,759
I'll ask Lingfeng to teach me.

199
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,679
I wanted to give it to you.

200
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,784
Right there.

201
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:10,816
(Bibo Palm Technique)

202
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,399
Fool.

203
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:15,360
(Classic of Filial Piety)

204
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:36,672
(Bibo Palm Technique)

205
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,036
(Bibo Palm Technique)

206
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,664
(Bibo Palm Technique is hierarchical.)

207
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,584
Mei Ruohua.

208
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,880
With your amateur skills,

209
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,039
want to kill me?

210
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,024
Looking to die?

211
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,279
- Chaofeng.
- Chaofeng.

212
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,264
Chaofeng.

213
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,960
Are you okay?

214
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,319
Why can't I get it right?

215
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,960
Don't rush and panic.

216
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,688
Master said,

217
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,119
one must first meditate

218
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
and clear the mind.

219
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,519
With no distractions,

220
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,440
then one can practice.

221
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't rush.

222
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,359
Chengfeng.

223
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,200
You've memorized

224
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,160
Master's words perfectly.

225
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,296
Miss Chaofeng.

226
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,920
You are too rigid.

227
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,160
And you look too stern.

228
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,000
Act casual,

229
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,112
and then

230
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,279
strike as you wish.

231
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,440
Chaofeng, don't rush.

232
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,840
Listen to me.

233
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,039
Relax first.

234
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,359
Don't use brute force.

235
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
You have to be like water,

236
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,240
using the yielding.

237
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,744
Any shortcuts?

238
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
None.

239
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,519
The Bibo Palm may seem simple,

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,039
but every stance and movement

241
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,480
embodies Master's effort.

242
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,880
It's the basic skill,

243
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,519
not something

244
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,799
you can master overnight.

245
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,720
Martial arts practicing requires time.

246
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,240
Every disciple here

247
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,880
starts with the Bibo Palm.

248
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,079
Even prodigies

249
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,200
need at least a year

250
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,240
before learning
other advanced techniques.

251
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,840
And you

252
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,039
might need three years.

253
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll master it

254
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,599
in under a year.

255
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,839
You three, go practice.

256
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,759
Chaofeng, come with me.

257
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
Xuanfeng, come on.

258
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,759
Chaofeng, this way.

259
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:34,880
Chaofeng.

260
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,759
Martial arts practice

261
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,319
is like a tower.

262
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,559
Every level up

263
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,960
is like entering

264
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,440
a new dark room.

265
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,599
This room belongs to you,

266
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,680
yet you don't know it.

267
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,200
Master wants

268
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,599
you to explore it yourself,

269
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,319
bit by bit,

270
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,200
inch by inch,

271
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,039
until every corner

272
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,640
and aspect of the room

273
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,880
is fully understood by you.

274
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,759
Then it belongs to you.

275
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,656
Otherwise,

276
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,799
we're merely

277
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,319
temporary guests.

278
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,079
But Lingfeng,

279
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,960
what if I can't find the clues

280
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
to see the whole room clearly?

281
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,759
The beginning is hard,

282
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,920
so you must devote time

283
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,039
to practice yourself.

284
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,920
Master often says,

285
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,208
enlightenment may come fast,

286
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,279
but skills require time.

287
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,272
Don't rush.

288
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,488
Stop practicing!

289
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,448
We have green mountains
floating on the sea.

290
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,680
If you miss it, then get nothing.

291
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
What do you mean?

292
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,279
Green mountains float on the sea.

293
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,279
She doesn't understand.

294
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,416
Explain it.

295
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,176
Seafood buns.

296
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
Master's favorite,

297
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,720
made by Madam.

298
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
I'll deliver them to him.

299
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,759
Chaofeng.

300
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,839
We haven't eaten yet.

301
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,440
Miss Chaofeng.

302
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,480
I just got these from Master,

303
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,119
and he saved them for us.

304
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Lamb rump,

305
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,656
piglet ears,

306
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,128
calf loin,

307
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,600
and

308
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,599
roe deer leg with rabbit meat.

309
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Got them all!

310
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,759
Only five types of meat,

311
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,079
when chewed together,
they create 25 variations.

312
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,119
25 variations

313
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
match the plum blossom pattern.

314
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,880
We

315
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,000
should give this dish

316
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,759
a proper name.

317
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,759
What's

318
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,319
your suggestion?

319
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,200
Flute Melodies.

320
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,728
Master,

321
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,799
Mianfeng said

322
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,039
this is your favorite dish.

323
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,039
I cooked it for you.

324
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,440
Why did you bring it back?

325
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,176
Chaofeng.

326
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,712
Do you

327
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,759
need something?

328
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,119
Master.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,279
I came to ask you

330
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
how to properly practice the Bibo Palm.

331
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,039
When the petals are dancing,
two are practicing martial arts,

332
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,039
playing the martial arts piece
the Melody of Bihai on the jade flute.

333
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,359
The essence of these

334
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,000
lies in the Bibo Palm.

335
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
The Luoying Sword Palm

336
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,359
and the Melody of Bihai

337
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,240
are all created by your master.

338
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,880
And the Bibo Palm

339
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,039
is the basic technique

340
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,079
of our martial arts.

341
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,656
(Zhuangzi, Dao De Jing)

342
00:23:58,656 --> 00:23:59,520
(Book of Songs)

343
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,279
Zhuangzi, Dao De Jing,
and Book of Songs.

344
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
The martial arts here

345
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,039
emphasize essence.

346
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,119
Before practicing,

347
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,960
first read these books.

348
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,359
It may help you comprehend

349
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,952
the Bibo Palm better.

350
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,104
Thank you, Madam.

351
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,759
I'll finish reading them soon.

352
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,359
It doesn't matter.

353
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,960
What matters is
to understand the essence.

354
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,720
Be agile and free from rigid rules.

355
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
This is the essence

356
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,920
of our martial arts.

357
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,319
Thank you, Master and Madam.

358
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,912
Zhuangzi,

359
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,920
Dao De Jing?

360
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
Why pick these books for her?

361
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,039
You mentioned

362
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
she's overly obsessive

363
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,240
and prone to extremes.

364
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,192
Reading

365
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
isn't just about
teaching her proper conduct,

366
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,440
but also tempering her character.

367
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,192
You

368
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,759
are really thoughtful.

369
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,759
Since she is your disciple,

370
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,519
I must be thoughtful to her.

371
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,160
Senior.

372
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,000
Books!

373
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,920
Hurry.

374
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,264
Blankets!

375
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,839
Do you want to know

376
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,880
why I can master the Bibo Palm?

377
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,088
Yes.

378
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,488
Actually,

379
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,928
there's a shortcut.

380
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,480
After mastering the basics,

381
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
you must venture into perilous places.

382
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,680
Only when in danger

383
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,559
can you understand the essence.

384
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,720
Any places on Taohua Island?

385
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,840
Taohua Array.

386
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,984
Chaofeng!

387
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,016
Madam!

388
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,800
You finally woke up.

389
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,464
Stay lying down.

390
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,120
Xuanfeng.

391
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,960
You failed to protect her.

392
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,799
I...

393
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,888
Madam,

394
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,559
don't blame him.

395
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
I insisted on entering myself.

396
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Xuanfeng, you may leave.

397
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,960
Let Chaofeng rest properly.

398
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,760
Yes, Madam.

399
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,599
Your master

400
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,400
rarely stays here.

401
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,680
Taohua Island stands isolated at sea.

402
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
He fears for my safety,

403
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,960
so set up all these arrays.

404
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,240
You're new here.

405
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,799
Don't wander around alone.

406
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,359
Madam,

407
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,880
actually I knew

408
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,799
about the arrays in the Taohua Grove.

409
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,200
Xuanfeng told me all about it.

410
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,480
Rest assured.

411
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll be more careful.

412
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,720
Madam,

413
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
I must master martial arts.

414
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
What

415
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,839
for?

416
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,279
I've asked

417
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,480
your master this question too.

418
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,319
What did he answer?

419
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,319
He

420
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,039
didn't answer me either.

421
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,000
But revenge isn't the only meaning
of learning martial arts.

422
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,200
You must figure out why you're living.

423
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,640
Sleep now.

424
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Have a good rest,

425
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,480
and everything will be alright.

426
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
What is it now?

427
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,599
I came to ask you

428
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,519
how to master the Bibo Palm.

429
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,360
Look.

430
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,839
What can you see?

431
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,576
Ocean waves.

432
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,119
What can you hear?

433
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
The reefs are weeping.

434
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,920
Why do waves surge?

435
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,240
Why do reefs weep?

436
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,880
I don't know.

437
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,824
Close your eyes

438
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,799
and feel.

439
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,160
Feel the breeze of seasons.

440
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,119
Go with the nature.

441
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,680
Roam beyond worldly cares.

442
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,480
Feel the breeze.

443
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,752
This is

444
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,920
the essence
of Taohua Island's martial arts.

445
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,679
Chaofeng is talented.

446
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,280
She's progressed fast.

447
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,039
We truly underestimated her.

448
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,656
Xuanfeng.

449
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
When we practiced the Bibo Palm,

450
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,840
you were the fastest

451
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,000
among us all.

452
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,440
But you still took a month

453
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,960
to reach such proficiency.

454
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Why compared with her?

455
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,280
She's still way below

456
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
my proficiency.

457
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,360
The Yin poison in Madam's body flares

458
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,039
more frequently.

459
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,199
Every time you use Solar Mantra

460
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,360
to heal her,

461
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,079
you risk losing control.

462
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,159
If it continues,

463
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,312
I fear...

464
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,920
Enough.

465
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,000
Leave.

466
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,776
Yaoshi.

467
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:25,920
Madam!

468
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,384
Madam.

469
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,480
Where's your master?

470
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,152
He told me to stand guard here.

471
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,400
He's preparing your medicine.

472
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,184
Are you feeling better?

473
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,816
I'm okay.

474
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,216
What about him?

475
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,000
Is he okay?

476
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,480
He's perfectly fine.

477
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,320
How could he be not okay?

478
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,679
Good.

479
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,360
That's good.

480
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,719
That's good then.

481
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,208
Master.

482
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,199
Now you know

483
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,519
the invincible Huang Yaoshi

484
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,800
is

485
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,719
merely

486
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,559
a weary,

487
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,639
broken man

488
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
who

489
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,159
refuses to change

490
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,400
like the moon's phases.

491
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,536
Master.

492
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,239
Everyone

493
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,480
has their convictions,

494
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,519
which others may not understand.

495
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,960
But to the one,

496
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,360
they're very important.

497
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,559
Thank you,

498
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,440
Chaofeng.

499
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,760
Madam is the kindest person I've known.

500
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,599
Sometimes she's like a mother,

501
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,800
sometimes a friend.

502
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,760
She's the best person in the world.

503
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,960
Why must she

504
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,639
endure such agony?

505
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,719
The world is ruthless,

506
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,159
treating all beings equally.

507
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,320
Madam has hope!

508
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,119
What is it?

509
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,280
From Baituo Manor.

510
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,760
Why Madam has hope then?

511
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,968
You read the letter?

512
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,960
It isn't sealed.

513
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,144
Who is it?

514
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,715
Ouyang Feng of Baituo Manor,
Western Regions,

515
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:56,559
known as

516
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,728
the West Venom.

517
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,528
(Yaoshi.)

518
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,719
(It's been years
since we met at Mount Hua.)

519
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,000
(I said there's no cure)

520
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,920
(to your wife,)

521
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,119
(making you upset.)

522
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,440
(I deeply regret it.)

523
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:13,480
(Now after searching Western texts,)

524
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,119
(I've finally found a method.)

525
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,559
(The Ninefold Yin Pill)

526
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,679
(contains the most potent Yin poison.)

527
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,079
(To save your wife,)

528
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,239
(Tinder Flower may work.)

529
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,719
Tinder Flower?

530
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,760
Tinder Flower is supremely Yang,

531
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,719
can counteract toxins.

532
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,000
Yet this flower is really rare,

533
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,360
growing only near craters

534
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,480
on Liubo Island, south of the East Sea.

535
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:35,840
(From Ouyang Feng, Baituo Manor)

536
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,704
Liubo Island?

537
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,559
Liubo Island?

538
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,760
Is Chaofeng not coming with us?

539
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,360
I didn't tell her.

540
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,679
Why?

541
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,480
Liubo Island is dangerous.

542
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,920
This is for her safety.

543
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,920
Miss Chaofeng still has injuries,

544
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,360
and shouldn't travel far.

545
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,800
Chaofeng.

546
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,728
Why are you here?

547
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,648
I want to go.

548
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,000
Chaofeng.

549
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,519
Just a trip to Liubo Island.

550
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,760
The four of us are enough.

551
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,079
You need me

552
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,719
for the Tinder Flower.

553
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,719
How dare you say so?

554
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Mind your words.

555
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,719
Pay respect.

556
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:24,880
It'd be better then.
