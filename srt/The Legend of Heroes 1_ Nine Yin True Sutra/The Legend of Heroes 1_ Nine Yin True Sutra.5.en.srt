00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,879
Chaofeng.

7
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,120
Master has reconnected

8
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,080
all your meridians.

9
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,680
Don't be afraid.

10
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,199
My legs...

11
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,039
Your legs...

12
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,159
They are untreatable for now.

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
But rest assured.

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,960
Master will find a solution.

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,599
I'll also help you.

16
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,464
Chaofeng.

17
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Madam.

18
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,408
What brings you here?

19
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,824
Chaofeng.

20
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,039
I know you're upset.

21
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,919
Just let it out and cry.

22
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,240
There is still hope for recovery.

23
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,400
Your Master...

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,759
Your Master will figure something out

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,400
while he is in seclusion.

26
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,400
For now,

27
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
staying calm matters most.

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
Madam.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,639
Stop comforting me.

30
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,639
I'm useless now.

31
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,199
Chaofeng.

32
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,080
Don't worry.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm designing

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
a new mobility device for you.

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
It'll be ready soon.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,879
It'll help you walk just like before.

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,104
Just like before?

38
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,432
Probably...

39
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,808
At least...

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
Maybe...

41
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,120
It'll help you stand

42
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,448
without falling.

43
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll go upstairs to work.

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Chaofeng.

45
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,079
Take care.

46
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,959
With your Master around,

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
there is always hope.

48
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,240
Staying alive comes first.

49
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,288
My Lady.

50
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,280
Rest assured.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,879
Master will be alright.

52
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,439
He overexerted himself

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,000
saving Chaofeng and me.

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,839
You're still sick

55
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,072
and you're pregnant.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,519
You can't be stressed.

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,336
My Lady.

58
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's go back.

59
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,759
Hong.

60
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,560
Prepare some ink and brushes.

61
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,976
Yes.

62
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,632
Drink the medicine.

63
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,959
It'll help you recover.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,600
Your pulse is faint.

65
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,399
Without medicine, you won't...

66
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,352
Medicine won't help.

67
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Why would I live

68
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
if I can't take revenge?

69
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,399
Listen to Madam even if

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,672
you don't listen to me.

71
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,600
Come on.

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,439
If Master can't cure me,

73
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,279
how will medicine help?

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,439
He'll find a way.

75
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
He's weakened.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,759
He'll find a way after his seclusion.

77
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,959
There must be a way.

78
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,800
Chaofeng.

79
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,920
Chaofeng.

80
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,399
It just occurred to me.

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Didn't Mofeng say

82
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
he'd make you

83
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,279
a mobility aid?

84
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Let's check out

85
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,160
his progress.

86
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,144
Okay?

87
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,760
Alright.

88
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,624
Not bad.

89
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,840
Not bad.

90
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
But it's slightly bulky.

91
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,840
We may need to cut the strap.

92
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
It will be much better.

93
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
This side is fixed.

94
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
Chaofeng?

95
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,799
Chaofeng.

96
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,224
- Chaofeng.
- What brings you here?

97
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,392
Well,

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
are you better?

99
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Chaofeng, we're going to help you.

100
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,272
You'll be fine.

101
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,919
Let me perform acupuncture on you.

102
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,840
It may help you recover soon.

103
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Alright.

104
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,976
Chaofeng.

105
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,759
I made this mobility aid for you.

106
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,080
Look.

107
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,919
It may look like a few pieces of metal.

108
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,039
But once completed,

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,960
it will help you walk freely.

110
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,256
Chaofeng,

111
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,120
keep your mind clear these days.

112
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,399
Focus inward

113
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,679
to ward off illness.

114
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,840
Chaofeng,

115
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,159
come regularly for acupuncture.

116
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,759
I promise it'll work.

117
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
She'll recover, right?

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,456
Yeah, she will.

119
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,080
Why are you out by yourself?

120
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,128
Yaoshi.

121
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,679
I want you to read this.

122
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,976
You're pregnant now.

123
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,039
Don't run around.

124
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,440
It's the Nine Yin True Sutra.

125
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,159
I remember Zhou Botong saying

126
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,799
this sutra can counteract
your Solar Mantra.

127
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,279
I wrote it down from memory.

128
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,519
See if it's useful.

129
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,456
After Mount Hua,

130
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,216
this

131
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,039
was entrusted to Wang Chongyang.

132
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,519
I will not read it.

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,279
But Wang Chongyang has passed away.

134
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,200
I know you won't break your oath,

135
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,799
but I don't care.

136
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,279
I only know this sutra

137
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,879
can save my husband.

138
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,279
At least, check

139
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,759
if this sutra can save Chaofeng.

140
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,639
I recall a chapter about bone forging.

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,816
If it works,

142
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
it could ease her mind.

143
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,039
I don't care if this sutra

144
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,399
can save Mei Chaofeng or not.

145
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,279
Never mention this again.

146
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,768
I will seal it

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,559
within the Qingyin Cave,

148
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,960
and no one is allowed to read it.

149
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Nine Yin True Sutra.

150
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,064
Yaoshi.

151
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Is worldly honor

152
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,679
truly worth more than your life?

153
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,248
Fine.

154
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,879
Even if you could

155
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,080
heal without external aid,

156
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,824
what about Chaofeng?

157
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,320
Should we sit and watch her wither away?

158
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,592
I can't

159
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,639
live without you.

160
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,440
I really can't live without you.

161
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,840
I...

162
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
Heaven's way

163
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,480
reduces excess to replenish deficiency.

164
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,808
Thus,

165
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,720
emptiness prevails over substance,

166
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,080
and insufficiency prevails over surplus.

167
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,159
Nine Yin True Sutra

168
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,279
consists of two volumes.

169
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
The volume you've written down

170
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,960
is the second volume
of martial techniques.

171
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,399
No one can practice it

172
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,759
without mental methods.

173
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,120
Even if

174
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,519
these recorded techniques

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,679
could heal Chaofeng's legs,

176
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,600
practicing them without mental methods

177
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,600
would put her at risk
of energy deviation

178
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,519
and make her lose control.

179
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,840
This is poison masquerading as a cure.

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
I've known all along

181
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,799
that this sutra

182
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,360
can't detoxify you.

183
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,720
Otherwise, why would I have

184
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,120
helped Wang Chongyang

185
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,600
while letting you suffer?

186
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
The Solar Mantra

187
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
hurts me.

188
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,160
I know that.

189
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
But you're pregnant

190
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,200
and more susceptible to the toxin.

191
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,000
If Chaofeng hadn't

192
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,399
gotten us into so much trouble,

193
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,600
I might have been able to sustain it.

194
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,056
So you...

195
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,799
At least, we have the second volume now.

196
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,519
However profound this sutra is,

197
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
it was created by a human.

198
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,440
I may be able

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
to deduct

200
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
the mental methods.

201
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,832
It's just that

202
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,320
I need some time.

203
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,960
No wonder you wouldn't
use it to help Chaofeng.

204
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,440
If Chaofeng had

205
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,480
learned about it,

206
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,519
she would have practiced it

207
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
against Heaven's way.

208
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,399
Even if she manages

209
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,480
to master the martial techniques,

210
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,320
she will fall prey to dark arts

211
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,128
and end up

212
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,759
with eternal regret.

213
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:28,240
Chengfeng.

214
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,159
You actually hit me?

215
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,799
Because you've been slacking off.

216
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,919
Rumor has it that

217
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,039
the Nine Yin True Sutra

218
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,879
was stolen by West Venom Ouyang Feng.

219
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,360
The Nine Yin True Sutra

220
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,200
is said to contain

221
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
the ultimate martial arts secrets.

222
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
Our martial arts are formidable too.

223
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,519
The Nine Yin True Sutra

224
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,159
may not beat ours.

225
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,279
But

226
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,759
I can't master our martial arts.

227
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
Our martial arts emphasize

228
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,320
essence over form.

229
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,679
Your senior Xuanfeng

230
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,279
inherited the truest teachings.

231
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,600
Xuanfeng, demonstrate it for Mofeng.

232
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,240
Xuanfeng, come on.

233
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,039
Impressive Luoying Sword Palm.

234
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,152
What brings you here?

235
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,048
Master.

236
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,880
You'll help me,

237
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,352
right?

238
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm working on it.

239
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,200
Do you know of

240
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,119
any martial arts

241
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,880
that could heal my legs in no time?

242
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,400
The Nine Yin True Sutra

243
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,056
cannot.

244
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,960
Why not?

245
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,279
I overheard everything.

246
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,680
Madam said that the chapter

247
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,759
about bone forging

248
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,720
could heal my legs.

249
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,039
I'll say it again.

250
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,079
The Nine Yin True Sutra

251
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,359
won't cure your legs.

252
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,039
You know nothing about

253
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680
the Nine Yin True Sutra.

254
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,016
Never

255
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,039
mention this again.

256
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,352
Master.

257
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,119
I'm utterly useless

258
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,759
like this.

259
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,079
I can't live like this.

260
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Master, please help me...

261
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,464
You should leave.

262
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,232
Chengfeng.

263
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,799
Didn't you get a message?

264
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,920
What does it say?

265
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,648
See for yourself.

266
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,824
What?

267
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,599
Qiu Yunhai destroyed

268
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,759
Chaofeng's family graves.

269
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Qiu Yunhai is a vindictive villain.

270
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,319
Chaofeng narrowly escaped.

271
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,759
This must be his scheme to lure her out.

272
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,400
But she's just starting to recover.

273
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:24,960
If she learns of this,

274
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,039
it might destroy her.

275
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,680
That's why we must keep this from her.

276
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Let's inform

277
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,480
Lingfeng and others

278
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,759
to devise a plan.

279
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,712
Yaoshi.

280
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,496
Yaoshi.

281
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,744
Chaofeng

282
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,079
is so impatient,

283
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,240
asking me to teach her
the Nine Yin True Sutra.

284
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
But that would only

285
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,200
do her harm.

286
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,216
Chaofeng

287
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,599
has suffered greatly.

288
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,279
Had she not insisted on revenge,

289
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
she wouldn't have ended up

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
like this.

291
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,728
I understand.

292
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,319
You never wanted to take her in.

293
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,160
You only accepted her as a disciple

294
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,920
because of me.

295
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,744
Chaofeng

296
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
has truly suffered.

297
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
Is there truly no other way?

298
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,839
The Ninefold Yin Pill.

299
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,000
The Ninefold Yin Pill

300
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,599
can regenerate bones and flesh

301
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,880
and revive the dead.

302
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,279
It's a miraculous cure,

303
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,680
but also a deadly poison.

304
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,440
If she takes it,

305
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,319
she'll end up suffering toxin like me

306
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,240
for the rest of her life.

307
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,599
But this is

308
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,680
the only solution.

309
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's concoct

310
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,519
another Ninefold Yin Pill.

311
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,880
Chaofeng, I'm coming in.

312
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,200
I brought you dinner.

313
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,799
The fish soup is amazing.

314
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,319
Xuanfeng.

315
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,224
What's wrong?

316
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,080
Do you know about
the Nine Yin True Sutra?

317
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,119
Those who obtain it

318
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,616
become invincible.

319
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,839
Heroes gathered

320
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,279
at the Duel on Mount Hua

321
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,616
just for this sutra.

322
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,079
Why are you asking?

323
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,400
The recorded techniques

324
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,519
not only grant people

325
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,839
unmatched power,

326
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,960
but also reforge bones.

327
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,599
Master is hiding this sutra

328
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,160
in Qingyin Cave.

329
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,824
How do you know?

330
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,016
Xuanfeng.

331
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,720
Do you know how

332
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
to break the formation?

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,079
I must obtain that sutra

334
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,600
and reforge my bones

335
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,688
to exact vengeance.

336
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,224
Are you sure

337
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,792
Master has the sutra?

338
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:41,039
Then you should

339
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,000
ask him to teach you.

340
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,488
- How could you...?
- I've tried.

341
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,319
But he wouldn't teach me.

342
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,472
The Nine Yin True Sutra

343
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,079
once stirred up chaos
in the martial world.

344
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
Master must

345
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,519
have his concerns.

346
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,160
Chaofeng, don't act rashly.

347
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,328
Your priority now is to recover.

348
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,319
Other matters can...

349
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,680
But I can't wait anymore.

350
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,039
When I was little,

351
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,279
I saw Qiu Yunhai murder my parents

352
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,839
with my own eyes,

353
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,319
but couldn't stop him.

354
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,079
If I can't avenge my parents,

355
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,279
what's the point of staying alive?

356
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,039
I need the Nine Yin True Sutra

357
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,720
to fully recover.

358
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,720
Then I can kill Qiu Yunhai.

359
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,359
This is my only hope.

360
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,088
Xuanfeng.

361
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,880
Help me.

362
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,008
You're asking me

363
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,440
to betray Master?

364
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,400
I never intended

365
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
to betray Master.

366
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,599
Nor do I want to keep the sutra.

367
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,119
I'll confess to Master

368
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
after I take revenge.

369
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,079
And I will accept

370
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,176
any punishment.

371
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,616
Xuanfeng.

372
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,759
I know this is gravely wrong,

373
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,039
but I have no other choice.

374
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,536
Chaofeng.

375
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,064
How is this different

376
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,160
from betrayal from Master?

377
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
In this world,

378
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,079
we can't always

379
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,079
get what we want.

380
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,640
I was wrong.

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
Forget what I said.

382
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,968
Just leave.

383
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,016
(Ruohua.)

384
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,839
(I'm right here.)

385
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
(It's your birthday.)

386
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,839
(May you enjoy)

387
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,359
(lasting happiness and peace.)

388
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,839
I'll sell her

389
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,079
to the lowest brothels

390
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,720
where she'll suffer endlessly.

391
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,920
I don't care if this sutra
can save Mei Chaofeng or not.

392
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,279
Never mention this again.

393
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,839
(I'll say it again.)

394
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,079
(The Nine Yin True Sutra)

395
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,512
(won't heal your legs.)

396
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,359
(What?)

397
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,319
(Qiu Yunhai destroyed)

398
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,440
(Chaofeng's family graves.)

399
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,656
Chaofeng.

400
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,856
I'll help you.

401
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,288
We revere Master

402
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,759
and honor the Way here.

403
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,648
Stealing the sutra

404
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,799
is a betrayal.

405
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,079
Master will never forgive us.

406
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,960
We must run away.

407
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,279
Have you thought about it?

408
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,464
Yes, I have

409
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,792
and I've decided.

410
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,568
What's your plan?

411
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,599
Aside from breaking in,

412
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,079
there are other things

413
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,279
we need to do.

414
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,456
One more thing.

415
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,544
The boats

416
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,119
were badly damaged

417
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,039
by the hurricane.

418
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,039
We must have them fixed.

419
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,079
And Chengfeng's formation diagram.

420
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
With that diagram,

421
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,960
it will be easy for us

422
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,039
to leave the island.

423
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,784
Chengfeng has always looked out for me.

424
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,480
If I ask him for it,

425
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,519
he'll give it to me.

426
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,216
Done.

427
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,079
Chaofeng.

428
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,039
How are you feeling?

429
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,599
I'm much better thanks to

430
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,648
your treatment.

431
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,000
That's the attitude.

432
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,599
Staying positive

433
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
will help you recover.

434
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,440
Can I really recover?

435
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
All of us will

436
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,039
do our best to help you.

437
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,936
Mianfeng.

438
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,359
You spend day and night

439
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,319
studying herbs.

440
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:27,880
Do you know any anesthetics
without hue or scent,

441
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,599
which are undetectable
even by martial experts?

442
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,839
Why are you asking?

443
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,359
Given my current condition,

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
I want some for self-defense.

445
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,839
Master developed

446
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,880
such an anesthetic long ago.

447
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,599
It has

448
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,160
a remarkable feature.

449
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,799
It's the most efficient

450
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,319
for martial experts.

451
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,279
They regain internal energy
after two hours.

452
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,200
It doesn't work on non-martial artists.

453
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,839
Why haven't I heard of this before?

454
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,880
Because Master believes

455
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,240
those who use poisons

456
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
practice dark arts.

457
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,279
That's why he never used it

458
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,512
after it was invented.

459
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,200
But

460
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,160
I secretly modified the formula

461
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,359
and produced some.

462
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,432
Give me a second.

463
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,440
Chaofeng.

464
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,400
You're injured.

465
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,599
Some anesthetics

466
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,440
might actually keep you safe.

467
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,839
But Chaofeng, don't let Master find out.

468
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,319
Chaofeng.

469
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,519
The mobility aid is ready.

470
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,704
Come try it.

471
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,240
Let me help.

472
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,696
Chaofeng.

473
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,799
Let me help you get up.

474
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,136
Here we go.

475
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,416
Slowly.

476
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,088
Chaofeng.

477
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,592
Chaofeng, are you alright?

478
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,008
I'm fine.

479
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,720
Thank you, Mofeng.

480
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,400
I'll practice a lot.

481
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,904
No matter what,

482
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,759
this is progress.

483
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,599
Lingfeng.

484
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,448
Xuanfeng.

485
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,856
What's wrong?

486
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,960
Chaofeng has been upset.

487
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,960
I want to take her fishing.

488
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,119
But all the boats are damaged.

489
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,400
Could you fix them as soon as possible?

490
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,280
Consider it done.

491
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,680
I'll have them fixed.

492
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,680
I also hope

493
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,599
that Chaofeng

494
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,519
could cheer up.

495
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:26,304
(Harmony Through Yang Energy)

496
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,496
Chaofeng.

497
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:34,720
Chaofeng.

498
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,599
With this diagram,

499
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,799
you won't get hurt

500
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,839
by the mechanisms here.

501
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,784
Here you are.

502
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:42,960
Thank you, Chengfeng.

503
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,200
Don't mention it.

504
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,680
You're my only senior sister.

505
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,968
See you around.

506
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,768
Chaofeng.

507
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,944
The formation diagram.

508
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,240
No one saw you, right?

509
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,936
Right.

510
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,784
Master.

511
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Chaofeng.

512
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,728
Xuanfeng.

513
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll see you later.

514
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,040
Master.

515
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,624
Are you feeling better?

516
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
You must let go

517
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,920
of your obsessions.

518
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,000
Master.

519
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,359
Have you never truly intended

520
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,119
to teach me martial arts?

521
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,119
Haven't I taught you

522
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,200
some of our techniques?

523
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,119
But I'm making so little progress.

524
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,719
Ever since I came,

525
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,079
you've never taught me

526
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,039
any mental methods.

527
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,519
Ever since you came,

528
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,039
I've been constantly

529
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,880
teaching you mental methods.

530
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,079
Like what?

531
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,599
You bring tea

532
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,464
and I drink it.

533
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,360
You bring food

534
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,016
and I eat it.

535
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,552
You bow

536
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,800
and I nod.

537
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,079
Not a single moment passed

538
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,079
without me teaching you mental methods.

539
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,679
Practicing martial arts

540
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,039
relies heavily on understanding the Way.

541
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,639
The Way of cultivation.

542
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,039
You told me to let go.

543
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,880
How do I do that?

544
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,199
Follow your heart.

545
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,840
Set yourself free.

546
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,119
Journey with

547
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,840
the cosmic unfolding.

548
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,000
Maintain ordinary thoughts

549
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,400
without improper desires.

550
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
How did you learn

551
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,840
martial arts?

552
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,400
That's a long story.

553
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,224
It all began

554
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,760
with a special connection.

555
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,159
Like when I met you?

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,360
Your martial prowess

557
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,199
is unmatched worldwide.

558
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,792
Have you let go?

559
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,000
Being the top martial artist

560
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,079
was never my pursuit.

561
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,880
That's not what I meant, either.

562
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,096
Master.

563
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,599
Don't worry about me.

564
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,760
I will get better.

565
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
Chaofeng

566
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,760
has suffered a lot these days.

567
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,880
If it were me,

568
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,752
I'd have given up.

569
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
I was worried that she might despair,

570
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,599
but it seems that

571
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,648
she's doing better.

572
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,280
It's Madam's birthday.

573
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,400
Let's celebrate properly

574
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,079
and cheer

575
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,440
Chaofeng up.

576
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,639
Are you sure about this?

577
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,440
There is no return.

578
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,480
I hope you won't

579
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,960
regret it one day.

580
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,064
I won't.

581
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,840
This anesthetic is undetectable

582
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,079
without hue or scent.

583
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
It works the fastest

584
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,360
on martial experts.

585
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,920
In Mofeng's water, too.

586
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,176
Not bad.

587
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
They've made an effort.

588
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:30,960
The taste is a bit off.

589
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,000
Nice blossom again.

590
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,599
The island will become lively.

591
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,920
How's it going

592
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,039
with Nine Yin True Sutra?

593
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,080
Don't I look

594
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,199
much better?

595
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,400
Master, Madam.

596
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,719
Master, Madam.

597
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,808
Master.

598
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:45,056
- Madam.
- Master, Madam.

599
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,880
Where are Chaofeng and Xuanfeng?

600
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,984
Master, Madam.

601
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,920
Chaofeng and I fetched wine.

602
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,240
Be seated.

603
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:55,840
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

604
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,119
Here, Madam.

605
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,896
Thank you.

606
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,920
- Let me do it.
- Let me do it, Chaofeng.

607
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,760
Let me do it.

608
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
It's fine. I'll do it.

609
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,800
I've got this.

610
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,264
Let me do it.

611
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,639
It's okay. A crash for peace.

612
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,920
It's fine. Let's eat.

613
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:37,920
You've worked hard

614
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,199
these days.

615
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,800
You're

616
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
not only disciples

617
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,440
who make Yaoshi and me proud,

618
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,840
but also family whom we cherish.

619
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,400
Come on.

620
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,519
Let's toast to Master and Madam.

621
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,199
- To Master and Madam!
- To Master and Madam!

622
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,264
- Cheers.
- Wait.

623
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,088
I want to say something.

624
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,000
Taohua Island will always be our home.

625
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:00,199
Master and Madam

626
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,360
will forever be our parents.

627
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,280
- Lingfeng is right.
- Cheers.

628
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,320
Wait.

629
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,239
I'd like to speak, too.

630
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
Master, Madam,

631
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,800
we pledge allegiance to you,

632
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,176
in this life and beyond.

633
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,119
Come on.

634
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,880
Hold on. Let me speak, too.

635
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
We share one breath, one destiny.
We'll never betray each other.

636
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,119
Xuanfeng, say something.

637
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,784
Alright.

638
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,224
Master, Madam.

639
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,480
May your future

640
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,760
be smooth and prosperous
in all endeavors.

641
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
Come on.

642
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,320
Cheers.

643
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
- Come on.
- Come on, cheers.

644
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,352
Wait.

645
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,440
My turn.

646
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,599
May Madam give birth to a lovely baby.

647
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,400
You're the sweetest, Mofeng.

648
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,400
- Come on.
- Cheers.

649
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,768
Wait.

650
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,679
Mofeng, are you going to have wine?

651
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,280
Don't worry, Madam.

652
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,800
Like you, I'm drinking water.

653
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:55,616
Come on.

654
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:56,639
- Come on.
- Come on.

655
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,632
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

656
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,856
This wine...

657
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,599
Why does it feel...?

658
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,032
Yaoshi.

659
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:29,816
