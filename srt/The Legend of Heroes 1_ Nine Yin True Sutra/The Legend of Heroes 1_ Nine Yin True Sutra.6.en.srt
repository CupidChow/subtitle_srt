00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,760
Nine-Square Model,

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,480
patterned after a turtle.

3
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,432
Two and four on the first line.

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,000
Six and eight on the last line.

5
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:26,600
(Formation-Breaking Diagram)
Three on the left, seven on the right.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Nine is above and one is below.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,656
Five at the center.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,840
Xuanfeng, are you alright?

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,200
Master's formation is powerful.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,840
But we're running out of time.

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,008
I'll figure it out.

12
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,392
(Du)

13
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:02,498
(Three lines represent Qian;
six breaks represent Kun)

14
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,096
(Two vertical lines and
one horizontal line represent Zhen and Gen.)

15
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,376
(Li's hollow center, Kan's fullness;
Dui's broken top, Xun's severed base)

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Got it.

17
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,439
(Du)

18
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,280
Let's go.

19
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,799
Life comes from Tai Chi.

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,519
Movement and stillness
form two polarities.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
Three forces, four symbols,
and eight diagrams.

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,480
Five elements, six harmonies,
and seven body parts.

23
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:52,992

28
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,439
Have you decided?

29
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:11,840
Master.

30
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,504
Madam.

31
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,712
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,920
I'll definitely come back.

33
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,520
Master.

34
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,839
What happened?

35
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,519
Someone drugged us.

36
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Madam.

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,936
She's fine.

38
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
She was put to sleep.

39
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Where are Xuanfeng and Chaofeng?

40
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,456
Quick!

41
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,720
- Take her back to her room.
- Yes.

42
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,744
Yaoshi.

43
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Before I passed out,

44
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,680
Xuanfeng attacked my acupoints.

45
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,712
Take her back to her room.

46
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,872
Master.

47
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,384
Lingfeng.

48
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,680
Take them

49
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,399
to find Xuanfeng and Chaofeng.

50
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,280
Lingfeng.

51
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,000
I gave the drug

52
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,480
to Chaofeng.

53
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,279
What do you mean?

54
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
Are you saying

55
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,920
that Chaofeng drugged us?

56
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,680
- Impossible!
- I don't know.

57
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,279
Chaofeng couldn't do such a thing.

58
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,480
Now,

59
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,079
we must quickly find Xuanfeng

60
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,279
and Chaofeng.

61
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,120
(Formation-Breaking Diagram)

62
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,399
- Lingfeng.
- Lingfeng.

63
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,399
Have you found them?

64
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
I searched the island

65
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,759
but failed to find them.

66
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,639
They must have left the island.

67
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,320
The recent strong winds

68
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,399
damaged the boat.

69
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
How did they leave then?

70
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,919
I had someone repair the boat.

71
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,360
One day, Xuanfeng told me

72
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,039
he wanted to take Chaofeng
on a sea trip.

73
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,360
(Formation-Breaking Diagram)
How did you get this diagram?

74
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,679
I gave it to Chaofeng.

75
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,880
This is bad!

76
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,040
Hong.

77
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,080
I have been

78
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,759
having an uneasy feeling.

79
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
I feel something will happen.

80
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,159
Let's go check it out.

81
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,336
You provided the diagram.

82
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
You gave the drug.

83
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,080
I repaired the boat.

84
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
How do we explain this to Master?

85
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
Master.

86
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,320
Master.

87
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,344
Master.

88
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,784
Master.

89
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:02,960
Xue Qingyi?

90
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,872
Hong, are you crazy?

91
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,080
Xue Qingyi! You're alive?

92
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
Sure, I survived.

93
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:07,720
I just saw

94
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,399
your disciples who stole your stuff.

95
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,368
Release her!

96
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,039
Hong is being controlled.

97
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,712
Huang Yaoshi.

98
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,559
Your disciples ruined my plans.

99
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,799
Now, it's time to make it up to me.

100
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,840
Let her go!

101
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,720
(You destroyed my years of work).

102
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,080
(I'll make you)

103
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
(kill each other).

104
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
How did you get this diagram?

105
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,039
I gave it to Chaofeng.

106
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:50,759
This is bad!

107
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,560
Yaoshi!

108
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,000
Huang Yaoshi.

109
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,240
Kill your wife immediately!

110
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,792
Yaoshi.

111
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,399
Don't waste your efforts here.

112
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,879
I've spent half my life

113
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,240
making the Emotions Powder.

114
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,639
It can't be removed

115
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,600
so easily.

116
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,960
Your disciples

117
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
destroyed my poison lab.

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,399
So, the Emotions Powder isn't perfect.

119
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,159
Otherwise, you'll obey me

120
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,559
like them.

121
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,584
Yaoshi.

122
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Yaoshi.

123
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,279
Huang Yaoshi.

124
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,799
To force out the poison,

125
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,399
you recklessly reversed your meridians?

126
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,600
Aren't you afraid of losing control?

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,919
Losing control?

128
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,440
So what?

129
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,440
Yaoshi.

130
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,039
You kill Huang Yaoshi.

131
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,159
Yaoshi.

132
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,856
Yaoshi.

133
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,519
Huang Yaoshi.

134
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,559
You treat them as disciples

135
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
and can't bear to hurt them.

136
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,600
Do they see you as their Master?

137
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
They allied with Mei Chaofeng

138
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,200
to steal the Nine Yin True Sutra.

139
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,480
They feared you

140
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,759
and dreaded your revenge.

141
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
That's why they helped me

142
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,279
infiltrate Taohua Island.

143
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,120
It's to kill you!

144
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,960
You're the best martial artist,

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,919
but so what?

146
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,320
In the end,

147
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,159
they all betrayed you.

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,279
Huang Yaoshi.

149
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,360
You're clever.

150
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
You must've known it.

151
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,879
The drug in the liquor,

152
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,960
the formation-breaking diagram,
and the boat,

153
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
all provided by your disciples

154
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,519
to Mei Chaofeng.

155
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,360
They already betrayed you.

156
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,639
They want you

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,159
and your wife dead.

158
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,639
They want to kill your child.

159
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,679
Yaoshi!

160
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,720
Huang Yaoshi.

161
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,600
They betrayed you.

162
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
They don't deserve to live!

163
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:29,679
No!

164
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,879
Kill them now!

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,096
Don't!

166
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Stop!

167
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,480
The Five Greats mean nothing.

168
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,759
Yaoshi.

169
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,840
The Five Greats mean nothing.

170
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,240
Ultimately,

171
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,120
they will fall under my control.

172
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,152
Yaoshi.

173
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,632
Yaoshi.

174
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,080
Spare me, please.

175
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,240
I have the antidote.

176
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,080
The antidote!

177
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,104
I'll give it to you.

178
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:27,960
Look, spare my life!

179
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,559
I'll give you...

180
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,880
Master.

181
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,839
- Master.
- Master.

182
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,839
- Punish us!
- We made a mistake.

183
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,559
- Punish us!
- Punish us!

184
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,359
Master.

185
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,536
Master.

186
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,839
Master.

187
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,519
Master, please forgive us.

188
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,472
Master.

189
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,599
- Master.
- Master.

190
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Master.

191
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,376
Master.

192
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,032
Master.

193
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,279
Master.

194
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,176
Master.

195
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,440
Master.

196
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,519
- Master.
- Master.

197
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,352
Master.

198
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,960
Master.

199
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,079
Senior, it hurts.

200
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,744
Unexpectedly,

201
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,960
the Emotions Powder
could manipulate minds

202
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,039
so quickly.

203
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,640
Thankfully, Xue Qingyi's dead.

204
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
If this powder

205
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,960
is spread,

206
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
it will surely

207
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,799
cause a catastrophe.

208
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
As the first disciple,

209
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I actually attacked my own Master.

210
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,839
How can I live

211
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,039
in this world?

212
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,680
Lingfeng.

213
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,000
- Let go!
- Lingfeng!

214
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,799
Lingfeng.

215
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,759
It's not your fault.

216
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,240
It's Mei Chaofeng's.

217
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,720
It's Mei Chaofeng's.

218
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,400
It's all Mei Chaofeng's fault.

219
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,119
She cheated Mianfeng

220
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,720
of the drug

221
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
and knocked everyone out.

222
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then she stole

223
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,519
Master's Nine Yin True Sutra.

224
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,416
She

225
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,279
let Xue Qingyi enter Taohua Island,

226
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
nearly killing Master.

227
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
It's all her fault.

228
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,279
It's all her fault.

229
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:27,440
Yaoshi.

230
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,416
Madam.

231
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,160
How is Yaoshi doing?

232
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,279
He is meditating to recover.

233
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,440
What about them?

234
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,960
They are

235
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,839
out of danger.

236
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,576
Master.

237
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
Madam has woken up.

238
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,160
Lingfeng and others...

239
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,519
This incident

240
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,200
was entirely caused
by Chaofeng and Xuanfeng.

241
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,359
Others assisted them, but they

242
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,079
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

243
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,432
Perhaps...

244
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,720
Tell them

245
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,759
to leave here.

246
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,264
Hong.

247
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,920
Master.

248
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,400
How are Master and Madam?

249
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,039
They're fine for now.

250
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,039
Madam is worried about you.

251
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,119
She asked me to see you.

252
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,704
Hong.

253
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,720
Will Master beat us to death?

254
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,592
All this time,

255
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,640
he's been forcing the Solar Mantra

256
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,319
to sustain Madam's life.

257
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,200
When Madam fell
from the cliff years ago,

258
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,200
her meridians and bones were broken.

259
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,519
The Ninefold Yin Pill saved her life.

260
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
After taking it,

261
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,359
she could only
live one or two more years.

262
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,192
If well cared for,
she could live three to five more years.

263
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,440
Since then,

264
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,240
all these years,

265
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,920
Madam has painstakingly
transcribed that manual

266
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,279
to heal Master's injuries.

267
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,008
Unexpectedly,

268
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,960
the traitors Mei Chaofeng

269
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,960
and Chen Xuanfeng stole it.

270
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,279
All these days,

271
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,559
Master has actually been seeking

272
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
a cure for Chaofeng.

273
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,880
What can we do now?

274
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
You're all injured.

275
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,599
Focus on healing.

276
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
With the island's current state,

277
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,759
we can't attend to you now.

278
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,320
Maybe

279
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,920
you should return to the mainland.

280
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,519
Come back after recovering.

281
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,920
We'll discuss

282
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,400
the future later.

283
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,599
I have an uncle

284
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
at Taihu's Qishier Village.

285
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,440
I can recuperate in his place.

286
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
I'll return to Shu.

287
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,759
My parents died there.

288
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,079
Their comrades in arms

289
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,039
should take me in.

290
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,664
Mofeng.

291
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,616
Where will you go?

292
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,400
I don't know.

293
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
Then come with me.

294
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,000
Though my father died,

295
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
but he lived simply,

296
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
and the people he helped

297
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,119
may shelter us.

298
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
We must recover fully

299
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
and return soon.

300
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,552
Lingfeng.

301
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,272
Do you think

302
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
we can come back?

303
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,599
Guest, please sit.

304
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,960
A trayful of buns, please.

305
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,519
Coming right up!

306
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,160
I wonder how things are

307
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,736
on Taohua Island now.

308
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,800
Don't worry.

309
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,519
After you recover

310
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,096
and take revenge,

311
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,680
we'll return

312
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,160
to beg for forgiveness
from our Master and others.

313
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:06,279
I hope

314
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,160
General Zhang

315
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,480
can turn the tide.

316
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,359
He has good military strategies.

317
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,064
He will reclaim our territory.

318
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,359
This time, General Zhang

319
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,599
launched a prepared war.

320
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,680
Your steamed buns.

321
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,440
General Zhang
prioritizes people's safety.

322
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,200
It's truly moving.

323
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,480
Indeed.

324
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,559
The order has arrived.

325
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,599
Order you to rally local forces

326
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,440
to stop martial artists

327
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,160
from joining Song's northern campaign.

328
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,600
Understood.

329
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,200
General Zhang's northern expedition

330
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,839
looks formidable,

331
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,799
but it will likely fail.

332
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,920
You tell the leader

333
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,599
that within this region,

334
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,119
all relevant parties

335
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,559
are under Yunhai Manor's control.

336
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,864
Okay.

337
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,960
By the way,
Mr. Chen's second son is coming soon.

338
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,048
Receive him on my behalf.

339
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,904
- No problem.
- Thanks.

340
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,128
Manor Lord.

341
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,359
Our source

342
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,759
has found Mei Chaofeng.

343
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,312
She's come to the mainland.

344
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,839
Mei Chaofeng?

345
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,440
Mei Ruohua?

346
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,240
I broke her meridians completely.

347
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,440
How is she still alive?

348
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,039
She is alive

349
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,799
and can walk normally.

350
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Did I strike her too lightly?

351
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
Your martial arts

352
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,839
are powerful.

353
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,640
Perhaps Mei Chaofeng

354
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
got help from a master.

355
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,799
She must be targeting me this time.

356
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,759
Don't let her ruin our plans.

357
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,319
To tie up loose ends,

358
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,256
we should...

359
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,200
Killing her now is more difficult.

360
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,256
I have an idea.

361
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,599
Issue a bounty notice

362
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,599
under Yunhai's name,

363
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:41,880
claiming

364
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,440
that Mei Chaofeng broke into the manor,

365
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:44,920
murdered, and stole.

366
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,839
Whoever beheads her will

367
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,160
get 100 taels of gold.

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,984
Understood.

369
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,528
Let's go.

370
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,000
How come there is a fine house

371
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,079
in the remote forests?

372
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,839
An elder of my clan was

373
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,359
in retreat in this place.

374
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,000
He later traveled

375
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,680
and never returned.

376
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,744
Chaofeng.

377
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,600
Don't worry.

378
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,279
This place is secluded.

379
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,240
Nobody will disturb us here.

380
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,216
What's wrong?

381
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,359
This manual

382
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,119
consists of two volumes.

383
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,576
The second one contains techniques,

384
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,496
while the first one has mental methods.

385
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,759
The one in your hands

386
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,312
is the second volume.

387
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
But the key

388
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,720
lies in the first volume.

389
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,856
Without it,

390
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,839
practicing techniques is impossible.

391
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,880
Without the mental methods,

392
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,319
you can't help

393
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,480
heal my injuries?

394
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,552
The mental methods
build internal strength.

395
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,960
It's essential for learning techniques.

396
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,480
With enough strength

397
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
to operate techniques,

398
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,839
I can treat your injuries.

399
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,359
In our haste, did we

400
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,000
forget the first volume?

401
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Given Master's character,

402
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,279
I don't think

403
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,839
he kept the manual in separate parts.

404
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,240
He only has this one.

405
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,696
So,

406
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,319
Master refused to give me the manual

407
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,920
because he didn't

408
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,759
have the mental methods?

409
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,992
The way

410
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,856
of Heaven...

411
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:05,856
(Heaven's way
reduces excess to replenish deficiency.)

412
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:09,440
(Thus, emptiness prevails over substance,
and insufficiency balances surplus.)

413
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,480
Sweetie.

414
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,279
You must help me.

415
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,440
I don't have much time left.

416
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,519
Only the Nine Yin True Sutra

417
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,432
can

418
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,039
save your father.

419
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,680
Chaofeng.

420
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,496
Chaofeng.

421
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,400
Chaofeng.

422
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,559
Chaofeng.

423
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Chaofeng.

424
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,728
Chaofeng.

425
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,104
You almost lost control.

426
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,920
Forcing practice is dangerous.

427
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,519
I intervened in time,

428
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,559
or you'd be dead.

429
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,216
Why?

430
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,840
After all we've done,

431
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,079
why can't I get vengeance?

432
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,264
Chaofeng.

433
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,768
Don't lose hope.

434
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,440
You almost lost control,

435
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,119
which gave me an idea
for practicing the manual.

436
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:25,440
(Nine Yin True Sutra)

437
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,288
Xuanfeng.

438
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,000
When will we start practicing?

439
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
We can't rush this.

440
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,000
Be patient a while longer.

441
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,840
Let me try practicing with you.

442
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:13,984
Well,

443
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,559
you don't have to.

444
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:24,992
You eat this.

445
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,864
Xuanfeng.

446
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,800
I've been thinking lately.

447
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,280
Taohua Island's mental methods
are gentle and simple.

448
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,480
Perhaps I can
practice the manual with it.

449
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,800
I want to try.

450
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,199
Taohua Island's martial arts are unique,

451
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
distinct from other sects.

452
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,640
That likely won't work.

453
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,760
You've been training alone these days.

454
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,528
Found any solutions?

455
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,816
Well,

456
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm still working on it.

457
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,888
We'll find a way.

458
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,232
Be patient.

459
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,256
Xuanfeng.

460
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,136
Give me the Nine Yin True Sutra.

461
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,559
I'll figure it out.

462
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,400
No.

463
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,488
Why not?

464
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,639
I don't understand.

465
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,280
I don't care.

466
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,280
We've been through much together.

467
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,679
Is there anything

468
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,639
we can't face together?

469
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,079
Chaofeng, I...

470
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,080
You should leave now.

471
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,800
It's not too late.

472
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,832
If I leave,

473
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,136
who'll help you find Qiu Yunhai?

474
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,719
This was not your business.

475
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,800
I'll get my revenge

476
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,272
on my own.
