00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,184
(In the Southern Song, the Meis of Lin'an
got rich as seafaring merchants.)

2
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,496
(Mei Ruohua, the Meis' spoiled daughter,
had her blissful childhood end at ten)

3
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:15,936
(when Qiu Yunhai destroyed her family.
Sold to a brothel, her suffering began.)

4
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,960
(Ruohua.)

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
(I'm right here.)

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,039
Mother.

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,079
Miss.

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,119
- Ruohua.
- Miss.

9
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,560
Over here, Miss.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,799
You can't catch me.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,080
Over here.

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,759
Ruohua.

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,640
Over here.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,760
Ruohua.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Mother.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,079
I caught you.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,816
Ruohua.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,439
(Mr. Mei, Qiu Yunhai)
Greet Mr. Qiu Yunhai.

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,960
(Young Mei Ruohua)
May you be well, Mr. Qiu.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,240
(Ruohua.)

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,640
(Didn't you say that)

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
(you had missed him?)

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,439
He came back to celebrate

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,280
your birthday.

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,560
Mr. Qiu has become

26
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,640
(Mrs. Mei)
our chief

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,560
business manager.

28
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,640
Thanks to him,

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,920
our family business

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,120
has gained momentum

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,079
and made a fortune.

32
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,480
Miss Mei,

33
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,640
happy birthday.

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,472
Here.

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,799
It's also

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,760
the Mid-Autumn Festival.

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,560
Stay over tonight.

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Yay!

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,640
Thank you, sir.

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,600
Rest well

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,799
- and drink with us.
- Alright.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,079
(I'll also)

44
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,439
drink with you, Father.

45
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,760
Alright.

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,359
The birthday girl calls the shots.

47
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:49,600

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,360
Move.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,984
Hurry up.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,719
What are you waiting for?

54
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,560
Legends say

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
those who obtain the Nine Yin True Sutra

56
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,080
become invincible.

57
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,800
Decades after Huang Chang's death,

58
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,840
the Nine Yin True Sutra resurfaced,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
stirring up the martial world,

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,800
causing countless casualties.

61
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,039
Therefore,

62
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,280
the top five martial artists,

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,936

Duan Zhixing,

Hong Qi,

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,919
and Wang Chongyang

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,199
(Qunfang Pavilion)
gathered at Mount Hua's peak

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,599
for a martial arts contest

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,039
to stop this carnage.

71
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:04,319
In the end,

72
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,759
Wang Chongyang prevailed

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,488
and obtained

74
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,520
the Nine Yin True Sutra.

75
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,960
Nine Yin True Sutra.

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Path to invincibility.

77
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,720
None of your business.

78
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,079
Move.

79
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
Stop hitting her.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Let me warn you.

81
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,480
If you damage

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,519
her pretty face,

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,024
I'll kill you.

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,480
Come on. Let's go.

85
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:28,839
Slowly.

86
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,319
Emperor Duan Zhixing of Dali...

87
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,360
Mei Ruohua.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Today

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
is a good day.

90
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:35,319
I have

91
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,439
found you a good client,

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,279
an old acquaintance of yours.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,959
Behave

94
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,439
and serve him well.

95
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:44,759
Then

96
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,920
everyone will be happy.

97
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,480
Otherwise,

98
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,120
I won't go easy on you.

99
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
Well, better not wear it.

100
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,839
There would be trouble

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
if it hurts the guest.

102
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,560
Drink by yourself.

103
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:04,879
Alright.

104
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,856
Go.

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
Sir.

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
Let me toast you.

107
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:32,079
(Mei Ruohua)

108
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,928
Sir.

109
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,639
Qiu Yunhai.

110
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,976
Mei Ruohua.

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,639
This place suits you well.

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,879
It's been a decade, huh?

113
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,488
More or less.

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,120
If your father could see

115
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,360
what you've become from the afterworld,

116
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,759
he'd be heartbroken.

117
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,879
Shameless.

118
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,768
You...

119
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,000
Suffer for the rest

120
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,328
of your life.

121
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
Scared I'll kill you?

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,048
I'm waiting.

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
Sir.

124
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,959
Madam sends you the new girl

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
as a kind gesture.

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,544
She's filthy.

127
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,984
You like her?

128
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,424
She's yours.

129
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,639
You're so lucky.

130
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:13,560
Hey, pretty.

131
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,528
Relax.

132
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll be gentle.

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,279
I won't hurt you.

134
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
Trying to run?

135
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,352
Get lost.

136
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,072
Let go.

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,928
Keep her alive.

138
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,776
Keep running.

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,128
Get her.

140
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:18,480
Get her.

141
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,328
- Understood!
- Understood!

142
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,600
- Get her!
- Get her!

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Wait.

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
Have you seen a woman in red?

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
No.

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,679
No?

147
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,880
Come on out.

148
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,072
Thank you.

149
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,480
Yah!

150
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,879
She's right inside.

151
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,159
Search thoroughly.

152
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,136
I want her alive.

153
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
You scheming viper!

154
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,879
I'll kill you!

155
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,832
Over there.

156
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,760
Get her.

157
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,639
Hurry.

158
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,616
Get her.

159
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:57,824
Hurry.

160
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,928
Over here.

161
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,072
Hurry.

162
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,704
Hurry.

163
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,464
Go.

164
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,584
(Master of Taohua Island, Huang Yaoshi)

165
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,039
I've never seen anyone

166
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,399
with your martial skills.

167
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,159
Please take me as your disciple.

168
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,992
Please rise.

169
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,960
I'll teach you three moves.

170
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,944
Watch closely.

171
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,759
I'm only showing you once.

172
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,528
Got it?

173
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,744
I...

174
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,720
I hope my inner energy

175
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,519
can help you get what you want.

176
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,440
(Qunfang Pavilion)

177
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,039
You dare

178
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,456
to show up again?

179
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,440
Qiu Yunhai.

180
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,712
Come out.

181
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,800
What's wrong?

182
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,919
It's you.

183
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,039
You're asking for this.

184
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
I won't go easy on you.

185
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
You've learned

186
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,799
a few moves, huh?

187
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,288
Get her!

188
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:58,560
(Qunfang Pavilion)

189
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,064
Beat her.

190
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
That's brutal.

191
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,279
Poor young lady.

192
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,480
Indeed.

193
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
Enough.

194
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't be so harsh.

195
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,352
Get up.

196
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,920
Look at you.

197
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,119
I thought you became

198
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,240
a martial artist overnight.

199
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,640
You're staring at me?

200
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,744
Stop!

201
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,119
Who is she?

202
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
Who is she?

203
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
No idea.

204
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:52,079
(Madam of Taohua Island, Feng Heng)
Bully a woman in broad daylight.

205
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Have you no shame?

206
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,200
Fine, I can stop.

207
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,799
If you trade places with her.

208
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,319
I know how to

209
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,799
treat a lady properly.

210
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,896
Nice aroma.

211
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,960
With your stunning looks,

212
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,200
I'll treat you right, my fair lady.

213
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,200
(Qunfang Pavilion)

214
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,440
She's got some fight in her.

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,920
I enjoy taming wild horses.

216
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,072
(Taohua Island, Hong)

217
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,336
My blade.

218
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,599
You'll be fine. Don't be scared.

219
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,648
Are you alright?

220
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,504
I'm okay.

221
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,359
Let's go then.

222
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Wait.

223
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,160
Come with us.

224
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,392
Come on.

225
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,040
Master.

226
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,200
It's not sustainable...

227
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,799
It's not sustainable

228
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,039
for you to help my lady

229
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
resist the cold poison.

230
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Is the Solar Mantra

231
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,279
incompatible with your original

232
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,120
cultivation?

233
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,319
The Ninefold Yin Pill

234
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,680
doesn't allow my lady

235
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,039
to develop yang energy.

236
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,119
You have to keep transferring

237
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,200
yang energy to her

238
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,119
via the Solar Mantra.

239
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,160
But it's only temporary.

240
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
You may risk

241
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
losing control...

242
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm well aware.

243
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,519
But what else can I do?

244
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,784
Please

245
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,936
take me in.

246
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,072
Get up, Miss.

247
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200
Bad people killed my entire family.

248
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm the sole survivor.

249
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,279
I must master martial arts

250
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,759
to avenge my family.

251
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,976
Please

252
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
take me as your disciple.

253
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,720
Are you done?

254
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,848
Yes.

255
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
All beings suffer.

256
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,079
I feel sorry for you,

257
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,759
but I can't take you in.

258
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,400
You should go.

259
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,576
Yaoshi.

260
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,559
Is it the girl we met?

261
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,559
She wants to be your disciple?

262
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,759
You rejected her?

263
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,640
The world overflows with misery.

264
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,880
We can't save everyone.

265
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
That's true.

266
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,319
We've seen so many people

267
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,279
and gone through so much.

268
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,920
We're leaves wavering in the wind.

269
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Of course, I'm among the fortunate ones.

270
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,759
When danger struck,

271
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
she risked everything to protect me.

272
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,359
That was deeply moving.

273
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:24,960
You spend

274
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,319
half the year in secluded cultivation.

275
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
She's around my age.

276
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,039
If she joined us on the island,

277
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,464
I would

278
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,839
have one more person

279
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,920
to talk to.

280
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,496
My Lady.

281
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,856
Fine.

282
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,400
I know you well.

283
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,280
Forget it.

284
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,232
(Yunhai Manor)

285
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,400
I failed the task.

286
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,304
Sir.

287
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
I deserve the worst punishment.

288
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,320
Sir.

289
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,072
Sir.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,864
Get up.

291
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,296
You know?

292
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,992
That man

293
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,440
was Huang Yaoshi,

294
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,519
one of the Five Greats

295
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,960
from the duel on Mount Hua.

296
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,759
How did he know

297
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,680
Mei Ruohua?

298
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,279
I have no idea.

299
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,240
(So you're saying)

300
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,400
(the man we saw was Huang Yaoshi?)

301
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,920
(I saw him cough up blood.)

302
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,960
He must be injured.

303
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,640
Qiao Si.

304
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,328
Track him down

305
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,312
and kill him.

306
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,424
Sir.

307
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,680
He's Huang Yaoshi.

308
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,200
But he's weak right now.

309
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,056
Kill him

310
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,640
and we will be famous.

311
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,288
This flower

312
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,759
blooms so well.

313
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,440
Not as pretty as you.

314
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,640
Yaoshi.

315
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,640
Honestly, I can relate

316
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,680
to this orchid.

317
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
I have no regrets after blooming

318
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,960
in full glory.

319
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,160
Don't be silly.

320
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,559
Meeting you has been

321
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,119
the greatest pleasure in my life.

322
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,864
I promise

323
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,119
everything will be alright.

324
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,480
I don't want to watch the sunrise
at Mount Tai anymore.

325
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,264
I'm tired.

326
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,279
Let's go home.

327
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,599
Master.

328
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,079
She's still kneeling outside.

329
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,496
(Auspicious Blessings)

330
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:12,832
(Auspicious Blessings)

331
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,119
He's no longer dangerous.

332
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,720
Whoever kills him

333
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,279
will rise to fame overnight.

334
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,944
Miss, don't move.

335
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,920
Yaoshi just infused you with energy.

336
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,720
You need to rest.

337
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,632
Huang Yaoshi!

338
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,192
Come out!

339
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,559
Mei Ruohua.

340
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,600
Come out!

341
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,392
It's fine.

342
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Huang Yaoshi.

343
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,064
Come out!

344
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,680
Master.

345
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,960
Master.

346
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,079
Qiu Yunhai.

347
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,096
Kill her.

348
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,832
Sir.

349
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,079
Thank you for saving me twice.

350
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,400
I offer my life in return.

351
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,488
(Sadly,)

352
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,720
(I can't be your disciple.)

353
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,920
Please take me in

354
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,119
if there's a next life.

355
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,776
Master!

356
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,736
(Auspicious Blessings)

357
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:26,880
(Auspicious Blessings)

358
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,432
Are you hurt?

359
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,320
No.

360
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,960
Wait for me at the dock.

361
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,256
Master.

362
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,119
Huang Yaoshi.

363
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,400
One of the Five Greats.

364
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,664
So invincible.

365
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,599
But he's weak now.

366
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,599
Strike while he's weak.

367
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,680
What are you waiting for?

368
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:37,952
Guys.

369
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,488
This is our chance.

370
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,799
Surround him.

371
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,920
You think

372
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,640
you can kill me?

373
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,079
I am Huang Yaoshi.

374
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,720
You woke up. We're safe now.

375
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,216
Where's Master?

376
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,232
Don't worry.

377
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,240
He's Huang Yaoshi.

378
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
He's here.

379
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,616
Master is back.

380
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,440
Master, are you alright?

381
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,360
Yaoshi.

382
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,720
Ruohua is injured.

383
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,984
Why don't we

384
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,839
take her to the island to heal?

385
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,839
Destiny brought us together.

386
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,599
And she risked her life to save me.

387
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
Will you take her as your disciple?

388
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,368
Let's go.

389
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,800
Where to?

390
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,336
Home.

391
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,504
Home?

392
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,519
Taohua Island.

393
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,712
(Taohua Island)

394
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,816
(First Disciple of Taohua Island,
Qu Lingfeng)

395
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,848
(Second Disciple of Taohua Island,
Chen Xuanfeng)

396
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:46,976
(Fourth Disciple of Taohua Island,
Lu Chengfeng)

397
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:50,752
(Fifth Disciple of Taohua Island,
Wu Mianfeng)

398
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,599
Seniors.

399
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think Master is back.

400
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,559
Are you daydreaming?

401
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,920
Master took Madam to see the sunrise

402
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,960
at Mount Tai.

403
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,119
They're not even there yet.

404
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,000
It really is Master!

405
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,480
Master came back early.

406
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,472
Let's go.

407
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,239
Put the things away.

408
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,800
- Tidy up.
- Come on.

409
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,679
Hurry.

410
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
- Let's go.
- Go.

411
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,119
You go.

412
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,079
I'm not going.

413
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,128
I'm not going.

414
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,344
You go.

415
00:35:57,952 --> 00:35:59,280
- You go.
- You go.

416
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,280
Stop dragging me.

417
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,504
I'm not going.

418
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,688
Knock it off.

419
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,719
Master will be here.

420
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,760
- You go.
- You go.

421
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
Go on.

422
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,176
Hurry up.

423
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,280
I am Qu Lingfeng.

424
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,320
Excuse me...

425
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,280
Young lady.

426
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,159
How old are you?

427
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:21,239
Who asks

428
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,639
a girl's age right off the bat?

429
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,776
Right?

430
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,800
Seniority is based on age here.

431
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,079
Mianfeng cares about it.

432
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,352
Exactly.

433
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,696
Fair enough.

434
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:30,976
Miss,

435
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,960
how old are you?

436
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,159
You told me not to ask.

437
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,080
Now you're asking?

438
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,072
I'm older.

439
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,079
I'm 20 years old.

440
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,480
Why am I still the youngest?

441
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:43,744
Let me introduce them.

442
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:44,719
He is

443
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
the oldest among us.

444
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,944
Qu Lingfeng.

445
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:48,719
He is

446
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,800
the second eldest.

447
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,679
Chen Xuanfeng.

448
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I am

449
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
supposed to rank fourth

450
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
below you.

451
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,679
I'm Master's most accomplished disciple,

452
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,856
Lu Chengfeng.

453
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:00,896
He is

454
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,880
the youngest.

455
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Wu Mianfeng.

456
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,960
Might I ask your name?

457
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,584
Mei Ruohua.

458
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,639
Mei Ruohua.

459
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,159
All of us bear "feng"

460
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,599
in our names.

461
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,816
I presume Master

462
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,440
hasn't given you a name yet.

463
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,176
Not yet.

464
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,840
Have you performed the ritual?

465
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,320
I skipped

466
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,559
the ritual last time.

467
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:26,719
So Master never

468
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,719
taught me properly

469
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,400
and made me study medicine.

470
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,360
You were slacking off.

471
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:33,320
Enough.

472
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,304
Master is here.

473
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,960
- Master.
- Master.

474
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,096
You met?

475
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,519
- Yes.
- Yes.

476
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,000
I, Mei Ruohua from Pingjiang Prefecture,

477
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,679
asked to be a disciple

478
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,719
of Huang Yaoshi

479
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,400
to learn martial arts.

480
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,840
You kindly took me in.

481
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,599
I shall respect you,

482
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,239
heed your teachings,

483
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,440
and bring us glory.

484
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:57,519
If I break...

485
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,528
Enough.

486
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,599
We don't have

487
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,880
so many rules here.

488
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,239
Follow your heart.

489
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,639
Roam freely.

490
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,320
May you find yourself

491
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,960
and start anew

492
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,519
on Taohua Island,

493
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,159
and let go of the past.

494
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,824
Understood.

495
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,480
Winds of Dao

496
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,119
guide my steps.

497
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,800
I roam beyond worldly cares.

498
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,912
Henceforth,

499
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,440
you shall be called

500
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,559
Mei Chaofeng.

501
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,072
Your disciple,

502
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,440
Mei Chaofeng, pays respects.

503
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,199
These paintings

504
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,559
are your master's collection.

505
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,519
Mianfeng made the incense.

506
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,480
I blended

507
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,800
these cosmetics myself.

508
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,159
I hope you like them.

509
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,576
Out.

510
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,144
Let's go.

511
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,880
Your master says

512
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,088
that you lack inner energy.

513
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,639
Ask Mianfeng

514
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,840
for three specially-made

515
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,760
Nine-Flower Dew Pills

516
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,519
to strengthen

517
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,800
your foundation for future cultivation.

518
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,039
Thank you.

519
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,840
It was a bit rushed.

520
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,039
Take a look and tell me

521
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
if you need anything.

522
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,872
Chaofeng.

523
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,600
From now on,

524
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,599
this is your home.

525
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
Take your shoes off.

526
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
In a second.

527
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,480
What do you think about our master's

528
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,776
new disciple?

529
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,000
We finally have

530
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
a female disciple.

531
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,079
I thought she'd be a sweet

532
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,000
little girl.

533
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But she

534
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,239
turned out to be quite cold.

535
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
I find her quite unique.

536
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,376
Especially the way

537
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,920
she looks at people.

538
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,000
Cold, stubborn,

539
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,239
with an indescribable style.

540
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,920
Lingfeng.

541
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,519
Don't tell me you're in love with her.

542
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,736
Nonsense.

543
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,480
Master will break your legs.

544
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,599
She might be

545
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,599
hard to get along with.

546
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,000
She should be gentle and composed

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,760
like our madam.

548
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,712
Right?

549
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,119
You usually talk the most.

550
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,519
Why are you so silent?

551
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,119
I'm wondering

552
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,840
whether I should
call her "junior sister"

553
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,920
or "older sister".

554
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,639
Or "older junior sister"?

555
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,880
Call her Chaofeng.

556
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,679
Chaofeng.

557
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,760
Well,

558
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
what's her background anyway?

559
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,199
Why did Master take her as a disciple?

560
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,920
Master must have

561
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,639
his reasons.

562
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,119
Like when he took me in.

563
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:21,960
My father

564
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,400
used to be an official,

565
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,480
poor but incorruptible.

566
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,480
He was framed by villains

567
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,896
and was exiled.

568
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,239
Master saved me

569
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,648
and brought me

570
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,719
to the island.

571
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,920
Loyalty and filial piety.

572
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Our master has always

573
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,599
respected loyal ministers
and devoted sons.

574
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,400
My parents
fought against the Jin invaders.

575
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,599
Mianfeng's parents

576
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,679
were military doctors.

577
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:47,119
It's a pity that

578
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,840
they died early on the battlefield.

579
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,920
Maybe Chaofeng's parents also fought

580
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,808
in the war?

581
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,208
Not necessarily.

582
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,159
My parents didn't fight in the war.

583
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,400
Maybe her family was also

584
