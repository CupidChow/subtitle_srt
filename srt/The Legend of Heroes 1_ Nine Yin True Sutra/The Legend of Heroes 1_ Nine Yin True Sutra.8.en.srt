1
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,088
Everyone,

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,279
the time has come

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,360
for us to join forces.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,879
Declare your allegiance.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,320
Kill her now!

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,120
Who'll face my White Serpent Whip?

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,480
Miss,

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,960
I'll test your legendary skills.

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,720
You impudent brat,

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,936
you're courting death!

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,120
Young lass,

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
let my Cloud Whisk

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,439
test your White Serpent Whip.

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,200
Today, we, the Chens of Yingchuan,

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,719
shall rid the world of you.

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,399
Preaching virtue and morality

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,119
while greedy and hypocritical.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,768
Surrender your life!

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
What a heretic!

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,599
All together now!

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,719
Kill this heretic!

22
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,040
Bullies ganging up

23
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,560
on the outnumbered!

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,224
How dare you

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,079
call yourselves heroes?

26
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:27,480
Heretics like you

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,840
deserve execution by all!

28
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,592
Attack!

29
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:43,232

Chaofeng, go find Qiu Yunhai.

35
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:55,680
I'll handle this.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,879
Alright. Be careful.

37
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,079
Consorting with the Jin

38
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,519
and treason for personal gain!

39
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,759
This wasn't my decision alone.

40
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,079
After centuries,

41
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,392
the Chen family

42
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
is no longer

43
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
the virtuous clan sworn
to aid the world.

44
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,759
Don't you want this?

45
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,759
I'll yield my position

46
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,672
as clan heir to you

47
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,399
and never return to the clan.

48
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,776
In exchange,

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,439
the Chens must cease harassing us.

50
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,320
Do you think

51
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,519
killing me

52
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,279
will bring vengeance?

53
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,656
My death

54
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,839
will only breed more hatred.

55
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,016
- Manor Lord Qiu!
- Manor Lord Qiu!

56
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,519
Any challengers,

57
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,128
face me now!

58
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,319
Let's go!

59
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,560
Quickly! Hurry!

60
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,600
Let's go!

61
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,839
Lingfeng,

62
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,696
why are you here?

63
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,319
We'd return to Taohua Island

64
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,720
after today's affairs.

65
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,448
What's with your legs?

66
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,079
Who did this to you?

67
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,872
Our legs

68
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,519
are your doing!

69
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,199
You used my drugs to poison Master,

70
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,279
letting Xue Qingyi strike

71
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:31,759
to make Master lose control

72
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,864
and...

73
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,384
We barely stand

74
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,120
with canes,

75
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,840
but Chengfeng

76
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,639
is confined to a wheelchair forever.

77
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,160
How could this happen?

78
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm sorry. I never meant...

79
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
Your feeble apology

80
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,519
means nothing.

81
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,679
Because you stole the sutra,

82
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,559
Madam risked her life saving Master

83
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,320
and died in childbirth.

84
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,024
Madam

85
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,368
died?

86
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,304
It can't be.

87
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,928
It can't be.

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
This must be a lie!

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Chaofeng,

90
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Madam truly died.

91
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
Your selfish obsession

92
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
endangered our whole sect.

93
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,799
How dare you face Master and Madam?

94
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,904
Master...

95
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,344
Madam...

96
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,904
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,504
Today,

99
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,200
as Taohua Island's first disciple,

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,960
I'll purge our sect's shame.

101
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,544
Lingfeng,

102
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
end my life then.

103
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,919
Lingfeng,

104
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,279
I broke Qingyin Cave's formation

105
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,360
and stole the sutra.

106
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Chaofeng didn't do those.

107
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,832
Kill me if you must.

108
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,864
Xuanfeng!

109
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,784
Xuanfeng!

110
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,288
Xuanfeng.

111
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,399
Lingfeng, Xuanfeng...

112
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,279
Don't call him that!

113
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,744
Xuanfeng.

114
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
He is internally injured.

115
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,840
Without treatment,

116
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,712
he might...

117
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
How can we save him?

118
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,759
Master's Wuchang Pills

119
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
are a healing elixir.

120
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,480
But I don't have any with me.

121
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,240
Lingfeng,

122
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,639
I know my sins weigh heavily,

123
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,152
and I deserve death.

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
But Xuanfeng is injured badly.

125
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I must save him.

126
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,879
I'll take him to Taohua Island.

127
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,759
After he recovers,

128
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,519
Master can punish me.

129
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,360
Chen Xuanfeng

130
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,600
and Mei Chaofeng,

131
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,399
you two ingrates

132
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,519
betrayed our sect.

133
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,159
Regardless of Master's judgment,

134
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,208
from this day forth,

135
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
we four buddies

136
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,440
will sever all ties with you

137
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,600
and stand as sworn enemies.

138
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,352
Xuanfeng.

139
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,912
Xuanfeng!

140
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,328
Xuanfeng,

141
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,240
wait here for me.

142
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,120
I'll go find Master now.

143
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,679
I'll go with you.

144
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
No matter what happens,

145
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,279
I'll face it with you.

146
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:59,044

(Tomb of Madam Feng,
Madam of Taohua Island)

148
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,480
Madam.

149
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,352
Madam.

150
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,856
Madam.

151
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:01,952
(Tomb of Madam Feng,
Madam of Taohua Island)

152
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,120
I'm sorry.

153
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,240
This is all my fault.

154
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:22,840
(Tomb of Madam Feng,
Madam of Taohua Island)

155
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,120
You once told me

156
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,920
that this world has

157
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
not just familial love,

158
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
but also friendship,

159
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,272
and romance.

160
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,240
Now I've

161
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,240
found someone

162
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,888
to share my life with.

163
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:47,136
(Tomb of Madam Feng,
Madam of Taohua Island)

164
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:50,120
But, Madam, in seeking revenge,

165
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,936
I've hurt

166
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,360
so many who care about me

167
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,279
and cherish me.

168
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
If I could start over,

169
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,799
I'd never steal the Nine Yin True Sutra.

170
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,376
My sins

171
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,399
are mountainous.

172
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,960
Even if Master

173
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
kills me right now,

174
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
it would be justified.

175
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
But...

176
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,192
People...

177
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,112
When lacking something,

178
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,039
they crave it.

179
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,519
When having something,

180
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,080
they take it for granted.

181
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
Only when enlightened

182
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,720
do they realize

183
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,919
it's already beyond recovery.

184
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,880
Losing a loved one

185
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,960
hurts,

186
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,864
but the true agony

187
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,599
comes when you realize

188
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
they'll

189
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,440
never return.

190
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,440
That pain

191
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,359
carves a hole

192
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,920
in your very soul.

193
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,304
From then on,

194
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,039
no sunshine

195
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
or gentle breeze

196
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,960
could ever fill

197
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,599
that cold, dark void.

198
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Leave.

199
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,119
Don't let me see you again.

200
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,079
Did you see Master?

201
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,312
Master

202
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,039
has aged terribly.

203
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,392
Madam.

204
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,519
(Tomb of Madam Feng,
Madam of Taohua Island)

205
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,599
Now I finally understand

206
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,640
beyond mountains

207
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,839
lie more mountains.

208
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,359
If we could start over,

209
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,600
I wish

210
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,039
you never met me.

211
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,880
Meeting you has been

212
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,880
the greatest pleasure in my life.

213
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,839
Master, I'll do a sword dance.

214
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,232
Master.

215
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,720
It's them.

216
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,560
Let's go.

217
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,736
Next...

218
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I don't know.

219
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,000
All this time,

220
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
my heart has only sought vengeance.

221
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,119
I never considered

222
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,039
what comes after revenge.

223
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,559
Master said

224
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,559
he was a weary,

225
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,759
broken man

226
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,759
who refuses to change
like the moon's phases.

227
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,519
But in truth,

228
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,519
he completely transformed me.

229
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,799
There they are!

230
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,720
Hurry!

231
00:21:58,944 --> 00:21:59,839
They're right ahead.

232
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,864
Quick, that's them!

233
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,039
Yes, it's them.

234
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,000
(Ke Bixie, Skyflying Dragon)
Black Wind Twin Evils,

235
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,599
you dug graves

236
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,839
and used corpses to cultivate.

237
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,640
- Even gods rage!
- Black Wind Twin Evils?

238
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
That's right.

239
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,480
It's them!

240
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,839
They even killed the benevolent

241
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Manor Lord Qiu!

242
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,968
(Ke Zhen'e, Skyflying Bat)
Black Wind Twin Evils,

243
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,559
you betrayed your sect

244
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,519
and slaughtered righteous sect members.

245
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,480
The entire martial world wants you dead.

246
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,519
I know you're severely injured.

247
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,359
We brothers

248
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,279
aren't heartless villains.

249
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,696
Commit suicide now.

250
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,559
Hypocrites like you,

251
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,039
claiming to be righteous

252
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,400
and spouting virtue,

253
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,519
can't even distinguish right from wrong.

254
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,279
Today,

255
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,440
we Black Wind Twin Evils

256
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,039
shall execute Heaven's will
and send you to your graves.

257
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:52,960
Evil vermin!

258
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,599
I'm Ke Bixie, Skyflying Dragon.

259
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,960
He is my younger brother,
Ke Zhen'e, Skyflying Bat.

260
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,559
Today we brothers

261
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,400
will eliminate you

262
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,640
to purge evil.

263
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,816
Heretics deserve heaven's punishment!

264
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,706
Kill them!

265
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,666
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

266
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,696
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

267
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:06,656
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

268
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,648
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

269
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:08,640
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

270
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,799
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

271
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:11,004
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

272
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,160
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

273
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,216
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

274
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,832
Bixie!

275
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,079
My eyes!

276
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,079
My eyes!

277
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,536
Xuanfeng,

278
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
are you alright?

279
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,920
Black Wind Twin Evils!

280
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,536
I, Ke Zhen'e,

281
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,839
will have my revenge!

282
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,079
Xuanfeng?

283
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,480
Chaofeng, I'm fine.

284
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,359
He missed my vital spots.

285
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,216
Xuanfeng,

286
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
let's leave.

287
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,400
Where to?

288
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,488
Away from here.

289
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,200
As far as possible.

290
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Okay.

291
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:12,960
(Northern Desert)

292
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:53,920
I love this place.

293
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
The grasslands here

294
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,079
are as vast as the sea.

295
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,160
Then let's stay here

296
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
and live peacefully forever.

297
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's go back.

298
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,079
Tonight,

299
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:42,920
we'll attend

300
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,839
Moke's wedding.

301
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,664
Okay.

302
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,519
Welcome, friends from afar!

303
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,840
Welcome!

304
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,624
Welcome!

305
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,079
Today is my wedding day.

306
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm delighted you came.

307
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,039
With your blessings,

308
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,480
we'll be even happier.

309
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,920
Miss, join our dance.

310
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,032
Come on.

311
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,912
Fair traveler,

312
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,319
you dance wonderfully.

313
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,839
This hat is for you.

314
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,319
They said

315
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,319
it's a marriage proposal hat.

316
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,240
When I give it to my lover,

317
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,799
if he agrees to marry me,

318
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,279
he'll wear this hat.

319
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,568
Chen Xuanfeng,

320
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,400
will you wear

321
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
the hat I give you?

322
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:56,370
- By heaven above
- By heaven above

323
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,144
- and earth below.
- and earth below.

324
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,039
I, Chen Xuanfeng.

325
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,920
I, Mei Chaofeng.

326
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,839
- We vow
- We vow

327
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:05,456
- eternal love.
- eternal love.

328
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,559
- Souls entwined
- Souls entwined

329
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,152
- through every life.
- through every life.

330
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,559
- Grow old
- Grow old

331
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,160
- and stick together.
- and stick together.

332
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:13,792
- Bound forever,
- Bound forever,

333
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,264
- never parting.
- never parting.

334
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,488
Chaofeng,

335
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,440
is this a dream?

336
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,744
Ouch!

337
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,016
Why did you bite me?

338
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,240
Good, it hurts.

339
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,672
That proves

340
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,759
you're not dreaming.

341
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,688
Xuanfeng,

342
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
thank you for giving me a home.

343
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,759
My parents died.

344
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,039
Then I made mistakes

345
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,440
and lost my family on Taohua Island.

346
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,319
You're all I have left.

347
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
Having me is enough.

348
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,504
From now on,

349
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,079
I'll be your lover,

350
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,240
(family, and friend.)

351
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,799
(We'll have a home)

352
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,839
(and fill it with children,)

353
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:02,240
(giving us)

354
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,200
(more family.)

355
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,759
(We'll stay together forever)

356
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,880
(and never be apart.)

357
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:15,799
But

358
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,359
I've committed so many wrongs

359
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,480
and hurt so many people.

360
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,079
Retribution will come for me.

361
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,720
Then I'll tell Heaven

362
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,880
to punish me instead

363
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,640
if punishment must come.

364
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,359
I'll bear it all for you.

365
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,400
I can't lose you.

366
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Chaofeng,

367
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,440
today's the full moon.

368
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,519
Let's go to the mountain.

369
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,440
Why isn't he coming?

370
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,440
I wonder if Guo Jing

371
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,240
dares climb the mountain alone.

372
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,480
Cong,

373
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
though Jing seems

374
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,720
simple-minded most of the time,

375
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,240
I can tell

376
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,839
he genuinely wants to learn.

377
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,799
Xiaoying's right.

378
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,792
Let's wait longer.

379
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,584
What happened?

380
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,319
There are skulls here.

381
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,680
Each has five holes

382
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,680
on the forehead.

383
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,599
Like

384
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,920
being pierced by fingers.

385
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,319
Are they in three layers?

386
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,559
Five below,

387
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,960
three in the middle,

388
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,080
and one on top?

389
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,424
Exactly.

390
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,240
Zhen'e,

391
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,200
how did you know?

392
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,536
Quick! Check northeast and northwest.

393
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,464
Search the area.

394
00:32:58,464 --> 00:32:59,424
Look for more clues.

395
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,592
More here!

396
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,480
Zhen'e, here too!

397
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,112
Here as well!

398
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,256
Over here too!

399
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,079
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

400
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,839
Listen carefully.

401
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,440
This is life or death.

402
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,224
(Seven Eccentrics of the South)
My eyes

403
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,000
were ruined by them!

404
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,360
Who are they?

405
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,496
Put these skulls back exactly

406
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:35,880
as you found them.

407
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,240
Don't let them notice anything

408
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,160
has been disturbed.

409
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,319
Zhen'e,

410
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,200
who are they?

411
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,720
They're the Black Wind Twin Evils.

412
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,079
The notorious Black Wind Twin Evils?

413
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,128
Yes.

414
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:54,920
These years,

415
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,839
no one in the world

416
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,960
has discovered their traces.

417
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,599
Everyone only knows

418
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
they are utterly wicked

419
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and should've died.

420
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,839
Now they're not only alive

421
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,920
but also hiding in this desolate area?

422
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,200
Listen.

423
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,759
Mount your horses quickly

424
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,199
and ride south.

425
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,559
Don't ever return here.

426
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
After traveling 1,000 li,

427
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,039
wait ten days for me.

428
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,920
If I don't arrive,

429
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,639
don't wait any longer.

430
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,119
Zhen'e, what are you saying?

431
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,199
We drank blood wine

432
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
and swore to live and die together.

433
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,199
You're sending us away?

434
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,199
If we can't defeat them,

435
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,679
we'll just leave our lives here.

436
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,960
How can we flee?

437
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,679
- Right, Zhen'e.
- Exactly, Zhen'e.

438
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,728
You don't understand.

439
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,119
They have formidable skills.

440
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,280
They've mastered
the Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

441
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,239
We're no match for them.

442
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,880
Why throw your lives away needlessly?

443
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,880
Zhen'e, if we leave, we leave together.

444
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,159
Yes, we stay or leave together.

445
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,199
No.

446
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
They ruined my life,

447
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,128
which I could endure.

448
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,519
But my brother's death

449
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,840
must be avenged.

450
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,128
Zhen'e,

451
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
we share blessings

452
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,816
and hardships alike.

453
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:51,800
- Exactly.
- Yes.

454
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,672
We share hardships.

455
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,000
Okay.

456
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,960
Tonight,

457
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,039
we'll rid the evil

458
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,280
and ambush the Black Wind Twin Evils.

459
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,848
- Okay!
- Okay!

460
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,239
Why is there

461
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,320
no birdsong?

462
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,672
Who are you?

463
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,159
Hiding like cowards!

464
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,639
You're seeking death.

465
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,432
Chaofeng.

466
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,119
Do you remember

467
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,280
Ke Bixie, Skyflying Dragon?

468
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Skyflying Bat?

469
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,880
You actually tracked me here?

470
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,384
Chaofeng.

471
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,400
Xuanfeng.

472
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,304
What's with your eyes?

473
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,000
I can't see.

474
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,599
The hidden weapon was toxic.

475
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,559
Who hurt you?

476
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,040
Asheng?

477
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,352
Asheng?

478
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,760
Asheng!

479
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,568
It's you,

480
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,360
Skyflying Bat?

481
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,384
Indeed.

482
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,472
It's me.

483
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,199
Give me back my brother's life!

484
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,800
You killed my brother.

485
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,880
Take this!

486
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,519
Let go of me!

487
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Let go of me!

488
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,119
Let go of me!

489
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,224
Chaofeng,

490
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,752
go.

491
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,360
Go!

492
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,184
Xuanfeng,

493
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,688
what's wrong?

494
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:57,984
Xuanfeng?

495
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,032
Go.

496
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
They did this to you?

497
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,984
I'll kill them all!

498
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,600
No.

499
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,519
He's just

500
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,864
a child.

501
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,559
Xuanfeng? Xuanfeng?

502
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,888
Xuanfeng?

503
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,400
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,320
I'm afraid

505
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,239
I'll break my promise.

506
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:28,880
Xuanfeng.

507
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,639
I can't stay with you anymore.

508
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,800
Don't talk like that.

509
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,232
Chaofeng,

510
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,559
listen carefully.

511
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,760
The one with the iron staff

512
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,960
is Ke Zhen'e, Skyflying Bat.

513
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,559
I once personally

514
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,239
killed his older brother.

515
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,960
When will this cycle of vengeance end?

516
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
I...

517
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
I don't want you

518
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,679
to spend your days

519
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,000
drowning in bloodshed.

520
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,360
It's all my fault.

521
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,840
If I hadn't insisted

522
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,320
on stealing the Nine Yin True Sutra,

523
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,679
we'd never have encountered
the Ke brothers.

524
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,360
Chaofeng.

525
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,119
Xuanfeng.

526
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,079
Listen to me.

527
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
The second thing is

528
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,119
the Nine Yin True Sutra

529
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,519
is carved upon my chest.

530
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,199
You must continue practicing it.

531
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:38,960
Then in the future,

532
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,840
no one would dare...

533
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,088
dare...

534
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,000
dare to bully you again.

535
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,320
I don't want
the Nine Yin True Sutra anymore.

536
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,559
I'll never practice martial arts again.

537
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:55,280
I just want you to live.

538
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,880
Xuanfeng,

539
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,599
