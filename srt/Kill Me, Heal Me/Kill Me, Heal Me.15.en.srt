1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,840
Inside those memories that Mr.Cha doesn't have

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,060
but only you have,

3
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,100
was I in there?

4
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,950
Episode 15

5
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,060
Oh Ri Jin...

6
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,650
It was Oh Ri Jin.

7
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,940
Don't go. Play with me.

8
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,940
I'm scared if I'm alone.

9
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,980
But if I'm with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

10
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,110
If Dad finds out that I'm here,

11
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,750
you'll get scolded. I'll come again tomorrow night.

12
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,070
I'll come every day.

13
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,570
Will you really come?

14
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,880
You have to come.

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,630
Okay. Remember. Every night at 10.

16
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,310
The time we promised (to meet).

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,920
Remember.

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,690
Every night at 10.

19
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,820
10 at night.

20
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,570
The time we promised.

21
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,900
The time we promised.

22
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,940
The time we promised...

23
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,230
Don't go.

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,310
Don't go.

25
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,480
Play with me.

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,650
Don't go.

27
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,060
Don't go.

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,500
Don't go. Play with me.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,650
You...what's your name?

30
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,000
Remember. Remember this well.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,030
January 7th, 2015, 10 PM on the dot.

32
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,020
January 29th, 2015

33
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,240
10 PM.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,450
Remember.

35
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,490
The time I fell in love with you.

36
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,240
The time our first consultation started.
♬ The hidden things inside me ♬

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,760
Remember.
♬ The hidden things inside me ♬

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,150
The time we promised.
♬ Changed me greatly ♬
♬ It put me to sleep, ♬

39
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,570
♬ tied my hands together, then locked me in a dark room ♬

40
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,280
♬ The lost pieces of time ♬

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,250
♬ The memories of love, which I abandoned ♬

42
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,380
♬ I erased them and I'm left ♬

43
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,650
♬ as an abandoned empty shell. ♬

44
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,740
♬ Without knowing anything, I screamed ♬

45
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,300
♬ And that’s all I remember ♬

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
♬ My heart, which was as cold as ice, will melt once once I wake up ♬

47
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,500
Why aren't you coming?
♬ I want to free myself, ♬

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,330
I'm...scared.
♬ from the torment of my sins ♬

49
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,360
♬  Someone take me out from my spirit full of scars  ♬

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,800
Come quickly.
♬  The deep night shows you,  ♬

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,240
♬  who was not able to leave  ♬

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,240
♬  It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again  ♬

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,010
The two of them fought on this day. Look at their petulant faces.
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

54
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,550
♬ and your scent

55
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,990
♬  echoes in my ears every day  ♬

56
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,070
♬  Where are you? ♬

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,340
♬  You hid yourself somewhere where I can’t see you ♬

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,070
♬  The pain that you endure through instead of me ♬

59
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,450
Don't go.
♬  When my angers come one , ♬

60
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,450
Don't go.
♬ Even if I want to find my real me, instead of you,  ♬

61
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,800
♬  The bruise in my heart is too big  ♬

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,460
Don't go.
♬  Even if I try to hide them, the rascals hiding inside me appear and wakes me up  ♬

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,500
Don't go.
♬  From the other side of my horrific memories, ♬

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,960
Don't go.
♬ I came to face you  ♬

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,650
I also would like to be with you forever.
♬  You even embraced my lost emotions and helped me, who was down, up  ♬

66
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,110
That child should have been saved instead.
♬  So that I don’t let my hand go,  ♬

67
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,820
That child should have been saved instead of me.
♬ I’m trying my hardest to erase the hellish times  ♬

68
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,450
That's what's humane!
♬ In this place that I locked myself  ♬

69
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,610
♬  I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

70
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,270
Me...I'm strangely scared of fires and basements.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,940
But, if I'm with you, I don't think I'll be scared.
♬  I can’t touch you or be embraced by you  ♬

72
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,750
What...is your name?
♬  The things that are taking over me aren’t the bastards living inside me  ♬

73
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,530
♬  The strong medicine will not heal me, only the word love ♬

74
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,070
Don't go. Play with me.
♬  The voice that echoes in my ears wakes me up  ♬

75
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,710
♬  Embraces and kisses me, and I can no longer see it anymore  ♬

76
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,170
♬  The deep night shows you, ♬

77
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,100
Move.
♬  who was not able to leave  ♬

78
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,460
Move.
♬  It wakes me up  ♬

79
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,850
- 21 years ago on that day...
- That child should have been saved instead.
♬  from my sleep  ♬

80
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,450
The person who saved you from the fire was your father.
♬  and kiss me again ♬

81
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,150
That child should have been saved instead of me!
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

82
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,340
That's what's humane!
♬  and your scent ♬

83
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,220
♬  echoes in my ears  ♬

84
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,300
Our father...
♬  Everyday ♬

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,970
♬  Where are you?  ♬

86
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,750
That's why back then...
♬  On the night sky, which I cannot reach,  ♬

87
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,810
You shouldn't have saved me.
♬ I see you, who is turning back  ♬

88
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,250
I became a monster because of you, Father.
♬ From this hard day  ♬

89
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,590
♬  it makes a picture  ♬

90
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,760
♬  I’m sorry. I hold on to you,  ♬

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,940
♬  and tell you to not get far away from me ♬
♬ and I call for you desperately ♬

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,000
Save me. I-I was in the wrong.
♬  But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you,  ♬

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,730
- Save me.
- Save me. I was in the wrong.
♬  and my tears fall  ♬

94
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,150
I was in the wrong. I was in the wrong.

95
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,710
Even back then you didn't have the courage to deal with the pain so you ran away.

96
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,900
So I faced that pain instead of you.

97
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,000
How could you do your work like this!

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,190
You said you weren't followed!

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,690
For now, who that guy is,

100
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,750
and the reason he has with the girl that he wants to take her away,

101
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,850
do a background check on him first. Get out of there before the police come.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,810
I am telling you this clearly already,

103
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,750
I have nothing to do with this. You understand?

104
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,590
If this matter gets bigger,

105
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,940
as you promised, you guys are taking the blame!

106
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,690
Stop.

107
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,290
Stop!

108
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,940
We're retreating.

109
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,240
Hey, open the door!

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Is there anyone out there?!

111
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,560
What is this...what is this now?

112
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,150
Open (the door)!

113
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,010
Open this door!

114
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,900
Open (the door)!

115
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,440
Open this door!

116
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Open (the door)!

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,940
Open this door!

118
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,020
Open this door!

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,600
Hyperventilation Syndrome: Respiratory problem caused from breathing out too much carbon dioxide. Often causes symptoms of dizziness and the like.

120
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll come again tomorrow night.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,580
I'll come every day.

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,110
Will you really come?

123
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,700
You have to come.

124
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,650
Remember. Every night at 10.

125
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,100
The time we promised.

126
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,350
I'm sorry for coming late.

127
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,900
Cha Do Hyun.

128
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,360
Why are you like this?

129
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,650
Why is your face a wreck like this?

130
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,480
For coming late,

131
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,450
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

133
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,940
Wait! Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

134
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,560
Who are you? What are you?!

135
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm Ri Jin's older brother. My little sister's in there!

136
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,520
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun, come to your senses!

137
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
- Ri On!
- Vice President!

138
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,150
Call 119! Hurry up and call 119! (Korean 911)

139
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,280
Hurry!

140
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,190
Do a vital check first, and get a C-ARM (portable X-ray equipment) since there could be a possibility of fractures.

141
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,930
He's sometimes taking Lorazepam and Alprazolam, so do a reference first.

142
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,600
Why are you here, Doctor Oh? Didn't you go to Johns Hopkins?

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,290
Is this the time to be chitchatting? Hurry up and try to save this person!

144
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,160
Don't get mad, don't get mad. Don't come in, you understand? Please make sure Dr. Oh doesn't come in.

145
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,810
Yes.

146
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,710
A chain laceration at the back of his head.

147
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,570
Thank you.

148
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,200
Shouldn't you get treated, too? You must have been really shocked.

149
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,330
I'm alright.

150
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,950
If you're that worried, I'll be here, so go home and get some rest.

151
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,650
No, I have to stay here.

152
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,170
I'm his physician.

153
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,580
You already take care of his heart's wounds. Do you have to take care of his bodily wounds as well?

154
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,490
- He got hurt because of me.
- Who says that it's because of you?

155
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,100
Is there any definite proof? It's even more possible that it's because of him that you got kidnapped!

156
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,580
Who says that it was because of him?

157
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,230
Is there any definite proof?

158
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,720
You...

159
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,890
Do you only worry about that person,

160
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,110
and not even give any importance to me worrying about you?

161
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,820
Do as you please.

162
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,600
Was there even a time you ever listened to me?

163
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,010
Are you sure the villa is under that person's name?

164
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,750
Maybe there is a mistake?

165
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,170
I understand for now.

166
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,390
Please find out the identity of the person acting as their leader.

167
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,510
And please investigate what their objective was in doing this.

168
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,330
Yes.

169
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,990
Who is the owner of the villa?

170
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,850
Who in the world kidnapped my little sister, and with what objective?

171
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,210
I can't tell you information that isn't definite yet.

172
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,120
I understand. I'll look into it, then.

173
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,880
There's got to be some information that's definite.

174
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,080
I hope that I guessed wrong. If not...

175
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,350
I don't know what I'll end up doing myself.

176
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,930
Hyungnim, this is Omega. I need you to find something out for me.

177
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,300
Professor...

178
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,270
What happened? Is it Perry Park who did this? Or was it Shin Se Gi?

179
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,690
I don't really know yet.

180
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,550
- Go out for a minute.
- No, I'll stay here.

181
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,530
You agreed to a consultation last time.

182
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,350
Leave Mr. Cha alone so he can sleep.

183
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,520
You had a déjà vu again?

184
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes.

185
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,870
I felt it very vividly this time.

186
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,000
I thought it'd be you that would become the key to make Cha Do Hyun remember his memories,

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,120
but, on the contrary, you began to open your own.

188
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
This is really a strange fate, strange fate.

189
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,780
Either way,

190
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,970
I think that it's definite that I'm in the memories that Mr. Shin has

191
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,210
and that Mr. Cha doesn't have.

192
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,820
Have you found out the answer?

193
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,080
Not yet.

194
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,270
But because there's a big possibility that Mr. Shin is a personality that appeared when Mr. Cha was around seven years old and lost his memories,

195
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,190
the probability of me meeting him around that time is also big.

196
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,010
So...

197
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,270
I'm going to try to remember

198
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,570
those memories that I lost.

199
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,350
Hm?

200
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,470
You're not going to have Mr. Cha remember his memories, but rather, you'll remember your own memories, Dr. Oh?

201
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,120
Yes.

202
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,110
If Mr. Cha and I met sometime in our childhood,

203
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,510
it could be helpful if at least one of us remembers.

204
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,700
It could also become the key that lets us know why Mr. Cha's mind was broken to pieces.

205
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,570
So you're going to try to remember your memories,

206
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,160
not for your own sake, but for Mr. Cha's sake.

207
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,610
We decided to overcome it together.

208
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,760
Whether it's fear of basements or just something difficult.

209
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,590
We can heal each other like that.

210
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,770
Please save me. I was wrong.

211
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,300
Oh Ri Jin...

212
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,700
No matter happens, I want to try to overcome it with you.

213
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,780
That's why...

214
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,690
That's why...?

215
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,030
I'll do it with you.

216
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,590
NO!

217
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,710
You made a promise with me, Yo Sub. You said that you weren't going to try to kill yourself again!

218
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,200
You told me not to worry because you won't be killing yourself for now!

219
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,160
If you want to die, then die.

220
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,100
But die tomorrow.

221
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,140
If you feel it's hard for you tomorrow as well, then die the day after that.

222
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,610
If you feel the same pain the day after that,

223
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,530
even if you die the next day and the day after that, it won't be too late!

224
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,640
If you live each day at a time like that,

225
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,460
then a good day will definitely come.

226
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,150
There will come a day where you'll tell yourself, "I did a good thing by not killing myself back then"!

227
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,090
♫A secret♫

228
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,280
Please. Please.

229
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,490
Leave Mr. Cha alone so that he can live, okay?
♫That can't be told to anyone♫

230
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,230

Mr. Cha?
♫I miss you♫

242
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,120

246
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,820
there's something I really want to tell that person.

247
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,480
I can't die right now.

249
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:04,210
This is the first time I realized how touching the words "I'm not going to die" are.

250
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,200
This is the first time I found out that the words "I'm not going to die"

251
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,890
are so reassuring.

252

♫Don't come close to me, who is like this
What can I do about my heart being like this?♫

♫You probably don't realize that I'm trying to push you away♫

254
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:52,480

256

257
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:17,500
♫Even if I can't tell you that I love you, I love you♫

258
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,190
Are you really thinking of reviving the childhood memories that you lost?

259
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,350
How did you know?

260
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,960
Are you really intending to

261
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,380
remember your childhood memories

262
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,380
because of me, to help me remember mine?

263
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,430
How did you know that I can't remember?

264
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,840
Could it be that you eavesdropped when Professor and I were talking?

265
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,700
That... can you not do it?

266
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,530
What?

267
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,560
Oh Ri Jin, even without remembering what happened in your past,

268
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,020
you're living very well in the present.

269
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,290
There are a lot of people who love you as well,

270
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,900
so do you really need to remember what happened in the past?

271
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,340
You said we should overcome it together.

272
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,210
If you're doing it for me, then please stop.

273
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,880
Just live your life as it is now.

274
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,480
Aye, you must have gotten scared.

275
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,770
Why?

276
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,390
Are you afraid that we could be entangled with some bad things?

277
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,340
Don't worry. One thing is for sure.

278
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,130
The possibility that I'm Mr. Shin's first love is very big.

279
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,670
That means that since Mr. Shin is you, I could also be your first love.

280
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:54,320
And you know what else? Some great memories could be hidden.

281
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,710
If we remember it, we would be really happy.

282
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,600
So let's try to remember them together.

283
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,930
If we do, it would be nice if they were really, really good memories.

284
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,900
Right?

285
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,650
Are you crying?
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

286
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,110
But why?
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and ♬

287
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,160
Which part of what I said touched you?

288
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:37,110
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent  ♬

289
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,840
♬  echoes in my ears every day  ♬

290
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,770
Don't cry.
♬  Where are you? ♬

291
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,720
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

292
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Why do you keep coming to me in my dreams with such a sad expression?

293
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,800
Do you have something to say to me?

294
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,630
Or is there something you're worried about?

295
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,240
Tell me. What are you so worried about?

296
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,220
Min Seo Yeon.

297
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,690
Hey, Min Seo Yeon!

298
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,250
[21 years ago]
You said you'll be coming to our restaurant once you came back to Korea. How come you're not coming?

299
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,760
Me and my husband are always waiting for you.

300
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,980
Soon Young, I have a request.

301
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,280
What's wrong with your voice?

302
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,820
Did something happen?

303
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,130
My daughter...

304
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,630
Please save my daughter.

305
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,640
What do you mean, daughter?

306
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,250
You have a daughter?

307
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,490
Right now, you're the only person I can trust.

308
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,070
That's why I'm asking you. Please go to our house in Seongbuk-dong and get my daughter.

309
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,060
You can't let anyone there touch her.

310
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,040
What are you saying... ?

311
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,580
Explain it in a way that I can understand.

312
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,190
It's almost time for me to board the plane. There's no time for me to explain.

313
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,230
Please save my daughter.

314
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,200
Then, I'll come in five...

315
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,130
No, I'll come within three days and get her.

316
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,280
Please do me a favor, Soon Young.

317
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,310
Seo Yeon! Hey, Seo Yeon!

318
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,140
If you said you were going to come, then you should have come no matter what.

319
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,180
How can you just pass away in vain like that?

320
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,250
You should have protected your own daughter. You should have protected her.

321
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,880
Your daughter...

322
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,340
No, our daughter grew up so well and prettily.

323
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,220
She got a handsome boyfriend, too.

324
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,170
You can't even see that...

325
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,460
It's me, President.

326
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,790
Yes. It has been confirmed that

327
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,720
from 1994 until now, for the past 21 years,

328
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,360
she had adopted and has been raising Min Seo Yeon's daughter.

329
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,540
I understand.

330
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,790
Be especially careful that you don't get discovered by anyone, and even if you are caught,

331
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,630
Keep in mind that I have nothing to do with this matter.

332
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,020
You understand what I mean, right?

333
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,930
What's wrong?

334
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,840
Judging from the fact that you're moving your own secret line of people,

335
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,870
it's not something ordinary.

336
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,400
Don't lose the chance to beat your enemy.
Bul Shil Jeok Ji Pae: Don't lose the chance to defeat your enemy

337
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,700
If I fail to grab a hold of my enemy's weak point today,

338
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,760
then there will come a day where they will grab mine.

339
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,330
I have a rough deduction of the enemy's weakness since I sense it real-time from the living room of the main residence.

340
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,930
Do you also have a weak point that can't be found out, Father?

341
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,010
Do you think that as someone who runs a big company, there wouldn't be anything on me, even just a speck of dust?

342
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,530
What happened to Chae Yeon's depression?

343
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,090
Ah, Mother said she'd placate her.

344
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,390
I saw you in the lobby of this hotel the other day.

345
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,370
You were drunk to the point where you couldn't even speak and left holding onto Do Hyun.

346
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,310
There is no one in this hotel who doesn't recognize us,

347
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,030
everyone probably knows whose fiancé you are.

348
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,500
But you're with another guy, in a condition where you can't hold your body up.

349
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,210
Isn't that a little off?

350
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,810
Even if he is your childhood friend, he's Ki Joon's second cousin.

351
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,290
I was wondering who Ki Joon took after that he'd keep his eyes on what other people are doing,

352
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,750
but I realize today that he is a lot like you.

353
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,730
Let's get over this quietly. Since you're not someone with poor judgement,

354
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,810
you wouldn't make this kind of mistake twice.

355
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,120
I'm trusting in you.

356
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,140
No, Ahjumma.

357
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,260
Don't trust in me.

358
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,870
What?

359
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,980
I can't trust my own self, so how could you trust me?

360
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,220
You're shrewd.

361
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,460
I'll take care of my problem my way.

362
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,120
I don't think you'd be in the mood to have a meal with me. I'll excuse myself.

363
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,030
Hey.

364
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,920
You must have seen wrong. Or just misunderstood their relationship...

365
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,540
Hey...

366
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,480
Don't yell.

367
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,000
I can hear everything you say well, even without yelling.

368
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,340
Is your son the only one who's so great?

369
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,620
My daughter is as successful and great as your son, you wench!

370
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,250
Fine! Let's break this engagement then!

371
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,350
What are you doing right now?

372
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,870
Let's call off the engagement.

373
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,810
Why do you keep acting like this?

374
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,270
How many times is this that you... ?

375
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,750
Do I seem like some kind of joke to you?

376
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,510
Has it started to become fun for you since I accept everything?

377
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,780
I've got someone...

378
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,520
who I want to have.

379
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,170
There's someone who I want to make mine.

380
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,510
It's wrong for me to have two hearts

381
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,780
and do this to you.

382
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,470
When did you become so nice, huh? Since when

383
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,450
have you worried about me?

384
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,350
I'm sorry.

385
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,510
Cha Do Hyun, this bastard.

386
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,090
I'm at the hospital now. I packed the bag that you left at home with some clothes so come and get it.

387
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,540
Huh? I'm on my way to Cha Do Hyun's house right now to get some things for his hospitalization.

388
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,110
Ah, what should we do? We missed each other.

389
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,080
I got it. Then I'll leave it with Cha Do Hyun and leave.

390
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,310
Why? What? Do you have something else to say?

391
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,400
It's me. Squad Leader Grissom.

392
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,210
Hyung-nim, did you find out anything?

393
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,210
It was way too easy to find this out.

394
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,330
It's Shin Hwa Ran.

395
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,970
According to the people in the real estate industry, she's quite the speculator (someone who closely monitors prices). She's the owner of most of the land in that area.

396
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,070
Of course, that villa is also under her name.

397
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,710
Are you sure it was Mother?

398
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,740
Yes.

399
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,220
We acquired the cellphone number of the leader of the group from the errand center,

400
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,620
his phone records with Madame have been confirmed. Especially the time of her last phone call...

401
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,570
coincides with the time of Oh Ri Jin's kidnapping.

402
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,000
Vice- President.

403
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,410
I'm getting discharged right now. Please handle the process.

404
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,200
What are you planning...?

405
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,990
I'm going to go meet up with my mother first.

406
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,860
Vice President, first you need to rest your body and let it...

407
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,300
Oh Ri On, it's Cha Do Hyun.

408
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,290
Oh Ri On.

409
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,680
I definitely warned you that if it was because of you, I wouldn't leave you alone.

410
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,250
That's why I told you that you can't be with her. I told you that you had no right!

411
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,740
You're Seungjin Group's son!

412
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,850
You have less right than me,

413
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,600
because you're Seungjin Group's son.

414
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,160
I told you not to create any more ties with her.

415
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,910
Why are you ignoring my warnings? Why? Why?! WHY?!!!

416
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,350
With this much, will he not have any difficulties while staying for two or three days?

417
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,110
Okay!

418
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,780
You liked it.

419
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,480
Who? Me? When?

420
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,840
It's not this?

421
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,160
It's not this, either?

422
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,150
How about this?

423
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,980
Choose.

424
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,900
Is it me or Cha Do Hyun?

425
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,540
I'll come again tomorrow night.

426
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,650
I'll come every single day.

427
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,020
I'm sorry. I'll come see you again tomorrow.

428
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,310
Can't you play a little bit more before you leave?

429
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,800
Instead, I...

430
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,410
will show you something cool.

431
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,970
...will show you something cool.

432
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,550
Something cool? What is it?

433
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,210
My Dad

434
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,590
Ah, Dad. What's wrong?

435
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,650
Yeah, Ri Jin, no matter how busy you are, you need to come home for a little while.

436
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,460
Why? Is something wrong?

437
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,450
Hey, your mom overworked herself this holiday and she's in the bed sick with fatigue.

438
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:03,110
Your mom said that as someone with a doctor for a daughter, she can't ever to go the hospital because it's annoying.

439
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,650
Ah, why? How much is she hurting? How about fever?

440
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,880
Hey, what good is there in having a daughter as a doctor? Don't say anything.

441
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,020
Just bring one IV drip and stop by for a moment, okay?

442
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,480
Then, I'll go. I'll be there soon.

443
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,740
When I was seven years old,

444
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,650
I suddenly got a younger twin sister.

445
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:35,420
That younger sister had no memories prior to her adoption.

446
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,200
She didn't even remember that she'd lost her memories.

447
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,930
Sometimes she would have nightmares at night,

448
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,360
and every time I would change those nightmares into an interesting, fun story.

449
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,810
She was horribly terrified of basements,

450
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:58,370
and every single time I would act like I was scared of them with her.

451
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,660
Then one day, I coincidentally overheard the conversation my parents were having.

452
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,760
There I ended up finding out about a chaebol group called Seungjin.

453
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,100
I guessed that my younger sister might somehow have some connection with

454
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,660
Seungjin Group.

455
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,230
So I started investigating Seungjin Group

456
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,420
and approached you.

457
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,230
I will find my younger sister's memories first

458
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,640
and decided whether I should cover them up or not.

459
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,100
But after my younger sister,

460
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,900
Ri Jin...

461
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,700
met you, Cha Do Hyun, she started remembering her memories.

462
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,560
There are a lot of warnings inside of my head right now.

463
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
"Stop her."

464
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,080
"If it goes on like this, it will become dangerous."
"Everyone will become unhappy."

465
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,840
If she ends up staying beside Cha Do Hyun in the future, at some point,

466
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,300
Ri Jin will end up remembering all of her memories.

467
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,410
And... someone who is afraid of Ri Jin's very existence

468
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,040
would scheme of something like what happened today.

469
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,540
I'm begging of you.

470
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,130
Cha Do Hyun, please let go of Ri Jin.

471
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,590
She doesn't listen to my words anymore.

472
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,690
The only one who can stop Ri Jin

473
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:46,110
is you, Cha do Hyun.

474
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,880
That's why...

475
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,100
I'm begging you.

476
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,960
Oh Ri On,

477
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,750
then...

478
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,130
will you also listen to my request?

479
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,750
I brought the most expensive one of these,

480
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,220
so don't take it out in the middle and you have to take all of it, to the very last drop.

481
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,250
It's not like I'm a critical patient. Your dad is overreacting.

482
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:46,450
Even so, I couldn't actually worry about you guys' health, because I was so busy working,

483
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,260
- so let me take credit for this at least.
- You are?

484
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,190
Of course, I'm taking credit for this. I'm really expensive.

485
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,120
I've earned a lot from being paid as a personal physician.

486
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,070
I'm not the kind of person who makes house calls to just anyone, you know.

487
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,230
Aigoo, I wonder where all this smartness and prettiness came from?

488
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,510
Where would it come from?

489
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,830
It came from my mom's heart.

490
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,680
Ri Jin.

491
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,550
What, Mom?

492
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,910
Don't you want to know

493
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,170
who your parents are?

494
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,180
Don't you want to know?

495
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,670
Later.

496
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,590
When I get curious later, I'll ask you.

497
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,230
Alright. Let's do that.

498
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,880
If you get curious, let's do it then.

499
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,070
Please, I'm begging you, Cha Do Hyun.

500
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,830
Please don't take away Ri Jin and my family's happiness.

501
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,020
Why is Do Hyun suddenly telling me to come see him?

502
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,560
I'm not sure. Wouldn't it be for the reason that you think it is, Madam?

503
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,180
Why did you do that?

504
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,990
I... I did wrong.

505
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,930
I don't know why I did it either.

506
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,790
You treated me like such a sinner yesterday..

507
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:27,070
That's why... I went completely crazy...

508
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,950
Hey... Why is your face like that?

509
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,930
I'm so upset, seriously. This will scar...

510
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:46,440
Is it because Oh Ri Jin is the dead Min Seo Yeon's daughter?

511
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,280
Do Hyun., you knew everything?

512
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,170
Answer me first!

513
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,370
What did Oh Ri Jin do wrong?

514
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,520
What in the world did she do to you that was so wrong that you'd even sneakily kidnap her?

515
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,510
Kid- kidnap? Do Hyun, that's a misunderstanding!

516
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:12,610
I was just going to call her over quietly to ask what kind of intentions she approached you with.

517
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,250
I just wanted to pry out why she hid her identity and why she is hiding like a stray cat.

518
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,680
I was just going to ask her why she approached you and stuck around you.

519
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,690
Oh Ri Jin did not even once hid her identity!
The reason why is...

520
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,140
that girl...

521
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,320
can't remember her past at all.

522
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,830
She can't remember?

523
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,830
She can't remember what you all did to her

524
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,490
or what type of pain you put her through at all.

525
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,120
That's good.

526
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,120
It's such a relief.

527
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,990
Gee, I thought she's coming onto you using her past as a pretext.

528
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,480
Are you human?

529
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,260
Do Hyun.

530
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,980
Are you still someone's mother even after doing that?!

531
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,030
You undutiful bastard.

532
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,760
You left the house for 6 years,

533
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,350
hammering a nail into my heart...

534
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,020
That's not even enough for you that you have to be laying down like this for over 20 years?

535
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,070
I've been waiting for you to wake up for so long.

536
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,530
Joon Pyo did? Joon Pyo came back?

537
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,240
Why'd you take so long to come back? Why?

538
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,200
I'm sorry, Mother.

539
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,370
It's not even one year, but 6 years!

540
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,850
How could you live in hiding like that without giving me even a piece of news about you?

541
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,790
Do you know how much I looked for you?

542
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,930
Where and how have you been?

543
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,400
Have you been eating well? Huh?

544
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,680
Let's hurry up and go in. Let's go in, okay?

545
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,070
Who is this kid?

546
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,850
He's my son.

547
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,030
He has to go to school next year

548
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,440
so he needs a family register.

549
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,620
Your son?

550
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,120
Yes.

551
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,600
That woman...

552
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,230
Why is she here?

553
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,550
Who is that kid?

554
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,850
Who would she be? She's your kid.

555
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,850
Seo Yeon gave birth to her in the US and brought her here.

556
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,150
My child?

557
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,350
Back then, if only your father

558
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,760
had not brought Min Seo Yeon back to the house...

559
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,420
If he only just dealt with you a little more leniently...

560
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,780
If only that child...

561
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,900
were your child,

562
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,670
this tragedy would have not begun.

563
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,780
I don't know where to start correcting things anymore.

564
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,630
I'll give you one last chance.

565
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,170
Will you give up your attachment to Seungjin,

566
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,750
let go of all of your useless ambition and greed, and leave for America with me?

567
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,650
I can't do that. You know that!

568
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,020
Abandon everything and leave with me,

569
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,340
for your remaining life... Do you have any intention of atoning for your sins?

570
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:56,460
Do Hyun, now... we're almost there! We're almost there!

571
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,990
I told you. Seungjin does not have any other alternative aside from you.

572
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:06,230
That old hag? She won't be able to hang in there for long. She will hand it to you soon.

573
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:11,040
So can't you just forgive your mom and dad just this once?

574
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,160
You're still not saying that you'll choose your son over Seungjin Group to the end.

575
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,360
I definitely gave you a chance.

576
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,270
You're the one who chose the company over your son, Grandmother.

577
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:31,480
The one who threw away her last chance to save her son,

578
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,350
it was nobody else but you, Chairwoman Seo Tae Im.

579
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,420
The Chairwoman who chose the company over her son,

580
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,850
and the mother who can't end her greed and throw it away even though her son begged her,

581
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,010
just how far are you two going to go?

582
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,160
Exactly how much more are you going to do?

583
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,490
Do Hyun... Do Hyun, please--

584
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,100
There's no use for your pleas.

585
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,520
Because your son unfortunately has no right to become the owner of Seungjin Group.

586
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,740
Why don't you have the right?

587
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,640
You're your father's only bloodline. Why do you not have a right?!

588
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,680
Because you all...

589
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,090
broke my mental state into pieces.

590
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,690
I have multiple personality disorder.

591
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,710
No way! Hey, you're joking, right?

592
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,800
You're just lying because you're mad at me, right?

593
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,890
You're just, to your mother... You're just saying this, right?

594
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,400
Get up!

595
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,070
Do Hyun...

596
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,230
I'm warning you. From now on,

597
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,150
don't call her out.

598
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,440
Do you understand what I'm saying?

599
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,980
The Shin Se Gi you met

600
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,470
is one of the rotating alternate personalities inside here.

601
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,590
How could this be? How could this be, my son!

602
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,360
Do you understand now?

603
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,090
What kind of a tragedy your greed has created?

604
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:17,460
This disease...is there anyone else who knows about it?

605
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,690
Does Secretary Ahn also know about it?

606
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,140
That child doesn't know, right?

607
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,080
Do Hyun, listen to your mother carefully.

608
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,490
Your disease. It must not be found out by anyone.

609
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,300
The second it's found out, you will lose your place as the heir.

610
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,110
Promise with your mother. That you will never get caught.

611
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,000
I finally...

612
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,260
know how to end your greed.

613
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,010
What are you saying?

614
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:06,700
My disease...to Seungjin, to the world,

615
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,570
I will reveal it to everyone.

616
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,300
No...

617
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,960
You can't do it. No...

618
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,290
So make a choice.

619
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,400
Will you leave with me?

620
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,720
Do you have a hobby of "coming out" these days?

621
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,980
What are you saying?

622
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,500
I heard you thanked Mom for raising you like her own child.

623
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,100
She thought you didn't know about it. She looked surprised.

624
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,620
So that's why she's sick.

625
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,570
After feigning ignorance for 21 years and

626
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,970
living naively, why are you suddenly doing this?

627
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,760
Just because. I feel like it's the right time now.

628
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,690
Time?

629
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,960
The time to seriously look back at my past.

630
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,680
The time when even if I look back at it, I don't think the ground beneath my feet will shake.

631
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,890
The time when even if shakes me, I'm certain that it won't

632
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,060
completely collapse.

633
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,990
Did you feel like it would in the past?

634
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,180
Well, no, it's not like that,

635
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,770
since I didn't even think of wanting to remember

636
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,010
or being curious about it back then.

637
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:45,600
But now, I'm starting to get really curious.

638
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,900
What is hidden in the past that I can't remember.

639
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:55,910
I also feel a little excited.

640
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,280
Is it because of that guy?

641
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,460
The reason you want to look for your past,

642
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,450
the reason why you even feel excited while looking for your past,

643
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,060
is it Cha Do Hyun?

644
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,980
I don't know.

645
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,040
It might be. It might not be.

646
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,420
Can't you just

647
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,730
think it's because it's the right time?

648
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,080
Oh?

649
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,200
Why is a person that should be in the hospital over there?

650
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,860
Thanks for giving me a ride.

651
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,830
Be careful on your way back.

652
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,010
What are you doing here, for someone who needs to be at the hospital.

653
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,270
Don't tell me...you were already discharged?

654
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,550
If you were discharged, you should be resting inside at home.

655
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,250
It's this cold. What are you doing out here?

656
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,280
Could it be that you were waiting for me?

657
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,630
Yes. I was waiting for you.

658
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,980
You were waiting for me when you don't know when I'll be back?

659
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,050
You would come eventually.

660
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,240
Now that I look at you, you resemble our Ri Na(her dog).

661
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,460
Our Ri Na would also be waiting for me even though she doesn't know when I would come.

662
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,050
Hand.

663
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,470
Oh... aigoo...how cute.

664
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:54,360
Aigoo, how nice. How clever.

665
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,720
Please do me a favor.
Cha Do Hyun, please let go of Ri Jin.

666
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,010
The only one who can stop Ri Jin is you, Cha Do Hyun.

667
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:15,700
Then...can you also do me a favor?

668
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:22,790
Before I send away Oh Ri Jin, please give me just one day.

669
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,080
Now that I think about it, I only received things.
I didn't give her anything.

670
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,590
Because of me, she was always anxious,

671
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:39,160
waiting, and crying.
♫ A secret that ♫

672
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,010
I never saw her smile brightly.
♫ Cannot be told to anyone ♫

673
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,410
One day, only one day,

674
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,510
I want to spend it solely on Ri Jin.

675
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,060
I want to make her smile brightly.

676
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,980
Because Oh Ri Jin...

677
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:13,190
she was the first person to enter

678
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,060
my castle that has always been desolate and cold.

679
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,410
If you don't have any questions, I guess the deal's on.

680
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,890
Here.

681
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:31,520
She was the first person to hold out her hand.

682
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,200
So you really were a doctor.

683
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,670
And you're not Shin Se Gi.

684
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,960
She was the person who noticed

685
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,850
that our eyes were different with one glance.

686
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:52,300
She was the person who asked for my name.

687
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,730
Then, what's your name?

688
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,620
Why are you here only now!

689
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,290
She was the person who waited anxiously for me to come back.

690
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,970
She was the person who gave me the warmest snowman in the world.

691
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,860
She was the person who told me words that

692
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,480
were more consoling than a 1000 words.

693
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,610
She was the person who could make me happy

694
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:39,450
just from looking at her.

695
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,280
And...

696
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,040
she is the person who I can't make it up to

697
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,590
even if I atone for the rest of my life.

698
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:00,290
Let's go in now, you'll get a cold.

699
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,190
Do you want to go see the Snowflake train tomorrow?

700
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,560
Huh?

701
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,150
The promise that I couldn't keep last time, I want to keep it.

702
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,710
Deal?

703
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,990
Deal! Of course, deal!

704
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:33,370
♫I will just hurt your heart♫

705
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:37,530
One day in the far future, when much time has passed and

706
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,370
Oh Ri Jin has forgotten me,

707
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:49,540
when she doesn't feel anything even if she's thought of me,

708
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,270
and if Oh Ri Jin happens to be pained from her past,

709
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,750
tell her this.

710
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,280
"It's not because you did something wrong

711
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,480
or because you didn't have the right to be loved,

712
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,060
that you were abused.

713
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:21,800
You definitely have the right to be loved.

714
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,930
That you shine so brightly and are so lovely

715
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:32,300
that it's only right for you to be loved."

716
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,060
So to forget about it.

717
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,530
So live while being loved from now on.

718
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,760
Yay!

719
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,390
♬ The hidden things inside me changed me greatly  ♬

720
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,920
♬ It put me to sleep, tied my hands together, then locked me in a dark room ♬

721
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,300
♬ The lost pieces of time ♬
♬ The memories of love, which I abandoned ♬
