1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,770
What? Are you scared?

2
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,130
It's not real. It's a paranoia, a delusion.

3
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,040
What (do you think) is the cause of the disease?

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,710
There must be a reason why he has multiple personalities.

5
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,340
That's probably hidden in his lost memories.

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,870
He does not have any memory from when he was seven to eight.

7
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,810
Are you saying he's enduring it by himself?

8
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,550
About Oh Ri Jin,

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,990
she's not a patient. She's a psychiatrist.

10
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,420
Miss Heo Sook Hee!

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,110
Miss Heo Sook Hee!

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,590
Miss Heo Sook Hee!

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,070
Kill Me, Heal Me

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,350
Excuse me, but who are you?

15
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,730
Perhaps, do you have a bomb?

16
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,660
Perhaps, do you have a leather jacket?

17
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,510
Then, what is your name?

18
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,870
You promised to let me know your name if we made it out of there alive.

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,510
What is

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,750
your name?

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,300
Cha Do Hyun.

22
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,570
The owner of this face and the gaze in my eyes right now.

23
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,660
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

24
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,060
Episode 4

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,320
Hey, hey. Why-why? What's going on?

26
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,200
You know that guy from last time that Doctor Oh got dumped on after two hours of booking.

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,630
What about that person?

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,190
He came to visit Doctor Oh in an expensive suit and a foreign car.

29
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,130
Hurry up and come!

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Why do doctors lately like gossip so much?

31
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,350
He came here in a foreign car?

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,280
Are your wounds okay?

33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,620
You didn't receive treatment and just left the
last time you were here.

34
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,460
I treated myself, so you don't need to worry.

35
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,580
You treated yourself? You weren't treated by someone?

36
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,510
Ah... Th-that's not it...

37
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,160
Oh Ri Jin! Don't be like this

38
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,590
Wow, did you also study medicine treatment techniques?

39
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,420
That's not it.

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,070
Don't even try to lie. Your expressions and the evidence aren't helping.

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,340
As a professional, it's lacking; but as an amateur, it's pretty good.

42
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,660
Illegal surgery? Or self-treatment?

43
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,490
Small injuries, I can take care of myself.

44
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,340
Wow, you're totally Batman.

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,440
At night, do you attach bat wings to yourself and fly around Gotham City?

46
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,170
So, what brings you to my hospital?

47
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,880
Oh, I had something that I wanted to ask you.

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,200
You came to meet me?

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
Can you give me some of your time?

50
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,320
But what are those people doing?

51
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,480
Doctor Oh!

52
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,500
Why are you like that? Is there a problem?

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,430
Cha Do Hyun, you said you wanted to ask me something, right?

54
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,640
I'll give you answers. All of it, everything...

55
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,930
In return, there's something that you have to do for me.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,700
You must feel that it's unfair since this problem is something Se Gi created, but what can we do?

57
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,800
You have to rectify this!

58
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,090
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,690
I don't feel good about asking you this favor either, but what choice do I have?

60
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,440
From titles like booking to easily-dumped, shouldn't I do something to fix my reputation that has fallen to the ground?

61
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,030
I will try my best.

62
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,260
3 meters ahead is Doctor Kang In Gu, who has been a resident for three years.

63
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,270
His nickname is 'Dispunch', who knows all the gossip scandals in the hospital!

64
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,220
Move, move!

65
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,510
Hello, Dr. Kang In Gyu.

66
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,930
Ah, yes-yes.

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,250
I heard a lot about you from my Ri Jin.

68
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,410
Ah, yes.

69
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,380
My Ri Jin?

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,470
But I wonder what Doctor Oh has said so much about me?

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,100
Oh, she said that you are the tonic-like senior who always energizes everyone with your personality!

72
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,660
She said even when she's tired, whenever she sees you, her strength recovers.

73
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,740
Huh? This is too exaggerated.

74
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,510
What do you mean, tonic?

75
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,620
It's not like I'm some kind of a nourishment tonic.

76
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,450
That's too exaggerating, Dr. Oh.

77
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,850
No way! He is actually believing this?

78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,520
It's been hard for you lately, right?

79
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,090
The first year is usually the hardest.

80
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,330
Be strong! Fighting!

81
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,190
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

82
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,260
Fighting!

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,400
He's believing it! He's believing it! He's believing it!

84
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,900
Towards the two o'clock direction, Nurse Joo Mi Ran. Her nickname is Geu Al.

85
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,080
Geu Al?

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,670
The abbreviation for 'I want to know that'.

87
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,400
She's more curious than Kim Sang Joong, that if I was really dumped in two hours. (Kim Sang Joong is the host for TV Show "I want to know that")

88
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,250
Hello, Nurse Joo.

89
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,700
Yes, I am.

90
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,590
As my Ri Jin has said, you're really a beauty.

91
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,650
Beauty, as if.

92
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,540
Teacher Oh, where is the club? Where did you do the booking?

93
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,970
I want to know that place.

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,430
At 9 o'clock is Doctor Shin Sun Jo.

95
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,210
He thinks that the booking, hospitalization, flower basket, and presents were all planned by me.

96
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,160
Hello, Doctor Shin Sun Jo?

97
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,420
I heard that you had a rough time for the duration my Ri Jin was hospitalized.

98
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,710
No-no! What hard time?

99
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,710
Please allow us to eat lunch together some time.

100
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,380
My Ri Jin is re--ally thankful.

101
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,570
Please continue with your work.

102
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,090
Is this funny? Are you a horse?
Are you a cow? Are you a pig?

103
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,390
Aigoo, I really...

104
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,280
At 8 o'clock is Chief Park Mi Jae.

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,640
Should I have you take off your medical coat and have you hospitalized? Should we go through the formalities?

106
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,870
Hey, I'll see you after.

107
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,440
Se Gi held him up by his neck and threatened him.

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,960
Doctor Park Min Jae!

109
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,880
Why is he working so hard? He is ruining the probability.

110
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,680
The flow until now was good. Cha Do Hyun!

111
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,340
Do Hyun, Do Hyun?

112
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,590
Doctor Park! Wait!

113
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,620
Stop it now! If you do that, he'll get more scared!

114
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,370
Doctor Park!

115
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,090
Doctor Park! Wait! I have something to tell you...

116
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,620
Why are you like this?

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,440
I haven't done anything wrong to Doctor Oh.

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,300
I know that.

119
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,640
Right. I just made her prepare some theses, just theses.

120
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,010
But other than that I swear--

121
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,380
Huh?

122
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,350
Why are you kneeling?

123
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,300
I am sorry.

124
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,270
That day

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,290
under the influence of alcohol I made a big mistake.

126
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,980
Yes? What? What did you say? I mean yes?

127
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,390
When I drink alcohol, I become a different person.

128
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,000
I should have controlled myself.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,430
That night, I drank too much. I'm sorry.

130
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:28,420
Well, that... If you made a mistake, then it must be the alcohol. It's not you.

131
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,050
-Yo (adding formal speech).

132
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,870
- Stand up, quickly.
- Because he's taking care of the things his personalities did,

134
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,300
he's been battling hard for eleven years alone.

135
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,820
As if he is fighting a battle that will never end alone.

136
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,680
Aigoo, quickly get up!

137
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,810
It's fine. Please.

138
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,290
- I'm sorry.
- Make me an iced carbonated drink and Secretary Choi, come see me.

139
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,140
Yes-yes.

140
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,670
You're certain, right?

141
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,190
It can't be an assumption or a guess. If it's not a fact...

142
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,200
you know I am dead, right?

143
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,290
How's the finding?

144
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,000
We couldn't check all the city hospitals yet, but--

145
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,940
I found an interesting fact through one of my sources.

146
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,390
Ah, really? It's already interesting.

147
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,390
Yes. At Kanghan Hospital, he was not recorded to have received treatment recently in the emergency room,

148
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,280
but there was someone who recognized Vice President Cha Do Hyun's photo that they've brought.

149
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,680
For what reason?

150
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,960
It seems he had a scandal with that hospital's psychiatrist.

151
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,070
Psychiatrist?

152
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,900
Yes, her name is Oh Ri Jin.

153
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,570
They said she's a first year resident.

154
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,340
It's not just that. I had a hunch so I hired someone to find out

155
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,360
and they said a while ago Secretary Ahn met with that hospital's psychiatrist.

156
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,530
Secretary Ahn met with a psychiatrist?

157
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,820
Yes. According to that informant, uh, he said it didn't seem like they were meeting for the first time.

158
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,160
Who is the doctor that he is meeting?

159
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,470
His name is Doctor Seok Ho Pil. They say he's a very famous doctor in the psychiatry department.

160
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,510
He worked in Johns Hopkins Hospital, and returned to Korea four years ago.

161
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,760
Here. Thank you.

162
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm saved thanks to you.

163
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,970
It was nothing.

164
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,510
Well, since it's all something that happened because of me anyway.

165
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,290
Oh, but before you were really good at acting.

166
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,090
Oh right. You said you wanted to ask me something.

167
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,160
Ask me. I will answer you with my greatest effort, since you worked hard.

168
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,230
Perhaps,

169
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,250
when you met Se Gi...

170
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,440
Did he ask you for any favor?

171
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,920
A favor?

172
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,040
A favor...

173
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,410
If Se Gi approached Oh RI Jin, who is a doctor, to get rid of me...

174
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,460
Oh, he asked me a favor.

175
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,970
What kind of favor?

176
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,940
He asked me to play with him.

177
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,480
- He asked you to play with him?
- Yes.

178
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,490
-Then what did you do?
- Don't move!

179
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,830
You're doing well.

180
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,300
You're doing well, you're doing well...

181
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,730
Now, slowly turn around.

182
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,500
Se Gi followed that order?

183
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,260
Yes, just at first. But later, he said to knock it off because it wasn't fun.

184
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,150
Why?

185
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,430
What? Is there a problem?

186
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,620
It's not a problem, it's just a little strange.

187
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,950
Se Gi would never listen to someone else's orders.

188
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,870
Oh, it was only that time. After that, he totally acted how he wanted.

189
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,460
Other than that, did he ask you for another favor?

190
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,240
Another favor? What kind?

191
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,710
Like if he asked you to do something as a doctor.

192
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,850
Eh, no way. Se Gi didn't even know I was a doctor.

193
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,420
Psychiatrist Oh Ri Jin
Kanghan Hospital

194
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,430
Psychiatrist? That's not good.

195
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,470
You and I have bad fate together.

196
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,100
Are you sure he said that? That you two could have a bad fate?

197
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,560
Yes. Rather, he looked like he was disappointed after he found out that I was a doctor.

198
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,790
If he didn't approach her for being a doctor, then why?

199
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,880
Although he said something striking, he said he found his first love.

200
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,430
Perhaps, it's not Chae Yeon, but Oh Ri Jin, who is Se Gi's first love?

201
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,820
What's wrong? Is there something strange again?

202
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,580
Then that night, it wasn't the first time they met at the club?

203
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,380
Then when in the world did those two meet?

204
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,860
Cha Do Hyun,

205
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,850
are you alright?

206
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,840
-Oh Ri Jin.
- Yes.

207
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,280
Perhaps, before, I- no... Have you met Se Gi before?

208
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,190
No, I saw him for the first time at the club.

209
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,600
-Are you sure?
- I think so.

210
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,840
Please look at me closely again. Was there really a time we both met--

211
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,300
You called me.

212
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,440
You called me.

213
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,010
A long, long time ago.

214
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,100
Cha Do Hyun, are you alright?

215
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,200
What are you looking at right now?

216
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,370
What's wrong?

217
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,450
Is it a migraine aura (pre-seizure sensation)?

218
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,200
Wait here. I'll go get a tranquilizer.

219
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,570
Oh Ri Jin, listen to what I have to say.

220
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,930
From now on, you have to avoid me at all costs.

221
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,770
If I appear, hide. If I come closer, flee.

222
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,340
If I hold onto you, you have to run away even by kicking or hitting me.

223
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,480
Do you understand what I'm saying?

224
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,380
Why do I... have to do that?

225
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,680
Because it's not me, but Se Gi.

226
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,010
He is very dangerous.

227
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,100
It could not be Se Gi, but you, Cha Do Hyun.

228
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,510
No, that'll never happen.

229
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,930
From this moment on, I'm never

230
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,770
thinking of appearing in front of you.

231
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,960
Promise me. That you'll do as I say.

232
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,870
Did you always send people away like this?

233
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,830
Answer! Understand?!

234
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,380
Keep it in mi--!

235
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,690
Cha Do Hyun, are you alright?

236
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,010
Wait here.

237
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,360
-Doctor Oh...
- Where's Lorazepam and Alprazolam?

238
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,430
-Ah, I'll find it for you...
- Ah...

239
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,980
Found it. Thanks.

240
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,730
Oh Ri Jin.

241
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
-Yes, it's Cha Do Hyun.
 -Where are you right now?

242
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,580
Have you forgotten my warning already? I'm sure I told you to avoid me at all costs.

243
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,870
How are you feeling? Do you have a headache?

244
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,630
Is there no problem with your breathing?

245
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm not your patient.

246
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,350
I know. But, right now, you need treatment.

247
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,500
You aren't my doctor.

248
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,360
I know that, too.

249
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,060
If you hate me talking as a doctor, I'll speak as a friend instead.

250
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,940
For the time being, come to the hospital. We still haven't finished talking.

251
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,090
- Oh Ri Jin.
- Yes.

252
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,700
I don't make friends.

253
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,470
I don't need friends.

254
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,790
I'll say it one more time.

255
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,340
It's either hiding, avoiding or running away.

256
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,530
- Cha Do Hyun!
-  In my warning, calling me is also included.

257
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,260
Don't do it. I won't answer.

258
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,380
Don't pick up either. It's dangerous.

259
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,210
I'll be hanging up.

260
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,240
Cha Do Hyun! Hello? Hello?

261
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,170
Ah! Why is he so arrogant!

262
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,960
We avoided a bomb and escaped from a fire together. After escaping from a life-and-death situation, how can he act like this?

263
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,390
What's a big deal with having multiple personalities? Is he a beast under a spell?

264
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,080
If he's a beast, then like a beast he should get help from a beauty! A beauty's help!

265
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,150
What are you looking at right now?

266
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,050
What is this? What was that? What could that have been?

267
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,300
Am I crazy? Am I going crazy?

268
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,590
Play with me now.

269
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,270
Did you have a nightmare?

270
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,300
I haven't had one in a long time.

271
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,020
Has my energy gotten weaker?

272
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,830
What's this? Is this a dream?

273
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,740
- A bad dream? A nightmare?!
- It hurts! I said it hurts!

274
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,380
- Ah, seriously. 
- It doesn't look like it's a dream.

275
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,040
- Then why are you sitting here?
- Then why are you lying here? Weren't you in the middle of being hospitalized?

276
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,220
I was discharged so I got back to work. That's why I'm sitting here.

277
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,580
Aish, then you should have called. Why are you making a busy person come all the way to the hospital?

278
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,810
- Why are you fussing? Did I call you? Did I call you?
- I sent him.

279
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,390
I asked him to discharge you if you were still hospitalized and bring you home.

280
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,400
Why do you think? It's because I was so busy working I couldn't visit you often.

281
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,370
I wanted to make you feel better by having you near me and feeding you my food.

282
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,190
But how can you go back to work already?

283
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,650
Without telling me.

284
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,300
I got it then. Anyway eat well and

285
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,060
on you day-off, don't go anywhere else and come straight home.

286
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,490
I got it, hang up.

287
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,180
- It looks good.
- Please have some.

288
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,040
I will drink well.

289
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,140
The bok choy didn't grow fully.

290
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,540
Really? If the bok choy hears you, it will become sad.

291
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,420
It's organic. It tried its hardest to grow.

292
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,250
After hearing that, you're right. You worked hard trying to grow!

293
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,980
Why? Is he saying they won't let her get discharged?

294
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,140
That's not it but, she said she already went back to work.

295
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,450
Why? Are you sad? You're worried about your daughter?

296
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,190
What do you mean sad and worried? She must be going back to work because she feels like she can.

297
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,580
She got a hundred percent on her collegeentrance exam and went to medical school. And you keep telling her to lie down in bed if she's having a hard time,

298
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,620
or get inside Mom's underskirt if she gets tired?

299
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,610
-I'm just thinking it's a national waste. A national waste.
-Don't exaggerate.

300
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,170
- You exaggerate every time you open your mouth.
- He's saying the truth though.

301
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,140
The whole town knows that Ri Jin got a hundred percent on her college entrance exam.

302
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,660
See, even Boss says I'm right. I'm a person who doesn't say incorrect things.

303
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,380
Ah, but... just who does Ri Jin resemble that she's so smart?

304
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,650
What do you mean who does she resemble? She resembles me! Me.

305
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,950
That's not right. It's Ri On who looks exactly like you, President Oh.

306
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,260
Ri Jin resembles me.

307
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,290
I'm not sure. I don't think that's really it either.

308
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,330
Is that so? Everyone says she resembles me.

309
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,910
But now that I see it, not all twins look the same.

310
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,620
One person is very intelligent, and the other one is hopeless in academics.

311
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,500
They are twins, and they don't look alike either.

312
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,030
If a stranger saw them, who would call them biological siblings?

313
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,630
You're speaking really strangely. If the child doesn't resemble their parents, then who do they resemble?

314
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,740
- Does the child have to ignorant just because the parent is?
- Why are you suddenly acting sensitive?
- Also,

315
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,240
are there only identical twins? They are fraternal twins. It's possible for them to not look alike.

316
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,610
Why are you suspicious of whether they are real siblings or not?

317
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,890
If they're not biological siblings, then are you saying my husband and I had our own child separately and brought them in or what?

318
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,550
- I was just saying it as a joke.
- Take this with you.

319
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,950
- I cannot cook with these low-quality vegetables.
- Honey! Honey!

320
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,950
President Jang, please understand. Something upsetting happened to Ri Jin so she's a bit uptight. We can use these vegetable. Hey, Honey!

321
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:51,210
Ah, that. Why are you acting sensitively today? It's unlike you.

322
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,940
He always does that.

323
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,230
The only son that their family had in difficulty in three generations is a fool.

324
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,620
He is just acting petulant because his children are like that.

325
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,340
Why are you so mad about that?

326
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,070
Ask other people and see if they have vegetables we can buy.

327
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,860
He's saying that because he doesn't know. Because he doesn't know. If he knew, do you think he would say that?

328
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,220
Aren't you going to prepare for the business?

329
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,470
- Trampoline?
- You know that round thing where if you jump on it, you bounce up.

330
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,820
I know what that is.

331
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,310
-But that came out in your dream?
-Yeah.

332
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,930
I was playing with a boy on top of that.

333
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,430
Who is that boy?

334
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,140
I thought it was you.

335
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,680
Give me an appearance fee.

336
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,140
I couldn't see the face so I don't know who it is for sure.

337
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,320
So if we try to organize it,

338
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,270
in your dream you looked like you were about 7 years old.

339
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,240
And you were jumping on a trampoline with a little boy who's the same age as you.

340
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,350
But it was vivid as if it was something that actually happened.

341
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,020
Perhaps, do you not remember? When we were young, was there not a trampoline in the yard?

342
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,880
Do you have no memories of playing on it with me?

343
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,060
Wait a minute so I can think.

344
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,940
Who is that man?

345
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,120
Wow. Did our Doctor Oh get attached to another man in a day?

346
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,090
Doctor Oh is unexpectedly a femme fatale.

347
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,060
He's not her man, he's her brother. Her twin brother.

348
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,140
He's not her brother. When I saw them at the resting room before, his gaze while looking at Doctor Oh sleeping was totally man-like.

349
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,220
Miss Heo Sook Hee. Catch her!

350
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,380
Ah. Still, the clues are lacking.

351
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:46,300
Was there anything else that was special? Other than you and the kid, if there was another person.

352
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,410
- Another person?
- So there was.

353
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,620
So there was. Who is it? Who?

354
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,770
- It's a person you wouldn't know even if I told you.
- So it's a man.

355
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,650
Ah. Perhaps, did you have an erotic dream?

356
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,040
Did it start out innocent and turned erotic?

357
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,980
- Forget it!
- Say it. Who is it?
- I said it's a person who you won't know even if I tell you.

358
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,120
You said to interpret it from a writer's point of view!

359
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,210
I have to know what kind of man he is for me to know his reasons behind this.

360
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,390
And I can only interpret the dream only if I know his reasoning.

361
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,960
The interpretation needs to be possible to know if your dream was a meaningless dream or a part of an actual memory.

362
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,930
- Are you playing in front of a psychiatrist right now?
- Come on sister!

363
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,590
- The guy who came at me saying he liked me.
- Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

364
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,840
- You're a cult maniac seeing how your taste is unique.
- Forget it!
- How did he come at you?

365
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,420
You won't understand, even if I tell you. And if something did happen, then what? What?

366
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,670
A man knows men well.

367
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,270
If I listen to how that man flirted with you,

368
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,450
I will see if he is being sincere, or trying to trick you into buying something from him,

369
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,890
or if he's just a playboy. I can estimate him, you know?

370
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,100
- Really?
- Really, really.

371
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,100
So believe this brother and tell me quickly.

372
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,180
- A comment.
- A comment?

373
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,020
What did he say?

374
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,200
"You called me. A long, long time ago. Now play with me."

375
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,160
What's wrong? Does it mean something bad?

376
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,730
Do you have the confidence not to be shocked?

377
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,170
Tell me each sentence. I'll translate it.

378
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,310
- You called me.
- You sent me a signal.

379
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,330
- A long, long time ago.
- Just a little while ago.

380
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,930
Now, play with me.

381
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,180
- Now, go to a hotel with me.
- Die, die, die, die. Get out. Get out.

382
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,950
You're not ready to accept the truth right now!

383
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,830
Go, go. Just go. Hurry, go.

384
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,510
-Wow, you're really angry. You're really angry.
- Go away!
- I got it. I'm going. I'm going.

385
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,870
Ah, I remember! The trampoline.

386
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,030
- You remember?
- That...

387
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,050
probably wasn't our house's yard but a nearby park.

388
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,040
You know, our next door neighbor ahjusshi let us borrow it and we took it outside to play with. Don't you remember?

389
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,550
I'm right, I'm right. There's no doubt about it.

390
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,200
That kid is...

391
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,940
is me, so give me my appearance fee.

392
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,510
Did you just make up the memory so you can get your appearance fee?

393
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,490
How dare you not know that I own many copyrights!

394
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,160
And you must never meet that man.

395
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,050
Looking at his bad pickup lines, he is a conman.

396
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,600
Look, he is going to ask you to buy something later.

397
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,820
Some kind of 'magnetic bedding', 'life-giving water', 'jade mat'--

398
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,580
Leave, leave, leave! Quickly, leave!

399
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,620
Leave! leave! Please leave, leave, leave!

400
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll go! Ooh...

401
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,370
Peace.

402
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,630
Just what kind of punk is it? The guy who's shaking up my little sister's heart.

403
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,530
Sorry for lying to you.

404
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,170
But, don't think about it.

405
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,340
Your childhood and the guy shaking up your heart.

406
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,700
Because it breaks your brother's heart as he's looking at you.

407
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,920
Calling him a conman is too much. He's a good person.

408
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,490
Ah, fine. Let's not think about it.

409
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,220
-Hello?
-  Is this Oh Ri Jin's cellphone?

410
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,400
Yes, I am Oh Ri Jin.

411
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm Cha Do Hyun's secretary, Ahn Gook.

412
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,500
Cha Do Hyun's secretary?

413
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,940
Yes. Is Cha Do Hyun with you right now?

414
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,630
No, we met at the hospital yesterday, but he left right away---

415
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,680
Cha Do Hyun, are you alright?

416
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,280
Perhaps, did something happen to Cha Do Hyun?

417
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,810
After he went out to meet you yesterday, I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

418
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,580
Then... are you saying he's gone missing?

419
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,180
It's hard to come to a conclusion. So you are not with him currently?

420
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,250
If he calls you, contact me on this phone number right away.

421
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,100
Yes, excuse me. Then.

422
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,240
When did you come, President?

423
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,620
I had something to discuss with him before the meeting, but he must have not come to work yet.

424
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,380
In the morning he left for a meeting with Hwamoo Media. It seems like the conversation is getting longer.

425
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,440
If it's urgent, should I give him a call?

426
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,790
An unauthorized absence...

427
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,170
Punk, he's making me worry about him when I'm busy.

428
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,710
Yes, Father.

429
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,970
How is Do Hyun? Is he adjusting to his new life?

430
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,400
Why are you talking about someone else's son after calling out your busy son? Making me jealous.

431
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,690
The reaction of him at the board meeting is not bad. He must have gave them a good first impression.

432
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,300
The directors who served his grandfather

433
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,720
and directors who weren't sure what to think of him are now looking at him with interest.

434
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,600
Isn't how he removed his veil in itself dramatic?

435
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,680
It will be a battlefield without the bang of a gun.

436
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,130
The election in three months...

437
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,390
Aren't you too determined, Father?

438
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,010
I have prepared for this fight for 20 years.

439
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:54,210
Thinking about your grandfather, a co-owner whose right was taken away from him unjustly,

440
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm thinking of having all of Seung Jin Group.

441
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,840
You and he will always battle one another, as long as you guys are alive.

442
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,520
Don't worry. You know, too, that I don't like losing.

443
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,460
Don't look down on him. He is still a bloodline of Chairman Cha Geon Ho.

444
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,110
That blood, which can betray his younger brother when he does not need him, wouldn't go anywhere.

445
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,370
Then should I prepare a gun that does not make a sound?

446
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,460
It's good if you prepare it. Do you have something against him?

447
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm not sure. It seems like I have something.

448
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,200
I should confirm it before I put it on.

449
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,490
Of how I'm going to use it.

450
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,650
It's my fault.

451
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,820
I should have grabbed onto him no matter what when I caught onto the warning sign.

452
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,970
I shouldn't have left him by himself.

453
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,020
Think about how his condition was before you left him.

454
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,620
There was no problem. Until before Se Gi's name was mentioned.

455
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,160
Se Gi... it's Shin Se Gi, right?

456
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,040
Yes, he asked if something happened between me and Se Gi.

457
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,480
I said that there was nothing that happened and then he asked if perhaps he (Se Gi) asked a favor of me as a doctor.

458
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,590
A favor as a doctor?

459
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:24,140
Put Cha Do Hyun to sleep. So that he can't wake up... forever.

460
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,040
Did he ever ask you that?

461
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,970
No. Se Gi didn't even know I was a doctor.

462
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,400
So that's what I told that person, too.

463
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,870
Please look at me closely again. Has there really been a time where we met befo---?

464
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,470
I thought it was a bit strange.

465
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:55,250
Delusions or hallucinations are closer to schizophrenia, rather than D.I.D. (dissociative identity disorder).

466
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,700
Doctor.

467
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,200
If my guess is correct, it could be Co-Consciousness.
(Co-Consciousness - A situation where the main personality is awake, the alternate personality makes an appearance.)

468
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,590
If it's Co-Consciousness...
( A situation where the main personality is awake, the alternate personality makes an appearance.)

469
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,550
What are you looking at right now?

470
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,200
Anther personality came out, even when he was still conscious.

471
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,950
Then has he had those symptoms before?

472
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,610
It never happened once while I was treating him.

473
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,210
Then, why did those symptoms suddenly...?

474
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,380
If an alternate personality became stronger after co-consciousness, he will appear at the same time as his owner,

475
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,490
and control his owner's actions.

476
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,610
In the worst-case scenario, he can control all of his consciousness and actions.

477
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,640
Are you saying co-consciousness can get rid of the owner's personality?

478
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,770
Then, that person is in a seriously dangerous state right now!

479
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,160
Calm down. We cannot just look at con-consciousness as something dangerous.

480
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,600
Sometimes, it could also help with the amalgation treatment of the other personalities.

481
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,980
And before I hear anything from him personally, we cannot conclude anything.

482
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,750
But one thing for sure is...

483
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,560
His personalities were stimulated by something.

484
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,360
Because of that, a battle of ownership between the owner and his alternate personalities could have started.

485
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,980
From this moment on, you have to avoid me at all costs.

486
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,890
If I appear, hide. If I approach you, run away.

487
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,400
If I hold on to you, you should even beat me up and run away. Do you understand what I'm saying?

488
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,410
It could not be Se Gi. It could be you, Cha Do Hyun.

489
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,470
No, that'll never happen.

490
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,790
From this moment on,

491
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,950
I'm not going to appear in front of you.

492
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,090
If you don't want to talk to me as a doctor, I'll talk to you as a friend. Come to the hospital first.

493
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,260
Our conversation didn't end yet.

494
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,440
I don't make friends.

495
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,990
I don't need friends.

496
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,320
Shin Se Gi

497
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,590
The phone you are trying to reach is off. Please leave a message.

498
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,160
Cha Do Hyun, it's Oh Ri Jin.

499
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,840
Listen well to what I have to say.

500
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,320
Whatever situation you're in, whoever you're with, you must never lose consciousness.

501
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,260
You cannot have your consciousness taken away by anyone. Understand?

502
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,110
You must not be influenced by anything and be strong.

503
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,410
Vice-President?

504
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,950
Vice-President, what are you doing here?

505
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,840
Madam (Ki Joon's mother) came, so everyone is having dinner. You should go in and say your greetings--

506
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,070
Take your time showering.

507
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,360
I cannot hold it in any longer, Aunt.

508
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,770
That woman?

509
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,750
I don't know why you brought me over, after hearing some rumors,

510
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,710
but I wasn't the one who started the fight over at the golf course.

511
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:54,540
Go ahead. Why don't you say that it's just me who made the fuss, since you did not do anything?

512
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't you know who she is?

513
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,540
If a person went through that much, you should have learned things.

514
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,090
You just had to avoid the situation.

515
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,530
Do you think I didn't?

516
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,660
She followed me!

517
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,390
Sister-in-law, why are you leaving out what you did?

518
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,880
Did I follow you because I wanted to?

519
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,320
She was shouting while calling someone in the field, like someone without manners.

520
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,500
If I turned around because I was embarrassed, she should have pretended not to see me.

521
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,170
How could I do something to someone who followed me and grabbed my hair?

522
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,380
You, really! Hey! Did you just go in?

523
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,430
You ignored me! You were rude, you bad wretch!

524
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,770
You saw that, right? That woman is like that. How can I hold it in?

525
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,110
This... seriously... Aish!

526
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,970
What are you doing right now?

527
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,680
Your character is rotten.

528
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,280
There isn't anyone on top of you, and if there is, you want to drag that person below you.

529
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,450
After Min Seo Yeon, who never could be dragged below you, died...

530
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:58,100
Why? You felt relieved but you can't eat now because of me?

531
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,850
Are you going crazy because you want to bring me down?

532
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,870
Aunt...

533
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,940
What is that woman?

534
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,290
She has rabies.

535
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,130
Don't become like her just because you get bitten. You should stop now, too.

536
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,530
I...

537
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,090
don't understand.

538
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,430
How can someone like you, Aunt, let a woman like her in our house?

539
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:27,740
What? She has a son? By law, he is Sister-in-law's (Min Soo Yeon) son.

540
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,500
How dare you talk about my son like he's adopted?

541
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,580
Even for Do Hyun, this isn't right.

542
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,750
- If only she's as half as good as Sister-in-law, who passed away, I...
- I gave birth to my son!

543
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,490
Why do you keep making him as Min Seo Yeon's son?!

544
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,430
Why do you keep bringing up a dead person?!

545
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,840
Don't wake up a person who is resting in peace in heaven.

546
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,090
Pack your bags and get out.

547
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,350
Take your son and leave.

548
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,090
I know. Before that fogey dies, she will never give Seung Jin Group to Do Hyun.

549
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:10,930
She just tied him up like a shepherd, who only will take care of the house until you wake up.

550
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:18,080
That's why, I changed my dream.

551
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,070
Instead of you, who is the son of that woman, my son, Do Hyun

552
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,500
will become Seung Jin Group's owner.

553
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,400
So, Honey,

554
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,760
I'm sorry.

555
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm sorry, but...

556
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,920
will you please not wake up again?

557
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,340
Is she

558
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,390
really resting in peace?

559
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,710
I don't know. When Min Soo Yeon left this world,

560
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,670
"I played well.

561
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,030
It wasn't such a bad life."
If she died, after thinking that way,

562
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,020
or if she died,

563
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,280
thinking "we'll wait and see," and swallowed her tears of blood.

564
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,860
That mouth, can't you shut it?

565
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,700
I can't leave this house, Mother.

566
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:43,700
One tongue can kill a person and it can also even ruin a successful company.

567
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,640
How can I trust my own mouth and leave here? I'm already a ticking bomb when I drink.

568
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,010
I told you to shut up!

569
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,920
I remember everything. Everything related to Seung Jin Group.

570
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,170
A horrific secret that is not known to the world.

571
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:05,750
What, it's not hard to get rid of something like me quietly?

572
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:13,020
That's right. But if Do Hyun finds out what happened to his mother, will he not do anything?

573
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,620
When he recovers his memories, many people will get hurt.

574
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,420
I have rabies?

575
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,090
Yes.

576
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,140
If you know, then please don't mess with me.

577
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,440
You can get bitten.

578
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,670
Do Hyun! Hey, let go of me! It hurts!

579
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,150
Seriously.

580
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,740
When did you come, Son? You should've called. What's wrong?

581
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,370
Mom,

582
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,660
what is the secret that I know?

583
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,860
Secret? What secret?

584
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,580
The thing that happened at Seung Jin Group. The secret that isn't known to the world.

585
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,160
I forgot it, but that memory that will make numerous people hurt when I remember some day.

586
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,840
You know what all of it is, right?

587
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,350
That?

588
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,970
Ah, that's all a lie. A threat!

589
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,510
You too have seen the humiliation and scorn I've gone through in this house.

590
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,140
I can only breathe if I know a pretend to know a secret that doesn't exist.

591
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,150
If not, I'll be kicked out from this house!

592
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,230
It's not something that came up just because. There is something.

593
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,610
Every family has secrets and weaknesses.

594
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:52,890
I'm just trying to keep the tension in this family. What else is there?

595
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:59,060
This is a strategy I made while racking my brains out for your sake!

596
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,320
My son, I heard that you were amazing at the board meeting.

597
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,210
You've done well. Really well.

598
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:12,590
So from now on, don't think about other things. That elder

599
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,870
even if she looks bold, is just a toothless tiger. She has no solution besides you.

600
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:22,310
No matter what the people say, you are the successor of Seung Jin Group.

601
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,180
Hey! Do Hyun! Eat and then leave!

602
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,900
Do Hyun!

603
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,750
Missed calls (64):
Oh Ri Jin (35), Secretary Ahn Gook (29).

604
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:04,090
Cha Do Hyun, it's Oh Ri Jin.

605
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,830
No matter what kind of situation you are in or who you are with, you can never lose your consciousness.

606
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,560
From this moment on, you have to avoid me.

607
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,590
If I appear, hide. If I go closer to you, run away. If I hold on to you, you have to beat me up and run away.

608
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,420
Why... must I do that?

609
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,770
Because it's not me, but Se Gi.

610
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,820
It could not be Se Gi, but you, Cha Do Hyun.

611
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,780
Aren't you scared of me?

612
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:43,850
If you don't want me to be a doctor, I will talk to you as a friend. Come to the hospital. Our conversation didn't end yet.

613
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,940
You cannot let your consciousness be stolen by anyone. Do you understand?

614
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,340
You must not be influenced by anything and become strong.

615
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,580
Sorry for being late. The meeting ended late.

616
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,310
If you think you're going to be late, isn't it manners to change the time of the appointment?

617
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,500
Thanks to me, you are doing a lot of work.

618
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,540
That egotistical gene. You are never sorry, aren't you?

619
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,270
Aigoo, that merciful gene. You always forgive me.

620
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,630
I'm about to die of hunger. Let's order first.

621
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,280
If you were that hungry, why didn't you just start without me?

622
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,240
You want a girl who was stood up to put on a performance?

623
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,610
I was going to waste some time with Do Hyun, but I can't get ahold of him on the phone either.

624
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,880
You keep using your childhood friend.

625
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,330
When you get drunk, he is your driver. He is a carrier when you shop.

626
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:59,280
And when you get mad, he listens to you. Now, you even use him to pass some time?

627
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,380
Did I ever force him? He did it because he was happy.

628
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,580
You try calling. He could pick up the President's phone call.

629
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,030
If he still hasn't eaten yet, ask him to eat with us.

630
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,580
Unfortunately, our childhood friend made an unexcused absence today.

631
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,570
Unexcused absence? That good student?

632
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,500
Yeah. That good student didn't come to work.

633
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,030
Oppa, don't you think Do Hyun is weird lately?

634
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:38,830
Only lately? I always thought he was weird. Ever since he was little.

635
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:46,790
Nowadays, he is busy dating.

636
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:53,060
Huh? Dating? With whom? Who's daughter is she?

637
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,750
Oh, what's this? This strong reaction?

638
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:04,550
Even if he is part of Seung Jin Group, if they found out the truths about his mom, they wouldn't want to send away their daughter.

639
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,590
It's not someone who is from a rich family. She is a doctor.

640
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,680
Doctor?

641
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,140
Kanghan Hospital Psychiatrist Oh Ri Jin.

642
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,620
Cha Do Hyun

643
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,580
The customer cannot pick up the phone. After the beep, you will be connected to voice mail.

644
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,940
Vice President!

645
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,400
I'm sorry to make you worry, Secretary Ahn.

646
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,080
Where are you right now? Are you alright?

647
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,500
Yes, I'm alright. Thankfully I don't think I made a big problem.

648
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,500
Oh Ri Jin was very worried about you. Did you call her?

649
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,330
Vice President?

650
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:02,900
I'm sorry, but it seems like I can't make it to the company today.

651
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,000
I took care of big things, so there won't be big problems. But can you take care of the rest?

652
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,960
What else is wrong? Did something happen?

653
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,920
Truthfully,

654
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,940
I'm in a dangerous situation.

655
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:31,070
There are things that I cannot explain that are happening to me right now.

656
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:38,580
This was the first time I personally witnessed a different personality with my own eyes. Also...

657
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,380
You're saying a new personality appeared?

658
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,510
I'm not sure but I think so.

659
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,180
It was definitely the personality of a young child that wasn't Se Gi, Perry Park,

660
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,930
Yo Na or Yo Sub.

661
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,280
Perhaps, have you received a big shock or

662
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,430
was there anything that could have stimulated him? For example, something about your childhood-

663
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:09,190
No, I don't know.

664
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,510
There's nothing I'm certain of. I'm just in a state of confusion.

665
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:19,590
For now, come. Let's hear the details after you come.

666
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,730
Professor,

667
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,440
am I...

668
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,050
going crazy?

669
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,530
Or am I...

670
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,400
becoming a monster?

671
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,180
The inheritors who the world is focused on.

672
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,240
Oh Ri Jin.

673
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,570
Why? Are you scared?

674
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,400
If not, miserable? Confused?

675
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:18,730
If you find your lost memories, do you have the confidence to face that pain?

676
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,480
No, it's an illusion.

677
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,320
What are you going to do with finding your lost memories now?

678
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,650
It's a hallucination. It's a delusion. It's an illusion.

679
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,730
There are prices to pay for every truth.

680
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,520
You can't handle it.

681
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,980
So, cover it up. Like how you normally would, quietly.

682
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,880
-  Just live crumpled up like that, as if you are not alive.
- Shut up.

683
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,980
Remember? Even at that time you, ran away because you didn't have the courage to handle the pain.

684
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,860
And I fought that pain instead of you.

685
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:04,230
Understand? If it weren't for me, you! You would have already died from being alone in misery.

686
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,440
But how dare you call me fake?

687
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,650
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

688
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,070
From now on, the owner of this body and time is me.

689
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:35,480
Because... I found that child first.

690
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,600
I don't make friends. I don't need friends.

691
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:06,390
Cha Do Hyun

692
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,740
New message from Cha Do Hyun

693
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:19,190
It's Cha Do Hyun. I came back safely.

694
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,280
I'm sorry for making you worry.

695
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,580
I'm at the entrance of the hospital right now.

696
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,410
I want to meet you for a moment.

697
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,940
Cha Do Hyun!

698
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,070
Have you forgotten my gaze already?

699
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,430
Shin Se Gi?

700
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,620
Bingo!

701
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,200
You're disappointed that you didn't meet the person you were expecting.

702
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,900
Then... it was you who prank texted me?

703
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,440
I needed to confirm something.

704
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,980
I'm done checking.

705
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,940
Reset, start.

706
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,190
Wait! Wait a minute! Where are we going right now?!

707
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,780
Slow down! I said slow down!!

708
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,440
You can't hear me?! Stop the car now before i jump!

709
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,900
I don't have much time given to me.

710
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,940
It's better to get rid of the luggage that gets in our way.
