1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,120
As you want, I will leave the company

2
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,900
but I will stay in Korea.

3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500
I have things I have to do.

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,620
What else do you have to do instead of receiving treatments?

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,200
I'm thinking of doing just that.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Why my heart had to be broken into pieces,

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,480
what those pieces signify, I'm thinking of finding out.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,860
While finding my lost memories and putting together my heart that became pieces.

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,140
I will see what kind of picture is completed.

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,220
I'm not a substitute for Father.

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,780
I am also not a dog that guards Seungjin Group, nor a monster.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
I am only

13
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,960
Cha Do Hyun.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,540
Let's go, Oh Ri Jin.

15
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,760
Oh Ri Jin!

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,360
Ahjumoni, where did Secretary Oh who came in with me go?

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,520
I asked her a favor to get some wine from the wine cellar, but it took so long that I was about to go downstairs just now.

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,920
The wine cellar?

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,780
But fire and basements,

20
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,660
I am just a little scared of them.

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,760
No, I will go.

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh Ri Jin.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,340
Oh Ri Jin.

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,820
Oh Ri Jin, are you okay?

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,460
I'm okay.

26
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,240
I just felt dizzy for a second.

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,840
I've been fine but I don't know why I'm like this again...

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,380
Let's go out now, can you get up?

29
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,040
Yes...

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,180
Oh Ri Jin! Oh Ri Jin! Oh Ri Jin!

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,540
What is this?

32
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,140
What.... is this?

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,060
Kill me, Heal me

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Episode 13

35
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,820
You must be busy, but thank you for coming here.

36
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,660
No, it's fine. I should come flying any time if my patient is in danger.

37
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,140
You're the Superman of this era.

38
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,120
Next time, instead of my office, how about a secret rendezvous at the aquarium?

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,940
These days the fish have gotten a lot better.

40
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Go back up and rest.

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,440
Yes.
- Even if you are faced with painful memories, don't get beaten up.

42
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Yes.

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Look after Dr. Oh well.

44
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,760
Even though she looks like that, she is very soft-hearted.

45
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,960
She used to struggle a lot because she would feel so much empathy for a patient.

46
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,920
Well, it might seem I'm needlessly worrying, but it just concerns me, seeing her become like that.

47
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,280
I will do well.

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,460
Hey, doesn't it feel like I'm a Dad asking my son-in-law to keep my daughter happy, right?

49
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,700
I'll leave now. You don't have to come out.

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
Oh Ri Jin!
-Ah!

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,960
Oh Ri Jin... are you okay?

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,100
Oh Ri Jin, come to your senses...

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,060
Come to your senses.

54
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,640
Oh Ri Jin.

55
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,240
Oh Ri Jin!

56
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh Ri Jin, are you okay? Come to your senses, are you okay?

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,340
Oh Ri Jin!

58
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,860
Oh Ri Jin...

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,860
Don't leave.

60
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,580
Don't leave.

61
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,440
Don't leave.

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,780
Play with me.

63
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,540
Play with me...

64
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,560
Play with me...

65
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,320
Don't go.

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,360
Play with me...

67
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,360
♬ The deep night will show you, who was not able to leave ♬

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,760
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

69
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,600
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,940
Don't go! Don't go...
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

71
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,000
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,860
Don't go, don't go, don't go...
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬

73
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:59,150
I'm not going. I'm not going anywhere. So don't worry.

74
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:08,420
No matter how scary the nightmare is, it will always end sometime. I will look over you from now on.

75
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,370
♬ I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

76
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,240
Rest assured and sleep.
♬ I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,860
♬ I can’t touch you or be embraced by you ♬

78
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,340
♬ The things that are taking over me aren’t the bastards living inside me ♬
♬ The strong medicine will not heal me, only the word love ♬

79
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,800
♬ The voice that echoes in my ears wakes me up ♬
♬ Embraces and kisses me, and I can no longer see it anymore  ♬

80
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,230
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

81
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,700
Hey, Oh Ri Jin.
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

82
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,760
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,200
Are you... perhaps having a nightmare right now?
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,920
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,800
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬
♬ Where are you? ♬

86
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,100
And the string of memory that has started to unwind... until it hits a dead-end wall will slowly

87
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,680
keep on rolling without stopping.
No matter where the end lies.

88
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,950
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me ♬

89
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,120
Misery and sadness, despair, greed,
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far way from me ♬

90
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,840
envy and guilt.

91
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:39,980
That even in the midst of being enclosed by all that darkness, may there be hope, even if in it's the end, and happiness.

92
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,100
The little girl....pleaded and pleaded.

93
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,930
Oh- Oh- Oh Ri Jin?

94
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,160
Oh Ri Jin? Oh Ri Jin?

95
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh Ri Jin! What are you doing, Oh Ri Jin?

96
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,760
You woke up already.

97
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,540
Because of Nightingale Cha I felt better. I was hungry so I was searching in the refrigerator.

98
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,740
Are you okay?

99
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,320
It seems you had a nightmare all night long.

100
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,660
No, I'm okay. I am like that sometimes, like it's an annual tradition.

101
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,740
I want to eat the duck stew my mom makes...

102
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,260
What are you sorry for? What do duck stew and you have to do with anything? Are you relatives?

104
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,980
It was completely because of me that you had to lie about being in America.

105
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,100
And because of that you haven't been able to meet with your family comfortably.

106
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,160
Therefore, you can' t eat your mom's duck stew. Which is why all of this is my fault.

107
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,340
Wow~!

108
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,040
You are like one of the 33 representatives who read the Korean Declaration of Independence.

109
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,040
But what should I do? I'm sorry. While you were not here, I already 'came out' to my family.

110
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,370
Oh, is that right?

111
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,750
That's good then. Let's go. I'll drive you.

112
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,020
Take a break starting today.

113
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,470
I return the offer!

114
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,290
If I appear like this to them, they will worry even more.

115
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,440
And... I still didn't tell them that I am your physician.

116
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,530
You're sorry, right? Then to make up for it, buy me food.

117
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,080
Then I shall forgive all your sins.

118
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,760
Ah... Oh... Oh Ri Jin! Professor said to rest until today.

119
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,840
You must have forgotten. I am also a doctor.

120
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,510
My source of nutrients has been cut off~!

121
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,740
I finally feel like I'm alive now.

122
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,470
What kind of nightmare did you even dream?

123
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,800
You said it's a yearly thing; I don't think it should be taken lightly.

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,390
Let's talk about the serious stuff during our conversation later.

125
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,830
For now, eat.

126
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,330
Is it... because of the phobia of basements?

127
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,380
Hey, I said let's do it later.

128
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,060
You are tired, too, having to resolve all the things Mr. Shin did.

129
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,350
For now, let's eat as we get things off our chest.

130
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,690
Here, cheers! Drink up!

131
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,310
Oh Ri Jin.
- Don't worry.

132
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,510
There's someone else who interprets my dreams.

133
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is that?

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,960
Here, cheers! I'll let you know if you drink. Cheers!

135
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,990
My brother.

136
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,200
When I dream nightmares, as a writer, he interprets my dreams for me.

137
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,020
I... actually am a little bit scared of...

138
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,000
basements and fires.

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,350
It was love.

140
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,670
Since the little girl was so scared, he himself pretended to be scared too for her.

141
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,380
I sweet-talked my brother to come with me.

142
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,380
But he is also scared (of basements)!

143
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,200
I guess we are really twins!

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,010
Since he wanted to pretend he's afraid just like her... he tricked himself into believing that he was really afraid.

145
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,650
I heard you met the writer, Omega.

146
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,950
I am sorry for lying to you all this time.

147
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,720
What kind of a person is Oh Ri On?

148
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,870
I don't know him that well either.

149
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,960
There are about 276 yellow-spotted snakes inside him.

150
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,260
Oh Ri Jin.

151
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,230
Why are there so many questions today?

152
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,030
Is Oh Ri On really your real brother... or...

153
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,000
Why?

154
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,240
Your body isn't that well, should you be drinking that much?

155
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,160
The mutt might as well stop eating poop, but I can't stop drinking soju while having samgyupsal.

156
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,570
Now--- cheers!

157
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,190
That was really good.

158
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,610
But...is it okay to always eat through your money?

159
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,070
To someone who entered the road of unemployment starting from today?

160
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,810
Don't worry.

161
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,790
If I sell all the items Se Gi bought so far, we can eat and live for two years.

162
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,120
So, from now on, how do you plan to live?

163
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,210
First, I am going to organize my stuff in the company... and then match the puzzle.

164
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,890
What kind of piece will you be grabbing first?

165
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,200
The child.

166
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,290
The basement child... if he/she really exists... and if he/she does...

167
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,470
where that child came from and where the child disappeared to....

168
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,070
Excellent! Not dodging the problem nor depending on someone else.

169
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,080
I like that attitude of yours just facing the problem upfront. Nice, really nice.

170
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,970
It's a tarot reading shop.

171
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,620
Wait, for a doctor... do you believe in that unscientific astrology?

172
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,530
Who knows? If we ask where that child is right now, we might be able to get a good psychic reading.

173
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,290
Just earlier you said that I was great for not relying on someone and facing it myself.

174
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,000
I was just joking. Gosh, getting so serious about it.

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,820
My phone?

176
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,870
I must have left it at the restaurant. I'm sorry but can you go in first.

177
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,070
Can you order some coffee? Americano, double shot. I'm counting on you!

178
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,890
Come in already, it's your first tarot card reading. Isn't it?

179
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,880
Come in.

180
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,510
Hello.

181
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,190
Wow, you look very handsome.

182
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,360
Well... I'm searching for someone...

183
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,350
So you are here for a love fortune.

184
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,590
It's not that.

185
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,330
Don't be nervous.

186
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,300
Think about the person that you like right now in your mind.

187
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,270
Take out 3 cards each with your right and left hand.

188
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,540
Who I like?

189
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,080
Yes.

190
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,070
Hurry, hurry. You have to choose fast before my spirit becomes hazy.

191
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,910
Ah, yes.
- Quickly.

192
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,380
3 cards on my right hand, 3 cards on my left?

193
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,020
Yes.

194
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,350
The middle is you, the right is the person you like

195
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,600
and the left is the obstacle that disrupts your romance.

196
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,330
Now.

197
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,070
That girl, very nice.

198
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,960
She's very warm and bright.

199
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,160
She's like... a sunbeam shining through the window in April.

200
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,340
When she calls your name...

201
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,540
You become a stuc---I mean, flower for her.

202
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,430
She does have quite some strong features, but she does make you comfortable.

203
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,190
Right?

204
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,350
Yes, that's right.

205
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,980
Now... you. The judgement card.

206
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,950
That girl entered your heart without you realizing it,

207
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:53,200
you judge yourself for it, and you try your hardest to contradict it. It comes out like that.

208
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,750
And... Oh my, the obstacle to your romance.

209
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,880
How come such a sour thing come in? Oh my, it's sour, sour.
Something very sour came in.

210
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,310
Wow, there are blockades everywhere!

211
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,740
Oh my, what on earth? They are all savages, all savages.

212
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,340
And so... will it become true or not?

213
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,350
Finally, pick the last card.

214
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,080
Oh, so handsome.

215
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,080
It's the wheel of fortune! It means an unavoidable fate.

216
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,070
You will meet the person you're waiting for the longest time, but it will not be smooth-sailing.

217
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,840
Without pain and hardship, this love will be hard to come true.

218
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Look, look. The judge is holding a sword. Ah, this judgement (It's a pun).

219
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,880
Judgement. Judgement.

220
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,550
Judgement.
- Judgement.

221
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,050
Today's horoscope... I stepped on poop. Poop.

222
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,320
Oh my, I am Year of the Ox, right. I'm looking at something else.

223
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,030
Hello~

224
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,970
Welcome!

225
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,750
You came to look at your love fortune.

226
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,910
Oh my, oh my! So great!

227
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,750
Wow, why do you have so many guys? 1, 2, 3. Wow you're a player. Dirty dirty.

228
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,420
What! No! It's not! What do you see me as?

229
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,320
It's fine. Let's just say that's true.

230
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,760
So? What do I have to do?

231
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,620
Pick your last card.

232
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,100
"Death?" Death (in Korean)?

233
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,910
Ruin. It's ruin. Haha.

234
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,910
It means to just forget things like love and just work hard instead.

235
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,030
Only if you give up on your current love can you prevent a big misfortune.

236
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,520
It's just that kind of meaning. Ruin. The End. The End (Korean). The End (Japanese).

237
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,300
This is INVALID! INVALID!
- Omo! Omo!

238
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,390
Shuffle the cards again!

239
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,940
Oh my, hallelujah, seriously! Oh my, what in the world!

240
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,940
What are you doing?

241
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,490
Oh, I was checking the stocks.

242
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,300
What are you doing?

243
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,080
What are you doing right now?

244
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,150
Huh? Tarot card accurate rate, tarot card validity... Why are you even searching this crap?

245
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,600
Ah, why are you doing this, really?

246
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,060
Wait...

247
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,300
This situation right now... It was on purpose, wasn't it?

248
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,500
It's very... unnatural.

249
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,100
It was not.

250
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,690
If you look into the context from both sides, it is also probable to a degree.

251
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,780
So, how accurate are the tarot card readings?

252
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,570
It doesn't say anything definite clearly.

253
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,450
It's not scientific.

254
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,520
It has no validity.

255
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,440
Right?
-Right?

256
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,720
Of course!
- Yeah!

257
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,810
No way.

258
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,390
Huh?
-Huh?

259
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,820
Huh?
-Uh~ Huh?

260
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,120
Huh-uh. Mm.
- Mm? Mm-mm?

261
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,940
You had yours read.

262
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,810
Then... I'll be upstairs,

263
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,060
call me if you need me.

264
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,850
Oh Ri Jin.

265
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,760
Yes?

266
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,780
Why do I have to call you only when I need you?

267
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,430
That's... What do you mean by that?

268
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,370
Have you never needed me before?

269
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,120
Am I only just

270
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,970
your patient?

271
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,910
No...

272
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,880
It's not like that.

273
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,140
Is there no possibility for me to be considered as a man?

274
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,790
Do you want to go ride the Snowflake train? (a train that runs through the Korean mountains and countryside overlooking the winter landscape)

275
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,860
What?

276
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,560
When you take the Snowflake train, go on a trip and and talk more with me,

277
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,760
you can learn a lot more about me.

278
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Then we can become a lot closer.

279
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,210
First, we need to become closer for me to be able to feel out the possibility.

280
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,980
Deal?

281
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,840
Deal.

282
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,160
Then, in 30 minutes, let's meet here.

283
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,630
Okay.

284
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,530
Han Chae Yeon.

285
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,480
Hello?

286
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,720
See me for a bit. I have something I want to say to you.

287
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,530
Did you drink?

288
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,420
Why do you care if I drink or not?

289
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,850
Do you even care?

290
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,230
Sorry, but I can't meet up with you.

291
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,840
You go home, too. You seem very drunk.

292
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,380
Then I'll call Ki Joon oppa then.

293
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,390
I'll call Ki Joon oppa... and

294
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,300
tell him everything about how you tried to seduce me that night...

295
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,140
and break the engagement.
-Chae Yeon.

296
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,860
I will tell the Chairwoman everything, that her grandson is a scoundrel.

297
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,680
And I am thinking to sacrifice myself and give a little treat to the tabloid and economic newspapers.

298
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,270
Let's try getting excitedly torn apart for once.

299
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,970
I won't die alone, you know?

300
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,270
What? Why didn't you change your clothes?

301
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,030
Sorry, Oh Ri Jin.

302
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,870
It's okay.

303
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,080
As long as you are comfortable, let's go.

304
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
It's not that... I suddenly have a matter to attend.

305
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,140
I think I need to push the trip for later.

306
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,680
Why?

307
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,450
Did the Chairwoman ask you to come to the main residence again?

308
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,020
It's not that... Chae Yeon.

309
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,620
She seems to be having a hard time because of Se Gi.

310
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,430
I think I should set her heart in place.

311
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,730
It is something that Se Gi did, but it is something I need to take responsibility for.

312
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,100
How are you going to take responsibility?

313
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,990
I'm not sure.

314
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,630
For her not to have a change of heart anymore, whether I act evil towards her,

315
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,650
by persuading her... for now, I have to go.

316
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,460
Will you be okay?

317
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,920
What?

318
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,380
Oh, of course.

319
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,580
Go already, go.

320
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,730
Then, I will come back soon.

321
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,030
Okay.

322
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,920
You're drunk. Let's speak at a brighter place.

323
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,820
What are you doing?

324
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,440
Calling me out all of a sudden, it will be the last time I will listen to you.

325
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,890
Next time, even if you say that you are going to break the engagement or go to the Chairwoman, I'm not going to come out no matter what threat you say.

326
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,930
If I slit my wrist, then will you come out?

327
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,850
Han Chae Yeon.

328
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,620
You're the one who first put your hand out to secretly be together.

329
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,610
But why do I have to be the only one feeling that I am left behind, thrown away?

330
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,140
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

331
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,550
That situation... was not a situation where I could be sane. I lost my senses for a moment.

332
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,610
When you lost your senses,

333
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,450
my reason came back.

334
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,770
I found out who is actually in my heart now.

335
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,620
Chae Yeon.

336
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,640
You said you wanted to put an engagement ring on me yourself.

337
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,210
You said you were going to give me the right to choose.

338
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,240
Wow, it's so nice.

339
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,580
I really like this hotel's spa.

340
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,640
I really like their massage, as well, because they press so well.

341
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,710
Later on, I couldn't even feel where my feet or arms are attached. My mind is just everywhere.

342
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,090
Hey, Baek Jin Sook.

343
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,810
Who would look at you and think you're the wife of an Ambassador?

344
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,020
Please think of Ambassador Han as well. Keep up with your class.

345
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,360
Anyway, because of you, I feel refreshed.

346
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,880
I hear that as another plead to bring you back here?

347
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,140
Wow, we connect so well.

348
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,520
I love my in-law.

349
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,690
When I go to Brazil next time, you're repaying this two times more, okay?

350
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,630
Okay, I got it.

351
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,290
How about dinner at that place?

352
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,250
Oh! Yes, it seemed okay there.

353
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,190
Oh, wait a second.

354
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,600
I don't know where my legs and arms are right now,

355
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,570
but I know that the peeing place is over there! I'll be back.

356
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,210
Aigoo, who would stop that mouth of hers?

357
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,080
Yes. Get the car ready.

358
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,520
And make a reservation at Samcheong-dong.

359
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,640
It's ruin, ruin. Okay?

360
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,680
It means, just give up on love and just work hard instead.

361
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,830
By giving up on your love right now, you can stop any big misfortune later.

362
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,610
It's that meaning.

363
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,750
Quack.

364
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,760
End. The ending. The end.

365
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:46,240
From tomorrow I'm going to go to early morning service.

366
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,130
I'm gonna go to church.

367
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,790
What work do you do, Hwi Oppa?

368
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,800
The work I do is...

369
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,680
To inherit his parents' restaurant,

370
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,260
he's just chopping firewood from morning until dinner. Isn't that right?

371
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,700
Why do you keep calling me?

372
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,450
What?

373
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,670
No, I didn't call you.

374
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,410
You called me.

375
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,990
Me? When?

376
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,020
From a very long time ago.

377
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,630
It's a joke, joke.

378
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,760
Ah, this...

379
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,910
The mood is good and why is she again...

380
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,930
Why? What?

381
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,570
Ri On, come take me home.

382
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:56,040
I really want to go home but I can't drive because I drank.

383
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,700
Oppa is in the middle of business right now, I'm busy. I'm going to hang up.

384
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,650
I had a nightmare again.

385
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,170
I even fainted this time.

386
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,450
So you need to interpret my dreams.

387
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,770
You turn my nightmares into

388
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,290
lucky dreams well though.

389
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,320
Where are you right now?

390
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,110
Oh Ri Jin?

391
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,040
Oh Ri Jin!

392
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,540
I'm taking back the vacation I refused a while ago.

393
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,100
I did not get mad because we couldn't ride the Snowflake train! Don't misunderstand!

394
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,370
Ri On, do you remember my first love?

395
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,740
Your first love?

396
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,970
Who is he?

397
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,280
You know that jerk in high school.

398
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,940
Even though he had a girlfriend, he wanted my notes

399
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,750
so he treated me well.

400
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,150
You covered my eyes so I wouldn't see him with his girlfriend.

401
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,690
You knew?

402
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,620
Am I stupid?

403
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,660
I actually discovered them before you

404
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,880
but I just acted like I didn't know.

405
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Because I was thankful.

406
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,720
Because of you, I wasn't one bit broken-hearted.

407
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,590
I thought there really was only you.

408
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,240
Can I get goosebumps for a minute?

409
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,960
Can you do that again?

410
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,010
If I... make a stupid mistake like that again,

411
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,490
can you cover my eyes again?

412
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,940
Do you by any chance...

413
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,210
like him?

414
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,700
What is a first love to a guy?

415
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,600
What?

416
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,070
Is it something that isn't easily folded?

417
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,320
Is it something that you want to unfold again after folding it?

418
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,030
Even if there is a fold mark, do you not care?

419
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,790
It differs based on the situation.

420
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,990
If it folds in one go, then it's a 'thank you'.

421
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,560
If you open it up again then it's lingering attachment.

422
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,150
If you open it twice then it's sadness.

423
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,650
If you open it three times...

424
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,840
it's pain.

425
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,900
After unfolding it over and over again and it becomes ragged,

426
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,180
that's how the heart gets ripped.

427
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:32,230
And when ripped, you just deal with it until you've gone numb. That's how it is.

428
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,650
So it's like that.

429
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,880
You know Ri On,

430
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,280
these days,

431
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,440
I don't know what I am doing.

432
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,320
About what?

433
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,200
I feel like I am transferring my feelings (transference) to that person.

434
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,210
I keep having nightmares, and I keep having a déjà vu feeling.

435
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,260
I feel confused.

436
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,600
I keep getting feelings that make me unprofessional.

437
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,680
I'm a doctor.

438
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,980
Because that person is going through tough times 100 times harder than me,

439
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,990
I can't tell him to listen to my hard times.

440
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,170
These days I miss my times at the hospital.

441
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,250
During then I was too busy to think about anything else.

442
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,060
I just needed to work.

443
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,670
It was simple.

444
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,090
There was no reason to be confused.

445
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,480
I became really weak, didn't I?

446
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,740
What are you doing?

447
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,760
I'm just saying you are loud.

448
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
If you're going to say such weak-hearted things,

449
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,490
say it inside.

450
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,250
You seriously can't be serious for even 10 minutes. 10 minutes!!

451
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,250
Just cover yourself! You!

452
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,680
♫ Everyone has  ♫

453
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,790
♫  at least one of those  ♫

454
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,410
♫  Even if I say ♫

455
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:54,620
♫  that there isn’t anything special  ♫

456
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:01,190
♫ Even if I act indifferent,  ♫

457
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,620
♫ it hurts ♫

458
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,310
I'm a doctor. And because that person is suffering 100 times more than me...

459
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,790
Do you think it will be okay?
- Huh?

460
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,290
Of course! Hurry and go. Go.

461
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,530
I can't make him listen to my problems...

462
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,330
If we get on the Snowflake train and go on a trip, and talk together,

463
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,330
you will get to know a lot more about me. And we can get a lot closer.

464
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,700
After getting more friendly, I can analyze the probability.

465
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,630
♫ With a face that is unfamiliar, ♫

466
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,660
♫ I will just hurt your heart  ♫

467
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,760
If you don't like a doctor, I will speak as a friend.

468
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,480
No matter what kind of situation you are in or who you're with, you can't ever lose your mind.

469
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,250
Don't worry. I am here.

470
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,090
Come out! I said don't die like this!

471
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:07,730
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

472
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,520
I thought you were gone because of me! I was so scared, did you even know?!

473
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,910
♫ seems like an old friend ♫

474
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:26,360
Save me.
♫ I cannot get used to this feeling, I miss you ♫

475
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:34,010
From now on, instead of "Kill Me", ask to "Heal Me" instead.

476
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:42,230
Even if that is the case, you guys are not dying, but under the name Cha Do Huyn,

477
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,860
you will become a greater person.

478
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:58,990
♫ The only thing I can give you are just the unstoppable tears ♫

479
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,310
♫  With a face that is unfamiliar,♫

480
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:13,010
♫  I will just hurt your heart  ♫

481
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:21,460
♫ Just let me love you by myself and leave ♫

482
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,330
President, you're here.

483
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,810
You came.

484
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,150
Now let's go in.
- Please go first.

485
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,130
I heard that Chairman Seo Tae Im fired Vice-President Cha Do Hyun.

486
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,420
I heard. If we try to personally ask, we might be misunderstood for intruding into private family matters.

487
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,080
But if we just go over this issue, I don't think it's proper as his uncle.

488
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,110
I am in a roughly tough spot.

489
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,280
Two months before the stockholders' meeting, she discarded her own successor.

490
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,560
Chairwoman Seo's gun isn't as good as it used to be,

491
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,090
isn't that clearly revealed now?

492
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,090
Not only that. Soon, with Chairman Baek's granddaughter,

493
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,720
his son will be married.

494
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,990
So for this week's stockholders' meeting, you elevating to the position of Chairman,

495
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,450
isn't that an obvious fact?

496
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,130
What did you just say? Who is the person looking for the child again?

497
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,440
Are you positive? Hurry.

498
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,220
We need to find that child out first before anyone else, using any kind of method necessary.

499
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,200
Do you understand?

500
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,060
Soon the chairwoman will call you.

501
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,190
Take it as a time to get a breather.

502
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,470
Secretary Ahn.

503
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,810
Yes, Vice President.

504
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,520
Don't wait for me,

505
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,800
and grab onto a good opportunity when it comes.

506
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,090
The people giving the good opportunity will get entangled with people they want themselves.

507
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,460
If the line is longer, the longer the wait, right?

508
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,830
I will line up in the short line.

509
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,370
So come back any time.

510
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,980
You can take your time moving out of your office.

511
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,170
Aren't you rushing too much?

512
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,110
A person that should leave, should hurry and leave.

513
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,160
You did well, Hyung. I am thankful for all this time.

514
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,990
I haven't even done anything for you so why are you thankful?

515
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,610
Also, when are you leaving for America?

516
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,580
I'm not going.

517
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,240
You're not going?
- I decided to stay here.

518
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,520
I have something I have to do here.

519
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,860
I see, take care.

520
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,730
I'm warning you but don't come near my company and woman again.

521
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:04,140
If I see you snooping around her one more time, you're dead.

522
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,840
Yes, Madame.

523
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,000
I heard Do Hyun got chased out of the company. What exactly is this nonsense grumbling?

524
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,960
What were you doing until the situation became this bad?

525
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,400
Ah...

526
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:41,880
I was going to hide myself quietly in Japan, but after hearing this news, I am on my way back to cause a confrontation.

527
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,220
Tell me! What on earth is going on?!

528
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,360
Mom, where are you?

529
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,700
Didn't you say you would become the owner of the Seungjin Group?

530
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,760
You said being out in some other country would be of help to you. Then you should've stayed there.

531
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,860
Whatever you could have done, you should've stayed. How could you just be chased out like that stupidly?

532
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,640
She's really spiteful. Would you do this on purpose?

533
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,600
Did she ever, for her grandson, cast a sweet gaze on you or compliment you?

534
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,020
That even you, who is innocent and lamb-like, would grow some horns, too.

535
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,920
No matter if the whole world points their fingers at you, mom will understand you. It's okay.

536
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,340
Mother...

537
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,800
From now on, whatever I ask, promise me that you will be honest and tell me only the truth.

538
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,660
I... I am too honest for my own good.

539
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,660
What? About what? What is it that you're curious about?

540
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,640
In the past, at Seungjin

541
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,480
was there a child around my age?

542
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,620
What? A child?

543
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,230
In that house, there was no other child other than you.

544
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,180
Mom, I already know that you are searching for the child.

545
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,500
Whose child is that child?

546
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,940
I don't know! I'm telling you I don't know! I don't know!

547
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,160
Then what is the reason that Father abused me?

548
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Yes? What are you talking about? What kind of strange things are you talking about?

549
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,300
Your dad treated you so preciously! You're saying nonsense!

550
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,020
Then, did father treat that child nicely as well?

551
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,570
Of course! He treated the child really well, too!

552
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,820
He was someone that really liked children.

553
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,480
Son...

554
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:47,780
I... I have a really important meeting I have to go to... I forgot about it.

555
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,700
Do Hyun, can I just call you later? I have to go now.

556
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,180
Writer Omega

557
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,060
You went to Ssang Ri yesterday, right?

558
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,280
That's right.

559
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,140
I am sorry for not welcoming you in.

560
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,260
Truthfully, our parents don't know yet.

561
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,360
That the patient that Ri Jin is in charge of is you.

562
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,600
A set of parents that raised a daughter preciously.

563
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,740
Hearing that their daughter is living with an unmarried man in another house, tending to him as a patient,

564
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,700
how many parents would welcome that?

565
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,200
I also am someone who is lying to his own parents by getting involved into this brother-sister conman team,

566
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,330
but I trust Ri Jin as a doctor.

567
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,790
I know that she is someone who will never develop personal feelings towards a patient.

568
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,500
Wow. Our mom is so amazing!

569
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,720
I think you were Han Seok Bong's mother in your past life. (Han Seok Bong is a well-known Joseon calligrapher)

570
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,430
What's so hard about that? You can do anything if you put care and effort into it.

571
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,770
Utmost sincerity and interest.

572
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,760
That was the secret method.

573
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,170
Is there a different secret method to cut rice cakes?

574
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,310
Not the secret method to cut rice cakes...

575
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,960
It's the secret method of how you loved Ri On and me the same.

576
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:05,300
It's impossible to give love equally like this, even if we are your biological children.

577
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,970
Even if you scale it over and over again,

578
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:14,090
even if you divide it after verifying so many times,

579
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:20,730
I don't think there's more of a precise, fair, and touching love like this.

580
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,530
Ri Jin...

581
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,230
I'm just saying.

582
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,210
I'm telling you to get a lot of new year's luck.

583
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:41,470
I'm very, very thankful.

584
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,910
It must be because you're a writer, but your thoughts are well-put in your choice of words.

585
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,970
Doctor. Patient. Tend to (as a patient).

586
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:59,990
If you intended to draw an indisputable line by poking at my weaknesses,

587
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,300
you have succeeded.

588
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,530
While I'm drawing, I'll draw another line.

589
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,820
I heard that you will go back to the U.S. after two months.

590
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:19,330
I trusted in that clause and joined this con team,

591
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,040
I will observe only until then.

592
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,520
After that, I wish that you would not create any connection with Ri Jin anymore.

593
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,170
Oh my, I came out.

594
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,300
Ah, really, this ^#@*. He only brings me out when he's having difficulty! Seriously!

595
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,300
Agh! I'm so ^#@* pissed! God, seriously!

596
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,420
Ah.. what are these tears? Geez, this is so annoying. Ugh.

597
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,540
Well, whatever, it's Ahn Yona's world now.

598
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,140
Here, then.

599
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,260
Cha-Cha- Cha Do Hyun?

600
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,070
Oppa~

601
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:10,190
O- O-O- Oppa?

602
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,540
Cha-Cha-Cha Do Hyun?

603
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,660
Oppa!

604
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,400
Oppa~

605
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,690
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

606
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,920
Oppa~

607
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,960
My Ri On Oppa!

608
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,000
Oppa?

609
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,660
Oppa!!

610
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,900
Hey, Oh Ri On. What are you doing, not helping out with the food for the holidays?

611
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,940
Is the personality you were talking about by any chance... Yo...Yo Na?

612
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,480
How do you know Yo Na?

613
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,220
Did you perhaps meet her?

614
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,050
S-save me, Ri Jin. I'll be good. I'll do better from now on, too.

615
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,430
I'll be good even when I die.

616
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,770
Oppa!

617
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,230
Yo Na wants to eat this.

618
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,070
Why am I your oppa?!

619
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,580
If you're handsome, you're my oppa.

620
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,320
Oppa, I want to eat this.

621
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,180
Buy this for me.

622
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,760
Oppa! Buy it for me!

623
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,160
Why are you making me say so many wo-wo-wo-words?

624
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,080
I'll buy it.

625
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,960
Please, sister!

626
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,820
Relax. I am on my way now.

627
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,740
Hang in there with the mindset of Kim Yuna!

628
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,620
You can't lose her.

629
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,940
If you lose her, whatever you're imagining, it'll be worse than that.

630
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,040
You got it?

631
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,660
Don't provoke her and do everything she asks you to do.

632
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,480
Yeah. Do everything that she asks you to do, everything.

633
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,550
Hurry and give it to me!

634
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,070
I'm saying I'm gonna die from starvation right now!

635
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,970
If you don't give it to me, I'll go up on the table and dance.

636
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,530
Here it comes. Here it comes.

637
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,430
Here it comes.
- Ah~

638
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,540
Ah~

639
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,820
It's not!

640
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,060
It's not like that!

641
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,320
It is like that!

642
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,470
I can't. I can't do this.

643
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,190
I can't do this anymore! Sister!

644
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,730
Why? Did you lose her?

645
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,620
Catch me.

646
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,400
She said try and catch her.

647
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,560
Hey, you want to die?

648
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,540
I'm... I'm almost there!

649
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,560
Try to stop him at all costs! Through any way!

650
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,820
Hey, I saw you!

651
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,300
Grab him!

652
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,870
Please do not take pictures.

653
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:06,030
Hey, you can't go that way! Yo Na! Yo Na!

654
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,550
Come here, come here!

655
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,350
Yo Na!
- Hey!

656
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,630
Oh!

657
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,550
Hey, Oh Ri On. For now, just grab her.

658
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,230
Go in with the 7th skill, 7th skill.

659
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,050
The 7th skill?

660
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,600
What do you mean the 7th skill on a girl?

661
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,220
I just called him a girl...

662
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,380
I don't know anymore, geez!

663
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,300
Hey, Oh Ri On! Grab him!

664
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,400
Run!

665
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,100
Oppa, try catching me!

666
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,800
Oppa, catch me!

667
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,040
You can't lose him! You can't! Can't! Catch him fast! Catch him! Catch him!

668
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,520
Hey!

669
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,170
Stop!

670
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,130
Let's go together!

671
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,330
Yo Na, Oppa will buy you snacks. Let's go.

672
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,870
Oppa, why can't you catch me?

673
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,610
Oppa, from now on,

674
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,130
I'll catch you. You got it?

675
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,430
Me?
- I'm coming!

676
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,910
Oppa! I'm coming!

677
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,870
Move.

678
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,750
Y-You're like a muscle girl...

679
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,430
Oppa! Just this once!

680
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,850
Oppa! One time!

681
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,720
Oppa!
- Oh Ri On!

682
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,060
Hey!

683
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,900
Wow! Oh!

684
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,290
Oppa! Oppa!

685
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,510
Don't work out!

686
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,850
Hey!

687
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,970
That... talkative wench! Didn't I tell you to not show your teeth?!

688
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,210
Hey, Ahn Yo Na! Aren't you gonna listen to me?

689
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,270
Don't touch my brother! Come here!

690
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,820
Again...?

691
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,760
Oh!

692
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,240
Don't! Don't!

693
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,960
Oppa!

694
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,960
Oppa.

695
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,630
Who are you?

696
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,330
What happened?

697
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,190
Am I the one that came here or did you---

698
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,750
Is that important right now?!

699
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,690
Just... I was thinking of dropping you off at your house,

700
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:43,880
but then automatically I needed to leave Ri Jin there.

701
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,220
Anyway, it's a long story to tell.

702
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,040
I... Did I perhaps...

703
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,500
For now, please get out.

704
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,780
I'll take my time and explain what happened in detail.

705
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,330
What kind of girl, girl... that energy, energy!

706
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,370
If it's a girl... Perhaps Yo Na?
- It was really something!

707
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,390
I really...

708
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,750
This is the clothes that Oppa values the most--

709
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,270
Look at me. I'm calling myself Oppa... Ha.

710
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,780
These are clothes that I value the most.

711
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,280
Change and come down stairs.

712
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,650
Oh Ri Jin! Why are you always pulling me like this?

713
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,750
Ahead of time, I think we have to put our lips together---
(she meant to match their story in case asked, but could also mean to kiss)

714
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,310
Are you okay?

715
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,180
I'm okay. Completely fine.

716
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,270
Poem Collection: When I look at a wheel, I want to roll them

717
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,930
It's your favorite poem collection.

718
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,910
Did the caretaker read it to you?

719
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:32,950
I used to read it to you once in awhile before.

720
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,660
When I see wheels I want to roll them.

721
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:07,210
So Oh Ri On knows everything now.

722
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,750
That I have multiple personalities.

723
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,530
It's not only Yo Na's fault.

724
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,490
Actually, Ri On had met Se Gi before.

725
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:17,690
Se Gi?

726
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,250
He actually already developed an inkling towards this direction,

727
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,700
if he saw the difference between you and Mr. Shin, it's game over.

728
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:28,180
Anyways, he won't use your weakness to fill up his self-interest,

729
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,840
so you don't need to worry.

730
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,900
This is under the fourth clause, 2nd subsection.

731
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,080
I've fulfilled my role now. If you can excuse me.

732
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,560
Oh right, you're Perry Park in our house for now.

733
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,240
Our mom and dad will otherwise be very confused.

734
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,410
Oh! I'll be in the kitchen so

735
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,090
if you need anything from me, call for me.

736
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,850
Oh Ri Jin.

737
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,240
What is it?

738
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,940
Only for two months...

739
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,020
Only for the remaining two months, can't I

740
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,270
be a man (to you)?

741
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,410
Actually, I knew everything.

742
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,370
That you didn't hate this woman but

743
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,790
that you really loved her.

744
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,680
Even though I knew that, I held on to you.

745
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,660
Because you looked like a rope

746
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,380
that will save me from my sewer-like life.

747
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,180
So I'm saying, Honey...

748
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:07,050
Me, I'm going to find this girl.

749
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:13,110
Before our Do Hyun remembers, I'll find her first.

750
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:19,650
And I'll get her out of Do Hyun's sight.

751
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,780
Party B (Ri Jin) will not fall in love with

752
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,480
Party A (Do Hyun), including the other personas.

753
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,060
Then I will pay the breach of contract penalty fee stipulated clearly in the contract. I will breach the contract.

754
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,260
What are you trying to do?

755
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,910
You said we need to put our lips together first.

756
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,770
No, that's not what I meant.

757
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:53,010
That's not what I'm trying to say!

758
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:57,170
No... that's not what I meant, I'm saying...

759
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,290
What's the matter?

760
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,230
♬  The hidden things inside me  ♬
♬  Changed me greatly ♬

761
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,220
♬  It put me to sleep, tied my hands together  ♬

762
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,120
This picture...

763
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,480
Why is this picture here?

764
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,080
♬ I erased them, ♬

765
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,900
Why?

766
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,460
♬  Without knowing anything I screamed  ♬

767
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,780
♬  And that’s all I remember  ♬

768
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,260
This is my mother's picture.

769
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,700
(Mother) on the family register.
♬  I want to free myself, ♬

770
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,500
♬  from the torment of my sins  ♬

771
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,560
♬  Someone take me out, from my spirit full of scars  ♬

772
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,940
♬  The deep night will show you, ♬

773
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,390
♬ who was not able to leave ♬

774
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,000
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬
