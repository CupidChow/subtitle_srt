1
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,300
Am I...

2
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,390
going crazy?

3
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,810
Forget it! I said what I needed to say. Is there something else?

4
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,650
How?

5
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,180
I asked if I look like your dead first love.

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,910
No.

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,140
I don't look like her?

8
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,270
She didn't die.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,900
She's alive... thankfully.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,750
Could it be? It's not Chae Yeon? Oh Ri Jin is Se Gi's first love?

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,710
Cha Do Hyun, you must not lose consciousness, understand?

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,850
Don't let yourself be seized by anything. You have to be strong.

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,330
From now on, the owner of this body and time is me.

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,030
Why?

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,870
I found that child first.

16
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,750
Cha Do Hyun!

17
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,510
Did you already forget my gaze?

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,700
Shin Se Gi?

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,680
Bingo!

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,570
Let me go. Please, let me go! Let go of me and then talk.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,290
Don't make me mad. I don't know what I will do.

22
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,400
Going AWOL during working hours would put me under probation. Did you know that!?

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,080
That's not my problem. I don't have that much time.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,460
Yet.

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,970
What do you mean 'yet?'

26
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,480
What do you mean?

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,540
I'm saying that Cha Do Hyun's time could become completely mine sometime in the future.

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,110
If the personality residing in Do Hyun gets stronger and comes out at the same time and space as him,

29
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,170
it could end up controlling his personality.

30
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,890
It could also end up controlling all of his actions and time as well.

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,070
Where is Cha Do Hyun right now?

32
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,560
He's sleeping since he was so scared and overwhelmed.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,040
He won't be able to wake up for a while.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,910
I gave him a serious fright.

35
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,140
If you want to save him, be quiet and follow me.

36
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,480
Slow down! I said, slow down!

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,080
You can't hear me? Before I jump out of the car, stop right now!

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,740
Doctor Seok Ho Pil

39
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,290
Why are you doing this to me, seriously?

40
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,100
I just left the hospital without permission, and without telling anyone. I should at least give them a call!

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,400
I told you, I don't have much time that was allowed to me.

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,210
Anything that bothers us is better gone.

43
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,180
Kill me, Heal me

44
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,040
Episode 5

45
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,840
What do you mean, the vice president hasn't arrived yet?

46
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,830
I think Se Gi kidnapped Dr. Oh.

47
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,990
Kidnapping?

48
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,890
Someone who looked like Mr. Cha came and took Dr. Oh away in a car.

49
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,350
So, why did Se Gi take Oh Ri Jin?

50
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,360
I have no idea. Seeing that they said he acted rough, I can only guess that it's Se Gi.

51
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,520
Either way, Dr. Oh is the one in more danger right now, so we should report it to the police right away.

52
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,110
No, we can't. You know, don't you?

53
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,440
If the police get involved, the Vice-President and Seungjin Group will all be put in a troublesome situation.

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,170
Then you're saying it doesn't matter what happens to Dr. Oh?

55
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,830
Right now, I'm trying to find out from my people. So if you give me more time-

56
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,240
From the last bomb incident, it's already the second time!

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,950
Did you forget how dangerous Se Gi is!?

58
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,920
And Dr. Oh is a woman!

59
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,920
What are we doing?!

60
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,070
Just what is the reason why you brought me here?

61
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,240
I am giving you a chance to choose.

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,260
What am I suppose to choose?

63
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,120
(Between) Cha Do Hyun and I.

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,830
What?

65
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,400
You can't choose both. Choose only one out of the two.

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,330
What are you talking about right now?!
Either way Cha Do Hyun and you are one person!

67
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,880
Shut...

68
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,200
up.

69
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm not Cha Do Hyun.

70
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,990
If you go like this, it's the same as killing Cha Do Hyun.

71
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,440
The moment you leave this place, Cha Do Hyun dies.

72
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,510
Did you forget? One body till death.

73
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,560
Mors Sola.

74
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,610
The moment I slit my throat,

75
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,930
Cha Do Hyun dies with me.

76
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
Why exactly are you doing this to me?

77
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,020
I told you. I will give you a chance to choose.

78
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,830
You can't decide yet?

79
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,280
Then let's go inside. Aren't you curious

80
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,950
to what will happen inside there?

81
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,340
He has never hurt a woman or child before.

82
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,980
So if you could believe me and give me a little more time-

83
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,970
How did it go?

84
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,500
Exactly how are you doing your work!?

85
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,080
Calm down. We will catch him soon.

86
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,780
His last location that we've got is in Yong In,

87
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,480
and the location of the two targets' phones in this city have been tracked.

88
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,560
And just now, we have verified that he bought a convertible car with his credit card.

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,760
And we also secured a model picture of a foreign car.

90
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,670
Chief! An employee at Shin Ha Hotel in Yong In said he found Target 1's car.

91
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,330
Why?

92
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,800
First, the safety of Target 2 is the priority.

93
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,380
By using any method, we have to control Target 1

94
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,860
but also prioritize his safety.

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,010
Are you listening to me?

96
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,780
He is in a very dangerous situation, so send only your experienced agents to the scene!

97
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,590
What is that?

98
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,500
Is that...

99
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,390
a bear?

100
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,300
No matter who looks at it, it's a bear.

101
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,930
So why is a bear sitting right there is what I'm trying to say.

102
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,160
You liked it.

103
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,980
Who? Me? When?

104
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,190
It's not this?

105
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,040
No! It's not exactly that I hate it...

106
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,890
How about this?

107
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,430
Wait... Do I, perhaps, look really stupid to you?

108
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,010
If not, do I seem really simple-minded or something?

109
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,280
It's not this either?

110
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,380
How about this?

111
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,210
Excuse me. I'm asking this because I don't know,

112
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,060
but is this supposed to be funny?

113
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,380
Is this funny?

114
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,300
So you aren't trying to be funny.

115
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,820
That's what I thought.

116
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,360
How about this?

117
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,570
How about this?

118
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,020
Oh my God!

119
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,060
You're telling me to eat it, right?

120
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,040
Just what do you want?

121
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,030
What is the reason you are being like this to me?

122
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm asking you to choose me and not Cha Do Hyun.

123
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,310
Is this a dating house? Why are you dying to date?

124
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,700
I told you, it can't be both.

125
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,020
Choose. Is it me or Cha Do Hyun?

126
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,030
What do you keep on asking me to choose?
Either way you and Cha Do Hyun use the same body...

127
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,910
but are different people!
Yes, different people, of course!

128
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,140
Both of you guys are freaking charming so give me some time to think, alright!

129
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,280
I told you!

130
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,360
I don't have that much time.

131
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,330
Then, how about this?

132
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,930
Cha Do Hyun?

133
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,030
Is it this? It is.

134
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,550
This won't do. Follow me.

135
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,420
I'll get some really long arms at this rate.
Where are we going this time?

136
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,670
I'm asking this because I'm really curious.

137
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,970
If you tell me first where we are going right now,
does the earth's peace become threatened?

138
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,120
Does it interfere with the unification of North and South Korea?

139
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,270
That doctor gown is annoying. It's cold too.

140
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,780
Welcome.

141
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,250
We're having a sale.

142
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,430
- What are you doing?
- You only have these thin clothes?

143
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,500
Are the old-fashioned style an option as well?

144
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,980
Customer, if you mess up all the things here like this, what...

145
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,470
do you expect me to do is what I was thinking,
but we just need to organize it nicely again.

146
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,570
That looks warm.

148
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,720
This is threatening. What's the difference between this and stealing?

149
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,650
Is there a psycho thief who pays three times the original price?

150
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,290
That money isn't your money either. It's Cha Do Hyun's money.

151
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,910
Cha Do Hyun's money is my money.

152
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,640
Look at this arrogant personality.

153
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,350
Didn't you say that you and Cha Do Hyun are different people? Then isn't it only right for you to earn your own money?

154
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,440
Cha Do Hyun had the skill to make money and I have the skill to spend the money.

155
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,170
I'm just saying we should live our own lives with different temperaments and qualities. Is there a problem with that?

156
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,340
There is! Of course, there is! You just spend, play, and make trouble and just need to disappear, but

157
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,740
Cha Do Hyun works hard every single day going behind you and cleaning up the messes you make! Aren't you even sorry?

158
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,590
That is co-existence in its true sense.

159
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,120
It is the only reason I am tolerating Cha Do Hyun and his bad taste in things.

160
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,150
How is that co-existence in its true sense?

161
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,160
You're even more unfair than the Treaty of Ganghwa Island! (*between Japan and Korea in 1876, it is a classic example of an unfair treaty)

162
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Shut...up.

163
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,380
If I wasn't here then he would have already been dead.

164
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,650
I save him from danger and take on the pain for him instead.

165
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,470
It's me. Shin Se Gi.

166
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,040
I got it. Sorry. I crossed the line.

167
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,180
When that guy made me, we both became responsible for handling me.

168
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,160
I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize.

169
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,080
When you're with me,
don't ever speak his name again.

170
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,870
Okay. I got it. I said I got it!

171
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:41,960
♫ I keep wanting to ask you why you love me ♫

172
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,400
♫ Because I'm scared and frightened, I may let go of you ♫

173
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:56,760
♫ Those frightened eyes, those trembling lips ♫

174
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:05,530
♫ Are just so lovely; it's okay ♫

175
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,540
Se Gi!

176
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,700
Shin Se Gi!

177
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,200
Are you mad?

178
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Oh, so personalities can get mad too...

179
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,470
But how did you know I like fireworks?

180
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,180
You wanted to see it, from a long time ago.

181
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,360
He's starting again. When exactly did I...

182
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,420
Perhaps? I-no... Have you met Se Gi before?

183
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,640
Did you enjoy watching Winter Sonata?

184
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,600
What are you talking about?

185
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,230
Do I look like your dead first love?

186
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,520
-No.
-I don't look like her?

187
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,780
She is not dead.

188
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,680
She is alive, thankfully.

189
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,210
Wow! It's pretty!

190
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,210
Do you like this present?

191
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,580
Is there a person that doesn't like fireworks?

192
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,260
Don't you wish it could go on forever?

193
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,740
That's right.

194
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:19,380
It's the same for me.
I wish that I could be with you forever.

195
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,440
No, I think you misunderstood something, but

196
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,390
what I was saying was that I wish that those fireworks could go on forever.

197
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,720
Put Cha Do Hyun to sleep.

198
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,830
So he can't wake up forever.

199
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:43,800
Perhaps, when you met Se Gi, did he ask you for a favor?

200
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,440
I don't want to use this time with him.

201
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,920
I don't want to worry about when I could disappear when I'm with you.

202
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,430
So do it... for me. You are a doctor.

203
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,110
I... can't.

204
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,150
No, you will.

205
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,970
-I can't do it.
-No, you will.

206
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,430
I'll make it that way.

207
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:03,610
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave ♬

208
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:11,140
♬  It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again  ♬

209
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,750
♬I hear your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

210
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:24,880
♬  echoes in my ears everyday, but where are you? ♬

211
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,930
♬ On the night sky, which I cannot reach, I see you, who is turning back ♬

212
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:39,560
♬ and escaping me, making a picture ♬

213
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,240
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me ♬

214
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:54,100
♬But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall♬

215
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,550
Did you find him?

216
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,430
Because of this firework event, it's packed so it's going to be hard finding him.

217
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,240
Let's go.

218
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,470
What happened?

219
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,490
Oh Ri Jin, why are you here?

220
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,230
Was it Se Gi?

221
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,980
Please answer!

222
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,230
I heard that you were missing so I was worried and left a voice mail, but

223
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,410
Se Gi sent me a response

224
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,520
with your name.

225
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,570
What exactly did you take my warning for?

226
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,500
Don't call or answer.

227
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,980
Se Gi is dangerous so don't go close to him.
Did you forget? You didn't hear it? Or...

228
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,190
it's what a crazy guy said so did you just throw it in a trash can--

229
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,420
Got him!

230
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,710
Ah.

231
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,810
I'm Secretary Ahn, the one who called. Are you alright?

232
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,650
I'm alright. But...

233
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,400
Secretary Ahn.

234
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,660
It's me.

235
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,040
It's me, Secretary Ahn.

236
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,080
He's Cha Do Hyun. Let go of him.

237
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,150
Are you okay?

238
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,450
Since a trustworthy person came, I'll be going.

239
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,660
Then.

240
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,720
But...

241
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,440
Escort her to the hospital, she is probably shocked.

242
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,910
Yes. I will do that.

243
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,560
So what I was worried about finally happened.

244
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,280
Don't worry.

245
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,410
I don't plan to meet either of them again.

246
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,280
It's not something that can be solved just by you avoiding him.

247
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,650
The more you avoid him, his obsession might become worse.

248
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,320
But for now you are in danger so go home for a while.

249
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll put you officially under probation.

250
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,000
Dr. Oh, are you listening? Dr. Oh!

251
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,490
Yes?

252
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,670
What did you say?

253
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,620
Put Cha Do Hyun to sleep,

254
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,630
for me. So he won't wake up forever.

255
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,390
I... can't.

256
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,150
No, you will.

257
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,320
I will make it that way.

258
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,290
Just who in the world did I kiss?

259
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,660
And who is this pounding for?

260
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,290
I sent Dr. Oh home for now.

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm sorry.

262
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,450
It's not like two men are having a secret love.

263
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,380
How much longer do we have to meet secretly, hiding from other people's eyes?

264
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,530
There's no fundamental solution. We don't have a resource either.

265
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,560
Doctor.

266
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,620
What?

267
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,410
It seems that Oh Ri Jin

268
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,640
could be Se Gi's first love.

269
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,130
What?

270
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,430
Something's strange.

271
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,910
The way he acts towards Oh Ri Jin is completely different from how he acted before.

272
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,120
January 7th, 2015 at 10 PM on the dot.

273
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,990
The time that I fell for you.

274
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,740
For the first time he confessed his feelings to someone.

275
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,790
You said the person that has your face and says a different name is fake.

276
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,550
There's only me, Shin Se Gi, who has this face.

277
00:27:53,550 --> 00:28:00,090
I'm the only one. So you... must never forget my gaze.

278
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,860
He appealed to her to remember his name and eyes.

279
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,580
And if you think about it, every time the personality is about to change...

280
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,600
Always.... Oh Ri Jin was there.

281
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:19,170
Do you perhaps think Oh Ri Jin is the switch for the personality changes?

282
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,830
By some chance, in my past that I don't know, Se Gi

283
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,100
might have met Oh Ri Jin before.

284
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,770
Whether or not Doctor Oh is causing the switches,

285
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,860
it's certain that he's gotten stronger.

286
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,630
That he also showed up co-consciously is a clear warning sign.

287
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,540
The same goes with the new personality appearing.

288
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,810
If he gets stronger from here, it's not just Dr. Oh who is in danger.

289
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,940
If you want to protect people around you, you need to become truthful first.

290
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,340
Open up your heart and mind, and get help for the both of you.

291
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,880
That's the only safe way.

292
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,290
Are you really sure that the President ordered that?

293
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,550
That's what I told you! Ah...

294
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,080
You're here.

295
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
What is that?

296
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,630
What are you trying to do?

297
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,520
If you cut off the head and the tail then I won't be able to understand what you're trying to say.

298
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,820
'Revise it from beginning to the end over and over again.'

299
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,920
This 2000-scene project that only has to go into final editing,

300
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,410
what's your reason for telling me to look at it again?

301
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,460
Are you disobeying the President's order?

302
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,390
Isn't this too one-dimensional to keep me in check?

303
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,020
If you want me to be alienated by the company, you should have at least given me some highly difficult work.

304
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,310
Not this kind of child's play.

305
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,200
Why should I trust you?

306
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,030
-What?
-How can I leave any important work to you when I don't know what kind of guy you are?

307
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,780
-Hyung--
-President.

308
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,390
Call me President at work.

309
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,600
The people working here at ID Entertainment are people I personally chose.

310
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,010
What kind of environment they grew up in, what kind of education they received,

311
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,650
and how much potential they have.

312
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,540
Whether they are physically healthy enough to carry out important tasks,

313
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,260
as well as if they are in the right state of mind to do so.

314
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,050
I'll tell you this again. I don't work with people that I can't figure out.

315
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,110
I'm still looking into you, so wait.

316
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,110
Wait, Vice-President. Do you really intend to examine all of these?

317
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,700
If he says to look into it, then I should.

318
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,140
Secretary Ahn,

319
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,920
what is this?

320
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,750
It's something from the hotel room that Se Gi took Oh Ri Jin to.

321
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,700
The workers from the errand center brought it.

322
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,040
What are you thinking about so much that you can't even eat?
Are you perhaps…

323
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,830
thinking about me?

324
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,420
Or by any chance are you thinking about me?

325
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,500
Choose quickly. Is it me

326
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,690
or Cha Do Hyun?

327
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,620
What are you thinking about so much that you can't eat?

328
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,080
I've come right back to reality.

329
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,300
What would I be thinking about?
It's just because I have no appetite.

330
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,840
Why don't you have an appetite?
What in the world? You haven't eaten one bite!

331
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,340
You rascal! That's why you should have listened to your mom when she told you to rest when you were hospitalized. Why don't you listen to your mom? Why?

332
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,830
This won't do, Honey. Go catch a duck.

333
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,720
- Oh, it's fine, mom!
- Should I?

334
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,380
Ri On, come with your father and make some firewood.

335
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,690
I'll be chopping firewood until I die!
Seriously, she's not some kind of a hundred-year guest!

336
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,200
Why do we have to catch a duck whenever she comes? That's why they all run away when they see her!

337
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,070
-Won't you get up?
-Get up!

338
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,010
Always doing this to me...

339
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,460
After thinking if I should incinerate it,

340
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,240
I felt like there may be dangerous items mixed in, so I took it and brought it with me for now.

341
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,770
For example, if there are drugs or something in it.

342
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,860
Oh Ri Jin...why are you here?

343
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,050
What is this? Why am I like this? This isn't me.

344
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,720
There is no reason for my heart to race.

345
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,210
This isn't attachment or anticipation.

346
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,690
There's no reason for us to see each other again anyway.

347
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,110
But since it's a waste to just throw it away...

348
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,450
No, it's not. It isn't my heart that's beating.

349
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,620
You devilish thing. Whose fault is it that you're making a fuss about your heart racing and not being able to sleep?

350
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,170
I want cleave what is inside this learned head.

351
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,510
I wanna cleave that. Euyi! Euyi!

352
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,050
I am really good looking.

353
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,920
I wanna cleave that.

354
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,250
Yes, yes. The best thing to do when you're having stray thoughts is to exert your body.

355
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,240
After hiding the fact that you're under probation,
it's killing you inside now that you've eaten healthy food, isn't it?

356
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,720
Another day, another day,

357
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,540
another day is getting farther away.

358
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,680
Is there any soju at home?

359
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,770
S-Soju? Why?

360
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,420
I will get you a golden ratio of soju and beer, so let's have some so-maek (combination of soju and beer).

361
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,020
Aigoo, there's no point in that.

362
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,970
From a brewmaster's son's perspective I say that's not right.

363
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,980
This So-maek is a mixture of God's tears and the devil's pee.

364
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Did you already forget your father's strict words that he's been saying all your life?

365
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,600
That's why I said we should just go buy it at the store.

366
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,670
Hey! What's this? What are you doing right now?

367
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,940
Why are you under probation?

368
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,040
I need to know the content to keep the secret.

369
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,170
Forget it, you don't need to know.

370
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,190
You think I don't know you're trying
to write a novel about it again?

371
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,370
I'm the stupid one for following him
just because he threatened me.

372
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,010
Hey, what is it? Did a patient take you as a hostage and escape?

373
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,080
-So what about the patient? Did the patient come back safely?
-I don't know!

374
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,840
There isn't a reason to see him ever again.

375
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:59,300
What's wrong with that car? I guess I can't drive that well.

376
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,650
Come out.

377
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,840
Ssang Ri. This is the right place.

378
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,080
Ah, I'm so good at finding stuff.

379
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,390
This smell of a mature rice wine!

380
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,320
My heart is already going

381
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,130
ba-dum ba-dum.

382
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,960
It's nice.

383
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,730
Oh my...what is this?

384
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,950
He is already trying to crawl out?

385
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,760
Damn it.

386
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,770
You shouldn't be doing this.

387
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,810
The time is too short.

388
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,720
My head!

389
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,930
I'm dying!

390
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,930
I still wanted to play a little bit more.

391
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,620
It's cold. Where is this place?

392
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,740
Ah, Perry Park, seriously.

393
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,520
- Will this be enough?
- Hey, let's just have it today to rinse our mouths. Let's take it lightly.

394
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,220
Hey, hide it so that dad won't see it.

395
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,170
How do you hide this? That's why I said that we should buy a couple small bottles...

396
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,130
Don't hit me! Seriously...

397
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,060
What is wrong?

398
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,840
I wonder...

399
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,300
what is that?

400
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,160
Oh my god... This is awesome!

401
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,240
The car is all bouncing!

402
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,630
Hey, follow me!

403
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,520
Hey! Are you crazy!? Hey!

404
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,810
-What are you doing over here?
-Perry Park!

405
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,190
You're Perry Park, right?!

406
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,480
Drink all the way. Let's drink.

407
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,130
But if you came, you should have just come in.

408
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,490
Why did you insist on changing your clothes and get humiliated?
Are you… a pervert?

409
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,300
You... to a guest, seriously.

410
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,020
Oh, that's right. You remember her, right?
The one that was ripping out my hair at the airport.

411
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,590
Oh, yes.

412
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,490
Hello.

413
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,650
Ah, yes. Hello.

414
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:16,060
By the way Ri On, how did you get close to Perry?

415
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,590
We understood each other. I realized it, Perry's extremely opposite and fatal charms.

416
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,750
What did I do on the airplane?

417
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,980
Oh, you don't remember?

418
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,390
For one, the aura he gave off in his entrance was different.

419
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,240
From the moment he sat, he took out his cellphone.

420
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,550
I wondered if he was saying goodbye one last time to his lover before we took off

421
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,770
or maybe he's giving out an important order for his business?

422
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,540
Nope, that wasn't it.

423
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,030
How do you feel about stepping into your country after eleven years, friend?

424
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,390
Hey, hey don't look at me like that.

425
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:30,060
A man must have ambition. Don't you want to be the owner of Seung Jin Group?

426
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,980
What are you looking at?

427
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:43,540
A message sent to his own self. That beautiful narcissism.

428
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,630
From then on, whenever my heart goes weak,
I leave myself a video message.

429
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,930
Are you looking Oh Ri On? Are you listening Oh Ri On?

430
00:42:53,810 --> 00:43:00,230
Hey, hey, hey. But how did you become close enough with such a scary person to be even exchanging business card?

431
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,950
My father is throwing out another critical question.
So about that,

432
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,100
after leaving a video full of narcissism, he just slept with his arms crossed.

433
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,870
So I also had a cup of wine and closed my eyes, but...

434
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,330
You sca-scared me.

435
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,360
You're awake.

436
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,180
I'm sorry.

437
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,060
But where did you buy this?

438
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,980
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it in any stores.

439
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,580
Ah, I...

440
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,520
I'm really in the need of a drink right now, so

441
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,310
can I drink with you?

442
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,680
Can I not?

443
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,020
That shocking reversal! His Bong Junho-like humor! (famous Korean director know for his movie style of humor and sudden-shifting of mood)

444
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,780
From that moment on, we were friends.

445
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,340
Bravo.

446
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,370
B-bravo.

447
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,610
Turn like this! Up!

448
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,540
Now, it's all spilling. Move, move, move.

449
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,610
Like this...

450
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,590
Okay!

451
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,240
He's one of us, one of us!

452
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,080
But you're not using any accent right now.

453
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,810
Yes?

454
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,760
I fixed it. That is my drunken habit.

455
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,610
Anyways, that day I gave him our business card.

456
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:53,640
That if he comes to Korea, to have a glass of beer made by the world's best brewmaster.

457
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:00,590
I'm going to treat you to something valuable.
Ri Jin, go up to the basement and

458
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,540
get the 'God bubbles'.

459
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,820
Why do you want me to get that? He brought his car.

460
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:11,430
Hey, if a guest came then we should give him that. Hurry go, go on!

461
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,220
Do you want to come with me? I'll show you around the basement.

462
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,650
-Oh, then..
-No, no.

463
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,670
The guest is supposed to be sitting. Just stay seated. Ri Jin, move.

464
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,370
Sit! Sit! Sit down!

465
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:34,200
Nice to meet you! I welcome you.

466
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,080
But I don't really take alcohol well--

467
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,120
That's right.

468
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,350
Wait a minute.

469
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,760
Writer Oh, are you finished with the draft of the novel series?

470
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,100
I'll come back soon after dealing with some work.
Just a minute will do, a minute.

471
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,990
Excuse me...

472
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,900
Ah! You. Sit down. What's wrong? Just sit.

473
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,940
Sit down.

474
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,470
Did you say it was Perry?

475
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,100
Are you a Korean from overseas?

476
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,110
No.

477
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:07,080
I used to live in America to study abroad when I was younger.

478
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,210
It must have been hard living abroad alone.
Are you back in Korea for sure?

479
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,270
Yes, well, for now. But...

480
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,320
please speak informally to me.

481
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,680
If we become closer. We can do that, right?

482
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,300
Yes? Oh, yes. What...

483
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,330
Excuse me for a moment.

484
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,330
Excuse yourself to the restroom and come outside.

485
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,600
She told you to come outside by saying you need to use the restroom, right?

486
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,720
Yes?

487
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,060
Go now.

488
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,920
Yes.

489
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,130
Leave that here.

490
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,060
- This?
- It looks nice. I want to see.

491
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,410
Leave it here.

492
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,240
Hurry, go on.

493
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,160
Oh Ri Jin!

494
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,770
Don't misunderstand. I brought you here because this is the only place where we can talk undisturbed.

495
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,010
Anyway, it seems my brother met your personalities.

496
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,940
Thankfully, he hasn't figured out that you have D.I.D., so I think you can relax.

497
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,470
Yes.

498
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,110
But did you really come to meet my brother? Or...

499
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,470
Perhaps, to see me...

500
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,010
No. It's Perry Park who came, not I.

501
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,760
I didn't even know this is where you lived.

502
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,980
Is this some Independence Movement? Why are you so eager to prove your innoncence? Whatever, forget it!

503
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,870
I'm done talking. Do you have something to say to me?

504
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,170
If not, then!

505
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,890
What are you doing right now?!

506
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,060
Please don't misunderstand. I'm not going to do anything.

507
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,660
I wanted to quietly ask you about what Se Gi said.

508
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,050
It's not that!

509
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,530
That door's broken so it only opens from the front!

510
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,700
Cell phone! Give me your cellphone! I'll tell my brother to open the door.

511
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,770
No, no, no. That... That...

512
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:08,630
What to do?

513
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,840
Why did you take away his cellphone? That's so immature.

514
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,420
I was planning to give him some alcohol since our daughter is interested in him.

515
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,740
I was trying to figure out if he's useful or not, or needed to be set straight.

516
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,650
Did you figure it out?

517
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,350
Of course. Every time I said something like that, she would look at him

518
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:26,680
and tell him to come outside. Do you think that I don't have eyes to even notice that?

519
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:33,340
He looks innocent. Unlike kids these days, he looks thoughtful. He's polite and his smiling looks nice.

520
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,050
He must have been taught manners well.

521
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,990
What's with the all the lights being turned off?

522
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,380
Ahjumma!

523
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,300
Ahjumma!

524
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,120
Oh, scared me!

525
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,570
Mother.

526
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,870
What are you doing there? You scared me.

527
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,870
Were you in Yangpyeong this whole time?

528
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,280
What do you mean Yangpyeong?

529
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,210
Go try fooling a ghost.

530
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,730
Do you think that I didn't know that you were visiting Joon Pyo?

531
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,040
If you weren't going to sit still and do nothing,

532
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,520
then why didn't you?

533
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,550
Either the quilt isn't ready yet, or the skirt width is narrow.

534
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,040
Just for the record, you hid him a twelfth time, Mother.

535
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,210
But because you used to be my son's woman.

536
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,160
Because it's a fact that you gave birth to my son's kid.

537
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,330
It's boring if the playtime gets too long. Since you already played enough, stop.

538
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:49,930
Why did our ever cold mother become so forgiving?

539
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:55,550
Why? Do you understand the situation now?

540
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,700
Are you getting scared of what I will say?

541
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,780
Don't worry.

542
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,110
It was hard to be in this advantageous situation. I won't waste it.

543
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,490
If you just cooperate with Do Hyun and treat him well...

544
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,790
You think the secret that is in your hand

545
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,240
looks like wings that will help your son fly.

546
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,780
But that is a foolish thought.

547
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,510
That is something that will cut your son's throat, a knife.

548
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,700
-What do you mean a knife?
-If you want to protect your son, then live quietly.

549
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,470
If you just blabber around, without knowing anything,

550
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,000
you will become a foolish mother who sticks a knife in her son's back.

551
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,720
What do you mean a knife behind Do Hyun's back?

552
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,370
Please say it so I can understand.

553
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,260
I can only say it so that you can understand if it is possible for you to understand.

554
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,610
Afraid?

555
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,120
Me?

556
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,220
Try opening it. Flap your tongue all you want.

557
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,700
The only person who will be harmed...

558
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,240
is your son.

559
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,740
Mother.

560
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,960
Mother, where are you going in the middle of talking?

561
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,710
Mother!

562
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,450
Chairman Cha Gun Ho and his daughter-in-law President Min Seo Yeon of Seung Jin Group killed in a car crash

563
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,650
Cha Gun Ho's eldest son, Cha Joon Pyo became the successor of Seung Jin Group

564
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:46,490
A mysterious fire in Seung Jin group.

565
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,040
Will he be able to live a happy life after this tragedy?

566
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,030
Is there some kind of a secret in the family house?

567
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,670
Isn't Shin Hwa Ran that family's open secret, as she would have said anyway?

568
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:02,450
I don't know. That secret (Shin Hwa Ran) is holding another secret

569
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,300
and is threatening Aunt with it.

570
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,560
"I know the horrifying secrets of Seung Jin.

571
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,260
If I open my mouth the wrong way then Seung Jin Group will fall."

572
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,620
"Min Seo Yeon probably died after shedding blood and tears."

573
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:23,760
Seeing as if Aunt's face grew white as paper, she's not just talking nonsense.

574
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,610
Do you know something?

575
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,210
There was a strange rumor going around.

576
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,570
Do you remember Uncle and Joon Pyo Hyung once ended their relationship as father and son?

577
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,520
Of course, I remember.

578
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,380
Joon Pyo left the house, and thanks to that, Min Seo Yeon went to America.

579
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,080
Joon Pyo had the right to be mad.

580
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,230
Uncle treasured his daughter-in-law over his son.

581
00:53:55,230 --> 00:54:02,670
Pushing aside his only son and placing his daughter-in-law in the CEO seat was not a rational decision.

582
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,950
She was an overqualified woman for Joon Pyo to begin with.

583
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,840
Ability, appearance, financial acumen, distribution.

584
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,310
-She excelled in all areas.
-Even still,

585
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,950
on a family that has no sons, how can he take back his daughter-in-law?

586
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,900
And he even went to America to look for her!

587
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,350
Anyways, when Min Seo Yeon came back, there was a strange rumor going around.

588
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,970
The rumor of Min Seo Yeon having a child...

589
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,820
Are you saying he had a child other than Do Hyun?

590
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,030
That child, do you think he's in Joon Pyo's bloodline?

591
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,920
That child is a child born out of wedlock then?

592
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,480
It's just a rumor, so it's hard to find out if it's true.

593
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,040
More than that, there wasn't anyone that actually saw that child.

594
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,840
Then that's a rumor without evidence.

595
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,800
But you know,

596
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,300
thinking about it now, it's not really baseless talk.

597
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:08,060
After there was a big fire, they changed all the workers in the house.

598
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:13,120
Back then, Uncle could have been trying to hide something.

599
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,320
Hide...

600
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,650
The child?

601
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,270
We don't know if that child actually existed,

602
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:29,010
or if it's a girl or boy, but

603
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:34,730
if that child, who was thoroughly hidden, suddenly completely disappeared...

604
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,470
The mail has been sent.

605
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,990
Yes, editor. I sent it by mail right now.

606
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,610
Ah, also,

607
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:56,320
the plan for a long novel that I stopped last time...

608
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,410
I'm starting it again.

609
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:05,450
Yes. I gave up because I didn't get anything from the info gathering I did in the US.

610
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:10,140
It seems like the goddess of luck decided to be on my side.

611
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,080
Yes, then I will hang up.

612
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,770
Seung Jin's lineage

613
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,980
Cha Gun Ho. Seo Tae Im.

614
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,970
Cha Young Pyo. Yoon Ja Kyung.

615
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,280
Cha Ki Joon. CEO of Seung Jin Group's ID Entertainment.

616
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,850
Cha Do Hyun. Vice President of Seung Jin Group's ID Entertainment

617
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,960
Stop trying so hard.

618
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,400
When they notice we are gone, they will come and find us.

619
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,740
Do you want to have a glass, too, Mr. Cha?

620
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,280
Mr. Cha?

621
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:22,290
Se Gi said to never say your name in front of him again, so

622
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:26,030
to be equal, I decided to go with Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin.

623
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,900
The kind Mr. Cha. The rough Mr. Shin.

624
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,150
Right now... You're Mr. Shin!

625
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,040
Right?

626
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,740
It's Mr. Cha.

627
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,170
Ah, right, right! It's Mr. Cha.

628
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,740
I'm drunk so I forgot momentarily, I'm sorry.

629
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,340
- Stop drinking now.
- No!

630
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:56,670
Actually, I am drinking because I'm scared.

631
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,280
I don't have claustrophobia, agoraphobia,

632
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,550
stage frights, or acrophobia (fear of heights).
I am not scared of those things.

633
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,390
But fire and basements...

634
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:17,870
I am just a li---ttle scared of them.

635
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,270
It's similar to me.

636
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:24,820
So since I was younger, my father would make me do all the basement chores.

637
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,930
He said that I needed to overcome it.

638
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,960
If I come down here and smelled the good tree scents

639
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,930
then I would know that the basement is not a scary place.

640
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,130
So!

641
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,890
I persuaded my brother to come with me.

642
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,090
But!

643
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,440
He is scared of it, too.

644
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,950
Twins are twins it seems!

645
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,980
Are you alright?

646
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,480
This isn't me.

647
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,640
There is no way this sound is mine.

648
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,420
What is this? It's beating again? Who is it beating for this time?

649
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,800
He didn't change by any chance, did he?

650
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,610
Perhaps...

651
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,680
Shin Se Gi?

652
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:41,370
Oh Ri Jin, are you still confused between me and Se Gi?

653
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,270
Should I make it so you won't confuse us?

654
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,390
♫  To anyone,  ♫

655
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:17,100
♫  there is a secret that cannot be told  ♫

656
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,590
♫ Anybody ♫

657
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:27,350
♫  has that kind of thing  ♫

658
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:36,630
♫  Even if you love a person like me,  ♫

659
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,400
♬What can I do about my heart being like this? ♬
