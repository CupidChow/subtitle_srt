Episode 12

2
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,210
-That night, 21 years ago...
-That other kid should have been saved...

3
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,430
The one who saved you from the fire...was your father.

4
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,150
The other kid should have been saved instead of me.

5
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,710
That's what's humane!

6
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,590
Father.

7
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,960
Father... How...

8
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,720
You got it wrong again.

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,480
I was wrong. I was wrong, Daddy.

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,960
What did I say I'll do if you do it incorrectly?

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,120
I was wrong!

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,170
Ah!

13
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,750
Who did I say will be punished if you keep continuing to do it incorrectly?

14
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,750
Father, I was wrong...
Father, I was wrong...

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,420
In the end who will be in pain?

16
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,750
I told you I'll be scolded, right?

17
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,710
I told you my feelings will get hurt, right?

18
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,710
Also...

19
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,870
That's why...

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,460
you need to do better. Right?

21
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,000
That way... no one will be hurt.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,860
Right?

23
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,620
Ah!

24
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,290
Who's the kid that was next to me?

25
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,460
Cha Do Hyun, shouldn't you deal with your past now?

26
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,670
The people that made you into a monster,

27
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,750
you can't just leave them be. Isn't that right?

28
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
If you want to do it, come out.

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,920
If you want to stop me, come out. You can't, can you?

30
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,250
Then stay crumpled up in there forever.

31
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,920
Don't ever come back out!

32
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,790
Shin Se Gi...

33
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,790
I won't lose to you.

34
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,040
I won't lose to you.

35
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,080
Ah...

36
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,210
Ugh...

37
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,000
Father...

38
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,650
Who are you? Who are you?

39
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,530
Just why in the world are you doing this to me?!

40
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,000
You...

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,870
That you told me not to bring up...

42
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,290
Cha Do Hyun's name in front of mom and dad

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,960
and not talk about Seungjin Group,

44
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,080
it's connected to all of this, right?

45
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,870
Right?

46
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,040
Please leave.

47
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,230
You dare to joke...

48
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,320
around about killing my son?

49
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,860
This is why they say not to take in a mindless beast.

50
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,020
I will think of it as my thoughtless mistake.

51
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,360
I shouldn't have taken your mother and you in.

52
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,690
I shouldn't have let you step into Seungjin Group.

53
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,510
- Chairwoman...
- Today's incident, for Seungjin Group's reputation,

54
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,450
I will just think of this as a cheap payment for protecting that empty seat all this while.

55
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,950
However, if you go near your father again, then--

56
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,610
You're sorry?

58
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,190
I... I... only remembered it now.

59
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,650
It's just I think I've lived forgetting about Father for a long time now.

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,360
I feel sorry for not properly giving my greetings to Father even once...

61
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,820
O-O-Of course, I know well that

62
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,020
you don't like me and my mother

63
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,420
being near Father.

64
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,570
So I couldn't tell you the circumstances and on my own accord... I'm sorry.

65
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,900
Shall I cut off those lingering feelings?

66
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,610
Shall I cut it off?

67
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,190
Because I know well that Father

68
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,430
became like that after saving me, it hurts and

69
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,110
I feel sorry.

70
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,610
And I feel thankful.

71
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,070
I never asked to be saved!

72
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,360
I never asked to be saved! I never begged to be saved!

73
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,230
For causing concerns... I'm sorry.

74
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,190
Please forgive me.

75
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,070
I don't want to see you any longer today, so get rid of your face in front of me.

76
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,320
Chairwoman...

77
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,900
I want to ask something.

78
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,730
When I was young...

79
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,400
was I abused by my father?

80
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,070
What do you want to ask?

81
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,770
When I was young... was there another child

82
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,630
other than me in Seungjin Group?

83
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,110
The other child should have been saved.

84
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,940
That child should have been saved instead of me!

85
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,860
That's what's humane!

86
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Please tell me.

87
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,900
Other than me, was there another child my age?

88
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,650
You're the one who's controlling Seungjin Group.
I'm going to take everything and give it to that child.

89
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,480
To atone for the past...

90
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,310
How many times do I have to tell you?

91
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,650
I said it's just a simple gathering of data.

92
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,860
The next novel material is about a chaebol and mystery.

93
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,420
How can I leave out covering Seungjin Group?

94
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,470
Tell me truthfully.

95
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,340
- Ah, what now?
- Meeting Cha Do Hyun in the airplane wasn't a coincidence, right?

96
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,390
You followed him, didn't you?

97
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,980
Ah, please!

98
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,250
Can't you just understand it as a writer's nature and passion and just get over it?

99
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,690
This is too sneaky. This is hitting below the belt.

100
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,860
Hiding your true motives, then gathering data about him.

101
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,730
Don't you think that as a human being, this is not proper?

102
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,570
I revealed it anyway. I revealed it.

103
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,950
Every time I saw him it pricked my conscience so I revealed that I'm Omega

104
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,940
and sold my copyright. Is that enough? Happy?

105
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,990
You're not going to perhaps write a novel on multiple personality disorders, are you?

106
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,770
This... seriously!

107
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,750
Do you see me as someone who will make business out of someone else's private issues?

108
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,050
Give it to me.

109
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,680
Leave right now!

110
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,870
I said I'll drive you there.

111
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,180
Ah, what? What now? What, what?

112
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,290
Then what is the reason you told me to never bring up Cha Do Hyun's name in front of Mom and Dad?

113
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,000
What is the reason you told me to hide the fact that Cha Do Hyun is part of Seungjin Group?

114
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,820
Oh.

115
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,590
That... That...

116
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,380
Why are you stuttering? Why can't you talk? Why do your eyes keep shifting?

117
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,610
Ah, please!

118
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,170
You have to give me time to speak so that I can tell you!

119
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,890
Because that's his privacy!

120
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,580
You, too, can't just reveal a patient's mental history.

121
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,250
Also, if it's known that you

122
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,870
are with a young man that's not even an old chaebol,

123
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,190
on top of that, that you live under the same roof...

124
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,980
What do you think Mom and Dad are going to do, huh?

125
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,060
What do you think will happen?

126
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,970
Really, you should have been careful!

127
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,060
Ah!

128
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,650
Oh, hey, hey! Ri Jin, you haven't gone yet?

129
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,720
-Why, dad?
-Good thing. You should give your mom a hand.

130
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,140
Your mom cut her finger while cutting up meat.

131
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,350
How!?

132
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,220
- Mom! Are you okay?
- Hurry up, hurry up.

133
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,470
What do you mean a child? What child?

134
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,710
I don't know whether it's a boy or a girl,

135
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,120
- but I know the child is about my age--
- I'm already forever regretting taking in just you...

136
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,900
There's no way for there to be another child.

137
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,150
Ajummoni.

138
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,100
Yes? Vice President, please speak.

139
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,000
Mom's inside, right? Can you please call her out? I have something to ask her.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,780
Madame went abroad, today.

141
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,840
-Why did she go abroad suddenly?
-You don't remember?

142
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,420
You sent her there, Vice President.

143
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,440
I did? When?

144
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,510
Not now, but when you came in last time.

145
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:28,840
You told her to stay abroad for a while and that you would contact her when the time was right.

146
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,020
Yes.

147
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,050
Excuse me, Customer. We're here.

148
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,350
- Here you go.
- Yes.

149
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,810
Here you go.

150
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Father.

151
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,960
Father, I...

152
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,590
Father, why me...

153
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,870
Oh Ri Jin.

154
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh Ri Jin.

155
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,210
Oh Ri Jin!

156
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,590
- Ah, jeez.
- Oh Ri Jin. I don't see Oh Ri Jin.

157
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

158
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,780
I came back.

159
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,830
-Vice President!
-But...

160
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,890
Oh Ri Jin is...

161
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,180
- I can't find Oh Ri Jin.
- Don't worry about Oh Ri Jin.

162
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,860
She just went home for a while, and she called to say she's on her way here.

163
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,310
What's the matter?

164
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,110
Are you all right?

165
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,400
No, I just...

166
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,090
I just suddenly, I...

167
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,960
I thought I harmed Oh Ri Jin.

168
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,000
Why do you think that way?

169
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,980
If you mess with my woman, your woman will be in danger.

170
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,930
What about Chae Yeon?

171
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,700
Is Chae Yeon safe?

172
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,670
So, are you going to break off this engagement?

173
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,980
Do you want to break it?

174
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,310
I can't be 100% sure Ki Joon Oppa is the right person for me for the rest of my life!

175
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,670
How many women in this world get engaged with 100% certainty?

176
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,360
Mom, just whose side are you on?

177
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
Cha Do Hyun

178
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,110
Who is it?

179
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,550
Hey, Chae Yeon. Chae Yeon! Chae Yeon!

180
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,510
She's gone insane.

181
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,070
She's gone totally insane.

182
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,050
No, it's okay. I just called, it's nothing important.

183
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,720
I can just call her again.

184
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,490
Yes.

185
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,930
What did she say? Did she say she won't call back?

186
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,600
She must have had a really hard time trying on the engagement dresses today.

187
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,550
Figures.You didn't listen to mom when I told you to take one or two hours off no matter how busy you were.

188
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,690
Standing in a dress without her man to see, do you know how depressing that is?

189
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,910
It's probably Marriage Blues.
Marriage Blues: Feeling anxious before a wedding.

190
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,590
Marriage blues or black, whatever...

191
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,770
it's expected to cause a quarrel, really.

192
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,950
Are you my doctor?

193
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,910
Why do you keep asking about my safety?

194
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,190
I'm fine, nothing's really going on.

195
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,190
It's good then that nothing has happened.

196
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,320
- If you're safe, then that's good.
- Why do you keep calling?

197
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,490
Why? So you can promote about having a lovefest again?

198
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,860
You're going to talk about us meeting at nights without our partners knowing again?

199
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,020
Do I look that easy to you?

200
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,190
I'm sorry.

201
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:19,020
But Chae Yeon, whatever I said, it wasn't my sincerity,

202
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,110
so don't take it to heart.

203
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,990
Just think of it as being bitten by a mad dog. Forget about it.

204
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,320
What?
-This is the only way for me to explain it to you so I'm sorry.

205
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,290
I will live my entire life atoning for whatever wrong I did to you.

206
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,770
-I'm hanging up.
-Hello?

207
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,540
Hello?

208
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,670
Try it. It's a type of tea that calms you down.

209
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,760
It's the first time I've lost consciousness for this long.

210
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,170
Just what exactly happened while I was gone?

211
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,370
Speculating and imagining about what happened is slowly becoming difficult now.

212
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,320
You have to become stronger.

213
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,030
If you don't want to lose your consciousness to a false image, if you don't want to lose the people precious to you, you have no choice but to become stronger.

214
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,420
I will find out what happened between Se Gi and the President.

215
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,110
There's a route we can follow to find out.

216
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,100
I have one more favor.

217
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,380
Please tell me.

218
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,300
21 years ago, before the fire...

219
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:42,200
At the Seungjin Group mansion, find out if there was a child my age other than me.

220
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,360
A child?

221
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,960
If there perhaps was a child, then figure out quickly whether it was a boy or a girl, and what kind of child it was.

222
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,930
Hey, from now on, bring your car.

223
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,420
You are wasting highly qualified human resource.

224
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,140
Hey, hey, hey! Forget it! Dad will drive her.

225
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,510
What's the address? I'll find it in no time with the GPS.

226
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,760
No!!!
- No!!!

227
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,880
What's… wrong?

228
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
I was wrong. I deserve to die. I'll take her.

229
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,090
You rascal. You should've said that sooner.

230
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,790
Hey, but you know that Perry or Henry friend of yours,

231
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,490
he said he's coming back last time he was here, but he's not coming.

232
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,160
Wait a minute. I should try calling him while I'm at it.

233
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
- No!
- No, no, no!!!

234
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,850
What's wrong with you kids today!?

235
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,100
You are so negative about everything? Why can't I? Why?

236
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,520
Don't be like this and ask him to really come.

237
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,610
He must've finished all the side dishes he packed last time as well.

238
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,140
No, no, no. I looked in his fridge and it seemed to be untouched-- AHHHHHH!

239
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,370
Dad! Mom! I'm leaving.

240
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,210
- She really is weak.
- Right.

241
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,730
It's not like we're some kind of a brother-sister conman team or something. Why am I even involved in this?

242
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,050
Sorry, Oh Ri On. I love you, Oh Ri On.

243
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,120
I don't have anything to say, Oh Ri On.

244
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,930
Don't worry about it and bring him over.

245
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,560
What?

246
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,570
You alone became his friend and his family. It must have been hard on you.

247
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,440
Their daughter is a psychiatrist so our parents are not people who won't understand.

248
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,230
If you're suffering alone, I'm telling you to bring him over.

249
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,840
We'll be his friends and family instead of you.

250
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,130
-Oh Ri On.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,530
Forget about those emotions. But who was that guy?

252
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,510
Everything starting from his gaze seemed different from Cha Do Hyun.

253
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,250
Who? Ah, Shin Se Gi?

254
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,250
Shin Se Gi?

255
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,900
He seemed pretty dangerous.

256
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,460
No way! He looks like it on the outside, but he's really innocent.

257
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,590
He has a cute side, too.

258
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,320
More than that, there is another personality that you have to be careful about.

259
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,850
Me? Who?

260
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,240
There is a personality more dangerous than Shin Se Gi?

261
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,820
Who is this? Is this your brother?

262
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,510
I marked him, he's mine.

263
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,550
It exists, that kind of personality.

264
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,660
I am expressing my sincere condolences ahead of time.

265
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,040
Why? Who is it?

266
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,280
Are you really okay?

267
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,210
I'm okay.

268
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm going to wash up under hot water and rest.

269
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,940
Oh Ri Jin is running later than expected.

270
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,330
Then I will trust Oh Ri Jin who is soon making her comeback, and head out first.

271
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,810
Chae Yeon?

272
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,030
I feel like I'm going to go crazy, seriously.

273
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm going crazy because of my hurt pride.

274
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,350
Stop, brother!

275
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,680
What? Why, sister?

276
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,820
That crazy psycho Shin Se Gi. He really doesn't listen.

277
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,580
From what I see, it's a melodrama. Is it supposed to be action?

278
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,520
What is it now? Your emotions right now, I mean.

279
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,250
Head out. I'm going out to film 'Love and War.'

280
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,210
Chae Yeon? Listen to me for a moment.

281
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,080
Hey, Cha Do Hyun! You trashy bastard!

282
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,350
Are you human? No matter how mad you are at me

283
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,120
is this something to do with a girl whose engagement is coming up?

284
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,960
Oh Ri Jin!

285
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,590
I'm sorry, Team Leader Han! This person had a fight with me and got extremely angry

286
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,330
so it seems while he was drunk he went to find you and acted like he was your ex-boyfriend.

287
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,230
Don't fall for it. Never fall for it. He's always like this, always.

288
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,120
Oh Ri Jin?

289
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,700
I'll recycle this trash, so Team Leader Han, you can spit on him and be on your way.

290
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,400
Spit twice, three times! Then.

291
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,150
-Oh Ri Jin! Ow! Ow, ow, ow...
-Hey, come here!

292
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,070
Oh Ri Jin, Oh Ri Jin...

293
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:01,900
So, it's still not yet time for the melodramatic emotional lines, huh?

294
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,580
Oh Ri Jin! Ow, ow, ow...

295
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,030
Mr. Shin, are you going to keep being like this?

296
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,650
Deal number 3. To not ruin Mr. Cha's reputation. Did you forget?

297
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,060
I told you. When you cause trouble and disappear, it's the end for you.

298
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,170
But Mr. Cha does his best cleaning up the aftermath of that.

299
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,920
If you're going to keep at it like this, I'm going to minus 10 points. Okay?

300
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,930
You smile?

301
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,870
Since you've been acting as Mr. Cha all this time, your acting has improved a lot!

302
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,450
This is seriously worthy of an end of the year drama award. Did you practice all night?

303
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,160
Wow! I admit it! That totally looked the same right now!

304
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,770
People might mistake you as Mr. Cha...

305
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,830
Feels like Mr. Cha...but not...

306
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,310
like Mr. Cha...?

307
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,750
I'm Mr. Cha.

308
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,990
I came back.

309
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,590
♫ A secret ♫

310
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,830
♫ that can't be told to anyone ♫

311
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:37,440
Perhaps... are you disappointed that I came back?
♫ Everyone has at least one of those ♫

312
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh Ri Jin, why are you suddenly like this to me?

313
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,640
Why are you only coming now, seriously!

314
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,290
I thought you would never come back so do you know how worried Secretary Ahn and I were!?

315
00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:00,770
Mr. Shin always threatened me to kill you and he constantly didn't listen to me.

316
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,080
You always appeared in my dreams and said your goodbyes.

317
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,840
I thought you disappeared because of me, so do you know how scared I was!?

318
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,050
♫ Don't love me, who is like this ♫

319
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,530
♫ What can I do about my heart being like this? ♫

320
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,460
I have come back.

321
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,880
I won't ever be late again.
♫ The only thing I can give you ♫

322
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,180
♫ is just my unstoppable tears ♫

323
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,790
If this is Mr. Shin acting like Mr. Cha, you're dead meat!

324
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,690
♫ With an unfamiliar face, ♫

325
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:53,050
♫ I will just hurt your heart ♫

326
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:01,050
♫ Just let me love you by myself ♫

327
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,080
End of report. According to Article 4, Mr. Cha's favorite contract rule,

328
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,010
I have truthfully reported to you, without leaving out or hiding anything,

329
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,700
everything that has occurred while one of the personalities of Party A (Cha Do Hyun), Shin Se Gi, was here for the past two days.

330
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,630
Questions?

331
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,080
Then... what happened between Se Gi and Chae Yeon...

332
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,510
We can only leave that to our imaginations.

333
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,750
So the results of that imagining is?

334
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,290
Nothing. Nothing probably happened.

335
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,950
He said to imagine as much as I trust him.

336
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,970
Your trust in Se Gi is deeper than I thought.

337
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,030
You were jealous just now, right?

338
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,980
Oh my. Look at you not even denying it now.

339
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:17,770
Why did my mom give birth to such a charming daughter, making people all tired.

340
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,180
If you don't have any more questions, you should get ready for work.

341
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,580
I do have a question.

342
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,170
To be honest, it was something I was curious about since yesterday.

343
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,770
What is this?

344
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,110
You see, what this is...

345
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,650
I prepared this because you seemed to be having trouble deciding.

346
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,730
If you can't decide on your own, leave it to the gods.

347
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,690
So, the result was?

348
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,170
[Cha Do Hyun]

349
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,970
God really does exist!

350
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,360
That's why... that's...

351
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,150
Damn it!

352
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,820
Damn it! Damn it! This is invalid!

353
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,980
I understand. This is invalid.

354
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,870
Why are you going against God's will?

355
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,360
Were you that kind of a doubtful person?

356
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,940
It's like a whip and a carrot.

357
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,770
I can get whipped once, but get a carrot.

358
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,020
So just what is the carrot you received?

359
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,480
I won't get angry.

360
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,770
I won't use violence. I won't ruin his reputation.

361
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,270
So, you were able to tame the mighty Shin Se Gi?

362
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,820
Thanks to that, I was able to protect your life in the company.

363
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,200
Mr. Shin posed as you.

364
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,230
So Mr. Cha should try as well.

365
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,810
What is it?

366
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,070
Are you ready for work...

367
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,900
Could it be... you're not going to wear this to work, right?

368
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
I can't?

369
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,610
No… I thought, it was a little...

370
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,070
-Let's go.
- Wait a minute!

371
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,860
Won't people get suspicious if you change so much like this so suddenly only after a couple of days?

372
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,270
How about if we close the gap?

373
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,190
Are you perhaps asking me to act like Se Gi?

374
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,690
Not act like him...

375
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,730
So... how about this?

376
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,650
Keep your charms, but

377
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,380
add new charms that only Mr. Shin has!

378
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,690
Just this much, not over or under that!

379
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,270
I like it! I like it! I like it!

380
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,470
But...let's bring this up a tiny bit...

381
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,690
What are you doing?

382
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,980
Not bring it up all the way...

383
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,880
Oh Ri Jin, I'm not that great Shin Se Gi.

384
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,190
Nothing. Leave it covered. The weather's cold so bring it down all the way.

385
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,970
Up Se Gi, down Do Hyun. So confusing.

386
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,650
Let's memorize. Let's memorize it. Memorize it.

387
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,570
Why are the female employees looking at me?

388
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,020
Did Se Gi do something again?

389
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,360
Wave your hand, while putting on a smirk.

390
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,520
What?

391
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,580
Try it. A new world will open.

392
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,190
Why are they acting like this to me?

393
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,190
It just means Cha Do Hyun has that much charm.

394
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,840
It's just that you don't have enough confidence.

395
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,380
Se Gi appeals his charm.

396
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,730
Please look this way!

397
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,980
Over here! Look over here, please!

398
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,440
Vice President, hello.

399
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,070
Yes, hello.

400
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,570
Ah!

401
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,570
Secretary Choi...

402
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,520
Secretary Oh, hello.

403
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,630
Hello.

404
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,590
Vice President, your style changed again today.

405
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,230
Ah, yes.

406
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:41,360
As expected, fellow FaPes can relate to each other.
FaPe: Fashion People.

407
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,440
I kind of got sick of this style as well.

408
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,770
It looks alright.

409
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,730
I got it.

410
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,900
You saw it, right?

411
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,880
You, too, Mr. Cha, should live while appealing your charms.

412
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,570
With confidence! You definitely have the qualification to do so.

413
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,940
Ah! Seriously.

414
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,460
Look where you're going!

415
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,020
Who is it?

416
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,230
ID Entertainment's idol group, Rocking's leader J.I.

417
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,400
He is an idol who is very bad at acting.

418
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,760
Se Gi debuted him as the main lead in a movie without the President's permission.

419
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,980
Oh my God!

420
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,110
Oh, Vice President!

421
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,570
Thank you.

422
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,110
The only one who told me that I could do it

423
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,400
was you, Vice President.

424
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,380
Ah, yes.

425
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,940
I was really touched that day.

426
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,190
So I'm going to go slowly, starting from a small role.

427
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm on my way from declining the offer to be the main character of the movie.

428
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,730
Yes...

429
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,270
But instead, do it for me once more.

430
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,320
Once more what?

431
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,240
"Tell me it's possible!" That.

432
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,510
How can I do that here?

433
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,360
Do it for me! Please, do it for me!

434
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,020
Do it for him, do it.

435
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,150
Tell me it's possible!

436
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,980
Once more. Like last time!

437
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:46,040
Tell me it's possible! T-Tell... Tell me it's possible!!

438
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,940
Then ID Family's World Tour will start at the Tokyo Dome in April as planned.

439
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,860
Make sure that everything happens accordingly.

440
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:11,150
Lately, our Vice President's contribution is outstanding.

441
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,070
You were able to renew the contract with J.I. and made him give up on Director Cha Min Suk's movie.

442
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,520
J.I.'s personality is not easy so how did you convince him?

443
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,670
Ah, that's...

444
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,940
Anyway, good work. Everyone, give a round of applause for the Vice President.

445
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,480
I was surprised because Se Gi didn't cause as much trouble as I thought.

446
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,860
I came with such a nervous heart.

447
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:59,030
Se Gi might be more useful than me.

448
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,230
To put it directly, it's a work done by both of you guys.

449
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,650
He just picked up on Omega's case, and was lucky with J.I.

450
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,400
And a person who has strong support

451
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,120
is always full of confidence.

452
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,770
Does Se Gi have a strong supporter?

453
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,170
Aren't you his support?

454
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,050
He always trusts you to clean up his mess.

455
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,230
That's why he can act however he wants to.

456
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,300
Well, since in the end, Shin Se Gi and Cha Do Hyun are the same person...

457
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,820
Then... does that mean he came to believe himself?

458
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,230
And more importantly, Doctor Oh worked hard.

459
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,770
It was no joke taming him.

460
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,400
Cha Do Hyun, will you see me for a moment?

461
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,730
Hello, Team Leader Han.

462
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,300
Then.

463
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,860
Wait a minute, Oh Ri Jin.

464
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,110
Let's have a talk.

465
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,570
You keep getting on people's nerves by going back and forth with your concept so

466
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,860
determine your concept, and stop making people confused.

467
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,360
I'll apologize if I hurt your feelings.

468
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,190
There are times when you want to go all out in life.

469
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,570
Maybe it was because I was holding it in for such a long time

470
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,570
that I lost a little control at the meeting at those times.

471
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,900
Is walking around Chae Yeon's house at night considered your breakaway?

472
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,090
I don't know what you're thinking about, but that's a misunderstanding.

473
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,360
Misunderstanding?

474
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,190
The guy who came to work with the car that was parked in front of Chae Yeon's house as if it was for her to see, a misunderstanding?

475
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,860
You've become weak as well, Hyung. Are you that unconfident?

476
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,650
Even if I taunted you, if there is faith in your relationship, there won't be any problem.

477
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,240
Shut that mouth, before I rip it out.

478
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,390
I don't have any lingering feelings for Chae Yeon anymore.

479
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,440
It will remain like that from now on, too.

480
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,140
So don't relieve your anger on me. It makes you look worthless.

481
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,070
Secretary Choi, come see me.

482
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,780
You called for me, President?

483
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,970
The thing I told you to investigate last time...

484
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,380
What are you doing?

485
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,580
Is the company some kind of a masquerade ball?!

486
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,740
Yes. I'm sorry. I'll take this off right away. Ah!

487
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,950
- Go outside and do it.
- Yes. Yes. I understand, President.

488
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,320
-President.
- You didn't hear me?

489
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,010
The result of the investigation that you ordered came out.

490
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,960
While investigating where Vice President was during his study overseas,

491
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,620
I found a very interesting fact.

492
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:53,660
-What is that?
-During his college days, he had a close friend named Alex.

493
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,520
For some reason, they severed their relationship before graduation.

494
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,370
- What about it?
- The thing that is strange

495
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,060
is that right before graduation, he imput a large sum of money in Alex's account.

496
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,330
Find out that friend named Alex's current whereabouts and his phone number.

497
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,630
- Yes.
- Yes, please send it right now.

498
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,200
They got the CCTV near the house and the nursing home.

499
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,640
For now, l'll go home and confirm it.

500
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,680
Excuse me, what is it you want to say?

501
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,200
Yes. I'm sorry about last night.

502
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,060
-About what?
-That...

503
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,670
It seems like he made you uncomfortable and was rude.

504
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,340
Oh Ri Jin, don't be mistaken.

505
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,640
- What?
- Haven't you thought that you're being used?

506
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:20,030
-That... what do you mean?
- The other night, do you know what Cha Do Hyun told me when he came to my house?

507
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,060
If you find out what happened that night,

508
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,520
then would you able to stay beside Do Hyun?

509
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,450
Every time Do Hyun pulled me away and acted harshly,

510
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,100
and pulled you forward,

511
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
what do you think is the reason for that?

512
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,050
Haven't you thought that it was to stimulate me?

513
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,480
You said you're engaged to President Cha Ki Joon.

514
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,510
I don't know why you're telling me this, but

515
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,470
I think I have nothing else to say to you.

516
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:12,040
I apologize once again about what happened last night. Sorry.

517
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,900
Yes. To your house?

518
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,650
Ah. Yes. I'm going to leave now.

519
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,080
Due to Se Gi's reckless acts, the Chairwoman collapsed from the shock early in the morning of this day.

520
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:52,010
Just why did Se Gi make this kind of a problem?

521
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,400
If he just wanted to put me in a difficult situation, this

522
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,230
isn't Se Gi's way.

523
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,730
This is the video of the CCTV in the Chairwoman's

524
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,510
office, which happened when I took Se Gi to the main residence.

525
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,340
And this is the file that recorded them.

526
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,980
Secretary Ahn, you can go first.

527
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,620
I never asked you to save me!

528
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,480
I never begged for my life to be spared!

529
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,980
The other child should be saved!

530
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,200
The other child should be saved instead of me. That's what's humane!

531
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,210
Wait a minute, Secretary Ahn. Play that part you just played again.

532
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,240
I'm going to take everything and give it to that child.

533
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:58,030
That child should have been saved!
The other child should have been saved instead of me!
That's what's humane!

534
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:02,170
"That child should had been saved instead of me?"

535
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,960
That child...

536
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,140
That night, 21 years ago...

537
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,580
the one who saved you from the fire was your father!

538
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,490
The other child should have been saved...

539
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,640
That child should have been saved instead of me! That's what's humane!

540
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,670
When I was younger,

541
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,800
at this Seungjin Group,

542
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,330
was there another child other than me?

543
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,130
Prepare the car.

544
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,150
Yes. Come in.

545
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,300
What are you here for?

546
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,110
I'm Vice President Cha Do Hyun's grandma.

547
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:32,240
Whether Mr. Cha would personally bring someone or if he came with his family members knowing,

548
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,760
I waited for a really long time

549
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,470
hoping that someone from Mr. Cha's family would look for me and knock on that door.
- I'm sorry but

550
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,110
I don't have that much time.

551
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,390
During his study overseas, I heard that you were his physician. That's why I came here.

552
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,420
Please tell me.

553
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,020
What's wrong with him?

554
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,380
I don't know how to explain this.

555
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,430
Whether he received trauma from his childhood

556
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,120
or in the case that he received an unbearable shock,

557
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,280
he separated out those painful memories

558
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,950
from his memory.

559
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,200
To protect himself, he split himself up into different pieces.

560
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,820
And those other personalities

561
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,000
deal with the pain and memories instead of him.

562
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,410
Medically, we call creating personalities that is different from oneself

563
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,050
Dissociative Identity Disorder. Commonly known as

564
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,260
Multiple Personality Disorder.

565
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:02,990
In the past I can't remember, there is a child.

566
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,130
Secretary Ahn, from the things I told you to do, what were you able to accomplish so far?

567
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,890
Currently, my sources are in the middle of investigating.

568
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,830
But something is strange.

569
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,240
The identities of the employees who worked at the main residence are unknown.

570
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,640
That can't be. They don't just let anyone in to the main residence of Seungjin.

571
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,570
Because of that, it should be easier to find out their identities.

572
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,160
The files are all missing.

573
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,090
It's as if someone purposely erased them.

574
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:42,340
Anyway, we are putting in all of our efforts, so we will find out something.

575
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,470
Why did you call me to the house all a sudden? Did something happen while I was gone...?

576
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:58,400
What is it? What is it that you guys seem so serious?

577
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:02,000
Oh Ri Jin, let's have a talk.

578
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,190
-Oh Ri Jin.
- Yes.

579
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,090
During the two days that Se Gi was here,

580
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:31,160
did you tell me everything that happened?
- Seriously.

581
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,570
Are you going to keep talking about the fourth rule of the contract?

582
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:39,660
According to Secretary Ahn, you went to meet my mother;

583
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,970
and Se Gi, who found out about that, went to find you. And after that,

584
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:49,370
Se Gi put my mother on a plane and sent her overseas.

585
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,670
Do you have no guesses as to why?

586
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,890
Oh Ri Jin.

587
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,640
Your mother...

588
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,320
was the witness at the scene of the abuse, he said.

589
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,090
The witness?

590
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:24,630
He said that that was what she used to survive in Seungjin. And he said that it's still the same.

591
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:32,080
Se Gi was...or Cha Do Hyun, I think you

592
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,070
were abused by someone.

593
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,740
What's the reason for not telling me that?

594
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,820
Is it because you thought that I was so weak that I can't handle my past memories?

595
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,240
Cha Do Hyun,

596
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,820
I was just worried that if you suddenly found out

597
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,380
that you were abused, you might get shocked.

598
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,070
I know.

599
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,320
I know how you feel and about that truth.

600
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,150
- You know?
- Yes.

601
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,340
I know.

602
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,770
I came to know.

603
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,000
I have to know more.

604
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,630
So I will become stronger

605
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:27,940
to the point I don't need an existence like Se Gi.

606
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:59,010
What do you think?

607
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:04,050
Shouldn't you deal with your past now?

608
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,890
I agree.

609
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,480
From now on, I...

610
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,920
I'm thinking of finding out all of the memories I lost

611
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,080
and the truth that they're hiding.

612
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,220
I'll do it or you'll do it?

613
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,170
Of course, I'll do it. Whatever the truth I have to endure is,

614
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,610
I am not thinking of hiding or running away anymore.

615
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,760
Do you have the courage to remember that memory?

616
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,570
Of course.

617
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:53,180
Can you endure that pain?

618
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,150
Of course.

619
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,020
Your memories will be my memories.

620
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:03,670
The pain that you endured will be my own pain.

621
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,010
If you did it, then I'll do it, too.

622
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,690
Why?

623
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,230
You are me.

624
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:20,400
I'll say it again.

625
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:26,280
I am

626
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,550
you.

627
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,130
What you're saying is, the child

628
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,510
actually exists.

629
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,570
Until we find him, we don't know.

630
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,610
By any chance, can I find out information on the people who are looking for the child?

631
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,590
One side is President Cha Young Pyo.

632
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:12,210
And the other side is your mother.

633
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,940
Just a moment.

634
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,350
Yes, Chairwoman.

635
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,030
Yes, I understand.

636
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,690
I will convey that to him.

637
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,070
The Chairwoman asks you to come to the main residence.

638
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,760
What would the Chairwoman...

639
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:53,610
Perhaps, did something happen to Father--

640
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,880
Vice President!

641
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,840
-Are you alright?
-I'm alright...

642
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,770
Oh Ri Jin! Oh Ri Jin!

643
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,550
What's wrong? Did something happen?

644
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,770
I just suddenly...

645
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:14,340
I'm alright. I'm okay.

646
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:32,020
Please loosen up. I'm here anyway.

647
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,070
You didn't do this, Se Gi did.

648
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:43,400
Just tell her everything. You are her grandson. She won't kill you.

649
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:52,320
You said that you will become stronger. You can't beat Se Gi like this.

650
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,980
Come in.

651
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:35,860
Why are you just standing there? Go sit somewhere suitable.

652
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,690
Is Father alright?

653
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:47,730
Do you remember what you did to your Father now?

654
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,830
I have something to tell you.

655
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,980
There is a bit of a problem with me.

656
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,610
I don't know if you'll be able to accept it or not.

657
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:15,200
-My mental state is...
-Go back to the States.

658
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,610
You're different from yesterday and today.

659
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:23,730
I can't leave Seungjin to a person who I don't know when a different person will come out.

660
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:28,090
Could it be... you knew it?

661
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,880
You weak rascal.

662
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,420
How is there nothing to raise?

663
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,550
That you raise a monster who strangles his father?

664
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,720
Is the person I'm facing even you?

665
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,510
I'll try to keep it short.

666
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,800
GIve up your title as vice president and go back to the States.

667
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,030
I'll find a house that you and your mother can live in.

668
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,430
Chairwoman,

669
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,170
have you ever considered me

670
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,480
as a grandson?

671
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:17,470
Not as a substitute for father, but

672
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:25,190
have you once considered me as your grandson, your family or as a person?

673
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,920
I'm sorry but I have a request...

674
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,840
Can you bring a bottle of wine that's written on this paper from the basement wine storehouse?

675
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,570
My eyesight lately has been bad.

676
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,270
Ah. I found it.

677
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,300
What is this?

678
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,570
What... is this?

679
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:16,980
I won't leave, Chairwoman. I will stay here.

680
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,550
Your ambition is finally shown, now that I told you to leave.

681
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:27,720
If you want, I will leave the company but

682
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,510
I will stay in Korea. I have things that I have to do.

683
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,130
What else do you have to do instead of receiving treatments?

684
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,400
I'm thinking of doing exactly that.

685
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:44,170
Why my heart was broken into pieces.

686
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:49,070
What those pieces signify. I'm thinking of finding out.

687
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,870
While finding my lost memories and putting together my heart that became pieces,

688
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:14,520
I will see what kind of picture is completed.

689
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,730
I am not a substitute for Father.

690
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:29,070
I am not a dog that will guard Seungjin Group nor a monster.

691
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,170
I am only
