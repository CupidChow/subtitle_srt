00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,720
Episode 16

2
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,010
Are you watching, Cha Do Hyun?

3
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,640
Are you listening, Cha Do Hyun?

4
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,140
Wow, it's so pretty!

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,430
But what are you doing, Cha Do Hyun?

6
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,300
Hey, what have you been writing down so much since earlier?

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,620
It's nothing.

8
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,910
Yeah, right. It's nothing.

9
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh? What's that? Is that a deer?

10
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
- Where? Where?
- Or is it an elk?

11
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,760
Ah, Oh Ri Jin!

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,430
What is all of this?

13
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,990
Blood type, zodiac sign, hobbies...

14
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,510
Life motto, favorite things, favorite color...

15
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,340
Whose life information are you trying to pry into?

16
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,010
It's not that. You told me.

17
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,260
If I go on a vacation with you, I will get to know a whole lot about you.

18
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,050
If I just ramble my questions without thought, I thought you'll just ramble your answers, too. That's why I wrote them. Just simple questions.

19
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,680
Oh, my... If 56 questions are what you consider 'simple', then 'complicated' ones would be really frustrating!

20
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,720
What is this?

21
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,280
Ah, I wrote this for an efficient use of time for a given time period.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,430
Our schedule for today.

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,470
Perhaps, this is your first trip, right?

24
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,930
How can you schedule each point for 30 minutes each?

25
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,890
What kind of freestyle trip is this? This is a retreat for middle schoolers.

26
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,050
Ah, give it back then, instead of saying things like that.

27
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,590
Come on. I already saw it all anyway.

28
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,930
Oh, this sounds fun!

29
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,720
Zero!
(Zero game)

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,890
Hey, that's nothing for a man.

31
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,470
One...

32
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,490
- Zero!
- You have to give me time to think!

33
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,550
Zero.

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,890
It's funny, isn't it?

35
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,430
One! Ah, seriously!

36
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,540
You're the first person I've seen that wrote this game on a notebook,

37
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,630
and it's also my first time seeing someone who plays so badly like this.

38
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,760
Two!

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Hey, you should give me time to think!

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
That doesn't count. It's invalid.

41
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,660
Damn it! This is invalid!

42
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,410
This doesn't count. It's invalid!

43
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,180
Huh? Why are you smiling?

44
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,890
Is it fun for you to hit people, Oh Ri Jin?

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,510
No. I just smiled because I thought of someone.

46
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,050
Stop whining and give me your arm!

47
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,050
One, two...

48
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,610
Oh! Where is this place?

49
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,410
Ah, we have to get off on this stop!

50
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,300
Hurry, hurry! Quickly, quickly! Your bag, bag...

51
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,930
A trip with just Cha Do Hyun and Oh Ri Jin

52
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,720
Remember. February 26, 2015.

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,430
(Wohoo wohoo~ Feels good! Ri Jin is excited♡ )
A happy moment with Cha Do Hyun.

54
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,010
Thank you for keeping your promise.

55
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,440
February 26, 2015.

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,550
When I was young...

57
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,760
What did you say?

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,990
I just remembered it recently!

59
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,370
When I was younger, I remember playing with some kid

60
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,390
with a toy train that runs on rail tracks.

61
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,890
I made a promise with him

62
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,760
that if I grew up to be a cool adult later,

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,540
we would ride a train and go on a trip far, far away.

64
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,930
I said we definitely had to go.

65
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,800
If I tell this to Ri On, he'd say it was him,

66
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,760
but I'm not fooled by it anymore.

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,720
I know that

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,180
that child wasn't Ri On.

69
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,590
Could it be that that child is--

70
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,180
Nice catch!

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,260
I was really surprised-- Hey, why are you doing that?

72
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,800
Looking for a child?

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,140
I received information that he's moving his emergency line of people to find a child.

74
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,090
That's not all.

75
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,140
Aiming the annual meeting of shareholders, the actions of President Cha Young Pyo and his people are unusual, Chairwoman.

76
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,050
Has that been going on for just a day or two? That's nothing new.

77
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,800
I don't think it's that simple of a problem.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Some directors who have been with you for a long time

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,930
had a secret meeting with President Cha Young Pyo last week.

80
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,970
It is certain that Vice-President Cha Do Hyun's dismissal has become such a big disadvantage to you.

81
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,590
It may be impudent of me to say so, but calling him back would be...

82
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,180
Who are you trying to tell what to do right now?

83
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,220
I apologize.

84
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,050
If you've finished your report, then just leave.

85
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes, Chairwoman.

86
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,120
Mada--

87
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,290
I can't bear this restaurant anymore.

88
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,340
They think that they have plenty of customers now, huh?

89
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,890
Tell me why you wanted me to come see you now.

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,300
Try to guess.

91
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,890
Why would I want you to come see me, Brother-in-law?

92
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm not sure.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,010
Why would someone who's smart pretend to be stupid?

94
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,340
If it's about the problem regarding Do Hyun's future, don't worry.

95
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,760
Isn't he too much of a waste for someone whose been acting like a dog protecting an empty position under the Chairwoman?

96
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
I will take responsibility for that child.

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,970
To leave him under you?

98
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,090
Exactly how are you going to take responsibility?

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,260
How about I give him as much as his ability calls for?

100
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,840
That's too lukewarm. It won't do.

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,970
First of all, the mall and the car company.

102
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,290
Please let Do Hyun take over those two.

103
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,830
Then what's in it for me?

104
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:01,390
I would have to hear your answer first regarding my deal.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,090
Don't laugh so openly. So embarrassing.

106
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,800
What do you mean, laugh? I didn't laugh.

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,380
Hey, I said don't laugh!

108
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,240
How does it taste?

109
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,510
It didn't look like this in the morning.

110
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,090
Have some of the "kot-deung-chi-gi".

111
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,800
Yes.

112
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,990
But why is this called "kot-deung-chi-gi"?

113
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,050
It's long that it hits your nose?
(kot-deung: tip of the nose; chi-da: to hit)

114
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,340
Oh Ri Jin, are you good at cooking?

115
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,760
Me?

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,890
There are two things that I, as a Jill-of-all-trades, can't do.

117
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,680
One of those things is cooking.

118
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,090
Then what's the other one?

119
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,260
Arithmetic.

120
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,050
Arithmetic? Are you talking about math?

121
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,760
Hey! Of course, I'm good in math.

122
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,200
But I can't do arithmetic.

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,260
That's why I can't take over the cash counter at Ssang Ri.

124
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,410
If it's the day I'm in-charge of the counter,

125
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,680
there would certainly always be mistakes.

126
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,390
I think it's because I take after my dad completely.

127
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,760
He can't do calculations at all.

128
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,010
You can't cook because you don't take after your mother, and you can't do arithmetic because you take after your father?

129
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,720
Then there's only Oh Ri On left now.

130
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,490
Where do you two resemble each other?

131
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,510
I'm not sure...

132
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,430
We hit first, talk later?

133
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,010
Ah, we can't refuse people's requests.

134
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,220
And we're scared of basements.

135
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,390
Our family's a bit lacking, isn't it?

136
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,470
No, it's nice to see.

137
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,510
I'm very envious.

138
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,160
I've read "The Child in the Basement".

139
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,220
Aren't you curious about the ending?

140
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,900
Do you know?

141
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,860
Perhaps,

142
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,600
have you found your memories?

143
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,260
A girl and a boy

144
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,400
make a promise to meet every night at 10 o'clock.

145
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,210
In the basement of the residence.

146
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,950
Did something happen in that basement?

147
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,520
The place, where the girl that must never be made known to the outside world

148
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,070
was locked in, was the basement.

149
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,450
Why couldn't the world know about that girl?

150
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't really know that myself yet.

151
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,450
I intend to find out from this point forward.

152
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,450
The basement was the place that those two children met

153
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,260
as well as their playroom,

154
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,650
but why did it become a place of fear that even mere memories of it become scary?

155
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,090
From now on, I will tell you that story.

156
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,750
What happened...

157
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,980
in the mansion's basement 21 years ago.

158
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,390
The promise between those two children to meet every night at 10 PM wasn't an easy one.

159
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,910
The reason why is...

160
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,470
If the boy did something wrong,

161
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,550
or if his father found out that he snuck into the basement,

162
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,120
the girl would get hit instead of him.

163
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,860
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go go! Go go!

164
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,540
Faster! Faster!

165
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,560
The boy who couldn't protect the girl

166
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,650
because of his despair, pain,

167
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,710
and helplessness, has sealed all of those memories.

168
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,400
He ended up dividing himself into various pieces.

169
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,480
But in the sealed memories,

170
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,040
an error occurs.

171
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,900
The horrible memory of the girl's abuse,

172
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,540
he misunderstood it as his own.

173
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,740
Woah, the air is so nice!

174
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,120
- I should take in all of this good air! Good air! Inhale, inhale!
- Because...

175
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,140
he wished that he would have gotten abused

176
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,270
instead of her.

177
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,910
He fervently wanted the pain that she had to go through

178
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,230
to be his pain instead.

179
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,200
Ah, it's so nice!

180
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,420
Isn't it funny

181
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,440
that he wished he'd become the victim instead?

182
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,980
No one in the world

183
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,460
wants to become an assailant or a victim.

184
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,970
They make the relatively easy decision to become a bystander instead.

185
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,240
Because if they just close their eyes tightly, it's like nothing happened to them at all.

186
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,710
If just one person out of those numerous bystanders opens their eyes,

187
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,490
then there wouldn't be a case of one person's soul getting completely destroyed.

188
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,790
You didn't just stand on the sidelines and watch what happened to her.

189
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,540
And...

190
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,060
you're also a victim.

191
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,260
Oh Ri On,

192
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,310
have you thought about writing a novel based on Seungjin Group again?

193
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,910
Please write one.

194
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,800
I'll give you information.

195
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,500
- Cha Do Hyun...
- In exchange,

196
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,730
please make it...

197
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,320
a bestseller.

198
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,670
Ah, coming to a place like this after such a long time makes me think of the old days.

199
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,520
We went on a trip as a family,

200
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,350
and Ri On and I got into a big fight with each other after betting on headlock skills, and then got majorly scolded by Mom and Dad.

201
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,610
I see you are as strong as you are now when you were young, too.

202
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,650
Thanks to my brother, while I was growing up

203
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,460
I was able to perfect all kinds of martial arts techniques.

204
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,690
I realized it's really useful in life.

205
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,720
Sometimes, (I use it) when a patient is acting out,

206
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,570
(I have to use it) as well as when I have to bring Yo Na under control.

207
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,370
I don't want to talk about Yo Na.

208
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,310
Ah, dear me! Who would have guessed that I'd become my own brother's love rival?

209
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,660
Stop it.

210
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,950
Oppa! Try and catch me!

211
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,860
I said don't do that!

212
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,340
What does the name Oh Ri Jin mean?

213
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,590
Ah...

214
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,230
'Ri' for smart, 'Jin' for treasure. It means 'smart treasure'.

215
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,700
Ri On's name was made for him to become an intelligent and warm person.

216
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,820
A smart treasure.

217
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,720
They gave you a really good name.

218
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,460
It suits you well.

219
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,540
I'll remember it for a very long time.

220
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,800
Wow, it's the sea!

221
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,470
Wow! How nice!

222
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,810
What are you doing over there? You should at least sink your feet in the water if you come to the beach!

223
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,890
- Oh Ri Jin...
- I know!

224
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,560
I know what you're going to say.

225
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,170
The memories that Mr. Shin has

226
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,130
that you don't have

227
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,030
have come back to you, haven't they?

228
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,730
Am I possibly...

229
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,430
in those memories?

230
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,530
Are they memories...

231
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,310
that won't make me feel good if I remember them?

232
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,750
So is that why me being by your side is really hard on you?

233
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,920
So are you...

234
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,190
planning to say goodbye now?

235
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,720
Oh Ri Jin,

236
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,430
I was thankful all that time.

237
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,410
♫A secret♫

238
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,750
The Chairwoman and my mother found out about my illness.

239
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,270
As a result, I
♫that can't be told♫

Should I be thankful for this situation or not?

286
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,560
You be the judge of that yourself.

287
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,340
Whether you call me names or hit me.

288
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,850
How did you know I was here?

289
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,760
Did you two plan this together? When?

290
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,930
Yesterday at the hospital.

291
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,260
He's going to end things with you, but he can't bear to leave you by yourself.

292
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,980
Really?

293
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,890
Are you laughing? You're laughing right now?

294
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Curse at me instead!

295
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,550
Whether it's at me or at that guy so that you can get it off your chest!

296
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,940
Mr. Cha...

297
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,930
wants to make sure

298
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,940
that I can't remember my past

299
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,060
because he thinks that if I remember it,

300
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,890
I'll become unhappy.

301
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,700
It's fine if you know. All you have to do is live like before.

302
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,180
You lived well even without those trashy memories.

303
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,020
You and I, and our family,

304
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,430
we had no problems at all.

305
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,220
Just cry. Why don't you just cry, huh?

306
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,390
Did you send her off well?

307
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,180
She told me to turn away if I had the confidence to show her my back,

308
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,770
so I coolly turned away.

309
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,140
Have you been drinking?

310
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,620
Yep.

311
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,890
Are you drunk?

312
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,240
No.

313
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
I want to get drunk.

314
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,020
I want to get crazily drunk.

315
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,190
I want to get drunk up until the last drop, so that

316
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,140
Se Gi or Perry Park would come out

317
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,390
and take away about a year of my time away.

318
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,050
Ah ha~ These guys,

319
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,340
they're not helping at a time like this.

320
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,430
Seeing you like this is a real eyesore, so please get up.

321
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,350
I... am an eyesore?

322
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,550
Yes. If you're going to sleep, please go to your bedroom and sleep.

323
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,010
At times like this, sleep is a restorative.

324
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,130
What in the world are you doing?

325
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,180
I've seen several people scoff at the pain of breakups and ruin their lives.

326
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,140
It starts with bodily sickness, so be careful.

327
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,470
Right now, your body temperature is up to 38.5ºC (101.3ºF).

328
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,680
You sound like a person who's experienced this.

329
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,430
Sometimes, crying also helps.

330
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,800
For a man,

331
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,170
it might not be comparable to the sadness of one losing his country--

332
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,930
I think I lost my country.

333
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,220
The country I always miss even though I've left.

334
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,080
I get this

335
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,640
feeling of unfairly losing it.

336
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,140
Awesome!

337
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,620
This is killer! Mom, what's the name of this stew?

338
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,190
What do you mean? I got the pancake and fried leftover from the Lunar New Year, and made them into a pancake stew.

339
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,180
Put this up! Put this in the Ssang Ri menu! This will be a super big hit!

340
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,410
Keep it down, keep it down. It's so obvious you're broken-hearted that you might as well be bitter about it.

341
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,600
Isn't this chaebol physician acting a little suspicious?

342
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,330
She looks like a person who didn't get fed properly.

343
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,450
Her palate could have not matched with the food from another family.

344
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,140
Is she that type of person?

345
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,850
Even if you drop her in the Amazon river, she's the type of person to go head-to-head against an anaconda and eat steak there.

346
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,340
Perhaps, she eats too much, that's why she's getting treated badly?

347
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,950
What the?! How can someone act like a freaking messed up dude with food??!!

348
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,740
Hey! The most upsetting thing in this world is getting criticized for eating!

349
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,090
Quit being that chaebol's physician or whatever! Ah, just quit!

350
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,730
Ri Jin Noona, something has arrived for you.

351
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,100
Hey, Mr. Kim, what's that?

352
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,660
I don't know.

353
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,470
What is all of that?

354
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,660
As you can see, it's my stuff that was in the chaebol's house.

355
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,930
- You got fired?!
- You got fired?!

356
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,620
Dad, you told me to quit immediately.

357
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,040
Have you ever seen a daughter acting to her dad's wishes at light speed?

358
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm admirable, aren't I?

359
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,520
- I should just organize my luggage instead.
- Here, I'll do it.

360
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,230
Just keep on eating.

361
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,560
Ah, that kid... She was fired. She did get fired.

362
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,870
That kid should just eat moderately. That--

363
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,120
I should have given it to Yo Na.

364
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,570
It looks better on me, doesn't it?

365
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,060
What do you think? Let's share. Peace!

366
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,920
But that wench really liked this.

367
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,750
- Hello?
- Is this Oh Ri Jin's cellphone?

368
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,660
Yes, it is. Excuse me, but who are you?

369
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,620
I'm Chairwoman Seo Tae Im of Seungjin Group.

370
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,710
You ended up sharing memories with Se Gi.

371
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,580
Then that means that you remembered all of the memories

372
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,370
from the year in your past that you lost.

373
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,220
Not completely just yet, but I keep remembering them.

374
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,580
Then is the only thing left now is to fuse the personalities into one?

375
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,270
When are you leaving for America?

376
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,570
I haven't decided yet. I have some things left to do.

377
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,700
Things to do?

378
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,950
You said that you took care of things at the company. So what is it that you need to take care of aside from your amalgamation treatment?

379
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,550
Why didn't they let the world know about that child?

380
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,830
Why did she have to be abused?

381
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm thinking of finding those out. Because only in that way

382
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:47,610
can I genuinely apologize to her.

383
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:54,020
So you'll have to keep receiving Dr. Oh, your secret physician's help to get treated for the time being then.

384
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,770
Go give this to Dr. Oh. She really likes this kind of stuff.

385
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,850
And tell her to contact me right away if she's having a hard time.

386
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,940
Welcome, Secretary Oh.

387
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,520
Hello.

388
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,330
The Chairwoman is waiting for you in her office. Hurry up and go in.

389
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,060
Yes.

390
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,550
Come in.

391
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,330
Yes, it's me.

392
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,280
Right now, Secretary Oh has gone into the office to see the Chairwoman.

393
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,380
Yes, I think the Chairwoman called her.

394
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,740
Yes, I understand.

395
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,780
Thank you for contacting me.

396
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,330
Yes.

397
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,430
I'm sorry for the interruption.

398
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,150
So if we continue the story,

399
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,840
21 years ago...the day that had the fire and also the garden party...

400
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,620
You have a group photo of the employees of the catering service

401
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,990
that made the trip (to the residence)?

402
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,630
If he was Min Seo Yeon's chauffeur, there's a big chance we could get new information.

403
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,770
You went through a lot. I'll see you at the house later tonight.

404
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,510
Ah, and also,

405
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,590
Oh Ri Jin was called by the Chairwoman and is currently at the residence.

406
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,100
What do you mean, he terminated the contract?

407
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,650
As I told you, the contract became null and void as of yesterday.

408
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,930
I am no longer Cha Do Hyun's secret physician.

409
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,950
Then there's nothing for you to discuss with me any longer.

410
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,750
What you were going to say---does it have anything to do with my job?

411
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,180
Thank you for coming all the way here. I would appreciate it if you leave now.

412
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,540
Yes.

413
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,040
Excuse me... If it's not rude of me to do so,

414
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,870
may I say one thing as Cha Do Hyun's former physician?

415
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,240
Cha Do Hyun needs his family's care desperately right now.

416
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,860
D.I.D is a wound that can never be fully recovered alone.

417
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,840
Didn't you say you were just going to say a word?

418
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,230
You're his grandmother. You're his family.

419
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,660
Can't you help him?

420
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:20,770
If he finds out what happened in his past, it will become of big help to his treatment.

421
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,630
A young woman like you is crossing the boundaries.

422
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,830
People who are stuck in the past have no improvement.

423
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,630
The past is simply the past, so what are you saying we should do in the present?

424
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,730
Even if he does know, would the past even change?

425
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,670
No one can go back to the past and start anew from there,

426
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,580
but if you start now, it can give you a new outcome.

427
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,670
- That's a good saying.
- It's not my saying

428
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,000
but Karl Barth's.
Karl Barth: A Swiss clergyman and theologian.

429
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,490
Thanks for the lesson. If you're done you can leave now.

430
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,350
You are more daring than you look, young lady.

431
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,040
You are one daring child.

432
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,430
Do you still have something left to say?

433
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,350
Excuse me, Chairwoman--about the frame that was broken the other day,

434
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,840
it just arrived. Should I leave it in your bedroom or...?

435
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,780
- Bring it here.
- Yes, Chairwoman.

436
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,720
Secretary Oh, are you okay?

437
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,900
I'm okay.

438
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,010
What do you mean, okay? Why is your face so pale?

439
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,510
I'm better now.

440
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,780
Thank you.

441
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,580
- Will you really be alright?
- Yes.

442
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,710
Then be careful when you're leaving.

443
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,480
You're wrong again.

444
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,660
I was wrong!

445
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,020
I told you what would happen if you were wrong again, didn't I?

446
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,240
I told you who would get in trouble if you couldn't get it right, didn't I?

447
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,040
Dad! I did wrong, so I'll get hit! Okay?

448
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,470
Hold out your hand.

449
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,240
Quickly.

450
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:36,150
I heard that it's wrong for adults to hit little kids.

451
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,120
You're the spitting image of your mother.

452
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,540
I'll get hit! I was in the wrong, so I'll get hit!

453
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,750
Daddy! I'll get hit!

454
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,910
I was in the wrong, so I'll get hit!

455
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,560
Please open the door!

456
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,740
- I was wrong. Please save me. I was in the wrong!
- Please stop!

457
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,710
Please don't hit her! Please hit me instead!
♫The things hidden inside of me changed me greatly. They put me to sleep, tied my hands,♫

458
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,140
Please save me. I was in the wrong!
♫And locked me in a dark room. The lost pieces of time, ♫

459
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:43,550
♬ The memories of love that I lost were erased and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell. ♬

460
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,940
♬ Without knowing anything I just screamed and that's all I remember ♬

461
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,730
♫My heart, which was once as cold as ice, will also be forgotten once I wake up♫

462
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,740

♫I want to escape from the torment of my sins. Someone take me out♫

463
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,080
The child.
♫Of my soul that's filled with these scars♫

464
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,130
If the child in the basement really existed. If he/she did exist,
♫The deep night sky♫

465
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,590
then where she came from and where she disappeared to.

466
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:11,620
Could it be... that that child in the basement... is me?

467
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,320
It was me?

468
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,330
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬

470

Why are you not coming? I'm scared.
♬  But where are you? You hid yourself somewhere where I can’t see you  ♬

471
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,140
Hurry up and come.
♬ The pain that you endure through instead of me. When my angers becomes one with me, ♬

472
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,080
Sorry for coming late.
♬ I will chase my lost memories which fell in deep slumber ♬

473
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,260
♬  The bruise in my heart is too big  ♬

474
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,760
♬  Even if I try to hide them, the rascals hiding inside me appear and wakes me up  ♬

475
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,550
♬  From the other side of my horrific memories, I came to face you ♬

476
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,940
For coming late..I'm sorry.
♬  You even embraced my lost emotions and helped me, who was down, up  ♬

477
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,510
♬  So that I don’t let my hand go, I’m trying my hardest to erase the hellish times  ♬

478
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,940
So, that child in my dreams was Cha Do Hyun?
♬  In this place that I locked myself  ♬
♬ I walk through the darkness because ♬

479
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,180
That, can you not do it?
♬  I want to find you,  ♬

480
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh Ri Jin, even without remembering what happened in your past, you're living very well in the present.
♬  I can’t touch you or be embraced by you  ♬

481
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,920
There are a lot of people who love you as well, 
♬  The things that are taking over me aren’t the bastards living inside me  ♬

482
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,720
So do you really need to remember what happened in the past?
♬  The strong medicine will not heal me, only the word love  ♬

483
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,300
If you're doing it for me, then please stop.
♬  The voice that echoes in my ears wakes me up  ♬
♬  Embraces and kisses me, ♬

484
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,890
Just live your life as it is now.
♬  and I can no longer see it anymore 
 The deep night show you, ♬

485
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,370
♬ who was not able to leave ♬

486
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,130
Oh Ri Jin.
♬ It wakes me up ♬

487
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh Ri Jin!
♬ from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

488
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,900
Oh Ri Jin! Oh Ri Jin! Are you alright?
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

489
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,890
Oh Ri Jin!
♬ and your scent  ♬

490
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,590
Save me!
♬  echoes in my ears everyday  ♬

491
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,270
Please save me! I was wrong! Please save me!
♬ Where are you? On the night sky, ♬

492
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:58,090
Save me! I was wrong!
♬  which I cannot reach, I see you, who is turning back  ♬
♬  From this hard day, ♬

493
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,620
Save me! I was wrong! Save me!
♬ it makes a picture  ♬

494
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,280
Save me, I was wrong!
♬ I’m sorry. ♬

495
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,250
Secretary Oh, are you alright? Secretary Oh!
♬. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me and I call for you desperately  ♬

496
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,510
Get up! Secretary Oh, come to your senses!
♬  But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, ♬

497
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,620
This won't do. Driver Jung! Driver Jung!
♬  and my tears fall ♬

498
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,400
What's the reason you called for Oh Ri Jin?

499
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,220
What exactly did you tell Oh Ri Jin!?

500
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,600
Who do you think you are, yelling at me?

501
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,530
I called her as your secret physician.

502
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,330
What is the reason that you need to meet my physician, Chairwoman?

503
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,900
What did you want to find out more by meeting her?

504
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,740
Go back to the company.

505
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,180
Instead of ID Entertainment, you're going to handle the Special Arrangements Committee.

506
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,930
After the shareholders' meeting, I will save a necessary seat for you.

507
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,760
It could be Seungjin Construction.

508
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,730
I will decline.

509
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,280
-You'll do what?
-As I have already told you, there is something else that I must do.

510
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,120
I will not return to the company.

511
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,290
I had a nightmare. Interpret it for me.

512
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,570
I looked around seven years old, and

513
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,880
as I was coordinating with some little boy playing the piano,

514
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,390
I was playing the violin.

515
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:26,220
Could it be that the boy who was playing the piano is you?

516
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,440
I-I don't know. Was I?

517
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,900
The boy makes a mistake during his piano performance.

518
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,110
But I get scolded instead.

519
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:44,030
A scary looking man drags me to the basement.

520
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,050
Who could be the man that was dragging me?

521
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,040
Was it the advertising dancing balloon?

522
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,320
-Ri Jin.
-I was locked inside the basement all day.

523
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,040
But every night at 10, the boy comes to find me.

524
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,810
So I wait every night for 10 o'clock.

525
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,570
Because I can play with the boy.

526
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,260
Was the boy I was waiting for

527
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,190
you?

528
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,930
If not,

529
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,800
was that child Cha Do Hyun?

530
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,380
You...

531
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,260
are able to recall your memories?

532
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,720
Up to what point do you exactly know?

533
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,200
Where and how did you and Cha Do Hyun work together, and what things did you conspire together?

534
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:51,810
Forget it. You're not going to tell me, right?

535
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:56,830
Then forget it. I'll find out myself.

536
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,500
Ri Jin. Ri Jin...

537
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,570
Don't follow me.

538
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,320
Mom...

539
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,150
Ri Jin.

540
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,660
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

541
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,090
Did something happen?

542
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:42,710
Remember how I told you I would ask when I became curious?

543
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,190
I became curious now. How my real parents were like.

544
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,180
So...

545
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,260
please tell me.

546
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,560
How did things go with Min Seo Hyeon's chauffeur? Did he decide to meet up with you?

547
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,510
I asked him to contact me as soon as possible.

548
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,270
And also, this...

549
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,720
What is it?

550
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,650
It's the results of the family register that you requested last time,

551
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,840
as well as Min Seo Yeon's immigration records.

552
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,440
If you look at documents, on June 1993, Min Seo Yeon and Chairman (Cha Geon Ho) entered Korea.

553
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,450
And you can see that they were definitely together with a six-year old female child.

554
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:48,760
But after entering, there's no data regarding the child anywhere.

555
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,520
What's wrong? Is there something that's bothering you...?

556
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,360
I'm under the impression that the reason why I came into Seungjin Group is because I needed a family register to enter school.

557
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,490
Before that time I was a non-family member.

558
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:12,280
- But?
- It was definitely winter when father brought me to the residence.

559
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,210
But if you look here, my name is already on the family register in the summer of that year.

560
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:26,160
Couldn't it just be that, even though Chairman Cha Geon Ho said it that way, you were put on the family register beforehand?

561
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:34,090
No. Up until I entered the residence, the people at Seungjin Group didn't even know about my existence.

562
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,110
No, then... this.. how can this...?

563
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,640
I got this ready to give it to you in case you would ask.

564
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,820
Though, to be honest, I hoped you would never ask.

565
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,300
Your mother's picture and some items she left behind are in there.

566
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,170
Aren't you going to open it?

567
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,200
Later...

568
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,650
When I'm alone.

569
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,260
I don't have the courage.

570
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,800
What kind of person was my biological mother?

571
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,620
You said she was your friend.

572
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,080
She was a smart, kind,

573
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,740
and beautiful person like you.

574
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:50,330
She did become a cold person after her life went awry,

575
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:56,430
but I think it was a protective shell for her to survive.

576
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,450
How did her life go amiss?

577
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:08,390
That messed-up household ruined her in just one moment.

578
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,020
So she got married into a rich family as if she were being sold,

579
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,060
but her relationship with her husband wasn't good.

580
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:26,410
The father-in-law who was a businessman...he liked his daughter-in-law, your mom, more than his son.

581
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,180
Since she was so capable.

582
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,870
So, what happened?

583
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,500
I've decided to get a divorce.

584
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,570
Year 1987

585
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,490
He said he'll do it? Your husband?

586
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:55,440
He fought with Father-in-Law and left the house, that person.
After throwing the divorce papers at me that is.

587
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,490
His stamp was already on them.

588
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:02,150
I'm on my way back from giving the divorce papers to Father-in-law after stamping them, and resigning from my position as the President.

589
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,310
Why did your husband suddenly leave the house?

590
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,440
I begged him to break up with me.

591
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,090
I told him that I had someone that I've loved since before we got married,

592
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,240
and that I still love him even now.

593
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,240
Are you crazy?

594
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,750
It's a marriage that was forced by my father-in-law anyway.

595
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,760
It was a loveless relationship.

596
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,310
I'm fed up with having a husband who has an inferiority complex when it comes to me,

597
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,720
and I've done all I can in that house.

598
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:45,710
So, what do you intend to do now?

599
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,540
I have to go meet that person.

600
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:55,770
That person? Didn't you say that your father hid his whereabouts after splitting you guys apart?

601
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,050
I found him.

602
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:02,180
I'm...going to America to meet that person.

603
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,490
That person was probably your father.

604
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,870
Even though I've never seen him.

605
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:18,490
But unfortunately when they reunited, he had not much time left to live or so I heard.

606
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,470
But it looks like she still loved him.

607
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:31,910
Because after that man left, you were here.

608
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,660
I'll tell you the rest slowly from now on.

609
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,820
Let's do it slowly.

610
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,160
Mom...

611
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,500
Why?

612
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,270
I'm sorry.

613
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,890
About what?

614
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:02,880
I'm not doing this because I hate you, Mom. You know that, right?

615
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,900
Of course, I know.

616
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,310
I don't want to remember,

617
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,750
but the memories keep coming to my mind

618
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,250
and it's painful for me. That's why.

619
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,020
So please understand.

620
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,810
I understand. I know.

621
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:30,150
I wouldn't be your mom if I didn't know that.

622
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:54,760
[Family Register]

623
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,820
[Cha Do Hyun]

624
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,980
- Save me! I was wrong!
- Save me!

625
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,490
I-I was wrong!

626
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:09,820
Please save me, I was wrong! Please save me...

627
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,420
Please save me! I was wrong!

628
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,970
Why is this picture here?

629
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,640
Why?

630
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,820
This is my mother's picture. The one on my family register.

631
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:46,070
I wanted to tell you my name since I didn't tell you last time.

632
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,980
I know. What your name is.

633
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:02,360
Ri Jin. It's Oh Ri Jin, right?

634
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:12,560
It's not. That's not my name.

635
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:15,800
It's not?

636
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,560
Then...

637
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:29,800
what's your name?

638
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,390
My name is...

639
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,360
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

640
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,740
What is this?

641
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,230
Why is she calling Cha Do Hyun's name?

642
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,710
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

643
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,250
Mommy!

644
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,920
Do Hyun! It's dangerous! Get down quickly!

645
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,010
Mommy!

646
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,250
Do Hyun, Mommy told you before that standing on that swing is dangerous.

647
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,080
If Do Hyun gets hurt, do you know how hurt Mom would be?

648
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,450
I know, Mommy. Next time, I'll be careful.

649
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,080
Aigoo, so smart!

650
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,120
My Do Hyun is so, so smart.

651
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,990
What... is this?

652
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,390
My name is...

653
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,580
My name is...

654
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,400
Your name is?

655
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,070
My name is...

656
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,600
Cha. Do. Hyun.
