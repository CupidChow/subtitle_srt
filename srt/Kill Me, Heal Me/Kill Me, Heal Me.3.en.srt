1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,810
Why in the world is he doing this to me?

2
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,030
You called me.

3
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,280
Me? I never did.

4
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,920
I didn't call you.

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,400
You did. A long time ago.

6
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,140
Make Cha Do Hyun fall asleep...

7
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,350
so that he can't wake up.

8
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,350
Mr. Cha is your owner.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
That's impossible.

10
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,450
If

11
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,990
you try to make that bastard and I fuse into one like you did in the past,

12
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,180
or make this guy remember his lost past...

13
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,190
I would rather die and get rid of you!

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,800
If I don't exist, you don't also. If you get stronger, so do I.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,140
If we die,

16
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,070
Cha Do Hyun dies and disappears with us!

17
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,220
Shin Se Gi, I'll call him out.

18
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,920
He's a guy who reacts very strongly when rage or violence is used on me.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,400
This is the only way.

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Are you alright?

21
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,530
Shin Se Gi?

22
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,780
Oh, did you just hit me right now?

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,060
Huh?

24
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,190
You rude bastard.

25
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,580
I asked if you just hit me. Huh?

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,970
Perry Park?

27
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,190
That's right, I'm Perry Park.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,380
Kill Me, Heal Me

29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,920
Episode 3
♫ These aren't my clothes either~ ♫

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,640
♫ These aren't my clothes either~ ♫

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,730
Where is it, really?

32
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,010
♫ These clothes aren't mine either ♫

33
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,020
Let's talk.

34
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,850
We don't have the time to be here like this!

35
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,860
Oh my! Michael is loyal!

36
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,280
I told him to hide my clothes and send them over to Korea.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,120
Look at how he secured he packed this!

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,190
Perry Park!

39
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,190
♫ These are the clothes~ They're my clothes ♫

40
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,940
Yeah!

41
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,030
Not this, but

42
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,970
for now, wear a suit and let's go to the Board meeting.

43
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,800
I will write down what you have to say, so all you have to do is read it. Just read it.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Ah. Why would I go to that when I don't know when I'll come out again?

45
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,120
It's been a long time since I came out.
If it were you, would you go?

46
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,570
I know. Of course, I know.

47
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,090
If you listen to my request first, I'll do whatever you want after the job is done.

48
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,120
Really! I'm about to go crazy.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,140
The only thing I want is freedom. Freedom.

50
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,250
I will buy you a ship.

51
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,420
I will put your name on the ship, too.

52
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,800
Isn't that your longtime wish?

53
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,760
In your ship, with your name written on it---
The Park Perry Boat!

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,210
In front of a mansion where you can see the blue ocean,

55
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,800
you will be able to fish. Wow, the whales and the sharks there, you'll be able to catch—

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,540
Alright! Okay!

57
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,300
It's a deal!

58
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,630
Good choice.

59
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,250
- What did you say?
- Good choice.

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,290
Good choice!

61
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,230
I have a call.

62
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,120
Let's go.

63
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,380
Oh Ri Jin? Must be a woman.

64
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,340
Please don't pick it up!

65
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,690
What are you doing?

66
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,250
-Hello?
-You have 1 hour left.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,130
What is it?

68
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,150
Oh my. What's one hour left?

69
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,880
I think you're mistaking this as voice phishing, so I'm calling you once again.

70
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,750
Bring my jacket to the Tae San Textile Warehouse before 1 o'clock.

71
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,850
If you don't do that...

72
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,990
You don't have to call that person. I have the jacket with me...

73
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,020
If you bring the police with you...

74
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,590
Why are you making things

75
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,660
like this?

76
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,090
Ah~Why are you making it more complicated?

77
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,460
How many times have I told you?
That person doesn't have the jacket, but I do!

78
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,260
So, you're telling me to bring the leather jacket by 1 o'clock?

79
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,250
So, you're saying I'm going to die if I'm late or if I call the police.

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,780
Excellent.

81
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,610
Then, I don't have to go.

82
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,050
I'm so busy anyway, so don't expect me. Okay? I'm hanging up.

83
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,580
W-w-wait!

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,760
I left out one thing.

85
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,640
If you don't come, your woman here will die.

86
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,700
What? So, you're using a woman to threaten me?

87
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,510
Ah~ This rude rascal. Where are you?

88
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,930
Where are you? I'm gonna go there and kill you!

89
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,690
Come to your senses! You said you'll go to the board meeting!

90
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,300
Ah, geez. This is driving me nuts.

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,780
There is only one of me. Stop telling me to do this or that.

92
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,560
Ah, geez. Damn it. Because of your nonsense I'm going to go crazy.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,510
Hey, where are you?

94
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,410
That punk named Shin Se Gi, you should all know well

95
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,530
how much of an atrocious guy he is.

96
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,360
From now on, to prepare for his attack,

97
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,450
we will have a simulation training.

98
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,590
Think of that person as me. Slowly,

99
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,500
come at me.

100
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
Wait, wait.

101
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Slowly, slowly. Why are you in such a hurry?

102
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,020
Do you have an appointment?

103
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,070
Come slowly.

104
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,280
Here, come slowly.

105
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,850
Who was this rude bastard who called me over the phone?

106
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,620
There was an urgent message for the Chairwoman.

108
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,210
A situation came up with the Vice President.

109
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,610
I think it will be difficult for him to participate in the Board meeting.

110
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,400
It looks like the new vice-president was in a minor car accident.

111
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,160
He said that he will stop by the hospital.

112
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's push his speech to the end, and

113
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,870
we'll start the meeting right away.

114
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,630
Ah, geez!

115
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,720
The mouthful guy who called me out, what are you doing? Come out!

116
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,660
While I'm counting to 4, move out of the way.
If you don't, then I'll throw this.

117
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,410
1...

118
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,700
2...

119
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,820
3, 4!

120
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,690
Oh, my! Look at these pathetic bastards!

121
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,280
It seems like you think this is a toy.

122
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,770
Look here, Shin Se Gi.

123
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,730
- Let's talk this through after putting that down.
- Don't move!

124
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,560
Just you dare move! I should just...!

125
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,200
This is not a toy.

126
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,110
If you don't know, don't even fight me.

127
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,530
You see, I was once a talented mechanic for a deep-sea fishing vessel.

128
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,510
I was once famous for making homemade bombs.

129
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,780
And in that blue, large ocean,

130
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,180
thanks to the universal brotherhood and humanism I have learned, I already washed my hands off this line of work, alright?

131
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,430
But you plucked out my nose hair, when I was sleeping! Damn you!

132
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,970
You mouthful guy messed with me and called me out. You know that?

133
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,630
You shouldn't live a wicked life, you know.

134
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,210
And if you want that leather jacket so badly,

135
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,980
you should have paid money and thought about buying it fairly.

136
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,880
What the hell are you doing, risking the life of an innocent woman?

137
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,820
You shouldn't be like that!

138
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,440
That woman!

139
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,540
What are you doing now?! Hurry up and loosen those ropes!

140
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,610
Hey!

141
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,130
Bomb! Bomb!

142
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,660
The rice is fully cooked.

143
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,430
Oh my, why is this damn thing turning off?

144
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,890
Is it because I used a timer from a rice cooker?

145
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,200
It should have already exploded by now. I'm about to go crazy.

146
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh my, oh my!

147
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,340
Ah!

148
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,580
I will kill you all.

149
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,040
Ah!

150
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I'm dying.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
You can find out my location and listen to what is happening.

152
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,890
When my other personalities come out, please attach this on my body.

153
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,010
This device will let you know what kind of situation I'm in.

154
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,480
As you know, if this is known to the police, things for Seung Jin Group and I will become difficult.

155
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,650
We need to prevent the problem from becoming bigger.

156
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,390
And end it between us two.

157
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,520
What is this? It looks like some sort of device.

158
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,030
You bad bastard!

159
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,690
- No.
- This is a GPS!

160
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,280
Hey! The police are on it! This bomb bastard!

161
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,950
This jerk and woman...

162
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,490
What the?

163
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,810
Driver Door Ajar

164
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,370
Oh... this fox-like bastard...

165
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,340
No wonder, he was using satoori which he didn't use before, changing his concept and putting on a huge show!

166
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,330
That was all for earning time!

167
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,570
Hey, but, did that bastard perhaps take some drugs?

168
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,140
- What?
- His look in his eye is different from last time!

169
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,940
I thought he was someone else!

170
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,710
It's for sure! He ate all the drugs in our jacket

171
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,410
and it's for sure that he called the police because there were no more drugs!

172
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,800
What is this? There were drugs hidden in that jacket?

173
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,440
Because it's made in Italy, it's very high-quality.

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,710
I really like it.

175
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,420
Father!

176
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,850
Hey, let's just run. Let's just tell the boss that we sold the jacket and

177
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,590
we just have to earn enough money for the drug!

178
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,740
Are you crazy? Our boss will kill us if we can't find the jacket.

179
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,340
I mean, why? Just what is that jacket worth?

180
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,660
That jacket is a luxury item that can't be bought with money!

181
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,830
If we want to buy that, we have to cross over to Italy

182
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,190
and meet with leather master artisan Salvatore Bocchetti, but

183
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,720
he already died a year ago.

184
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,900
How?

185
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,000
From a heart attack, finished!

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,140
That's why you bastard!

187
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,520
Why did you make this fuss, because of stealing something without the Boss' permission!

188
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,830
Anyway! Before the boss finds out, the jacket and

189
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,530
the drug, we have to find all of it.

190
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,600
No, this...where is it?!

191
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,120
You have a text message!

192
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,430
I'm about to go crazy.

193
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,850
Who is this punk?

194
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,600
- I took it~!
- Answer me!

195
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,920
I said answer me! Why aren't you answering me? Why?!

196
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,830
It's my brother! It's my brother!

197
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,410
How many times have I told you since a while ago?! That that person doesn't have the jacket! That I have the jacket!

198
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,570
If you release me, I'll bring the jacket. So let's not make things complicated and please take care of this quietly!

199
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,320
If you had asked me once, if you hadn't put tape over my mouth,

200
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,370
then something like this could have been taken care of quickly. Why did you make it so complicated?!

201
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,790
To me--

202
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,220
I... If I go and bring it right now--

203
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,940
Of course, you can't. How can I trust you?

204
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,180
If you believe me once--

205
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,700
Shut up! We'll go personally and find it.

206
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,280
Just find out where it is right now.

207
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,230
Yeah, Oh Ri Jin. Did you see my picture?

208
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,930
It fits me perfectly, right?

209
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,780
Yeah, Ri On. Where are you right now?

210
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,260
What do you mean "Where are you?"? I'm at Ssang Ri.

211
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,840
Hey, didn't I tell you yesterday that I was going to have an after work party with the hyungnims that I know?

212
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,630
After work party?

213
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,760
Ah, after work party.

214
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,710
That's right, after work party! That, you know, too.

215
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,800
You know Yeongdeongpo, that person who helped me a lot with gathering information while I was writing my novel.

216
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,090
Ah! Those people! I know, I know!

217
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,340
But, but Ri On, since the topic of your novel came out,

218
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,080
did I tell you that in your novel, the episode in chapter 3 left a

219
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,920
very, very big impression?

220
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,180
Hey, you- you- you, what's wrong with you suddenly? Why are you giving me compliments that you don't give and

221
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,090
are making me scared. Is something wrong?

222
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,410
Are you perhaps...?

223
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,000
Is it because you don't want to pay back $200 that you borrowed from me before?

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,920
Wow, you can't be like that. Even parents and children

225
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,310
must have a clear relationship about money.

226
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm about to be really disappointed in you right now!

227
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,480
Ask until when he'll be staying there!

228
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,810
Until when? Until when? All night long, you punk. All night.

229
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,250
Until the sun comes out. Why?

230
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,420
Because our night is more beautiful than your day.

231
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,580
Look at her phone etiquette, sheesh.

232
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,290
Ah, jeez.

233
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,230
Hyungnims! The snack for the alcohol is here!

234
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,820
You stay behind and look after that man and woman.

235
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,660
And the rest,

236
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,810
follow me.

237
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,090
Are you all right?

238
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,230
Excuse me. Are you coming to your senses?

239
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,980
Huh?

240
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,660
Remember. January 7th, 2015 at 10 PM on the dot.

241
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,380
The time I fell for you.

242
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,260
Excuse me. Excuse me, but who are you?

243
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,980
Why aren't you coming out?

244
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,170
Move away while I count to 4, alright?

245
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,980
It's all different. The look in his eye, his tone and personality.

246
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,810
Aish. What is this?

247
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,120
This is unbelievable.

248
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
What is this?

249
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,210
Ch!

250
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,470
How did this happen?

251
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,950
It wasn't Se Gi who came out? Then, who?

252
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,900
Perry Park.

253
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,200
Oh Ri Jin?

254
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,850
Are you alright? You're not hurt, right?

255
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,910
Ah, what about the jacket? What happened to the jacket?

256
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,780
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,870
When I'm angry or drink alcohol, I sometimes lose consciousness.

258
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,380
As you can see, I'm alright and don't worry about the jacket. They went to go look for it.

259
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,550
- Now, now, drink a lot!
- This is really good, isn't it?

260
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,970
Eat a lot! Eat a lot!

261
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,650
-I am really younger than you!
- You didn't know?!
-Haha.

262
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,640
How can you tell them where your brother is so easily?

263
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,840
You should have warned him first.

264
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,220
It's alright. There's an after-work party today.

265
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm not kidding right now. Your family could be in danger.

266
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,380
It's okay! Today is the after work party.

267
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,050
Are you in your right state of mind?!

268
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,060
She's a very~ dangerous patient. She's a megalomaniac.

269
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,970
I'm sorry.

270
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,520
What? For what?

271
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,730
Still, to a person who's hurt...

272
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,130
Why do you keep saying I'm hurt?

273
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:22,110
Apologize later and think of how to get out of here! I have to go to the hospital quickly!

274
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,590
Wait... When did you let yourself free?

275
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,670
Did you learn escaping tricks or something like that?

276
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:41,000
It's something like that. I'm used to things like this. I learned throughout the years.

277
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,000
Remember.

278
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
About what?

279
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,710
January 7th, 2015 at 10 PM on the dot.

280
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,260
What day is that?

281
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,160
The day I fell for you.

282
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,010
Oh Ri Jin, you can't say it here.

283
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,930
But you told me that.

284
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,820
You don't remember?

285
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,640
You said that a person with the same face as yours is fake.

286
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,470
You said that you are the only one with your face named Shin Se Gi.

287
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm the only one. So you...

288
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,600
-So, you...
- You must never forget my gaze.

289
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,900
♬  Your voice, which whispered "I love you" ♬

290
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,140
♬  and your scent keeps repeating in my ears  ♬

291
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,730
Your name? What is it?

292
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,950
Say it! Your name.

293
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,160
Oh Ri Jin, you want to...

294
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,930
get out of here alive, right?

295
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,130
You didn't forget your promise that you'll tell me your name if we get out of here alive, right?

296
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm sorry but, I think it'll be difficult to bring you to the hospital.

297
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,580
I have a place to go urgently, too.

298
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,590
If we go out, I'll catch a taxi. You can go by yourself-

299
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,400
While I'm speaking nicely, go back inside.

300
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,570
Let go of her.

301
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,550
I'm counting to 3!

302
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,470
That person... is a megalomaniac.

303
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,210
Who? Me?

304
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,950
- One.
- Don't stimulate the patient. If she acts out it'll become dangerous.

305
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,740
Who's a doctor now? From how I see it, you're more dangerous.

306
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm okay, so don't become become agitated. Breathe.

307
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,130
- Two!
- Stop counting!

308
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,410
You rascals! Three!

309
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,630
The countdown has begun.

310
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,510
Let her go.

311
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:59,390
This rascal is playing around with me again. You made a scene with that useless thing earlier too.

312
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,620
At that time, I wasn't able to cancel the safety mode.

313
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,540
This time, what will you do if it's actually counting down?

314
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,410
Of course, the chances are 50-50. The choice is yours.

315
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,840
Whatever choice you make, exactly after 5 seconds,

316
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,270
I will throw this at you.

317
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,420
Ah!

318
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,200
- Cheers for 2015!
- Cheers!

319
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,890
Haha.

320
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,960
Who's Oh Ri On?

321
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,430
Drink, drink, drink.

322
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,160
Won't Oh Ri On, this rascal, come out right this instant?!

323
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,060
Are you looking for this?

324
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,450
Bring it. If you don't want to see blood.

325
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:50,230
How can I just give it to you? I should take away some luggage so that you can go on your way comfortably.

326
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,300
I'm an investigator for the Drug division of the Myeongdong Police Station!

327
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm from the general investigation team.

328
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,160
I'm from the Traffic Division!

329
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,450
I'm in charge of investigating missing people!

330
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm sorry, Hyungnims! I brought you out for a meal, but you can't even catch a break.

331
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,790
I'm sorry. I love you!

332
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,040
Where is my sister? Where is my sister right now?

333
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,240
Oh Ri Jin, Oh Ri Jin, come to your senses, Oh Ri Jin.

334
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,540
Save me.

335
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,290
Save me.

336
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,490
I was wrong.

337
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,650
I was wrong. I was wrong.

338
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,570
♫ You see, the things inside of me, they've changed me a lot. ♫

339
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,640
♫ They put me to sleep, tied my hands and locked me in a dark room. ♫

340
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,100
♫ The fragments of my lost time, the memories of the love I abandoned. ♫

341
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,680
♫ I erased them and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell.
Without knowing anything I screamed ♫

342
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,540
♬  My heart, which was as cold as ice, will melt once I wake up  ♬

343
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,780
♬  I want to free myself, from the torment of my sins. ♬

344
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,890
♬  Take me out, from my spirit full of scars  ♬

345
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,240
♬  The night, which is deep ♬

346
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,720
♬ Showed you, who couldn't leave♬

347
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,330
♬  You woke me up and kissed me  ♬

348
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:26,920
♬  Your voice, which whispered that you loved me, and your scent  ♬

349
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:33,900
♬  I can hear it every day in my ears, where are you? ♬

350
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,480
♬  I want to walk along the darkness and find you ♬

351
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,270
You... What is your name?

352
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,900
Don't go. Come play with me.

353
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,820
♬  The deep night sky shows you, who was not able to leave  ♬

354
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,950
♬ You wake me, who was sleeping, up and kiss me again  ♬

355
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,050
I'm sorry.

356
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,570
For making you go through this danger.

357
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:47,300
I'm sorry that I can't tell you why you were in this kind of danger.

358
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,820
Above everything, I'm truly sorry that you ended up meeting me.

359
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,360
I hope...

360
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,730
that another misfortune of meeting me won't happen.

361
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,510
I'm sincerely sorry.

362
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,940
Ri Jin, are you coming to your senses?

363
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,420
Do you know where you are?

364
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,420
Ri On, you're not hurt?

365
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,820
Who are you worrying about, punk?

366
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,690
I had to rack those guys to know where you are. When I knew, I immediately ran there, but you weren't there and the factory was burned up.

367
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,270
Do you know how shocked I was?

368
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,350
Still you understood my code.

369
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,660
Omega-3 murder case, Chapter 3!

370
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,890
An episode where a marine boy secretly carrying drugs in his body for transport gets kidnapped because of the stolen drugs.

371
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,380
The conclusion that the drug that didn't even show up in the MRI was eventually found in the victim's dress!

372
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,790
Bingo! As expected, we match.

373
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,500
You must be happy.

374
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,130
You burned up the factory well.

375
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,100
I'm sorry.

376
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,300
For not being able to explain why you got caught up in this danger,

377
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,450
I'm sincerely sorry.

378
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,160
That man. Where is that man right now?

379
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,270
If you're having a hard time, I'll bring you to the hospital.

380
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,990
If he isn't able to attend this meeting where the Chairwoman has especially put a lot of planning into,

381
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,720
he must not be in that severe of a condition then.

382
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,760
When I saw him in the morning, he seemed to be fine.

383
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,300
Well, you can never know what happened in the car accident by just looking at the outside.

384
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,690
Even if he looks fine, no one knows how much he is hurt inside.

385
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,910
Now, we cannot keep busy people waiting,

386
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,650
so we should end the meeting.

387
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,100
After bringing busy people together, I'm sorry for being late.

388
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,390
There was an accident on my way here.

389
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,030
It was a variable I didn't expect and something out of my control.

390
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,370
I am saying this not as an excuse, but as someone who is going to be leading ID Entertainment from now on,

391
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:33,160
I will be placed in numerous variables and situations that can't be controlled, just like what happened today.

392
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,840
Being the President's grandson is also something I have no control over.

393
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,310
Also, I, who became the Vice President of ID Entertainment without any effort,

394
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,770
was a variable that you guys never thought about.

395
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,390
I will face the ever-changing world with something unchangeable within me.

396
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,550
You will witness it.

397
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:02,630
From now on, I will fight the variables and uncontrollable situations before me with one unchangeable thing.

398
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,740
That is determination. Spirit. Effort.

399
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,070
And... identity. My whole self.

400
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,900
From now on, I will try my best

401
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,530
to persuade the hard-working people of this company with my skill

402
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,760
and become a new vision for Seung Jin Group.

403
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,890
I formally introduce myself.

404
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,600
I'm the new Vice President of ID Entertainment, Cha Do Hyun.

405
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,020
You're late? On the day you take your first steps in the company?

406
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,300
In front of all those sly men who waited a long time for you, and are watching you?

407
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,090
How dare you show up late in front of your uncle, who would jump at the first opportunity to snatch your position?

408
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm sorry.

409
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,690
Sorry? Do you even know what you did wrong

410
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,800
and who would you have to ask forgiveness from?

411
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,590
First... Please listen to...

412
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,160
Your father!

413
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,100
The reason why you are here was because...

414
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,340
your father threw himself out for you and saved you.

415
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,270
The reason why your father is not here right now is because of you!

416
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,080
If you only know what he did for you, and what he did for you to become a member of the Seung Jin family,

417
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,020
you wouldn't have dared to make the mistake you did today.

418
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,750
If you're a human. If you're a human at least.

419
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,540
No matter what happens to you, you have to protect Seung Jin Group.

420
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,710
Until my son, Cha Joon Pyo, can sit on that seat!

421
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,900
No matter what methods you use, you have to protect Seung Jin Group!

422
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,100
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

423
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,570
Cha Joon Pyo

424
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,930
You found him nicely.

425
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,760
You worked hard.

426
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,840
I finally found you.

427
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,960
Have you been well?

428
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,520
Do you know how surprised I was?

429
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,840
Your phone isn't working; when I called the hospital they said you were brought to the emergency room.

430
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,800
I almost dropped my heart, which I was barely holding onto, to the floor.

431
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,370
You're overreacting.

432
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,210
I am just lying down because I want to grasp this opportunity and take a break.

433
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,880
I couldn't sleep for days because there were so many emergency patients.

434
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,810
I will send you food through Ri On, so eat my food instead of the hospital's food.

435
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,020
Aigoo. I made a little. A little. It's the size of a chick's eye crust.

436
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
Ri On said he's going.

437
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,620
I'll go, Father. Driving at night is dangerous.

438
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,710
You're not thinking of feeding Ri Jin all of this, are you?

439
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,900
Then who else? A dog next door?

440
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,670
Why are you sending a food truck of love? She's only been admitted for a couple of days.

441
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,960
You should just give this to the dog next door. I can't bring this to her because it's too embarrassing.

442
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,410
Honey, you go.

443
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,280
Alright. I said I would go.

444
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,070
- Hey, hey, you. Go inside and bring that leather jacket.
- What?

445
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,540
Why all of a sudden?

446
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,310
What do you mean, you punk? I'm going to wear that.

447
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,660
You gave that to me.

448
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,370
Hey, it's a present that Ri Jin gave me. Even if it is tight,

449
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,390
I can't give it up. I want to keep it.

450
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,110
I'm going to lose weight and wear it for sure.

451
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,050
Ah, stop it now! It's talk that's already over!

452
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,170
How long are you going to be obsessed about it?

453
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,640
Hey.

454
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,910
I didn't get hit~

455
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,840
You've grown a lot.

456
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,940
How dare you talk back at your father mannerlessly?!

457
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,540
Is it really okay for you not to go to the hospital?

458
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm alright. I've always been taking care of wounds that are at least this much.

459
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,700
More than that, how is Oh Ri Jin's condition?

460
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,910
Yes. Fortunately her condition is stabilized and they said they moved her to the general ward.

461
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,150
It's a relief.

462
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,930
Don't we have to worry about taking care of the incident?

463
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,790
If she threatens you because of this...

464
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,760
She didn't seem to be that kind of person.

465
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,900
However, she had a mental illness, like me.

466
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:35,540
Pay for her treatment, and until she gets released, please take care of her in any way that you can.

467
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:41,120
And if Se Gi was rude to her...

468
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:47,490
please sincerely apologize in my stead so that it won't become another scar.

469
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,310
The drink came out.

470
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,530
Wow.

471
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,790
I'm sincerely hoping for a complete recovery.

472
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,880
Could it be.... Gentleman?

473
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,130
Perhaps, are you dating right now?

474
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,160
Cheers!

475
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,170
Can you do this at a hospital?

476
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's alright, I already closed the door.

477
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,960
As expected, my dad's beer is the best.

478
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,010
Hey, but you know, about that guy, if he's as you say he is, he's a really weird guy.

479
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,070
Does that make sense that he keeps changing every time you meet him?

480
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,720
It is not impossible either. You're the same.

481
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,890
You are Oh Ri On and Omega. Living with different identities is a defense mechanism and strategy to live in this hard world.

482
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,020
Hey, not everyone does that!

483
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:37,050
That's only possible if you're just like me, you are able to support Jupiter and Saturn from behind with your intelligence and personality. (a pun on words)

484
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,280
Why would you leave out Mars? For someone infected with the Martian virus.

485
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,040
Be careful. I think that man is a player, no doubt.

486
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,190
But if... what if it's not his tactic?

487
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,220
- What?
- What if it's a strategy not out of his own will, but rather something out of his control?

488
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:07,490
Not a defense mechanism, but a trap?
How does it feel?

489
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,380
Wouldn't it be unfortunate? Wouldn't it be dangerous?

490
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,830
Wouldn't it be hard to bear?

491
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,990
Wouldn't it be really lonely?

492
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,680
-What?
-Nothing. It just feels like you're worrying about him more than you need to.

493
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,060
Do you perhaps... like him?

494
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,870
Me? Who?

495
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:40,740
I don't know. I don't know if a person that you are concerned about is a werewolf

496
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,950
or a gentleman, or a shipman.

497
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,410
Why are you saying...

498
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,490
such nonsense...

499
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,330
I don't know, I don't know. Anyway, he's not someone I'll be meeting again. Alright! Let's drink! Drink up!

500
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,040
-Then let's drink.
- Cheers!

501
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,500
I-I was wrong...

502
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,630
I-I was wrong...

503
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,340
I-I was wrong...

504
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,870
Did you call for me, President?

505
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:57,340
On the day of the meeting, find out if a person named Cha Do Hyun

506
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,630
was at a hospital in Seoul.

507
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,360
Yes.

508
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,260
Yes?

509
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,160
Every single hospital in Seoul?

510
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,210
Why? You don't have the willpower to do that?

511
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,870
I need to have some guidelines.

512
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,220
Start with hospitals near the company.

513
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,470
If you use your brain, your arms and legs won't suffer.

514
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,920
I understand.

515
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,570
Did Vice President come to work?

516
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:35,020
It is only us, ID Entertainment, that owns a film site among all the entertainment companies in the country.

517
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,210
Aside from here, we are also currently procuring a land in Jecheon in North Chungcheong province.

518
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,170
It is planned that by this year, we would be able to start construction of a set in there.

519
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:54,580
Because of the construction for a movie set that is set to film soon, the Art team is currently in the middle of site inspection.

520
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,840
I got a food truck so that the staff will feel better. Let's have a meal together.

521
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,230
- Yes.
- Oh?

522
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,840
Cha Do Hyun!

523
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,500
Why are you acting like you don't know me?

524
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,860
I already told you last time.

525
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,420
If I surprise you with words and actions that aren't like myself---

526
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,440
Ignore you?

527
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,320
You can ignore me right now as well.

528
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,260
Are you saying that we have different statuses now?

529
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,390
-That's not what I meant---
- If you treat me badly,

530
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,960
look for me late at night, or call to meet me,

531
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,350
or cross a line that you must not, it's not you, so you said that I should beat you up.

532
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,790
That's right.

533
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,880
-Have you ever even tried to do that before?
-What?

534
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,430
I asked if you've ever tried to cross the line with me?

535
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,290
You are conscious of me, Ki Joon, my mother, and the Chairwoman.

536
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:03,970
You are too conscious of everything in this world.

537
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,890
-What do you want to say?...
- Cross the line.

538
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,420
That line that should never be crossed...

539
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,810
Cross it.

540
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,810
I'm curious to see whether

541
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,240
I will beat you up

542
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,610
or if I will cross the line with you.
- Chae Yeon, I...

543
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,260
Tell me.

544
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,140
I'm not someone you can handle.

545
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,610
Huh?

546
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,510
I'll pretend that I didn't hear what you just said.

547
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,130
It's not something that can be solved just because you hide it!

548
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,610
We have to restart treatment as soon as possible.

549
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,470
You know the situation the Vice President is in.

550
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,030
It's not a time to say something like that.

551
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,580
This incident was solved, but it almost led to a crime!

552
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,310
It's a bomb! Bomb. It's become too dangerous for Mr. Cha.

553
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,340
So I'm saying...

554
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:45,360
Is there anyone you could recommend who could be his secret physician?

555
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,900
Come in!

556
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,950
You're supposed to be lying in a hospital room right now, what are you doing here?

557
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,440
Please do me a favor.

558
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,470
Since you have a guest, I'll--

559
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,000
Ah... No.

560
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,090
You need to examine your patient, but I took too much of your time.

561
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,980
I'll talk to you later...

562
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,560
Ah, our Doctor Oh isn't a patient but she's a doctor, a doctor.

563
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,810
She's our hospital's psychiatrist.

564
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,240
How long have you been a resident?

565
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm a first-year resident.

566
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,300
You want to start working again?

567
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,230
Yes.

568
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,640
-Are your colleagues bothering you?
-Ah, it's not that...

569
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,450
Anyhow, every time Doctor Shin receives an emergency call to cover for you, I heard that he complains in your room.

570
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,320
I heard that him grumbling about your bad fate, or good fate, something like that.

571
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,750
Do I have to rest more?

572
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,030
No PTSD, right?
(PTSD: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

573
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,560
Yes. I'm the type who is born with a strong brain and heart.

574
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,420
Okay, you can go back to your rounds today.

575
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,850
Thank you, thank you.

576
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:23,480
Why? Are your heart and brain becoming fickle now that you're going back to work?

577
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,990
Doctor,

578
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:36,850
you said you've treated a D.I.D patient when you were in America, right?

579
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,480
About Oh Ri Jin.

580
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,350
Is there any problem?

581
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,830
Yes. She's not a patient

582
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,630
but she's a psychiatrist.

583
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,060
On top of that, she's Doctor Seok Ho Pil's student.

584
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,940
At first I had suspicions that it might be Borderline Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder or schizophrenia but

585
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,730
I found out that whenever his personality changes, his consciousness disappears.

586
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,020
He didn't remember the things he did at all.

587
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,190
There's also a dissociation symptom. How many personas have you met?

588
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,440
Three people.

589
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,390
The first personality I met was a very gentle and kind man.

590
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:24,190
The second personality I met is rough and aggressive like a werewolf.

591
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,270
And he was violent.

592
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,640
He said his name is Shin Se Gi.

593
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,980
Wait a moment.

594
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,570
What did you say about the name of the violent persona?

595
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:39,410
Huh? Ah, yes. Se Gi. Shin Se Gi.

596
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,440
He asked to put you to sleep. So that you can't wake up forever.

597
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,520
Could it be, in order to put me to sleep,

598
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,940
he used Oh Ri Jin instead of Professor?

599
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,560
What's wrong? Do you any hunches...

600
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,490
I don't know.

601
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,310
But if that person is a doctor,

602
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,310
she will have definitely caught onto my changes.

603
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,100
Where are you going?

604
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,560
I'll need to personally meet with Oh Ri Jin first.

605
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,310
The time I first met him was

606
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,920
eleven years ago.

607
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,060
When he was seventeen years old.

608
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,270
He beat up his friend's stepfather until he was half-dead, but said that the had no memory of doing it.

609
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,230
I was suspicious right away, at first.

610
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,440
Ah, so he's one of these guys who has read some mystery novel somewhere.

611
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,440
And I was with him for seven years.

612
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,890
He had a very nice outlook.

613
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,310
He is very responsible, and thoughtful.

614
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,450
Also, his IQ was high.

615
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:10,390
While I was treating him, I met with all of the personalities hiding inside him.

616
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:16,100
I also had conversations with them. In the end, I came to believe him.

617
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,810
This person really had multiple personalities.

618
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,850
What is the reason for his illness?

619
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,880
There must be a reason why he began to have different personalities.

620
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,140
That will be hidden in his lost memories.

621
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,520
He lost his memory

622
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,020
from when he was seven to eight. He lost a year's worth of memory.

623
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:42,690
Then you didn't find out the reason?

624
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,310
During his amalgation treatment,

625
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,730
I tried very hard to recover his lost memories, but I failed.

626
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:53,500
That means that he covered up his own memories.

627
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,640
He created multiple personalities as a defensive mechanism to protect himself.

628
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,350
He's not ready to face the painful memories yet...

629
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,340
Then how about his family?

630
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:10,480
If it's difficult for him to remember on his own, he can ask his family for help.

631
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,060
That is very unfortunate as well.

632
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,480
The people that he has to hide his illness from

633
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,660
are his family members.

634
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:32,350
Then he is enduring this alone?

635
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,560
He has been working hard for eleven years,

636
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,810
taking care of things that his other personalities created.

637
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,540
As if he is risking his life to battle alone

638
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,440
in a war, that will never end.

639
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,160
Sometimes, I think about it.

640
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,790
How wronged must he feel?

641
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,390
How much anguish must he feel?

642
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:04,450
How lonely must he be?

643
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,410
In the end, the last question about loneliness always makes me pause.

644
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,060
I'm sorry. Because of me, you had to go through this danger.

645
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:35,810
I'm sincerely sorry that I cannot tell you why you had to face this danger.

646
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:41,200
More than that, I am sincerely sorry that you have met me.

647
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,480
I hope that a misfortune

648
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,400
of meeting me never occurs again.

649
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,730
Miss, Heo Sook Hee! Miss, Heo Sook Hee! Where you going?!

650
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,450
Miss Heo Sook Hee! Miss Heo Sook Hee!

651
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,050
Miss Heo Sook Hee! Miss Heo Sook Hee! Miss Heo Sook Hee! Don't go!

652
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,280
Miss Heo Sook Hee!

653
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,450
Miss Heo Sook Hee!

654
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,410
Are you alright?

655
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,940
Stand up.

656
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,100
Are you alright?

657
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,390
Oh my? Club Paradise's prince?

658
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,100
Ah, that doctor...

659
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,940
I remember! That loneliness sketched on your face!

660
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,540
You feel like you're alone in this world, right? You feel like you're not yourself, right?

661
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,030
Because I know that feeling! I think we'll become good friends!

662
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,190
Club Paradise's prince, I'll see you again!

663
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:06,810
Let's meet again! Let's meet again!

664
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:34,140
You really are a doctor.

665
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,440
And you're not Shin Se Gi.

666
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,560
Did you notice?

667
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,850
Notice what?

668
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,130
Me chang...

669
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,690
Me changing.

670
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:05,190
Aren't you scared of me?

671
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,600
Because I still don't know who you are.

672
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,800
I know it's rude, but who are you?

673
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:23,520
Perhaps, do you have a bomb?

674
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,480
Then perhaps, do you have a leather jacket?

675
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,390
Then...what is your name?

676
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:53,440
I, who has this face and this look in my eye,

677
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,980
am Cha Do Hyun.
