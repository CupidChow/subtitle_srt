1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,120
♬ The hidden things inside me changed me greatly ♬

2
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,620
♬ It put me to sleep, tied my hands together, than locked me in a dark room ♬

3
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,340
♬ The lost pieces of time ,the memories of love, which I abandoned ♬

4
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,080
♬ I erased them and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell ♬

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,790
And your name is?

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,310
My name is...
♬ Without knowing anything I screamed, and that's all I remember ♬

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,070
♬ My heart, which was as cold as ice, will melt once once I wake up ♬

8
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,410
Cha. Do. Hyun.
♬ I want to free myself, from the torment of my sins ♬

9
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,050
♬ Someone take me out, from my spirit full of scars ♬

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,920
What is this? My name... My name is... 
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,680
And your name is...
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep ♬

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,980
♬ and kisses me again ♬

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,100
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,180
Daddy! Please hit me!
♬ and your scent ♬

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,120
♬ echoes in my ears every day,
Where are you? ♬

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,340
Hey, Ri Jin! What's going on? Get your grip!

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,310
- I was wrong.
- I was wrong! Please hit me!

18
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,090
- Daddy!
- Please save me...

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,850
That child's family register was given to me, who didn't have one.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm scared. Hurry up and come.

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:51,900
The traces of the child that lived in the basement of the Seungjin Group mansion were erased from the world... just like that.

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,480
Like that, the evidence of the abuse disappears.
♫ In the unreachable sky, I see you, who is turning back. ♫

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,730
♫You leave me, who was exhausting, making it into a picture♫

24
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,550
Snap out of it!
♫ I'm sorry. ♫

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,940
Ri On, what's wrong with Ri Jin? Why are you like this? Are you hurt somewhere?
♫ I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me and I call for you desperately. ♫

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,830
Ri On, hurry and find a sedative at least, quickly!
♫ But the sadness surges in ♫

27
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,970
Ah, what do we do?!
♫ because I cannot see you ♫

28
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,820
♫ and only my tears fall again. ♫

29
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,570
Episode 17

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,620
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

31
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,190
Mommy!

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,940
Do Hyun, it's dangerous! Get off, quickly!

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,220
Mommy!

34
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,490
Do Hyun, Mommy told you that it was dangerous on that swing!

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,080
Do you know how hurt Mommy will be if you get hurt, Do Hyun?

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,300
I got it, Mommy. I'll be more careful next time.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,430
Such a good girl. Where did this prettiness of yours come from?

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,910
Where would it have come from? It came from mom's stomach.

39
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,070
Our Do Hyun is so smart! Our Do Hyun is really, really smart!

40
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,180
Father-in-law, how did you... What are you doing here?

41
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,980
What happened? Who is that child? Explain it to me.
[1993, America]

42
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,290
I think the answer is already in your question.

43
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,930
If it's a child that doesn't need to be explained, then you would not demand an explanation from me.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,330
She's the child of the man from before I got married.

45
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,600
Why did you come here?

46
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,970
Return to the company.

47
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,920
I did all that I could.

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,350
The company is in danger. I don't know if they were swept away by the flood, or dried up in the drought,

49
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,070
but no matter how much I look, there's no person as competent as you.

50
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,600
It has nothing to do with me. I'm not the daughter-in-law of Seungjin Group anymore.

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,830
I still have your divorce papers.

52
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,840
Legally, you're still my daughter-in-law,

53
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,210
Joon Pyo's wife, and a person of Seungjin Group.

54
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,430
Father!

55
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,300
All the inheritance you received from your marriage had been used by your parents for their business,

56
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,480
and exhausted even more for the hospital fees of that child's father.

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,380
I came here knowing that what you're left with is one beggar's can.

58
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,800
I will no longer act as a tenant manager working under the landowner.

59
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,190
Put that child on Joon Pyo's family register.

60
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,240
Even if your words are Seungjin Group's laws and scripture,

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,510
is this something that Joon Pyo would be likely to accept?

62
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,700
That bastard isn't coming back.

63
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,150
He gave up being both a human and a son.

64
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,500
He had no chance of becoming one in the first place.

65
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,180
Anyone is verdant when they are born.

66
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,210
Someone must have stepped on him. That's why his color has changed.

67
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,420
Haven't you worried that your child could get stepped on by others?

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,510
It's a life of someone born out of wedlock. Do you think other people would not step on her?

69
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,670
This is not a world where they will grow verdant just because their parents would not step on them.

70
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,050
I am offering you the best environment for the child.

71
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:17,310
If she grows up well and takes after you, she could have an important role at Seungjin Group in the future.

72
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,380
This means that she officially becomes the official successor to Seungjin, after Joon Pyo has ran away.

73
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,650
Wh-who did you say this is?

74
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,600
This pretty little puppy is our Joon Pyo's?

75
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,960
You should say hello to your grandmother.

76
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,050
Hello, Grandmother.

77
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,990
Even though I am not well, I should be.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,500
Our Joon Pyo has a kid, so I should be well!

79
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,220
He doesn't even know his child has grown this much. Where exactly is your father roaming around?

80
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,340
- Aigoo, Mr. Park!
- Yes, yes.

81
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,390
I see you've gone fishing with your kid. Were you able to catch some?

82
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,840
Not even one fish is around. They must have fled after hearing the word (that we're coming).

83
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,590
Oh my, I was waiting all night until my eyes have turned inside out, thinking I'd be able to mooch off some spicy fish stew from you.

84
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,580
I feel completely lost.

85
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,390
- Work hard.
- Yes, yes, yes.

86
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,400
- Daddy!
- Hm? What?

87
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,160
Your name is Mr. Cha, so why do people call you Mr. Park?

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,710
Shh!

89
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,550
My name can't be disclosed to others.

90
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,400
Why?

91
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,820
Because I want to live freely.

92
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,800
You become free if you hide your name?

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
Up to a point.

94
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,840
What does it mean to live freely?

95
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,560
Not living how other people want me to,

96
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,310
but just as I am.

97
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,290
Living while doing what I want to do.

98
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,960
Not getting scolded even I am living like that.

99
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,680
What do you want to do, Dad?

100
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,290
Buy a boat and go on trips here and there,

101
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:46,170
and go fishing, read books, make pictures,

102
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,710
write, get off my boat if I find a place that I like, and work there.

103
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,490
Living like that.

104
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,090
I'll buy one for you.

105
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,090
- Buy what?
- A boat.

106
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,710
Really? You're really going to buy a boat for your dad?

107
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,860
Yeah. I'll even give it a name. What should I name it?

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,200
Perry Park! The 'Perry Park' Boat.
What do you think? (t/n: Ferry is pronounced 'Perry' in Korean)

109
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,060
Okay! The 'Perry Park' Boat!

110
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,290
You made a promise with me! You have to buy it for me.

111
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,990
Ah, I feel good!

112
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,650
We need to send the boy to school.

113
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,510
You're back?

114
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,100
I said, we need to send the boy to school.

115
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,960
Send him then. What's the problem?

116
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,610
What's the problem?

117
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,800
We don't even get an enrollment notice because he doesn't have a family register!

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,570
We can't stay like this any longer. Go back to the mansion.

119
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,860
It's plenty enough that you've rebelled that long already.

120
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,360
I told you I cut ties with the mansion already.

121
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,670
You still haven't finished your puberty stage?

122
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,850
Will you still be going through puberty until you turn seventy?

123
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,730
Up until when do we leave the kid unregistered?!

124
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,730
That's why I told you to put him on your family register first!

125
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,080
Why are you telling me to put your son on my family register?

126
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,210
It's only proper if you put him under yours!

127
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not like I don't know why you're acting like this. But quit dreaming.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,030
The people from that house will not treat you well. Just live the way you originally do.

129
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,020
And so? You're telling me to live off from what I make working in restaurants,

130
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,400
and leave the child with no family register for the rest of his life?

131
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,740
When I left the house,

132
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,880
I cut off my blood relation, birth relation, any connection with them.

133
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,760
(If not) I wouldn't be able to go my way.

134
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,690
Does a parent put his pride first before his son?

135
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,230
And you still call yourself a father?!

136
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,410
- Dad.
- Yes?

137
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, it's nothing. It's alright.

138
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,810
We weren't fighting, okay?

139
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,530
I am not saying this twice. Go back.

140
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,450
If you want to receive memorial food from this kid,

141
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,110
yield to your pride for once! Bow down for once!

142
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,280
- You're headed to Seoul, right?
- Yes, I am.

143
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,850
Yes.

144
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,230
Dad, you don't want to go home?

145
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,910
No. Why would I not want to go home?

146
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,130
Your grandfather and grandmother are there.

147
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,510
Then what about mom?

148
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,310
We need to give our greetings first, and then she'll come soon.

149
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,900
Why is that woman here?

150
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,140
Who is that child?

151
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,260
Who would she be? She's your kid.

152
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,200
Seo Yeon gave birth to her in the States, and came back here with her.

153
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,120
My child?

154
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,230
Tear it. With your own hands.

155
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,690
The only useful one in this household is Seo Yeon.

156
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,900
When I left this house six years ago, I ended my relationship with that woman completely.

157
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,210
Then take your son and leave! I can't put him on the family register.

158
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,950
You decide. Do you want to at least save your son,

159
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,080
or to give relief to some shallow woman from somewhere who has no basic principles,

160
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,110
and lose both your son and your woman?

161
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,790
I'll do as you say,

162
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,990
so please get rid of that child that Min Seo Yeon brought here first.

163
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,720
Get rid of what? Get rid of your own child?

164
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,110
Is she really my child?

165
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,780
Stop with the useless talk. Just follow as I say, and come back.

166
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,780
There's no way that she's my child.

167
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,330
Because I...

168
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,530
never even hugged...

169
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,720
that self-righteous woman even once.

170
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,090
What's your name?

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,860
Joon Young. Cha Joon Young. What's yours?

172
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,640
My name is Do Hyun. Cha Do Hyun.

173
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,750
Do Hyun?

174
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,450
Joon Young, jump a little bit higher! A little bit higher!

175
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,200
Okay!

176
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,390
What kind of employee are you?

177
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,320
What were you doing as this matter has turned to this?

178
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,430
I am deeply ashamed.

179
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,350
So what's our countermeasure plan?

180
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,540
We have strongly demanded for the withdrawal of any related news from each media company.

181
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,000
The uploaded news articles on portal sites have been taken down, but there's still a limit (of what we can do).

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,010
Have the car ready.

183
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,970
You're leaving already?

184
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,440
Is it your doing?

185
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,900
You're dragging an innocent person into this again. What did I do this time?

186
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,320
Just live your life reading newspapers.

187
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,240
Former Seungjin Group Chairman Cha Joon Pyo, slim chance to return to position

188
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,250
Former Seungjin Group Cha Joon Pyo in coma for 21 years, currently under treatment
Former Chairman Cha Joon Pyo's health deterioration issue resurfaces again

189
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,380
You properly exploded the card I gave you.

190
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,320
The only thing left is for me to get my money's worth.

191
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,480
Anyway, if you break the promise that you made with me, there will be a problem.

192
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,710
It's a card I brought using the whole of the car and department store subsidiaries,

193
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,500
there's no way I will use it carelessly.

194
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,320
This is just the beginning. Look forward to it.

195
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,060
Alright.

196
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,750
What did you buy that the mention of the car company and department store are being passed to and from the phone?

197
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,500
You don't need to know.

198
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,730
Just remain clueless about it, and just enjoy the results later.

199
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,440
I didn't ever imagine that you would join hands with Do Hyun's mother.

200
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,020
Aren't you making a mistake? I think that

201
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,820
I would be the one to end up getting stabbed in the back.

202
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,640
You see, during wartime,

203
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,040
who your allies and your enemies are change all the time.

204
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,760
You need to read the momentum fast. You have to find the attack point at the right time to win the war.

205
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,570
Isn't it ironic?

206
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,630
After all, it's not of one of our troops that cut the enemy general's throat.

207
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,650
It's one of the enemy general's close subordinates.

208
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,290
You had something to say to me?

209
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,050
Yes. I have something to tell you about Do Hyun and me.

210
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,990
I investigated the records regarding corrections of the family register that you talked about.

211
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,300
As you said, in May of 1994, there was an application to correct the family register.

212
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,670
And one month later, the gender under your name on the family register

213
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,390
was changed from female to male.

214
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,720
It was this?

215
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,310
The role that you, Chairwoman,

216
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,460
played in the tragedy 21 years ago?

217
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,020
So you're saying that the reason why your engagement with President Cha was called off, was Vice-President Cha?

218
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,430
Yes, that's right.

219
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,720
I don't understand what you're saying.

220
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,590
I will help you, Chairwoman.

221
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know what you mean by that, either.

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,220
President Cha Ki Joon, until the General Shareholders' Meeting,

223
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,920
is maintaining my engagement with him to keep a good public image.

224
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,870
It must be because of the Seungjin shares my family possesses.

225
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,990
- So?
- If you help me, Chairwoman,

226
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,740
then I can also help you.

227
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,910
You're asking me to help you?

228
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,410
To the extent that you are even using your family's shares as bait,

229
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,930
what reason is there for you to ask me for help?

230
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,840
First of all, I want you to acknowledge my relationship with Do Hyun,

231
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,550
and I wish for your help.

232
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,300
Problems between a man and a woman are none of my concern,

233
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,980
but if you really need my approval and help that much,

234
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,180
then I'll give it to you. Next?

235
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,000
It's no fun if the person I'll be with in the future is just accepting orders.

236
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,180
Please give some power to Do Hyun.

237
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,100
A position within Seungjin Group.
And as your biological grandson,

238
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,800
a position of social standing.

239
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,230
You have a brain that is waste for a mere Art Team Leader, I see.

240
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,840
Anything else?

241
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:11,200
I wish that from my husband's family, I wish that there's at least you to back me.

242
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,860
The talk is getting longer.

243
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,050
Bring some tea here.

244
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,400
You were here?

245
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,890
Early this morning, news about former Chairman Cha Joon Pyo's recent health condition

246
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,600
has been reported in all mass media.

247
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,800
I know.

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,460
It was definitely from President Cha Young Pyo's side.

249
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,340
They will seize advantageous high lands for the Shareholders' Meeting.

250
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,430
There is nothing small for them to use as a card to bring the Chairwoman down from her position.

251
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,290
So what do you plan to do?

252
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,900
What are you talking about?

253
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,040
The Chairmwoman is currently unaided right now. Even so, she's not someone who would extend a hand to you first

254
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,220
and ask for your help.

255
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,380
So... I should be the one to go to her first, and help her?

256
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,450
It's a matter of choice.

257
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,800
Would it not matter to you if Seungjin Group falls into their hands?

258
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,580
What do you mean, it doesn't matter? It can't happen.

259
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,090
I'm going to make it mine.

260
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,400
- Vice-President.
- But not right now.

261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,680
I have to make them stir up a little more.

262
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,590
I'm not making a move until the Chairwoman personally comes to me and begs.

263
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,190
- What is that?
- It's from the catering service employee that I met with last time.

264
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,510
It's a picture sent by the quick delivery service.

265
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,940
At the inauguration garden party,

266
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,880
it's a group photo they took before the morning of the fire.

267
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,580
Will she be alright, Professor?

268
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,270
Well, it's not that there's something wrong with her health.

269
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,790
I think she's just exhausted.

270
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,650
Did something happen that could have given Dr. Oh a big shock?

271
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,920
Ah, that... So, well... Not too long ago, this kid...

272
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,370
she got fired from being that chaebol's physician.

273
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,610
It must have given her a big shock. In her own way,

274
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,480
I think she's had a sense of pride for that work.

275
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Why are you looking like that? Do you recognize someone?

276
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,700
The person who saved Ri Jin

277
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,740
from the mansion on the day of the fire was none other than....

278
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:35,460
After looking at it now, since they're twins their birthdays must be the same, right?

279
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,240
That's right.

280
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,550
What's wrong, Vice-President? What is it?

281
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,760
Dr. Seok is calling.

282
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,060
- Yes, Doctor.
- I heard you fired Doctor Oh, what does this mean?

283
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,620
You didn't tell me that when we met yesterday.

284
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,470
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

285
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,580
There's no need to be sorry to me.

286
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,430
I'm at Ssang Ri right now.

287
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,550
It looks like Dr. Oh suddenly fainted last night.

288
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,420
She fainted? Wh-why?

289
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,940
According to her brother,

290
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,420
I think that Dr. Oh remembered something and fainted because of the shock from it.

291
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,510
Perhaps, you two, are you remembering your lost memories one by one?

292
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,600
- Are they entangled with bad things?
- Is Oh Ri Jin

293
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,940
okay?

294
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,370
She's okay right now. It's later that's the problem.

295
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,750
If the treatment doesn't work, she could get repetition compulsion.
Compulsive actions caused by repetition of painful past events

296
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,050
Mom.

297
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,970
Ri Jin! Have you come back to your senses?

298
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,490
You should go to your room and sleep comfortably. Why are you out here?

299
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,460
Why did you ask if you were going to be like this

300
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,320
and go through such a hard time?

301
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,430
If it were going to be this hard for you, you should have just told me.

302
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,760
You should have come to me and cried. Why did you cry alone, why?

303
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,300
- Mom.
- What? Do you need anything?

304
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,490
- Is there something you want to eat?
- Back then...

305
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,520
Mom, you were

306
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,980
the person who

307
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,470
took me out of the basement

308
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
and saved me from the fire, weren't you?

309
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,560
You remember that?

310
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,230
Back then,

311
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,270
was my name Do Hyun?

312
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,160
You even remember that?

313
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,520
But...

314
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,610
But, you know...

315
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,520
Why did that person become Cha Do Hyun?

316
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,450
What do you mean, that person?

317
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,380
- Who?
- How did that person

318
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,540
end up losing his own name?

319
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:47,590
Why and because of what

320
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,450
were our names taken away from us?

321
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,590
What do you mean, that person? What do you mean, we?

322
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,220
Mom, you know...

323
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,600
I really liked my name.

324
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,290
I was thankful to you and Dad

325
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,880
for naming me Ri Jin.

326
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,550
And...

327
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,570
And, you know...

328
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,890
I really liked that person's name, too.

329
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,610
- Ri Jin!
- But...

330
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,630
What should I call that person now?

331
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,720
What should I call him?

332
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,630
What is your name?

333
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,110
What is

334
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,090
your name?

335
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,280
I, the one with this face and this gaze,

336
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,060
am Cha Do Hyun.

337
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,690
Look at this when you need medicine.

338
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,140
Look at this when you need medicine.

339
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,640
♫ A secret ♫

340
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:54,600
♫ that cannot be told to anyone ♫

341
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,010
♫ Everyone has at least one of those ♫

342
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,100
Are you watching, Cha Do Hyun? Are you listening, Cha Do Hyun?

343
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,550
You were going to eat medicine again, weren't you?

344
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,430
You're caught red-handed. Don't even think about lying.
♫ Even I say ♫

345
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,760
The fact that you're watching this video right now means that you're having a hard time again,
♫ I don't have ♫

346
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,720
and are about to rely on medicine.
♫ anything special ♫

347
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,350
I'm not saying that medicine is bad.
♫ Even if I act indifferent, ♫

348
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,300
You said so yourself.

349
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,260
Whatever it is, you want to overcome it with me.
♫ it hurts.♫

350
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:40,680
That you wanted to erase the bad memories with good memories with me.
♫ Don't love me, who is like this. ♫

351
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,600
So what is my point?

352
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,390
I'm saying, today let's go ride the snowflake train

353
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,910
and make a lot of good memories.
♫ The only thing I can give you ♫

354
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,640
So that you can get rid of all of the medicine in your drawer,

355
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,390
and completely fill it with good memories instead.

356
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,390
Are you ready? I'm ready!

357
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,140
And I have something to confess.

358
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,800
Uh, me not being able to confess to you all that time

359
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,850
was because I was being conscious of my duty as a doctor and professional.

360
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,930
Don't be surprised by this either!

361
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,100
I won't.

362
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,930
Don't!

363
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
I like you.

364
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,430
I...
♫ Even loneliness ♫

365
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,930
really...
♫ seems like an old friend. ♫

366
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,130
like you

367
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,220
a lot, Cha Do Hyun.
♫ I cannot get used to this feeling, ♫

368
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,100
♫  I miss you ♫

369
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:05,260
♫ Don’t love me, who is like this  ♫

370
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,550
♫ What can I do about my heart being like this? ♫

371
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,140
♫  The only thing I can give you  ♫

372
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:24,760
♫  is just my unstoppable tears ♫

373
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,260
♫  With a face that is unfamiliar,  ♫

374
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:39,180
♫ I will just hurt your heart ♫

375
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,970
♫ Just let me love you by myself ♫

376
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,250
Come out and eat.

377
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,950
Should I bring it here?

378
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,410
Get up.

379
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,200
Ri On.

380
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,750
How long are you going to stay holed up in the corner of your room?

381
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,550
Just please leave me alone.

382
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,930
How long do I have leave you alone? Until you die?!

383
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,220
I beg of you to let me go!

384
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,510
If you're the one hurting, is that it?

385
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,910
Then what about us?

386
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:52,640
What do I say to Mom who cooks all day for you?

387
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,600
"She said she'll have a hard time by herself. Act like you don't know." Should I say that?

388
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,430
What should I say to our father who sobs in secret because his heart is so torn up because of you?

389
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,430
"She said she'll be in pain by herself. Ignore her." Should I say that?

390
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Why do you have to make it that we can't help you? Why?!

391
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,680
Who do you think you are?!

392
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,180
I understand.

393
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,980
You work this out yourself.

394
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,350
I don't like a sister who just cries.

395
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,850
I like a vigorous sister.

396
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,140
If you're not going to be one, then you're not my sister.

397
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,640
Don't be like this.

398
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,350
I rely on you so much.

399
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,260
I became so strong because of you.

400
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,180
I'm not scared of anything when I think of the fact that you've got my back.

401
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,510
I was wrong. I won't be like that.

402
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,930
So... don't say that you won't be my brother.

403
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,220
Ever since I was young, those were the words I was most afraid of.

404
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,680
♫ I call you softly ♫

405
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,220
♫ Unlike my heavy heart♫

406
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,100
Are you going to eat then?

407
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,080
- Yeah.
♫ I hide behind a playful tone ♫

408
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,850
Are you going to say that you're hurt when you're hurting?

409
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,720
- Yeah.
♫ and hold myself back ♫

410
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,600
Are you going to say you're tired when you're tired?

411
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,850
- Yeah.
♫ I live as the person you know ♫

412
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,800
Then after eating, 
♫ You, ♫

413
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,760
are you going to take Ri Na out for a walk with me?
♫  who is smiling so prettily. ♫

414
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,390
- Yeah.
♫ Truthfully  ♫

415
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,390
That's enough. Follow me then.
♫ it's tiring for me to only look at you ♫

416
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:53,800

417
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,260
- Start!

Why, Sister?

You know that I'm really thankful to you, right?

I'm not so sure.

441
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,800
The love that you were supposed to receive alone from our parents,

442
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,600
thanks for sharing it with me.

443

You don't really know how to ask for a favor.

I can't protect Seungjin, based on the amount of request you're asking with right now.

When you go back and have the heart to beg, come back then. I'll think about it.

461
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,250
I'll tell you what happened

462
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,400
at the mansion 21 years ago.

463
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,330
I have already seen through to an extent. I will learn about the rest by myself.

464
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,010
Prepare a different bait when you come next time.

465
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,430
There's no way you can find out just because you said you will.

466
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:57,010
The only one who completely knows about that incident is just me.

467
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,460
Even if the whole world is pointing fingers at him, calling him names,

468
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,940
your father

469
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,840
is the only son I have.

470
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,360
No matter how much you try to deny it, just like you are your father's son.

471
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,700
Promise me in front of your father.

472
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,500
That for the price of hearing the truth about the incident 21 years ago,

473
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,060
you'll return to the company.

474
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,680
After I hear all of the truth,

475
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,900
then I'll answer.

476
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,200
21 years ago, that day...

477
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,740
was the brightest

478
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,920
and happiest day of my son's life.

479
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,420
It's been a long time.

480
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,760
[1994, May, The day of the outbreak of the fire]
Seungjin Group's Chairman Cha Joon Pyo's Celebration

481
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,240
Thank you for coming. Yes, thank you.

482
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,920
Thank you. Yes.

483
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,120
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

484
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,580
Thank you. Yes.

485
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,180
Ah, it's been a while. So your kids are doing well, right?

486
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,280
Alright, thanks.

487
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,300
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

488
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,200
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.
-Yes.

489
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,780
-Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

490
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,790
Hyung-nim, I sincerely congratulate you.

491
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,020
Me, too, Brother-in-law. It's been a while, hasn't it?

492
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,300
Thanks for coming, Young Pyo.

493
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,060
You, too, Sister-in-law.

494
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,180
Wow, they say one's position makes a person. Your face looks very comfortable, Joon Pyo Oppa!

495
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,260
Your force is totally different! You seem like a totally different person.

496
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,100
Jin Suk, you're still the same. You didn't change at all.

497
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,760
What do you mean I didn't change? My kid's already seven.

498
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,400
Wow, you're so cool!

499
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,500
Make sure that nothing makes the guests uncomfortable, especially cleanliness.

500
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Yes, Madam.

501
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,860
Then, I'll leave it to you.

502
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,420
Yes, Madam.

503
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,020
Ajumma, can you make me some food?

504
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,860
Are you hungry? What would you like, Young Master?

505
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,280
Anything is fine, give me a lot of food.

506
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,180
Really? Then just wait a bit.

507
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,160
Do you want me to bring this to the 2nd floor?

508
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,920
No, I can do it by myself.

509
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,160
Thank you.

510
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,800
Who is that little kid who just left?

511
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,160
The son of the newly inaugurated Chairman.

512
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,180
Actually, a child born from a 'second'.

513
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,260
- Second?
- Shh!

514
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,160
There is someone like that. A nuisance for this family.

515
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,940
She's still not kicked out probably because of that kid.

516
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,640
But no one knows for sure how it will turn out later on.

517
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,960
Their family situation is complicated.

518
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,130
This is the norm!

519
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,230
Wait! Isn't he going to the basement again?

520
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,060
Joon Young, listen to Mom carefully.

521
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,840
Today, Dad is going to introduce you to some people.

522
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:22,200
Grandmother, Dad, Mom, and the employees were the only ones who knew about you for the time you've been living here in this house.

523
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:29,540
But after today, everyone in the world will know about you.

524
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,120
That's good, isn't it? It'll be nice, won't it?

525
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,570
Then what about you, Mom?

526
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:43,210
I'll go later. If you grow up and take over Dad's company later,

527
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:48,910
then I can also live proudly and openly.

528
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,610
I told you that you had to do something to make that happen, didn't I?

529
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,630
That I have to become the owner of Seungjin Group.

530
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,830
That's right.

531
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,570
You're so smart, my son.

532
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:10,490
So you have to do well, Joon Young.

533
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,250
That way, Mom can go out into the world.

534
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:35,570
Yes, thank you to everyone, our precious guests, for attending this celebration and brightening this place, despite being busy.

535
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:40,180
There is no formality today. I would just be grateful if you enjoyed yourselves.

536
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:46,720
However, later, there is someone that I want to formally introduce to you all.

537
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,960
The person who will become Seungjin's successor after me in the future.

538
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,080
I will introduce my son to you.

539
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,730
Chairman Cha Joon Pyo had a son?

540
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,400
Wait, he had a hidden son?

541
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,080
... A hidden son ...

542
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,340
And so, if it's a son, is it the child from the woman we saw outside? Is it him?

543
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,220
Madam Yoon, have you seen the child?

544
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,540
I've only heard of him through rumors, too.

545
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,480
Everything that happens in the main residence is strictly off-limits to the outside in the first place.

546
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,940
What is it now? It just made deceased President Min Seo Yeon pitiful.

547
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:24,720
But for the Group's two important people to have an accident on the same day at the same time, isn't it

548
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,000
a little doubtful?

549
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,300
But really... Who else could be the one who benefits the most from that accident?

550
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,440
I heard those rumors, too.

551
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,380
The rumors are saying that it might be the biggest tragedy perpetrated by a mother to put her son on the Chairman's seat.

552
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,620
Hey... Why don't you write a gossip article instead?

553
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,200
Hey, little boy!

554
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,780
You live here, don't you?

555
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,540
That's right.

556
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,400
Do you know where the basement here is?

557
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,140
Th-the basement?

558
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,480
Hey!

559
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,420
Joon Young, are you ready?

560
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,260
You should come out and introduce yourself to the guests.

561
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,300
Joon Young?

562
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,240
-I'm sorry, I was late.
-Joon Young!

563
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,620
You waited a long time, didn't you? Hurry up and pack your stuff.

564
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,470
Let's run away from this house.

565
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,760
Run? To where?

566
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,160
Let's ride the train and go far.

567
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,290
Train?

568
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,170
But I have no money.

569
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,990
I have money. Hurry and get up!

570
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,540
Before daddy comes, we have to leave.

571
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:13,720
Joon Young, what are you doing in here?

572
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,440
Daddy...

573
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,990
Daddy, I was wrong! Don't do it!

574
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,120
Please, don't do it!

575
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,120
Daddy! Don't do it!

576
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,490
Please, don't do it!
-I was wrong!

577
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:51,960
Daddy!

578
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,360
I was wrong! Save me!

579
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,610
Save me!

580
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:06,680
The guests are waiting. Where did Chairman Cha Joon Pyo go to?

581
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,230
He said he was going to bring his son and went just now.

582
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,400
Really?

583
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:28,230
Fire! Fire!

584
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,110
Are you saying that the fire that happened 21 years ago

585
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,040
was not caused by a simple electrical problem,

586
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,050
but that someone deliberately started it?

587
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:42,230
- That's right.
- Who was it?

588
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,750
Please answer it. Who was it?

589
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,480
The person I saw at that time...

590
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,140
was you.

591
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,030
It was you.

592
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,460
21 years ago, on that day...

593
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,640
you started that fire.

594
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,280
If it weren't for you,

595
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,290
your father! My son, Joon Pyo...

596
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:02,090
would not become a living corpse like this!

597
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,810
I had no choice but to cover it up.

598
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,000
The truth about my only grandson starting the fire.

599
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,070
If that had become known, my son's weakness,

600
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,830
everything that occurred in that basement...

601
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,340
and the identity of the missing child, they would all come out.

602
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,670
I had no choice but to cover it.

603
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:34,680
That was to save you.

604
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,490
Because it was the only way to save

605
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,750
your father and Seungjin Group.

♬  The hidden things inside me , changed me greatly ♬

607
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,890
♬  put me to sleep, tied my hands together, then locked me in a dark room  ♬

608
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,620
♬ The lost pieces of time  ♬
♬ The memories of love, which I abandoned  ♬

609
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,010
♬  I erased them and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell.  ♬

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,590
♬  Without knowing anything I screamed ♬
♬  And that’s all I remember  ♬

611
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:38,760
♬  My heart, which was as cold as ice, will melt once, once I wake up ♬

612
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,900
♬  I want to free myself, from the torment of my sins ♬

613
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,370

♬ Someone take me out, from my spirit full of scars ♬
♬ The deep night ♬

614
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:51,710
