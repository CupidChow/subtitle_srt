1
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,560
The basement again?

2
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,450
What is this? What did I figure out?

3
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,880
In the basement, other than me, there was one more person?

4
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,400
Who is it?

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,190
Just who are you?

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,350
Don't leave.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,820
Play with me.

8
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,910
♫The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave♫

9
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:22,410
♫ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again♫

10
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,200
♫Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♫

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,060
♫echoes in my ears everyday♫
♫Where are you?♫

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,610
Are you feeling better now, Cha Do Hyun?

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Shin Se Gi?

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Why are you here?

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Why are you in Cha Do Hyun's bedroom? Why?

16
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
WHY?!

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,450
Since a while ago,

18
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,530
I was Mr. Cha's personal doctor.

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,300
It seemed like he was having a nightmare so I just...

20
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,880
To kill me?

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,630
To get rid of me?

22
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,970
Episode 10

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,550
Where are we going?

24
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm trying to leave here. I can't leave you in Cha Do Hyun's place.

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
Mr. Shin! Calm down and listen to me.

26
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,630
Listen to what?

27
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,080
Listen to your warning saying that since you've teamed up with Cha Do Hyun now and am ready to kill me, get prepared?

28
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,900
I told you I don't have that kind of skill.

29
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,340
I'm just trying to be an equal moderator between Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin, that's all.

30
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,280
Equal moderator?

31
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,640
Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin both have the need to understand each other!

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,280
This can only end if one of us disappears!

33
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,300
And you must choose only one in the end.

34
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,550
Is it ok with you even if I disappear?

35
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,630
Would you like me to disappear?

36
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,890
Mr. Cha didn't request for me to get rid of you.

37
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,460
He wants to converse with you.

38
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,950
He wants to reconcile with you.

39
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm just a moderator between you two.

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,590
I'm a negotiator. I'm nothing more or less than that.

41
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,660
So the choice is not mine to make.

42
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,820
You've completely fallen for Cha Do Hyun.

43
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,310
Mr. Shin!

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,500
Do you think Cha Do Hyun put you here with an innocent intention?

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,880
What does that mean?

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,270
Do you think that bastard is really

47
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,450
just innocent like that?

48
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,120
What does that mean?

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,130
Check it yourself.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,140
Where are you trying to go?

51
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,690
Cha Do Hyun broke the rule.

52
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,360
Now, it's impossible to remain at peace with him.

53
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,190
I'm thinking of punishing him in my own way.

54
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,150
Because that's the rule for the game.

55
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,720
Wait! What rule? What punishment?

56
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,280
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,290
Tell me what the rules for the game are.

58
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,940
I said tell me!

59
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,880
Cha Do Hyun has you here as a hostage.

60
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,570
In order to protect his woman, and to threaten me.

61
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,870
And foolishly enough, you're caught right in the trap.

62
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,640
What are you talking about? Explain so I can understand.

63
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,090
So that's why I'm going to punish him.

64
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,780
Since he ruined my world, Cha Do Hyun's world needs to be ruined too.

65
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,090
You! What in the world are you planning to do?

66
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,990
When that bastard comes back,

67
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,670
so that he can never clean up this mess,

68
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,210
so much that he would want to hide again,

69
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,430
so that he would hide and never come back, I'm thinking of punishing him thoroughly.

70
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,140
Wait!

71
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,390
Take me with you.

72
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,760
If you're not going to have me,

73
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,390
don't touch me.

74
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,690
Shin Se Gi!

75
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,370
Cha Do Hyun has you here as a hostage.

76
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,520
In order to protect his woman, and to threaten me.

77
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,510
And foolishly enough, you're caught right in the trap.

78
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,620
Long time, no see, Cha Do Hyun.

79
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,150
While I wasn't here, you've made the house into a complete prison.

80
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,080
It's amazing. Very amazing.

81
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,700
It's a great way to spend your money, just like the rich chaebol you are.

82
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,550
This is why psychiatrists are tiring.

83
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,100
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

84
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,720
If you touch my woman,

85
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,450
your woman will be in danger.

86
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,700
Do you like it?

87
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,790
But what's wrong with your expression?

88
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,020
Don't worry about it. I heard women are usually like this before their engagement.

89
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,120
Never mind.

90
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,820
I understand. And

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
I was wrong.

92
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,860
I took care of my dignity before your feelings and pride.

93
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,940
I reacted foolishly to a rash rumor. I made you lonely. Shall I continue?

94
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,850
That's enough stop it now. It seems like you're well aware of it.

95
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,630
Aren't you going to try it on?

96
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,400
Here.

97
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,800
It's pretty.

98
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,960
Do you want to drink wine?

99
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,810
No, I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow so I have to wake up early.

100
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,020
Can you give me another cup of tea?

101
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,940
Personal Report: Team Leader Han Chae Yeon

102
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,440
Seoul City, Gangnam district...

103
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,530
Oh Ri Jin! Oh Ri Jin! Where are you?

104
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,380
Secretary Ahn, I'm here in the study room!

105
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,780
What happened?

106
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,770
First of all, please give me your car keys.

107
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,410
Did you find Se Gi?

108
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,710
- I think I know where he is.
-Then I'll-
-No.

109
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,180
Just in case Se Gi comes back,

110
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,740
Secretary Ahn, you can stay here.

111
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,510
Mom said she will be on the night flight. She'll arrive at Incheon Airport tomorrow.

112
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,900
-Yes I know.
-Do you want to go to the airport or shall I?
-Oh, mother said she'll go.

113
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,360
She's excited about meeting her old classmate from high school again.

114
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,440
Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow.

115
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,390
Your lips are a bit red.

116
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,460
Huh?

117
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,950
I'm going.

118
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,190
Cha Do Hyun.

119
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,090
What are you trying to do? Why'd you call?

120
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,680
Are you trying to maintain your fishery half a step late?

121
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,030
Either way, you picked up my call.

122
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm engaged to Ki Joon. Don't call in the future.

123
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,730
Nice timing, I guess.

124
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,300
- What?
-Want to meet up? I missed you.

125
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,760
- I'm busy. I don't have time to meet you.
- No way.

126
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,970
Cha Ki Joon just left, so you're probably alone.

127
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,010
Where are you now?

128
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,530
I think someone's here outside.

129
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,230
-Are you crazy?
-Why do you think it's me?

130
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,930
It could be Cha Ki Joon.

131
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,600
Who's there?

132
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,930
Oppa?

133
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,390
Is it you, Oppa? Did you leave something behind?

134
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,100
Hey

135
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,300
Have gone crazy?

136
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,390
I don't think you should treat your guests like this.

137
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,520
You told me if you came for me late at night or called asking to meet up,

138
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,720
and crossed the line that you mustn't cross, you said that's not you so I should avoid you at all costs.

139
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,410
I said that? Wow, that's impressive.

140
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,520
Leave. It's too late.

141
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,480
The engagement ring looks nice.

142
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,400
I wanted to put it on for you.

143
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,440
But you. Don't you think you're going too far ahead?

144
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,340
Who said I'm going to cross the line?

145
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,950
I just wanted to drink a glass of wine with my friend.

146
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,870
- What have you done?
- Don't ask every single time,

147
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,370
and muster up your imagination.

148
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,180
What in the world have you done?

149
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,270
If you're not going to have me,

150
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,710
didn't I tell you not to touch me?

151
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,370
Not that car!

152
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,420
This car.

153
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,110
Not the driver's seat, get in the passenger's seat! How dare you try to sit in the driver's seat after drinking alcohol?

154
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,560
Wear your seat belt.

155
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,090
Let's talk, Mr. Shin.

156
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,580
-What did you do to Team leader Han?
-Just imagine with the amount of trust you have in me.

157
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,000
-Mr. Shin!
-It drives you crazy, right?

158
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,940
During the few hours you lost me,

159
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,780
you're about to go nuts with curiosity wondering what happened, right?

160
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,680
Is it fun to tease?
-I feel like that.

161
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,190
When I'm not here, I go crazy in curiousity of what happened between Cha Do Hyun and you.

162
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,530
So I only imagine with the amount of trust I have in you.

163
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,560
And you betrayed that trust.

164
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,680
Let's stop, Mr. Shin. Let's stop it all and just end it here.

165
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,850
What will it take to stop you?

166
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,750
Is your IQ number only one digit? How many times do I have to tell you?

167
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,370
Instead of me, kill Cha Do Hyun.

168
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,900
Vice President.

169
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,570
Secretary Ahn, you've aged, too. Seeing that you don't recognize me at once.

170
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,730
This is quite lonely.

171
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,700
This place is filled with people on Cha Do Hyun's side.

172
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,370
It feels like I was dragged into enemy ground.

173
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,650
Tonight, I will stay here so

174
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,550
Oh Ri Jin, go stay at a hotel-
-No, it's okay. I'll stay here.

175
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,320
-We have things to talk about.
-Is what they say.

176
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,380
The door is over there.

177
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,210
Mr. Shin! Let's talk.

178
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,170
If you stayed behind hoping for Cha Do Hyun to return, then forget it.

179
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,380
That bastard isn't coming back.

180
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,460
What are you saying?

181
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,440
You didn't hear it?

182
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,770
That bastard is never coming back.

183
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,370
Why? There must be a reason.

184
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,610
-Because the seal to his memory has been opened.
-The seal to his memory?

185
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,470
Since the entrance is opened,

186
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,450
the memories he wouldn't want to remember,

187
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,320
will soon get released one by one.

188
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,760
By any chance...do you know about it?

189
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,450
The year's worth of memory that Mr. Cha lost?

190
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,290
Of course.

191
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,570
- Because I was born in order to handle that.
- Then...

192
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,920
In the memories that you have that Mr. Cha does not, by chance...

193
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,660
Have you really never met Mr. Cha or Se Gi before?

194
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,420
Am I in it?

195
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,730
Am I...in it?

196
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,100
I'll tell you if you choose me.

197
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,700
-Are you joking!?
-Does it seem like I'm joking?

198
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,200
It's the same as you throwing in fake bait to reel in fish!

199
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,880
It's bait that I'm risking my life on.

200
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,700
So eat it. Hook onto it.

201
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,810
Are you the one who's IQ is a single digit?

202
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,660
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't have that kind of potential!

203
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,870
Keep this in mind. The more you hold off your decision,

204
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,030
the more destroyed Cha Do Hyun's world becomes.

205
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm going to make it like that.

206
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,320
You understand?

207
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,160
What a charming engagement ring.

208
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,280
I wanted to put one on for you.

209
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,360
Oh Ri Jin, you'll catch a cold if you sleep out here.

210
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,620
Mr. Cha?

211
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,310
Yes, I'm Cha Do Hyun.

212
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,540
You came back?

213
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,510
I was worried because I thought you really wouldn't come back!

214
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,190
When did you come?

215
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,270
Try to stop Mr. Shin.

216
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,970
I'm sorry but I can't take care of him anymore.

217
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,340
Oh Ri Jin.

218
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,330
Yes.

219
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,740
Thank you for all this time.

220
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,100
-We meet again.
-What's the reason you're being like this to me?

221
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Don't be scared.

222
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm only here to get my car.

223
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,110
Tomorrow, I'll come to get that car.

224
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,800
Are you okay, President?

225
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,870
Exactly where did he learn how to drive...

226
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,810
Your lips are pretty red.

227
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,000
Wow.

228
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,070
But...but...isn't that the Vice President?

229
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,650
Speechless.
Wow. Awesome.

230
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,880
Heart drops.

231
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,380
Uncommonly handsome man

232
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,920
Hello, Grandfather. No...

233
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,850
Chairman Cha Geon Ho.

234
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,740
You seem well.

235
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,860
He isn't here as well?
-Yes...

236
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,090
Then, even at Team Leader Han's house?

237
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,980
Only his car was parked there.

238
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,830
Anyway, let's look around inside the company.

239
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,300
Secretary Choi! Secretary Choi!

240
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,620
Ah, y..yes...

241
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,730
Did you by chance see the Vice President today?

242
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,150
He really looked to die for today!

243
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,480
I mean, I thought he stepped out of a fashion magazine!

244
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,980
It's Shin Se Gi.

245
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,870
So where is he right now?

246
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,660
What are you guys looking at?

247
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,790
Is this the first time you've seen a handsome man yawn?

248
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,010
Vice President, let's step out for a moment...

249
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,020
There's a party tonight, but you've already changed! And even styled your hair to an all-back style.

250
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,090
He sure is diligent!

251
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,910
-Vice President!
- Don't touch me.

252
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,800
We won't touch you, yes. Then, just the chair...

253
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,290
What are you doing?

254
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,780
What are you doing? Stop it right now!

255
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,680
I told you to stop touching me.

256
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,180
How disgustingly high and mighty of you.

257
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,210
Here. I touched you, I touched you. What are you going to do, huh? Huh?

258
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,700
Stop touching me. I told you to stop touching me. Stop, stop, stop touching me. I told you, stop.

259
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,970
What are you doing right now!? We're at the workplace.

260
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,750
I'm sorry. It's just that he won't listen to me.

261
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,560
You heard him. This is the workplace and I'm Cha Do Hyun, the Vice President.

262
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,760
And I need to attend the meeting right now.

263
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,990
That's enough. It's too late to stop him.

264
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,560
We have to stop him. Se Gi is thinking of destroying everything Cha Do Hyun worked for.

265
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,150
He already revealed himself to the employees,

266
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,410
and today's meeting is a meeting where the Vice President's attendance is mandatory.

267
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,850
- But...
- If an emergency situation occurs, we have no choice but to stop it with our entire bodies.

268
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,060
Just a moment.

269
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,040
Yes, Madame.

270
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,660
Oh Ri Jin?

271
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:40,130
Currently, the 5 member idol group Rocking is showing great sales in the album charts.

272
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,000
They're also working towards international advancements.

273
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,310
Okay, the album team should prepare the presentation for the Asian Music Festival until next week; and now, let's move on to the video team.

274
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,650
Vice President?

275
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,590
Vice President, report.

276
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,960
Oh Ri Jin ♥ Shin Se Gi
Oh Ri Jin, you are a star in my heart

277
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,700
Cha Ki Joon = Attention hogger
Boring bastard!!

278
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,670
Give that back!

279
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,710
Vice President, what are you doing right now?

280
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,630
Did you find Omega?

281
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,370
Omega?

282
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,100
Do I have to catch a tuna for you now?

283
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
What are you trying to say?

284
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,750
Omega's copyrights are secured.

285
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,260
It's the contract directly signed by Omega himself.

286
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,580
If the task is done, shouldn't you be happy?

287
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,680
You worked hard.

288
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,410
This project will return to the original person in charge, Team Leader Lee.

289
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,260
So cheap.

290
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,590
You make the servants work and take in all the money yourself?

291
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,350
Vice President, do you see this meeting as some kind of playground?

292
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,810
There is a time and place for jokes--

293
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,350
Seeing how you can't even differentiate between jokes and disses,

294
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,820
your brain's no good.

295
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,400
What did you just say?

296
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,010
If a person with education has been educated enough, in front of all his employees,

297
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,610
cheaply outcast an opponent like this openly, isn't it embarrassing?

298
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,840
Omega's production will be handled by Team Leader Lee from now on.

299
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,200
That... President... That's...

300
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,990
What is it?

301
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,360
Omega signed the contact

302
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,830
on the condition that only Vice President would handle the production, so...

303
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,120
Is what they say.

304
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,170
Cha Ki Joon.

305
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,990
I prepared some ice cold soda because I thought you might feel heated.

306
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,080
Please leave.

307
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,790
Don't feel too angry.

308
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:59,680
Vice President Cha. I didn't see him like that but he is very cool.

309
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,360
A fellow that's normally like a puppy

310
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,970
but today he was totally like a hyena...kya~

311
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,760
I mean, how can someone change all of a sudden like that?

312
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,810
It isn't like he have multiple personalities or something.

313
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,910
Leave! Can't you hear me? I said LEAVE!

314
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,270
Yes.

315
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,020
I can't understand. I can't understand at all.

316
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,970
How does he stay still

317
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,520
while being treated like this?

318
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,290
How stupid do you have to become for that to become possible?

319
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,800
That's what is called responsibility.

320
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,240
Because there is something to protect, and something to accomplish, that is why he is enduring it.

321
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,840
That is something a person who latched responsibility off of them

322
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,880
can say with such ease.

323
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,440
Is that...about me?

324
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,450
Looking at it now,

325
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,890
Secretary Ahn and Cha Do Hyun really are a match made in heaven.

326
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,520
But what to do?

327
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,590
That Cha Do Hyun bastard will never come back.

328
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,810
What are you doing now?

329
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,650
I haven't seen Oh Ri Jin since long before. Where did she go?

330
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,480
She left to meet with Vice President's mother.

331
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,550
Who did you say she's going to meet?

332
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,960
She left after receiving a call from the Vice President's mother.

333
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,940
Are you crazy? What do you expect them to do together?

334
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,760
What are you saying?

335
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,030
They were already acquaintances.

336
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,140
Where did they go?

337
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,890
Where are these two people?!

338
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Why...are you giving this to me?

339
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,100
I bought it for you because I thought it would match you well.

340
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,290
Just trying holding it for now.

341
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,780
I don't have a right to accept things like this.

342
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,110
I said to try holding it.

343
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,950
Yes.

344
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,940
It looks good.

345
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,670
As expected, my eyes are good.

346
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,230
Here.

347
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,930
-Take the tag off.
-Yes?

348
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,800
Since it looks good on you, there's no need to do a refund. I said to remove the tag.

349
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,950
Yes.

350
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,760
Since you took the tag off, I'm saying this now. That's a bribe.

351
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,020
Then, I'll put it back.

352
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,930
Don't you know that I can't return it once the tag is removed?

353
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:23,490
Then, what is the consequence for receivng this bribe..?

354
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,430
Is my kid eating well?

355
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,040
Yes.

356
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,020
And do you think he's sleeping well?

357
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,860
Don't go!

358
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,030
Play with me, play with me.

359
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,100
Excuse me, Madame.

360
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,680
I wanted to ask you something.

361
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,360
About what?

362
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,740
It's an off topic question, but

363
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,980
I heard he has no memories from when he was seven until he was eight years old.

364
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,110
Is it true?

365
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,570
Who said that?

366
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,570
Did my child say that?

367
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,190
Yes.

368
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,700
So what I'm saying is...

369
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,990
Perhaps, did something happen back then?

370
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,520
There's no such thing. Nothing much happened.

371
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,920
Ah...

372
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,480
Then, by chance, when Vice President was younger,

373
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,590
did he have a close friend his age?

374
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,990
Why are you asking about that?

375
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:09,870
Yesterday, when he was resting in the dressing room,

376
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,640
he seemed to be having a nightmare.

377
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,520
He kept looking for some kid in his sleep.

378
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,740
Get up!

379
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,480
Do Hyun...

380
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,380
This is a warning.

381
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,400
From now on, you better not call her out.

382
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,440
Do you understand what I'm saying?

383
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,100
Do Hyun...Do Hyun...

384
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,050
Could it be...

385
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,640
that you remembered everything now?

386
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,020
Hold on. I'm not done talking with your mom yet. I have things left to say to her!

387
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,270
There's no need. There's no need to listen to that woman!

388
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,630
Why are you so mad?

389
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,660
I was just being a friend and talking with her.

390
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,430
Whenever someone is lonely, they all want to reveal their pain sometimes.

391
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,560
Pain? Loneliness?

392
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,950
Should I tell you what kind of woman she is?

393
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,540
Should I take off her mask!?

394
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,120
What do you mean mask?

395
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,350
In an abusive scene where one person's soul was getting shattered,

396
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,830
there are three types of people.

397
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,410
Victim, perpetrator, and witness!

398
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,690
Even if there is one less person out of those three, bad things don't happen.

399
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,970
He was...abused?

400
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,930
That woman was a witness.

401
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,130
And she survived in Seungjin Group using that as a weapon.

402
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,390
And even now, she is struggling to exist using that as a threat.

403
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,060
But could I really be able to love that woman?

404
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,490
Answer! I said, answer!

405
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,970
You're doing well.

406
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,470
That's right.

407
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,380
Slowly, go slowly.

408
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,560
That's nice. Good hold.

409
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,280
Since when did you know that I was Cha Do Hyun?

410
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,940
How much and how far do you know about me?

411
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,930
I knew you were the only successor of Seungjin Group from the start.

412
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,380
But why did you pretend not to know?

413
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,110
You knew my name but why did you call me Perry?

414
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,050
Because I figured it was an act or a cover up.

415
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,410
The desire to escape from being a third generation chaebol and act as a totally different person.

416
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,110
Am I wrong?

417
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,170
But that guy you talked about, does it make sense that he changes drastically every time you meet him?

418
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,750
What if that isn't the strategy of the mind?

419
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,730
What if it's not something done freely, but against his will?

420
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,850
It's not a defense mechanism, but a trap?

421
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,300
Some chaebol asked me to be his secret physician for three months.

422
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,640
Do you like him?

423
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,970
Me? Like who?

424
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,170
I'm sorry.

425
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,310
Excuse me, but where is this plane landing?

426
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,300
About the novel, The Child in the Basement,

427
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,010
what was the reason the boy was afraid of the basement?

428
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,930
No way...

429
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,060
What's up with you? Making mistakes which isn't like you?

430
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,230
Even monkeys fall from the tree sometimes.

431
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,630
You got something, right?

432
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,650
What are you talking about?

433
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,840
Something must have popped into your head while climbing. Tell me.

434
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,640
There's a man.

435
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,790
Why are you telling me so easily today? It's not fun.

436
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:56,210
Appearance, family, education. On the outside, he has all the points that would make everyone jealous.

437
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,050
But truthfully, he is a man with a mental disability.

438
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,000
Considering him as a main character of a thriller novel, it's a bit plain.

439
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:11,030
Then one day, a woman shows up in his life like a coincidence, like a destiny.

440
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,020
And...

441
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,210
how do you think the story goes from there?

442
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,590
Pack your stuff. We're leaving this place.

443
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,840
Even though you know the memories that Mr. Cha lost,

444
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,830
what's the reason for shutting your mouth?

445
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,460
What in the world is the reason that you're not telling?

446
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,960
That bastard cannot handle it.

447
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,010
In the end, he will end his own life.

448
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,160
But he can handle it. He can overcome it.

449
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,610
Then we die!

450
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,020
We were made to take in that bastard's pain instead, for him.

451
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,580
If that bastard's pains go away, then we all die.

452
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,040
Either he lives like this while covering it up, or instead of him, I remain alive. It's one or the other.

453
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,350
One more thing.

454
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,140
In that memory that Mr. Cha doesn't have,

455
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,400
but in that memory that only you have,

456
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,980
am I in there?

457
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,290
Am I? In there?

458
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,410
Answer me.

459
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,770
Who is it?

460
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,900
Ri On! How did you..?

461
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,570
-Where are we going right now?
-We're going home.

462
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,380
This is different than what you promised!

463
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,060
Back then, it was emotion. Right now, it's reason.

464
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,230
Hey! But right now, the timing isn't so good.

465
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,020
Because of me, a person's life can get ruined-

466
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,220
Hey! You treat me roughly these days! Do you want to die?

467
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,380
Don't move!

468
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,130
If you move a step from here,

469
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,930
then I'm going to tell everyone in I-D Entertainment that Cha Do Hyun has D.I.D.

470
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,320
Hey..you..

471
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,400
You..how did you know that?

472
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,170
I understood you lying to your parents, and I also understood that you were alone with a man.

473
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,800
But this is a different story.

474
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,990
I can't leave you in harm's way, so listen to your brother.

475
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,080
Are you even her real brother?

476
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:32,150
Stay right here. What I said earlier wasn't a threat. It was a declaration of war.

477
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,910
Ri On! Oh Ri On..

478
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,200
-Cha Do Hyun?
-Let's just say I am.

479
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,790
Why are you kidnapping her? With who's permission?

480
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,020
Are you not Cha Do Hyun?

481
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,790
Cha Do Hyun, this bastard. How many people has he been caught by?

482
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:13,090
-I don't know who you are but I am taking my sister back.
-With who's permission?

483
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,410
Whatever the penalty is for breaking the contract, I will provide.

484
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,080
With what right?

485
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:25,180
For further negotiations, I will continue with Cha Do Hyun later.

486
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm asking you. With what rights are you taking her?

487
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,550
Rights as a brother.

488
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,320
If you continue to claim rights as her brother while having eyes of a man, I'll take your eyeballs out.

489
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,060
Then you yourself have less of a right than me, because you are

490
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,200
a son of Seungjin Group.

491
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,400
Hey. What did you tell Mr. Shin?

492
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,980
What did you tell him that makes him look so sad?

493
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:36,730
Shut your mouth. Are we going to picnic? You're going to get punished right now.

494
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:45,900
♫The deep night shows you who was not able to leave ♫

495
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:53,380
♫It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again♫

496
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,410
Then, you yourself have less of a right than me. Because you are

497
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,250
a son of Seungjin Group.

498
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:08,050
♫echoes in my ears every day
Where are you?♫

499
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:19,530
[Ssangli]

500
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,090
Tell them so that they don't get shocked and beg for forgiveness no matter what.

501
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:45,340
And tell them you'll stop being his physician right away.

502
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,720
Also,

503
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,480
don't mention his name,

504
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,780
or Seungjin Goup either.

505
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,780
-Why?
-Don't ask for reasons!

506
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,280
Just do as your brother tells you to do.

507
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,420
What's wrong with him?

508
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,890
When I first saw Dr. Oh, I knew it right away.

509
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,760
She's definitely worth something!

510
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,920
That's right, that's right.

511
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,310
Dr. Oh.

512
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,300
Professor!

513
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,340
Ri Jin!

514
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,760
Why are you here?

515
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,050
It was like that?

516
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,710
She says that's what happened.

517
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,090
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to lie to you from the beginning.

518
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,730
This girl! How dare you lie about that out of all things to lie about?

519
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,000
I should just-

520
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,090
Mom! Wait a minute!

521
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,350
Professor is here too! Can't you save my social dignity a bit too?

522
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,410
You little wench! What good did you do?

523
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm sorry but I can't take your side on this.

524
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,920
Everybody, calm down.

525
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,270
Wow, I wondered what Dr. Oh ate as a child to become this strong like a warrior.

526
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,780
I guess it was genetics.

527
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,170
You also knew it, Professor?

528
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,630
That Ri Jin didn't go to America and was hanging around as a physician?

529
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,940
You, really! Why are you being like that to the professor?

530
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,700
There is no way that the professor knew and wouldn't tell us.... would you?

531
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,950
I'm sorry.

532
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:23,670
Why didn't you say a word to us until now? You're too much.

533
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
The professor only figured it out yesterday.

534
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,210
And it was me that kicked away a good opportunity that he requested.

535
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,050
Hey you. Have we ever belittled and opposed your decisions?

536
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,300
Why didn't you tell us truthfully?

537
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,090
What is family? We cherish, trust, and understand each other, that's what family is.

538
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,020
The reason why Dr. Oh couldn't tell you..... is so that she could keep the patient's secret.

539
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,630
She did something that she should as a doctor.

540
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,880
I am very embarrassed in front of Dr. Oh.

541
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,190
Professor...

542
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,630
A doctor shouldn't turn a blind eye to a patient who needs his or her help.

543
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,480
I convinced her so that she would turn away from the patient and choose studying abroad instead.

544
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,840
But even then, Dr. Oh followed her conscience as a doctor and chose the patient.

545
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,300
I learned a lot this time from Dr. Oh.

546
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,840
So please just forgive her now.

547
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,300
Please do me a favor.

548
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,340
There's nothing to forgive.

549
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,600
Sit down, sit down.

550
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,550
Sit down.

551
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,000
Here...

552
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,840
Welcome back.

553
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,750
What is it that the chaebols are trying to hide?

554
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,850
Disputes amongst the chaebol families and reconcilement.

555
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,060
Seungjin Group's Chairman Cha Geon Ho and his daughter-in-law Min Seo Yeon die in a car crash.

556
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,600
So you didn't only live happily up till now.

557
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,250
Seeing..

558
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,250
that your heart has been broken into pieces.

559
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,590
Professor, are you going to eat the sweet potato?

560
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,610
No, its not even cooked all the way yet.

561
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,770
This is good.

562
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,420
Uh...have some coffee.

563
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,740
Earlier... thank you, Professor.

564
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:59,250
It's nothing, in all reality I have some responsibility over this.

565
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,400
From the beginning Mr. Cha was my patient,

566
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,350
but I feel like I put the burden on your shoulders.

567
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,300
So I wasn't feeling too well.

568
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,380
I heard from Secretary Ahn

569
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,950
that Mr. Cha isn't coming back.

570
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:22,060
Yes, according to Se Gi, the memory seal broke so he hid.

571
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,460
That most likely he will never come back again.

572
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,360
The seal of the memory broke...

573
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,710
Do you have a gist of what that means?

574
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,270
I really don't know.

575
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,840
But... the last nightmare that Mr. Cha had

576
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,400
might be the hook to find what that memory is.

577
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,710
It's only a guess.

578
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm worried.

579
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,350
If Cha Do Hyun really doesn't come back

580
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,330
if he never wakes up...

581
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,250
What should I do?

582
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,630
At the same time the memory seal broke,

583
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:06,590
what if there was a negotiation?

584
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,630
He might come back as a stronger person.

585
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:14,400
Then, right now, Cha Do Hyun...

586
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,600
Either gets overpowered by Se Gi,

587
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,670
or will come stronger than before. It will be one or the other.

588
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:30,460
The most important thing is how he will deal with his pain in his past memories.

589
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,130
As of now, all we can do is trust Mr. Cha and wait.

590
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,000
Are you there Cha Do Hyun?

591
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,710
What do you think?

592
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,310
Don't you think it's time you deal with the past?

593
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,630
The people that made you a monster,

594
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,070
you can't just leave them be, can you?

595
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,840
What do you want to do?

596
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,110
I'll do it? No... or You?

597
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,250
If you want to do it, come out.

598
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,340
You can't?

599
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,550
If you want to stop me, then come out.

600
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:07,300
You can't, can you?

601
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,670
Then just stay there crumpled like that and never come back out!

602
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,870
Either way,

603
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:20,600
a world that's hard for you to handle will be created.

604
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,340
Long time, no see, Grandma.

605
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,750
What are you trying to do?

606
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,520
Like a night robber, making no sound.

607
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,340
All I did was follow what you told me to do.

608
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,420
You seem very surprised.

609
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,170
What are you saying?

610
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:05,280
You said to live quietly as if I wasn't here.

611
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,960
And if I can, not to appear in others' sight.

612
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,380
What I saw, or heard, or experienced...

613
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,590
as if I have nothing, quietly.

614
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,980
You don't remember?

615
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:23,540
You!

616
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,900
Why?

617
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:36,130
You thought that I lost all of my childhood memories.

618
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,400
Are you surprised?

619
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:43,650
I wonder why everyone believes that I lost my memories?

620
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,270
As if they hope for me to.

621
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,550
What do you want to say?

622
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,130
Seungjin Group, give it to me, Grandmother.

623
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,840
What? Give you what?

624
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,800
Seungjin Group...

625
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,300
Did you hold hands with your mother?

626
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,000
Did you go on the same side as her and decide to threaten me together?

627
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,130
Rather than a threat, it's a request.

628
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,960
If you feel fear when asked of a request,

629
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,230
that's what a threat is.

630
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:30,780
Because fear is something you make yourself.

631
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,060
Leave now.

632
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,960
Before others wake up.

633
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,370
You must still

634
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,250
be waiting for father to wake up.

635
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,250
Have you still not let go of him yet?

636
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:33,550
How dare you... How dare you!

637
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,800
That lingering affection...

638
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,760
shall I end it for you?

639
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,880
Shall I end it for you?

01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,940
Hello, Cha Joon Pyo.

641
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,830
No, I will just call you father.

642
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,560
It doesn't seem you were that well.

643
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,330
So that time,

644
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,460
you shouldn't have saved me.

645
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,250
The reason I became a monster, is probably because of you.

646
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
I...

647
01:00:56,410 --> 01:01:02,800
should now let you rest in peace.

648
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,880
Why did you disturb me?

649
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,800
Do you know how hard it was for me?

650
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,960
Our father..
