Episode 1

12
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,340
The world is so unfair.

13
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,930
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

14
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,690
When I first saw you,

15
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,500
I thought that you were either a Christian, Mormon, or Amish.

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,610
I even put $100 in to say that you were a Mormon.

17
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,700
Did I look like I have been filled with the Holy Spirit?

18
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,420
That's not what I mean.

19
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,230
You are such an exemplary, austere and honest person.

20
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,490
[Fall of 2004, America]
Above all that, you are also good at football. This is unreal.

21
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,870
I'm asking because I'm sincerely curious.

22
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,610
Is living like this really not tiring for you?

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,040
Living like this?

24
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,690
How do I live?

25

[Save the Africa Club]
Do Hyeon, I saw your special column in the school's newspaper.

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,360
It was great. We have sent goats to Africa.

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,700

Thanks for your offer. I will have a look at it.

35
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,350
Thanks for your offer. I will have a look at it.

36
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,930
Can't you really feel how you being so exemplary

37
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,630
austere and worldly nice is bringing harm to others?

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,340
To our school's minority and nerds, you are

39
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,960
a person like Mahatma Gandhi.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,830
Hi, Do Hyeon.

41
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,740
Hi, Abby.

42
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,030
What now? Are you joining a farming association this time?

43
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,200
She is Abigail, who was in the student union with me.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,110
What's up, Abby?

45
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,230
Will you pass this on to Jennifer on your way home?

46
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,970
It's the agenda for the student union meeting next week.

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,150
You can do it yourself!

48
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,140
But I've lost all contact with her and she has been absent from school for several weeks.

49
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,300
Please, Do Hyeon.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Okay.

51
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,490
So rude. Don't do it for her.

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,680
It's okay. It's on my way anyway.

53
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,520
You bitch! I hate you!

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,230
You gotta learn some respect!

55
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,900
If you say more of this... one more time...!

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,260
-Jennifer!
-You gotta learn some respect, huh?!

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,710
Get up! You bitch!

58
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,520
Stop! Stop! Stop!

59
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,670
The fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?!

60
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,310
What is this? What is this exactly?

61
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,910
Jennifer, call the police.

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,360
-You! Huh?
-Police!

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,140
Stop right here.

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,440
The neighbors made a complaint.

65
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,600
Did your father hit you?

66
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,540
Did he hit you?

67
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,890
He assaulted us first.

68
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,070
Jennifer.

69
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,550
My father found me.

70
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,570
He hit me.

71
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,350
Let's go outside.

72
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,380
Jennifer.

73
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,790
Why are you lying?

74
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,970
Tell the truth, Jennifer. You'll never get out of this hell.

75
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,070
Jennifer. Jennifer!

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
No one is available to take your call.

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Please leave a message after the tone.

78
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,470
This is Secretary Ahn.

79
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,090
I just got a call from our lawyer.

80
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,310
They said you trespassed and committed an act of violence.
What in the world happened?

81
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,210
Thankfully the Chairwoman and Madam Shin don't know about this yet.

82
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,200
Good timing. I'm on a business trip in San Francisco.

83
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,090
I'm going to fly tonight to visit you. I'll listen to the full story then.

Look at me.

98
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,880
If you ever touch her again, I will come back

99
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,850
and break every single piece of your bones.

100
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,350
Thank you.

101
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,300
It's Secretary Ahn.

102
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,670
Are you not in here?

103
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,410
Is he in the bathroom?

104
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,350
Oh my, how did this happen?

105
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,810
Secretary Ahn, please help me.

106
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,250
Yes. Yes. You have to tell me what happened for me to be able to...

107
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,150
What should I do?

108
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,900
I don't remember anything...

109
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,490
I first realized it then.

110
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,760
The fact that there was a monster living inside of me.

111
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,850
His name is Shin Se Gi.

112
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,550
He's the same age as me.

113
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,930
When he appears, the area around him becomes a bloodbath.

114
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,360
America, 2014
Ah...

115
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,600
Don't be worried.

116
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,230
He only uses violence when he is mad. Fortunately,

117
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,980
he would never be violent towards little kids or women.

118
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,850
Please continue.

119
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,500
He appears without my permission and steals and uses my time and my body.

120
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,210
But unfortunately, because he steals my body and time,

121
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,210
I can't remember the things that have happened.

122
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,350
So sometimes...

123
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,210
Mors Sola.
(Mors in Latin- "death", Sola/Solus in Latin- "alone")

124
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,920
What the f***? What's going on?

125
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,390
I end up at places I don't recognize.

126
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,240
And a person that I don't know recognizes me.

127
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,600
Hello.

128
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,750
You look gentle today.

129
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,310
What?

130
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,800
I like when you're sexy like you were yesterday though.

131
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,750
Um... Excuse me, but who are you?

132
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,560
Sometimes, because of something I didn't do, I have to deal with terrifying consequences.

133
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,820
Do you recognize

134
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,960
what your symptoms means?

135
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,700
Of course, I do.

136
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,940
I already got a diagnosis from my physician, Dr. Scofield, four years ago.

137
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,060
D.I.D.
(Dissociative Identity Disorder a.k.a Multiple personality disorder.)

138
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,120
People commonly call it Multiple Personality Disorder.

139
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,860
-How many people?
-Yes?

140
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,750
S-so how many people live inside of you, Mr. Cha?

141
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,550
From what I can remember of the ones who've appeared;

142
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,020
there's the cruel personality Se Gi,

143
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,790
Perry Park, who is skilled at making hand-made bombs,

144
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,320
Yo Sub, who tries to kill himself countless times...

145
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,690
Doctor.

146
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm sorry. I don't think I have the ability to treat you.

147
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,580
Doctor! You said you've treated people with D.I.D. before.

148
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,300
It's a lie. It's definitely a lie.

149
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,920
Wait, Doctor!

150
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,550
Don't come near me. Please, I'm scared.

151
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,360
Doctor!

152
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,320
I'm not sure how many people are living inside of me.

153
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,040
I don't know if more personalities will show themselves in the future.

154
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,530
Kill Me, Heal Me

155
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,090
Way to go, Soldier.

156
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,740
Yes, sir.

157
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,460
How come you're here without contacting me?

158
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,920
I wanted to see you,

159
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,270
and I came to tell you the Chairwoman's orders.

160
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,300
What did Grandma want?

161
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,200
She wants you to finish things completely here and for you to come back to Korea as soon as possible.

162
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,230
You know it as well as I do.

163
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,050
My treatment isn't over yet.

164
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,860
Can it be hidden?

165
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,430
If I told Grandmother and Mother the truth, would they understand?

166
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,780
That would be impossible.

167
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,860
So I can't go.

168
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,870
Not in the monstrous state I'm in now.

169
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
The Omega 3 Murder Case

170
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh my...

171
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,040
Excuse me. Where is this plane going?

172
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,140
Passengers, this plane will soon land at Incheon Terminal Airport.

173
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,580
We're almost there.

174
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,330
We are now making our final...

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,170
Please don't use your cellphone before we land.

176
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,020
They said you can't?

177
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,040
Then you can use mine. Isn't this first class?

178
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,280
Then you can't use mine either. I'm so stupid.

179
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm so funny, aren't I?

180
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,600
How do you feel about stepping into your country after eleven years, friend?

181
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,280
Look here, look here.

182
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Don't look at me with those eyes.

183
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,380
A man must have ambition. Don't you want to be the owner of Seung Jin Group?

184
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,470
I already sent all your things over.

185
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,820
When you arrive, look after my things well.

186
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,830
Your style...

187
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,000
is really the worst.

188
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,990
I'm not Omega, the writer.

189
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,740
No, I told you already! I'm going to catch that writer Omega or Oscar today...

190
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,620
So please don't call me, please!

191
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,900
Oh Ri Oh! You're dead meat today!

192
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm asking for a booking.

193
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,570
Yes., a plane ticket to New York. It doesn't matter if it's business or economy class.

194
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,650
Just get the quickest...

195
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,950
The Chairwoman has sent a car for you. We will escort you outside.

196
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,070
Hey!

197
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,660
Excuse me, but who are you?

198
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,220
Come out while I'm speaking nicely.

199
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm already out here, so how much farther out should I go?

200
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,230
Come here, come here! You're dead today, come here!

201
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,750
Do you know how much I went through because of you?

202
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,260
Hey, my phone got flooded with countless phone calls from reporters.

203
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,930
Because of that, I couldn't stay at the hospital!

204
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,770
How bad do you think it was I had to come to you after you ran away?! Come here!

205
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,750
Save me, please help me! Ah!

206
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,860
Ex-Excuse me, please calm down.

207
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,600
I don't know what's going on, but I think it would be better to talk it over...

208
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,330
-Then move if you don't know!
- Ah, yes.

209
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,650
Wait, why are you moving just because she said so?
A person's life is at stake here!

210
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,260
Come here! Come here!

211
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,200
Little sis, can we talk after you let this go? Let go first. Violence isn't a good thing.

212
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,250
Until when are you going to use my name to live off of?

213
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,080
While we're at it, let's just reveal your identity here.

214
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,450
Everyone! This person here is anonymous writer, Omega-

215
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,930
Omona! Omona! What to do?!

216
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,790
What to do! I'm sorry!

217
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,410
I'm sorry! My sister is really sick... here.

218
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,690
She's really sick... here! Sister...

219
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,560
Oppa will take you to the hospital. Let's go.

220
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,000
- Alright, alright.
- Hey!

221
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,510
Ah!

222
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,600
Are you alright?

223
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm alright.

224
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,360
♫ There's too much of myself inside of me, yeah♫

225
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,570
♫ Leaving you no place to rest~♫

226
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,430
♫ Ri Jin~♫

227
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,300
- You must be feeling great, huh? Good for you!
-Hey!

228
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,360
Do you have multiple personalities?

229
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,030
Hey, how could you say it like that... You think I'd be able to write in a house where two people have to go to a psychiatric hospital all the time?

230
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,790
How long are you going to be a mystery writer and use your family as your replacement?

231
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,300
Mysticism is my identity.

232
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,660
Thanks to that, I got best-seller recognition and became rich through my copyrights;

233
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,890
I can even go travel on first class for my business trips.

234
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,470
It allowed me to become a cool brother. Just be satisfied, you brat.

235
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,090
Then you should have named your pen name well!

236
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,030
You have such a good name, and yet, what the heck is Omega? So embarrassing!

237
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,730
It's very transparent and clear.

238
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,280
I adore Omega-3 so much.

239
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,200
-Hey!
-Hey?

240
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,080
This brat, why are you referring to your older brother as "hey"? You have no sense of the fundamentals.

241
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,420
Do you think we're the Royal family to mind the fundamentals here?

242
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,050
It would be a big problem if we were born to the Royal family.

243
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,260
The twins were symbols of grave misfortune to the Royal family during the Joseon dynasty.

244
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,560
If we were born in the royal family,

245
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,140
between the two of us, one would be sent away to a court lady or an eunuch,

246
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,990
could have grown up as a Kanghwa young master (a nickname for a prince) or a Sanghwa maiden.

247
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,820
What I'm saying is you have to treat me well.

248
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,790
How can the conversation go towards that?

249
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,130
Do all stories start with, revolve around, and end with you?

250
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,120
Then would you be the Ganghwa maiden then?

251
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,140
If you look at visual and character, I'm perfect to become the Ganghwa young master.

252
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,730
You said that something big would have happened if we were royal.

253
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,360
What I'm saying is I could be a son of a rich family, you rascal.

254
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,150
-Go! Go! To your house! Please go!
-I'm driving right now!

255
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,880
-Leave! Please just leave! Please just go!
-Hey, I'm in the middle of driving, you brat!

256
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,390
-I said leave! Aigoo!
-I'm driving!

257
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
Aigoo.

258
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,540
Let's go. Let's go into the hospital.

259
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Aigoo, aigoo...

260
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,230
Even if the hospital life gets exhausting, I hope you'll be able to bear through it.

261
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,040
Don't forget that we're always together in our hearts.

262
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,130
Let go of the thought that we're together,

263
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,510
and just don't make the reporters call me!

264
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,500
Don't look at me like that!

265
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Can a psychiatrist fix your habit of holding grudges for a long time?

266
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,000
Oppa is sorry, Oppa is sorry.

267
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
Aish!

268
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,060
It's a relief that you're healthy!

269
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,080
It's a relief.

270
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,610
Just do well yourself.

271
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,910
Driver Kim! Turn the car around!

272
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,820
Hey, that hurts! Hey! Do you think this is

273
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,070
a roller coaster!

274
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,270
I said let go of me!

275
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,830
Omo, Ahjusshi!

276
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,920
You're here again. You're here again.

277
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,650
Is it you again? Did you get dragged here, too?

278
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,220
You know me, right?

279
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,330
Hurry, hurry! I said to turn the car around!

280
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,510
Aigoo, this very handsome man.

281
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,960
You've become stressed. Who did this to you?

282
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,600
- I will scold that person!
- Is it my fault that I'm handsome?

283
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,510
Of course, it is! Being handsome is tiring!

284
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,590
He is an alcohol-dependent patient. He could be irritable and could act out very strongly, so I ask you to sedate him first.

285
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,250
What? Put me on death penalty?

286
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,250
You can't do that to me!

287
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,240
Hey! l have all the power in Korea!

288
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,250
Is this the emergency room? Huh?

289
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,630
Hey! Turn the car around!

290
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,570
Psychiatrist
Oh Ri Jin

291
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,880
Don't come near me!

292
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
Don't come near me!

293
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,730
Aigoo, what's wrong again, Ahjusshi?

294
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,690
Here! That one, give it to me.

295
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,130
Why are you always butting in?

296
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,090
I still can't tell if you're a doctor

297
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,260
or a patient!

298
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm not going to let you go. If you come any closer, I'll...

299
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,060
Ah!

300
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,040
I got it, I got it! Let's do that thing with your stomach later

301
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,700
so put that down first and then talk.

302
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,300
If you listen to me,

303
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,500
I'll buy you some alcohol, okay?

304
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,990
I know a place with really great rice wine.

305
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,370
While you drink some alcohol,

306
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,310
tell me what's been giving you a hard time. I'll listen to all of it.

307
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,310
When you got discharged, you told me

308
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,820
that you wanted to quit alcohol and start over again.

309
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Drink one last drink with me

310
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,320
and release all of the grudges and anger in your heart. Okay?

311
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,850
Ah! Ahh!

312
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,800
Oh!

313
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,570
Here...

314
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,330
Give me Ativan and Haldol, hurry!
(Ativan: benzodiazepine for anxiety and tension)

315
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,150
Ahjusshi, wait a minute.

316
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,600
What are you doing?

317
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,150
Here...

318
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,570
Okay, please restrain him. After putting him in seclusion,

319
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,630
please check his vital signs in one-hour interval.

320
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,890
Yes. I understand.

321
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,850
Ahjusshi, don't worry. I'll buy you some rice wine, okay?

322
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,310
Yes. Please give it to me.

323
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,590
You're cool, little sis.

324
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,130
♫ There's too much of myself inside of me ♫

325
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,240
Please give me some food!

326
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,280
♫ My battery is out of juice ♫ 
(from the song "Love Battery")

327
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,900
Aigoo...

328
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,050
My USB cable...

329
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,920
Where are you... where are you~

330
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,730
Where are you~

331
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,670
Seung Jin Group's successor was miraculously rescued...

332
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll give you some food. (Talking to the phone)

333
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,270
You're here?

334
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,850
Mother!

335
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,690
Mother!

336
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,840
Where did you put him this time?

337
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,860
Where have you hidden him?

338
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,260
It's already been twenty-one years since you've hidden him under your skirt.

339
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,820
It's not like he's a horse on a chessboard.

340
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,040
Do you think someone unconscious will get better if you move him around like that?

341
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,130
Mother! Really, it's not the first or second time, what's wrong with you?!

342
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,360
You move him when I look round everywhere

343
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,220
to find what nursing home he is staying in.

344
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,070
When I finally find him again, you find out somehow and move him again.

345
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,110
Why do you keep making me waste my efforts?

346
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,270
Where in the world did you learn to talk like that?

347
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,970
You can't talk unless it's vulgar, huh?

348
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,910
Yes.

349
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,690
I am vulgar and mean.

350
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,720
So, please say it.

351
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,570
Even if everyone else doesn't know,

352
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,750
I deserve to know.

353
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
Who the hell are you?

354
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,890
-Mother!
-What right do you have to be so proud?

355
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,250
Do you have a family register or a child?

356
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,960
What are you trusting in that makes you more audacious and shameless as time goes by?

357
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,550
I... I...

358
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,830
Why don't I have a son?

359
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,580
Our Do Hyun, Joon Pyo's son, your grandson,

360
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,750
Seung Jin's only successor,

361
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,100
Cha Do Hyun. He came from my stomach!

362
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,760
What the heck are you implying?

363
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,320
How many times do I have to tell you that he is not your child?!

364
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,610
Are you still holding on to that already severed relationship with him?

365
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:02,490
- Do Hyun!
- Son!

366
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
When did you arrive?

367
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,070
Look at his haggard face.

368
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,250
This makes me really upset.

369
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,430
Ah, my son.

370
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,200
You like this steam dish, right? Hurry, eat up.

371
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,930
This is from a good catch this time.

372
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,770
- Please eat. I'll eat by myself.
- Hey, hurry up and eat!

373
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,690
You did make a fairly large-scale bet.

374
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,800
As a requirement for coming back, you said that you want to be the president of Seung Jin Group.

375
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,670
A man must have ambition. Don't you want to become the owner of Seung Jin Group?

376
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,190
Having rash ambitions is never a good virtue. It's still too early for that.

377
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,430
Instead, I've issued to appoint you as the Vice-President of ID Entertainment;

378
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,760
so start from there.

379
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,590
- Chairwoman, I have something to tell you...
- If it's ID Entertainment,

380
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,310
Ki Joon is its President, right?

381
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,540
Are you telling me that my Do Hyun is to work under Ki Joon?

382
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,250
The first successor of Seung Jin Group?

383
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,020
I will pretend that you didn't demand for 5% of the company stocks.

384
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,780
But since you will work in the company,

385
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,840
we will transfer you 0.5% stocks every birthday.

386
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,360
It will happen once I talk with Lawyer Jeong.

387
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,940
- Chairwoman, please listen to what...
-It's not even 1%.

388
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,050
0.5% is too little. Our Do Hyun

389
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,310
is young. He should at least be in control of the stocks.

390
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,270
Only then will the directors seated in high positions listen to him.

391
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,550
I will accept your decision to become independent and live alone.

392
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:57,470
Become independent? Why does he have to move out of a perfectly fine house? That makes no sense.

393
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,540
He's been living overseas up until now, so what do you mean, moving out?

394
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,650
Who is the kid you're referring to?

395
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,740
From now on, he's the Vice President of a company.

396
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,880
I put the villa in Cheondamdong under your name.

397
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,270
Ask Secretary Ahn for anything that you need, and have him put them in the house.

398
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,070
According to your condition, you'll be summoned to the company next week;

399
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,740
so keep in mind that you're starting then after formally introducing yourself to the company.

400
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,100
I've asked people to put all the basic furniture and necessities you will need first.

401
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,460
If you tell me what you need as you get settled,

402
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,780
I will get it ready.

403
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,520
What are you thinking of doing from now on?

404
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,800
What do I need to do from now on?

405
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,090
I will help you no matter what you choose.

406
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,760
- Se Gi made too much trouble for me to return to America.
- Yes.

407
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,960
He personally made a deal with the Chairwoman's Chief Secretary through a video call.

408
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,670
I had no choice but to lie to them since they don't know.

409
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Can I hide it?

410
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,080
All you have to do is hide it and I will find a way.

411
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,080
I've been getting treated for eleven years, but absolutely nothing has changed.

412
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,060
- Is there even a way to find out in the first place?
- Until it is found, I will look for it.

413
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,280
Ki Joon Hyung

414
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah, Ki Joon hyung.

415
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,190
You brat. I heard you were back in Korea; how come you didn't even call me?

416
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,050
I'm sorry. I went straight to the mansion and meet the Chairwoman first...

417
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,030
- I'm just now catching my breath.
-Y ou don't have plans for dinner tonight, right?

418
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,630
What do you mean why? We should have a drink. It's been a while.

419
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
I will send you the address.

420
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,820
Okay, I'll see you later.

421
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,880
His voice is still the same.

422
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,540
That naive character like he doesn't care about the world.

423
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,210
He wanted my position as a requirement for coming back.

424
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,170
He probably really hated returning to Korea.

425
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,650
A rascal who hid his tail and pulled back his ears like a dog when it came to Grandmother...

426
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,900
- Be on your guard.
- Do I have to?

427
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,710
Even if you're born out of wedlock, you're still definitely in the running to become the Group's successor.

428
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,840
Keep an eye out for him from the very start. After all, he'll be working under you.

429
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,430
Ah, is that what it means?

430
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,010
And here I thought it's a deep thought from the elders to keep the strong bond between us cousins.

431
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,920
Don't look at him as easy and find his weakness.

432
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,710
There would come a time when that weakness will become of importance to us.

433
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,870
He will try to find out your weakness.

434
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,100
He has a power to find anything he wants to.

435
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,270
In this kind of situation...

436
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,840
being admitted to the hospital to get treated is dangerous.

437
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,480
That's why I'm asking this of you, Secretary Ahn.

438
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,810
Can you look for Dr. Scofield?

439
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:52,540
- Are you talking about the doctor that treated your disorder when you were in America?
- Yes.

440
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,830
He will definitely have a way to help me.

441
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,940
[He's Dr. Scofield in the US. Seok Ho Pil is the Koreanized name for 'Prison Break' character, Scofield.]

442
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,910
- Doctor Oh, give me a report.
- Yes, sir.

443
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:09,080
Patient Heok Suk Hee, 26 years old, woman, is suffering from grandiose delusion resulting from bipolar disorder.

444
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,980
She was admitted to our hospital five weeks ago. She is currently undergoing D.T (drug therapy) and G.T (group therapy).

445
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,170
Her grandiose delusion is caused not by schizophrenia, but bipolar disorder? What's the reason for the DDX (differential diagnosis)?

446
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,710
Yes. According to clinical observations, her G.D arose from an abnormal elevation feeling of her thoughts and actions.

447
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,890
Other than that, there was no auditory hallucinations that appear on schizophrenic patients.

448
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,310
After prescribing her lithium for 4 weeks, on the results of the follow-up,

449
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,840
she showed improvements both on her insomnia and hyperactivity.

450
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,480
Okay. Then let's have a look.

451
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,410
Ms. Heo Suk Hee?

452
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,250
Ms. Heo Suk Hee?

453
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,880
Ms. Heo Suk Hee?

454
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,380
Ms. Heo...

455
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,030
What is this? What happened?

456
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,580
-Hurry up and read it.
-Okay. This place does not suit me.

457
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,390
I'm leaving for a paradise where I only converse

458
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,330
through vibrating music, shining lights, and dance.

459
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,450
- Please do not look for me.
- What?

460
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,920
Is it a suicde note? Or did she escape?

461
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,190
Hey, Doctor Oh. How in the world are you taking care of your patients?

462
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,210
Look for her right now. Immediately!
Professor!

463
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,740
PARADISE CLUB

464
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,920
I'll be around the area. If something happens, please get in touch with me right away.

465
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,470
Ah, and you definitely must not drink alcohol.

466
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,310
Three-two-one! GO!

467
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,200
Come in.

468
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,760
I see your "model student" clothing style is still the same.

469
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,810
Alright! This gentleman here is Vice-President Cha Do Hyun,

470
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,500
who will be working with us at ID Entertainment starting next week.

471
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,770
These are all our employees of ID Entertainment's Art Team, who will be working on film production.

472
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,620
- Hello!
- Nice to meet you!

473
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,770
Nice to meet you.

474
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,420
Alright, you have us two of here now who will gladly foot the bill, so please enjoy to your heart's content.

475
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,680
But you guys have to pay back with amazing results at work.

476
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,380
Thank you!

477
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,070
Sit down. You should have one glass.

478
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,280
What the heck? Shouldn't you have told me in advance that I would be in this kind of place?

479
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,340
If I told you, then what?

480
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,320
You would have to get your hair and outfit concept from professionals.

481
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,160
And you have to get a manner consultant and learn manners.

482
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,930
Are you planning to just give greetings all night like that?

483
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,070
If someone heard you, they'd think that's true.

484
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,000
But it's true.

485
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,150
You think I don't know you? To be fair, you can't live however you like under the Chairwoman's watchful eyes.

486
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,110
The tough spot you'll be put in if you lose the Chairwoman's favor.

487
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,540
Here, drink this.

488
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,820
Such a good student.

489
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,680
By the way... isn't it the right thing to at least let me know what kind of place it would be?

490
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,280
Yes, we have to follow that at least.

491
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,430
There were some changes in our company.

492
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,150
The Art Team Leader, who we had tried to recruit,

493
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,970
and our Vice President that appeared without a warning.

494
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,720
To put it, it's a welcome party for you and the Art Team Leader for returning to Korea and starting work.

495
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,680
- Art Team Leader?
- Yes, she's in the powder room right now.

496
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,970
She's a complete beauty.

497
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,090
She's here. Our recruit.

498
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,080
Hey, no mistake? Are you sure? You're not writing a novel again, right?

499
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,650
I told you it's unmistakeable!

500
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,780
I'm telling you! It's a place where I did business in for a whopping 7 years!

501
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,380
Hey, the President's nickname

502
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,620
is the "Chief Grissom of Location-tracking"!
(a nod to Gil Grissom of CSI)

503
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,590
Isn't that right, boss?

504
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,350
She's here, she's here. The culprit...

505
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,820
Ah, that's right. Ms. Heo Suk Hee... What?

506
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,600
This? She's inside the hospital room.

507
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,260
Heo Suk Hee

508
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,890
But I'm still hung up on that word "Paradise."

509
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,290
It would be hard to exist in this world. Would it be a last will then?

510
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,100
Trying to locate my phone is a no-no. Please let me go to Paradise.

511
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,020
A VIP free-tasting event for the thirtieth anniversary of Moderato, the great master of whiskey.
-Club Paradise in Cheongdamdong-

512
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,690
It exists! There's a place in this world called Paradise!

513
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,040
It's in Cheongdamdong, Gangnam.

514
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,050
Wow, I'm going crazy.

515
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,660
You did that on purpose, even though you knew Ji Sun liked you?

516
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,240
If it's Ji Sun... Myung Seong Group's 2nd daughter?

517
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,930
I think you two would look good together. Why not?

518
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,840
Isn't that right? Don't they look like model boarding students from Britain?

519
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,420
Harry Potter and Hermione, who went to a prestige school, Hogwarts?

520
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,080
That's perfect, just perfect.

521
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,170
Anyways, she asked me first, so I created a chance for them to meet, but

522
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,290
he didn't come out straight to the end.

523
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:28,970
I had to return the bag I received as a present, although I really liked it.

524
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,360
Will you get drunk like that?

525
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,400
Come to think of it, you, who are warm to other things, are overly cold when it comes to women problems.

526
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,220
If it's Myung Seong Group's 2nd daughter, then she isn't that bad.

527
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,090
I don't really have any good feelings towards her, and I don't think there would be any in the future either.

528
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,150
Giving her false hope is being ill-mannered.

529
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,380
You have the heart but you can't confess. But then your heart also can't cleanly forget about it.

530
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,470
So that's why you only keep cowardly sneaking glances at her.

531
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,550
Wouldn't that be considered worse?

532
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,800
What is this? There's a woman that Do Hyun can't forget cleanly?

533
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,700
Why are you asking me that? You should ask him.

534
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,600
Is there?

535
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,970
Really? Who is it?

536
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,480
Ah, you're still here like this?

537
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,290
Come out!

538
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,070
Right now, they keep asking for you to show your dancing skills, Team Leader.

539
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,330
- Shall we go, too, President?
- Let's go.

540
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,520
Yes.

541
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,990
You, too, Vice President.
- Let's go.

542
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,950
Hello?

543
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,550
Oh, Chae Yeon.

544
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,830
Christmas Day?

545
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,060
Oh, I think it'll be alright. Alright.

546
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,800
Sure, I'll see you then.

547
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,540
You must be very lonely!

548
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,920
What?

549
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,270
I've been watching you since earlier.

550
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,280
You're a person who has very deep scars in his heart.

551
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,520
Feel it. The feeling that you're all alone in this world.

552
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,130
The feeling that you're not yourself.

553
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,100
The feeling that there are a lot of yourselves inside of you.

554
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,090
That scary feeling of not knowing when the violent me is going to come out of myself.

555
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,560
I know that feeling!

556
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,010
Heo Sook Hee

557
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:26,930
That's right! I'm a psychiatrist.

558
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,730
If you need someone to talk to, I'm always...

559
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,380
Thank you, but I'm going to politely reject this.

560
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,000
Please help me!

561
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,300
What's the matter?

562
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,430
That's my patient!

563
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,630
She escaped from the hospital, and I think she's trying to follow me.

564
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,400
My little sister is very sick! She's very sick up here.

565
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,440
I couldn't stay at the hospital anymore! Do you think I would have escaped from the hospital to come find you?! Huh?!

566
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,460
Until I go outside and call an ambulance, please hold onto her until then. I'll ask of you this favor.

567
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,450
W-wait a minute.

568
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,760
She's a very~ dangerous woman. She's a megalomaniac.

569
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Oh?

570
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,270
(Mouthing)
Hey! You!

571
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,660
Ms. Heo Seok Hee!

572
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,400
-What is it?
-Wait. Please wait here.

573
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,670
What are you trying to do now? That woman is my patient.

574
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,080
She escaped from the hospital ward without permission!

575
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,530
She's going to tell you that I'm a runaway patient for sure.

576
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,460
Of course, she'll probably claim that she's a doctor.

577
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,850
I am the doctor in-charge of that patient!

578
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,980
She is delusional. Don't believe her.

579
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,670
Move!

580
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,260
You're really not going to move?

581
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,250
Come to your senses! Please calm down!

582
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,180
Listen to what I have to say.

583
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,970
Move! Move! Do you not hear me say move!

584
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,770
Seriously, get out of the way!

585
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,470
Excuse me.

586
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,100
Are you okay?

587
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,700
Excuse me.

588
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,240
That's why you should have moved when I told you to move.

589
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,300
Hey...

590
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,870
No, it can't...

591
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,250
Ki Joon hyung is here.

592
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,240
Ah, that scared me.

593
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,700
What is this? Ah, damn it.

594
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,770
What is up with these clothes?

595
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,610
This...

596
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,100
Hey, because of you my makeup is all ruined!

597
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,130
Ah, that tickles.

598
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,300
This looks like my style.

599
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:54,210
I'm already bored and tired, and it didn't even start yet.

600
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,910
Where did Do Hyun go?

601
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,930
I don't know. Maybe the furnace?

602
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,490
What is that? The name of a bar?

603
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,160
It's a place where well-behaved cats go up first.

604
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,310
He must be thinking of going up. He was even sexily shedding his fur.

605
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,710
Shedding his fur?

606
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,430
Where are you? Bring the kids and come over here right now!

607
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,260
Some bastard took my jacket and ran!

608
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,410
There's DoriDori in there!
[Slang for MDMA 'ecstasy']
- Let go!

609
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,360
Nobody can tie me down!

610
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,170
-Let go!
-Ms. Heo Seok Hee!

611
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,080
Hurry, take her up. One, two, three!

612
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,950
- Let go!
- Hurry, hurry.

613
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,490
Let go!

614
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,540
- We're leaving right now, so hurry up and get in, Doctor Oh.
- Yes.

615
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,120
Let go!

616
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,850
Doctor Park, you go first. I'll be right behind you.

617
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,700
Hey, hey! Oh Ri Jin!

618
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,910
Oh, it's you from earlier, right?

619
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,210
I'm sorry, I was in such a rush earlier. Are you okay?

620
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,090
When did you change your clothes?

621
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,150
Remember.

622
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,460
What?

623
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,900
January 7th, 2015 at 10 o'clock on the dot.

624
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,540
The time I fell for you.

625
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:56,580
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

626
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:02,620
Haha!
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

627
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,410
What?

628
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:13,980
What is this? What part of me did he see that he's saying he fell for me?

629
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,620
Move! Move! Ah, seriously! Move!

630
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:24,210
No way... He's not the type to say, "You're the first woman to treat me roughly", those kind of goosebump-inducing comments, right?

631
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,600
You're the first woman...

632
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,760
Don't. Please don't!

633
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,650
to treat me so roughly.

634
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,450
Ah, I'm sorry.

635
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:40,820
I'll act like I didn't hear that. I don't have the confidence to continue treating you roughly in the future.

636
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,340
Then...

637
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,780
What is it now?

638
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,420
Why did the genre change from romantic comedy to action?

639
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,290
Take it off.

640
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,940
What the? An erotic movie?

641
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,420
Try to take it off then.

642
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,010
Is it bromance? What is the genre, exactly?

643
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,700
Let's not uselessly fight right now, alright?

644
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,520
You can take your jacket off and bring it to me slowly.

645
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,210
Omo, you're so cool! Hurry up and take it off, okay?

646
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,160
Hurry up! I guess he likes your jacket.

647
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,190
I don't want to.

648
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,440
You don't want to? Why?

649
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,810
Is this leather jacket more precious than both our lives?

650
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,140
I guess we'll have to see some blood then.

651
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,930
That suggestion sounds good.

652
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,750
What! What in the world are you saying?

653
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,760
Take it off! Stop being clingy to it!

654
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,720
Looking at it, it's not even real leather. It's fake, fake!

655
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,620
Let's take it off, okay? Take it off!

656
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,790
Should we have a go then?

657
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,250
Huh?

658
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,570
Hey! Behind you!

659
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,620
Do you want more?

660
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,840
Yes!

661
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,230
Do you want more?

662
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,690
Are you ready?

663
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,420
Are you ready?

664
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,410
Two-one!

665
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,300
♫The things hidden inside of me have changed me a lot♫
