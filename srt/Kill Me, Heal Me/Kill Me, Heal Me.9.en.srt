1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,430
KILL ME!!

2
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,690
You want to comfort them, and you have something to say to them?

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,350
From now on, rather than "Kill me,"
ask to "Heal me" instead.

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,280
Even if that happens, you guys will not die.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,370
You guys will still be alive in here.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,130
Instead, you guys will no longer be scattered pieces.

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,280
But like connected puzzles, you will become a cooler picture.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,420
With the name of Cha Do Hyun, you guys

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,970
will become a cooler person.

10
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:15,050
♬ The deep night will show you, who was not able to leave ♬

11
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:22,540
♬It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

12
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:29,280
♬Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent♬

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,100
♬echoes in my ears every day, where are you?♬

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,940
Ri Jin?

15
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,670
So because that rich old man started making a fuss about money, you were forced to take a break?

16
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,500
He's not old...

17
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,530
Anyway, you're right.

18
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,990
Could it be that chaebol is Cha Do Hyun?

19
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,860
Kill Me, Heal Me

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
Episode 9

21
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,070
Patient Kang Min Woo, 32 years old, is being administered with _______.

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,570
Eh? What's this?

23
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,800
Where am I? Why am I here?

24
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,720
Wait. There's no guarantee that that was Mr. Cha.

25
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,410
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

26
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,980
Even if it WAS Cha Do Huyn...

27
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,820
Cha Do Hyun was drunk for the first time in a while.

28
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,840
And his film (memory) could have been cut.

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,770
Then he has a chance of not remembering, either.

30
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,950
[Lust]

31
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,720
[Lust]

32
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,300
Cut off lust.

33
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,800
All concerns and worries come from lust.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,850
When a person allows themselves to become enflamed with lust,

35
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,130
their body will eventually be burned in the flames.

36
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,170
Release your worries, and pluck out the root of your anger.

37
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,280
Cast lust away.

38
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,740
How is your condition?

39
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,520
Is your blood pressure and pulse all normal?

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,230
I am normal...

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,300
And so...you don't have any other symptoms?

42
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,290
Other...symptoms?

43
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,590
For example...what..?

44
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,640
For example...like...after drinking alcohol

45
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,800
you lost consciousness...

46
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,010
I understand!! When I drink alcohol I also--

47
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,460
There's none.

48
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,460
NONE?! There should have been though...

49
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,470
There was no loss of time or consciousness.

50
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,280
I remember everything.

51
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,340
Then...

52
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,540
It was Cha Do Hyun.

53
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,790
Then, perhaps, what about now?

54
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

55
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,040
Where are you going?

56
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,010
What are you doing?!

57
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,590
Why do you keep grabbing someone's neck??

58
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,180
Let go!! Why are you doing this to me? Let go!

59
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,820
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Ah!

60
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,040
Ah...

61
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,110
Why does he keep following me like he's some kind of a dog?

62
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,490
Oh Ri Jin, where are you going?

63
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,990
I'm going to eat outside. Why?

64
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,050
Alone?

65
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,210
You don't eat out, right?

66
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,980
I've been only eating vegetables because of you, so I've been hearing cows in my ears.

67
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,930
I'm going to eat whatever I want, so don't stop me.

68
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,990
Did you forget that you have to take care of me 24 hours a day?

69
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,990
Even shamans only work from when the night curfew strikes until the break of dawn.

70
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,890
Aren't you doing a little too much?

71
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,600
What if something happens to your patient while you're gone?

72
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Then, if you want, you can follow me.

73
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,100
Stop it.

74
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,730
Let's go get something to eat.

75
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm fine. Ah, why are you acting like this?

76
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,290
You're not eating this, right?

77
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,290
I promise you, Shin Se Gi.

78
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,050
If you don't stop me from doing these things after I mustered courage for the first time...

79
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,840
If you don't steal just the time I have with this person...

80
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,830
I promise you tens, hundreds, and thousands of times.

81
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,080
I promise that I'll give my entire body and all of my time and memories

82
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,760
to you in my next life.

83
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,540
I promise that I'll become your false image in my next life.

84
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,840
So please, just don't appear in front of this person.

85
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,790
Please just don't steal

86
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,830
this person from me.

87
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,190
You're here?

88
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,990
Oh, you're here?

89
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,830
I apologize for calling you here and then being late.

90
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,800
I observed some paintings for the first time in a while, so it was nice.

91
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,110
Do you like that?

92
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,860
It has a somewhat captivating power.

93
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,380
Wrap it and send it to Team Leader Han's address.

94
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,910
That's not what I mean when I said that, Ahjumma.

95
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,040
I was going to give you a piece of art anyway.

96
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,090
It saves time and it's good anyway.

97
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,470
It looked pretty expensive...

98
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,770
That's an artist bound for higher value. Right now, it's fairly cheap.

99
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,410
You must've felt so bad because of the rumors.

100
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,950
You don't care at all, Ahjumma? Oppa was going all about it.

101
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,900
He can be like that. Because men and women are different.

102
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,340
How are women different?

103
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,650
All of the wives here think that Ji Sun is at the losing end.

104
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,230
He said that the moment Do Hyun became first in the succession line, my eyes started to flutter.

105
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,700
Dear,

106
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,110
no one thinks like that.

107
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,680
As for skills, everyone says Ki Joon is number one.

108
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,300
Do Hyun can't compare to him.

109
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,850
Um...

110
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,190
Don't you think the atmosphere is too excessive?

111
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,830
Rather than an interview, it feels like I'm getting my tarot cards read...

112
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,380
You got it! That's it.

113
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,260
As you know, I'm not an expert yet,

114
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,740
and I created this place in order for us to become friends.

115
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,490
It's not a formal interview.

116
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,900
But still, the scented candles are a bit..
Ah-!

117
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,990
Before we start our conversation, there's a problem

118
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,520
that needs to be cleared up.

119
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,100
By any chance, do you want to lean on me,

120
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,030
want to be with me forever,

121
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,180
are you scared of being separated and find yourself obsessing over me?

122
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,230
Do you?

123
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Oh Ri Jin, in the middle of a personal talk...

124
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,200
- if you do this...
-That right there!

125
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,850
You have to be on your guard.

126
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,080
The emotions that you feel toward me.

127
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,150
Patients feeling more than necessary emotions for the doctor,

128
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,220
this is called positive transference.
Positive transference: the excessively positive feelings a patient feels toward his therapist.

129
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,230
Ah, yes.

130
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,310
You must not mistake those feelings as love!

131
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,650
Because you are dependent on me as a doctor,

132
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,330
those fake feelings are created, you understand?

133
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,370
Yes, Doctor.

134
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,580
Okay. Now...first make yourself comfortable.

135
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,590
From what I see you are more uncomfortable than me.

136
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Me?

137
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm not. I'm not at all.

138
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,060
You look uncomfortable.

139
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,710
That puppy-like smile. Seriously.

140
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,740
Let's continue after a break.

141
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,410
What did we do to already...

142
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,200
I definitely...am better off with coffee than red tea.

143
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,630
Positive transference my butt!!

144
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,560
You're the one who's about to start counter transference!
Counter transference: When a therapist obsesses over or has feelings for their patient because they feel needed.

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,670
Get a grip. You are a pro, you are a doctor.

146
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,330
You cannot ever get personal feelings!

147
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,810
Now, let's start again...

148
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm Na Na.

149
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,630
Nana is a new personality who appeared recently, so there is nothing that's been understood about her for sure.

150
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,190
Na Na!

151
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,720
Na Na?!

152
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,670
Na Na, where are you?

153
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,130
Na Na!

154
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,760
Na Na, are you in here?

155
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,870
Na Na?

156
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,640
Na Na?

157
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,630
Na Na?

158
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,700
That b****, seriously!

159
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,450
Yo Na! Yo Na!

160
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,030
How many times do I have to tell you my name is Yo Na?

161
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,450
You rock head.

162
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,110
You... why are you here?

163
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,550
Wait! Those clothes. Aren't those pajamas mine?

164
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,020
You're right, they're yours.

165
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,330
They look better on me, don't they?

166
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,670
How do I look? Let's share it. Peace!

167
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,860
Peace, my butt! Give it back! Take that off right now!

168
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,810
Take it off! Take it off!

169
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,150
This fierce wench, I knew this would happen. Ow!

170
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,620
Why do you always take my stuff?

171
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,490
- Wow, you're really strong.
- Give it! Give it to me!

172
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,480
I told you not to show your teeth!

173
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,840
This. It's the bear that Se Gi gave me.

174
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,440
How does a wrench not have a single skirt or makeup?

175
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,470
Did you put this here, Yo Na?

176
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,710
No-pe.

177
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,780
Na Na was playing with it.

178
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,450
Wow! That face is shining with childlike innocence!

179
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,180
Who is he? Is he your older brother?

180
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,990
Why are you asking that?

181
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,180
I put my spit on it. Give it.

182
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,220
-What?
-This oppa's phone number, give it.

183
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,260
Why do you want his phone number?

184
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,490
You shameless wench. Why are you being like this when we are both players; its annoying.

185
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,500
I gotta check with my reality eye! (Korean expression for saying that it is sensational enough to cry.)

186
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,550
You can't. For Mr. Oh and Mr. Cha, this meeting can't happen. Don't even dream about it.

187
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,530
You wench.. I told you not to show your teeth.

188
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,170
You are so rude.

189
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey, Ahn Yo Na! Bring that back!

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,670
Give me my phone back right now!

191
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,730
Ahn Yo Na.

192
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,640
This... just what in the world happened?

193
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,700
Who are you?

194
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,890
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

195
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,550
That...

196
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,850
Se Gi...

197
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,820
Did Se Gi appear?

198
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,620
No, that's not it. This bear is something that Se Gi gave to me as a present in the past, but

199
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,530
Nana found it somewhere and apparently was playing with it.

200
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,150
Did Nana show herself?

201
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,720
It's not that I saw Nana but Yo Na said so.

202
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,050
Yo Na appeared again?

203
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,480
It's a long story.

204
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,960
Anyways, I stopped a big crisis.

205
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,900
Then, who...?

206
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,950
That's...

207
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,190
Yo Na fainted and so I finally got her into the bed and was watching over her,

208
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,190
and then I finally fell asleep when it became nighttime.

209
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,010
The rice will begin cooking

210
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,520
Rice, rice, rice.

211
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,990
The rice will begin cooking.

212
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:40,640
Rice, rice, rice, rice.

213
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,150
Steam, steam, steam

214
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,680
Let out steam, let out steam

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,460
Perry Park?

216
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,770
Oh my, you were alive.

217
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,050
Do you know how worried I was for you?

218
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,270
Aigoo.That's right, that's right.

219
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,600
Nice to meet see you again!

220
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,370
Aigoo, pretty, pretty.

221
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,500
But!

222
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,860
What are you doing now?

223
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,240
Ah~~you're so fast!

224
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,040
I was so bored playing by myself that

225
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,360
I was going to make a couple bombs.

226
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,070
No!

227
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,640
Oh my...

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,030
Who do you think you are that you put your nose into someone else's hobbies?

229
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,230
And what's with this informal talk?

230
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,190
These young'uns with nothing in their brainless heads!

231
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,030
Using informal speech to adults!

232
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,350
It's not "No". It's "No, sir. It's not it!" (formal speech) Repeat it.

233
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,210
No, sir. It's not it.

234
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,340
It's not it---Eeing! Did you not hear me?

235
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,630
Okay. No, sir. It's not it!
Yes!

236
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,870
You must learn to be respectful to adults and you can become a child of the new world!

237
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,910
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

238
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,990
Alright, good.
- Ah!

239
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,410
Why don't you do that later..?

240
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,850
and just play with me? Alright?

241
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,190
I think I need to go make the bombs.

242
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,010
Ahjusshi! I...I'm a really good dancer!

243
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,570
What kind of technique is that...

244
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,250
Oh, that's pretty good.

245
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,710
I'm good, right?

246
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,460
There is no time. I must go make the bombs.

247
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,190
Ahjusshi!

248
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,660
Do you know this dance move?

249
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,170
After I got him to dance for three hours as if we were filming for Dancing With the Stars,

250
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,370
I finally got Perry Park to sleep.

251
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,440
And I, myself, almost got to go to sleep. too...

252
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,630
Yo Sub?

253
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,060
What is it?

254
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,140
Why are you here?

255
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,650
From a little while ago, I became Do Hyun hyung's personal doctor.

256
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,960
That idiot...

257
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,470
brought an annoying person into the house.

258
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,830
What are you looking at?

259
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,990
Don't think about keeping an eye on me.

260
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,360
Go and sleep.

261
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,820
Why? Are you regretful that you couldn't die the other day?

262
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,980
If you died that day, you couldn't have listened to this music

263
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,510
or have seen these pictures again.

264
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,220
Also, there wouldn't have been the fate of meeting me again here like this.

265
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,800
Aren't you looking forward

266
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,940
to what kinds of interesting things will happen in the future?

267
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,100
Are you going somewhere?

268
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

269
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,280
Noona,

270
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,070
thank you.

271
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,750
For me it was a pity, but it seems that everyone is happy to be alive.

272
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,850
I'm thinking of not killing myself for the time being. Don't worry.

273
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,990
Are you really telling me that all these personalities showed up?

274
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,560
Yes...I guess it's just a good meeting.

275
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,180
Se Gi?

276
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,010
Except for Se Gi.

277
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,220
-Really?
-Really.

278
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,980
The contract's fourth article, second clause.

279
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,380
It states you have to say all of the happenings with each of the personalities

280
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,880
without any lying and truthfully.

281
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,130
Is it true?

282
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,520
It's true.

283
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,170
Cha Do Hyun,

284
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,460
if you keep on not being able to believe me in the future...

285
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,500
Don't worry. This is definitely a good sign.

286
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,340
If I get closer to these personalities, I would know how these personalities came to be...

287
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,010
and it would help with the treatment.

288
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,160
I'm really quick to catch on.
(a famous gag line from Gag Concert)

289
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,910
It's a relief.

290
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,890
That you didn't get hurt.

291
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,920
It's better than

292
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,360
saying sorry.

293
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,740
Give me back my phone!

294
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,040
Perry Park? AH!

295
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,450
What are you looking at?

296
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,580
I wonder why Se Gi was the only one that didn't appear?

297
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,750
Is it because of my determination?

298
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,080
Or...

299
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,830
is it the calm before the storm?

300
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,540
What in the world is your problem?

301
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,570
I respected your feelings, and even retracted the news about our engagement. What more must I do?

302
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,740
Close the door and press a floor.

303
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,420
This is a place where many people know who we are.

304
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,090
Why are you acting so unlike you, not being cautious of yourself?

305
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,160
The door is closing.

306
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,690
Thank y---

307
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,990
Are you coming in or not?

308
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,130
The door is closing.

309
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,390
Oh, by the way, did you two clear the misunderstanding?

310
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,370
Misunderstanding?
- I heard Chae Yeon played some tricks during your arranged date with Ji Sun.

311
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,630
She seemed very sorry.

312
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,310
Saying she was such a disturbance.

313
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,770
Childhood friends could be like that.

314
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,920
That's what I told her, too.

315
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,530
But you...

316
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,460
- aren't you being a bit too ill-mannered?
-What do you mean?

317
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,000
No matter how incredible Myeong Seong Group is,

318
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,400
you sent a woman you used to date somewhere else.

319
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,230
Isn't that too much?

320
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,850
Are you perhaps even investigating me behind my back?

321
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,230
Of course not. I just heard it

322
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,480
when I went to Kanghan Hospital to look for a medical professional.

323
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,510
What a perfect coincidence. And very calculating at that.

324
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,000
I heard that you sent her abroad. Where is she? At your apartment in America?

325
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,030
Stop it. You're taking this too far.

326
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,230
Or...has another big one appeared?

327
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,370
I said, stop!

328
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,800
Tell me.

329
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,480
Don't worry. I hid her in a very safe place.

330
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,390
Have you arrived, Vice President?

331
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,130
Good morning, President Cha Ki Joon.

332
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,260
Good morning, Team Leader Han Chae Yeon.

333
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,580
There is no where safer than the company.

334
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,040
The darkest place is always under the lamp.

335
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,530
And if I want to see her I can see her whenever I want.

336
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,940
You know, right? That there is a secret within our family.

337
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,730
Let's go, Secretary Oh.

338
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,160
I will accompany you, Vice President.

339
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,180
Tell me again. What did you say?

340
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,220
You didn't understand me? Just announce the engagement! Since the word is out, let's just do it!

341
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,210
Just begin it? Is engagement some kind of homework to you?

342
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,710
I'm better off than you who is trying to use it like an eraser to get rid of all the rumors.

343
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,760
Why the heck have you, who said you won't get engaged before the selection period, changed your mind all of a sudden?

344
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,890
Now I said that I will do it and you still have a problem with it?

345
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,070
Is it because of Do Hyun?

346
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,040
Who the heck is Do Hyun? Why should I even get engaged because of him?

347
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,420
Getting called by Ahjumma is annoying too.

348
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,910
And I don't like you with your mannerlessness. It's all annoying.

349
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,170
If we are going to do it, do it quickly.

350
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,350
I am going to call my Mom, so you make your decision for the engagement day.

351
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,630
Why are you staring at me like that? Have you seen a human for the first time?

352
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,060
For what reason are you at the company, Mother?

353
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,380
Who is this young lady? I haven't met her.

354
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm the new secretary Oh Ri Jin.

355
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,180
What about Secretary An? Has he stabbed you in the back already?

356
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,510
No, it's not that. Secretary An was just stopping by a department and in the afternoon....
Oh, that's it.

357
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,070
I almost gave myself a fright.

358
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,010
Young lady, you can leave.

359
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,820
-It's not Miss, but Secretary Oh----
-Okay.

360
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,240
I feel like a student who was sleeping in class and then chased out of the classroom...

361
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,990
But... her aura is completely different from Mr. Cha.

362
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,830
Dear. Relax your face.

363
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,350
I heard that the old hag won't be coming in today so I came.

364
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,440
If it's that kind of worry, you don't have to. You think I can't handle that much?

365
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,170
Why have you come?

366
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:47,450
I heard that you had a marriage meeting with a daughter from Myung Sung.

367
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,490
- Yes.
- You rejected her.

368
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,430
Is it really because of that wrench, Chae Yeon?

369
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,890
It's not like that.

370
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,320
I was the one that got dumped.

371
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,520
This is Seung Jin Group's Chairwoman and my grandmother.

372
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,330
She is first in the list of people I have to be cautious and careful of.

373
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,130
Why do you have to be cautious and careful of your grandmother?

374
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,940
If I show symptoms of my illness in front of her,

375
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,530
or I am changed into another personality already,

376
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,500
you must remove me from her sight, even if you have to knock me out cold.

377
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,610
Hello, Chairwoman.

378
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:33,610
I am the new secretary for the Vice-president in replacement of Secretary Ahn starting from today, Oh Ri Jin.

379
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,070
Did the Vice President come to work?

380
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,720
Yes, he is speaking with his mother inside.

381
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,230
I will tell him.

382
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,880
It's fine. I will go in by myself.

383
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,900
Dumped?!

384
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,970
That wrench has no manners! What is she to do that!

385
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,660
She is one funny wench! What is her number?

386
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,460
You're the future owner of Seung Jin Group, and she dumps you?

387
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,340
Myung Sung? Hey-hey-hey!
Tell her to stop overreacting.

388
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,100
Compared to Seung Jin, which you will own... Aigoo!

389
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,120
Her company is just a child's toy. What's wrong with her?

390
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Why is someone that should be home here?

391
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,700
Mother, it's...

392
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,660
I had something to tell her so I asked her to come.

393
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,090
- Do Hyun...
- Is she a person that can be brought outside?

394
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,280
If one cannot shake herself to her senses, the other should have at least stopped her.

395
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm sorry.

396
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,510
Why would you call her in?

397
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,880
What good will come of letting others know who your mother is?

398
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,560
Stop. Wanting to see my own son...

399
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,930
I myself...came here without knowing.

400
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,380
How do you not know that not looking for and not searching for your son is the best way for him?

401
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,010
There are tons of ears all around us and itchy mouths everywhere.

402
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,050
Are rumors not enough for you?

403
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,390
I'm sorry but Vice President, you have to hurry to your next appointment.

404
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,400
You are already ten minutes late.

405
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,630
Why did you suddenly do that?

406
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,930
You said to remove you from the Chairwoman, even if I have to knock you out cold.

407
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,250
If I left you, I felt like Perry Park would come out with bombs.

408
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,050
I am making you escape.

409
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:49,020
Don't make a ruckus and go out without making a squeak. You understand me?

410
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,300
Please...give some of your power to our Do Hyun, Mother.

411
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,010
I...

412
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,030
know that I am the flaw and

413
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,290
defect in Do Hyun's life.

414
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,520
That flaw...can only be covered...

415
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,910
with your power.

416
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,840
Please push him for a more secured position instead of something

417
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,650
weak like a Vice-President position.

418
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,320
I know this may sound brutal...but

419
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,470
your son has no hope.

420
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,480
He may not even wake up in the end.

421
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,530
Shut your mouth.
- And if... Min Soo Yeon's child appears,

422
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,390
if that child takes revenge on Seung Jin Group,

423
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,790
you never know whose hands Seung Jin Group might fall into.

424
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,340
What are you standing there for, not leaving?

425
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,110
Before it's too late..

426
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:55,530
Do Hyun's status must be firm...
- Should I call someone to drag you out?!

427
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,840
What? There is another person looking for Min Seo Yeon's child?

428
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,610
Find out whose order they took to find the child...

429
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,240
and how much they have been able to find out.

430
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,630
From outside...

431
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,150
did you hear... it all?

432
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,610
I think...because I am taking care of you 24/7,

433
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,050
I get to hear and see a lot of things accidentally.

434
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:50,230
My family is very different from your family.

435
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,000
We have a sort of past incident.

436
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,250
My family also has a lot of incidents too if you get to know them.

437
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,120
This is where you guys were.

438
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,930
-I was looking for you guys for a long time.
-You came.

439
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,600
There is something that has happened; you must move out of this place quickly.

440
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,720
-Where to?
-I will explain while we are going.

441
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,910
I will take the vice president.

442
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,290
You have a different personal schedule you must take care of.

443
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,890
I'm sorry, Professor.

444
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,020
I feel like I am meeting my daughter,

445
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,200
who ran off secretly with her boyfriend at night.

446
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,760
I'm thinking, do I have to take her back, even if I have to drag her by the hair?

447
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,620
Some people say that there is no parent that can win over their child...

448
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,430
I'm just wondering if I should give her my peace and happiness...

449
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,350
You laugh? You....laughed?

450
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,370
I was really tired and it was hard for me lying to a lot of people.

451
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,450
I feel like I'm going to cry now that you're here.

452
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,510
Coming out to just one person is this hard...

453
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,650
And when I think of him keeping it to himself for 11 years,

454
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,910
I can imagine how hard it was for him.

455
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:42,030
This is why they say there's no point in raising a daughter.

456
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,600
What is his reason on a sudden change in his 'mysterious identity'?

457
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,750
I'm not sure. I can't find out since he's such a unique writer.

458
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,290
Arranging a meeting like this in a 'guerrilla' (spontaneous) style,

459
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,800
saying not to bring anyone and that his identity will only be revealed to VP Cha

460
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,680
seems kind of weird...

461
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,860
It's for certain that the writer has a 4-D personality.

462
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,320
I'll be nearby. If anything comes up, just give me a call.

463
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,050
Ah, and also...

464
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:32,540
please let me know if his looks are really on the level of Won Bin.

465
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,770
I'm really curious about that.

466
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,390
Nice to meet you, Writer O (as in Omega).

467
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,680
I'm Cha Do Hyun, I-D Entertainment's Vice President.

468
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,240
Oh Ri On?

469
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,100
Nice to meet you.

470
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,830
I am the writer Omega.

471
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,790
What did you just say? In one night

472
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,140
all the personalities of Mr. Cha appeared?

473
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,160
Yes, I couldn't meet Nana in person, but there was evidence that she was there.

474
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,270
Yo Na, Perry Park and Yo Sub... I met them all in person.

475
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,900
And Se Gi didn't appear.

476
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,280
How can this be? It took me ten years to find out about his multiple personalities.

477
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,180
Having a bunch of personalities come out at once is very rare.

478
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,790
It's a bad sign?

479
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,530
I don't know.

480
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,820
Perhaps, could Oh Ri Jin be the switch to the personality changes?

481
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:02,440
Before my personality changes, Oh Ri Jin was always there.

482
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,190
You must have been very surprised.

483
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,530
I should have done a weaker cover for myself...to be honest...

484
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,630
Besides the editor and my family, no one knows that I'm Omega.

485
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,610
My neighborhood elders think that I mooch off of my parents and see me as

486
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,180
an unemployed bum or the neighborhood fool.

487
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,570
Oh Ri On,

488
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,140
when did you know I was Cha Do Hyun?

489
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,580
About me... How much and how far do you know?

490
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:51,240
By any chance... did you approach me first, knowing everything?

491
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,110
Is it confession time?

492
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,220
I knew from the beginning that you were Seung Jin Group's only successor.

493
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,400
I saw your picture on a gossip news article about chaebols.

494
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,160
Then why did you act like you didn't know?

495
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,020
When you knew my name, why did you call me Perry..?

496
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,090
I thought it was either an act or a cover.

497
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,830
That feeling of a third-generation chaebol heir getting out from the expectations of him and wanting to live as a different person...

498
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,250
It was understandable.

499
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,400
I thought it was manners that if you didn't reveal it first, I should act like I didn't know.

500
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,690
Was I wrong?

501
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:36,610
Then what is the reason for your sudden decision to hand over the copyrights?

502
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,940
And to also take off your cover that you've worked so hard to keep secret?

503
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,140
Don't think too deeply about it.

504
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,770
What's important right now is

505
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,970
that the copyrights of Omega's works which have never been made into a movie

506
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,900
was attained by Cha Do Hyun.

507
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,480
But there are three conditions.

508
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,620
Tell me.

509
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,850
First... I shall do the scenario for the adaptation.

510
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:18,110
-What is the reason?
-Because I can't leave my child in others' hands.

511
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,620
Deal?

512
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,230
I understand. What about the other conditions?

513
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,930
I will be known as the replacement writer for Writer Omega.

514
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,450
I think it's a waste to just throw away my hard earned cover as Omega.

515
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,100
Tell me your last condition.

516
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,770
That....

517
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,470
Can't we do that after we eat?

518
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:46,080
Personality changing switch? Me?

519
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,280
You really haven't met Mr. Cha or Se Gi in the past?

520
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,790
Yes.

521
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:55,780
But everyone asks the same question so it makes me confused.

522
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,850
The human brain is very mysterious.

523
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:03,900
A former memory of some kind might not be out on the surface; but somewhere inside it.

524
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,420
It may be buried down deep there.

525
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,510
If there is something that happened between you two in the past that neither of you remember, but connects you to each other...

526
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,170
What if there was?

527
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,530
It might be that Mr. Cha met the best fortune.

528
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,150
You may be the treatment key for Mr. Cha

529
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,100
or the catalyst to make him remember his lost past.

530
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,350
About the novel The Child in the Basement...

531
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,960
How does the ending go?

532
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,060
Since you're the writer, you must have some idea for it.

533
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,670
What was the reason...

534
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,200
the male child was afraid of the basement?

535
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,070
It was love.

536
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:03,170
Because the girl was so afraid of the basement, he acted like he was afraid, too.

537
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:08,160
Because watching the girl tremble in fear alone

538
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,710
was heartbreaking.

539
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:18,910
He misunderstood himself pretending to be afraid as his real fear.

540
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,950
It's his own misunderstanding and delusion.

541
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,830
That feeling in the heart

542
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,330
was

543
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,090
love.

544
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,170
The male child figures that out after he is grown.

545
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,360
So--

546
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:04,740
Does the boy end up finding out the reason

547
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,730
why the girl was afraid of the basement?

548
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,610
He is still looking for it.

549
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:16,430
And he's always thinking about it.

550
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,430
If, by chance, he does find it,

551
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,720
if he should bury it or not.

552
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:45,820
I will ask you to do well for us in the future, Oh Ri On---...Writer Omega.

553
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,890
It's going to be hard on you from now on because of me.

554
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,260
As a writer I am pretty picky.

555
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,020
We seem to have a strange fate with each other.

556
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,150
I hope for it to be a good fate.

557
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,830
Then.

558
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,000
Is Ri Jin doing well?

559
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,190
Let me meet Ri Jin.

560
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,650
That is the third condition.

561
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,670
The human brain is mysterious.

562
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,210
A former memory of some kind might not be out on the surface,

563
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:37,730
but it could be hidden deep down somewhere inside it.

564
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,930
Cha Do Hyun

565
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,240
Yes, Cha Do Hyun.

566
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,000
Right now?

567
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,810
Yes, I know where that is.

568
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,260
I will go right now. Alright.

569
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,160
Come on, sister!

570
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,150
Ri- Ri On!

571
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,270
Th-th-that is...

572
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,160
Where are you running off to?!

573
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,980
Wait..wait wait!

574
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,030
Listen to me. Ahh!!

575
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,830
Come here! Come here!
Ah!!

576
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,830
Ri On, let go of me and let's just talk.

577
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,130
You little...you always make me use techniques on you.

578
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,620
Hey! Let go! I said, let go!

579
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,900
Just know that you're the first to carelessly mess with a woman!

580
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,950
What was the reason that the boy was afraid of basements?

581
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,200
Why? Are you scared?

582
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,740
Or are you miserable?

583
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,910
If you find the lost memory...do you have the courage to face the pain?

584
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,800
What's the point of trying to remember your lost memories after all this time?

585
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,450
You cannot ever handle it.

586
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,160
Are you alright?

587
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,680
What was the reason the boy was afraid of basements?

588
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,430
It was love.

589
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,870
You cannot ever handle it.

590
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,280
- Shut up!
- Cover it up.

591
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,950
That time also...you had no courage to face the pain and ran away.

592
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,580
And in replacement of you, I had to go through it.

593
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,080
Do you understand?

594
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,930
If it wasn't for me, you would have already died from being alone in misery.

595
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,370
But who's calling who a fake?!

596
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,780
Shut up! Shut up!

597
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,620
So you never even set foot in the airplane going to America,

598
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,020
and went to that chaebol oldie's...

599
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,660
No. You're staying at Mr. Cha's house, and is acting as his doctor?

600
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,780
Hey, you brat! If things happened this way, you should have come home first

601
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,740
and told your parents that you were going to end up not going because of this and that and begged for their forgiveness!!

602
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,770
Do you think it's right of you to keep this from your parents?

603
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,740
I feel really sorry to everyone.

604
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,170
But if I told them the truth I thought they would be more worried.

605
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,130
It's enough.

606
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,440
Pack your bags. Leave that place immediately.

607
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,660
Hey! Sit down, sit down!

608
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,840
Sit down! Wait a minute!

609
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,760
I'm not done talking yet.

610
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
What else are you telling me to listen to?!

611
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,380
My younger sister who hasn't even married yet is at another man's place.

612
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,890
I can't accept that. I'd rather you kick dirt in my eyes.

613
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,080
Three months.

614
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,660
That person is leaving to America in three months anyways.

615
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,490
But until then I want to help.

616
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,200
Can't I do that?

617
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:10,490
You're the one who said that the best choice is my choice.

618
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,620
That if I regret that choice, to come run to you any time.

619
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:20,880
That any time, you will stand behind me.

620
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,370
I haven't regretted it yet.

621
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,880
So, can't you believe in me

622
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,660
and just wait?

623
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,830
Move. My eyes are rotting.

624
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,830
Hey! You didn't even answer, how can you just go?

625
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,830
You're dead meat if you turn your phone off. Know that.

626
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,080
Making a coincidence

627
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,830
was my first mistake.

628
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,850
Come here, come here! You're dead! Come here!

629
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,990
You remember her, right? The one that was ripping out my hair at the airport.

630
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,530
Ah, yes.

631
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,410
Hello.

632
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,120
Ah, yes. Hello.

633
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,580
Making that coincidence into fate was the second mistake.

634
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,530
I'm just saying a doctor is not the only thing they need.

635
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:47,580
They need their family, friends, and significant others.

636
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,030
There's probably no one by that person right now.

637
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:54,950
"I'm having a hard time." "Help me." "I need some friends."

638
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,990
The choice is yours.

639
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,530
Constantly encouraging her

640
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,830
and making that fate into destiny...

641
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,370
was my third mistake.

642
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,240
I love you, Oh Ri On.

643
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,280
If you regret your choice or have a hard time, run over.

644
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,080
Elegantly...and luxuriously...

645
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,840
Decisively sending you away...

646
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,370
was my last mistake.

647
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,890
Cha Do Hyun! Are you alright, Cha Do Hyun?

648
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:21,680
He doesn't have a fever.

649
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:40,510
Cha Do Hyun! Come to your senses, Cha Do Hyun! Okay?

650
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,930
Cha Do Hyun?
♫ A secret ♫

651
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:54,790
♫ that can't be told to anyone ♫

652
00:57:54,790 --> 00:58:00,800
♫ Everyone has at least one ♫

653
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,120
♫ of those ♫

654
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:14,910
♫ Even loneliness ♫

655
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:19,990
♫ Is like an old friend ♫

656
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,030
Wait here! I'll come back with medicine.

657
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:33,120
♫ I can get used to this. I miss you ♫

658
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,820
Don't go.

659
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,580
Don't go!

660
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,950
Play with me

661
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,840
Play with me.

662
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,380
♫ The only thing I can give to you ♫

663
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,940
Play with me.

664
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:02,160
♫ Are these unstoppable tears ♫

665
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,160
♫ With that face that was unfamiliar the first time you saw it ♫

666
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:15,760
♫ I just gave your heart scars ♫

667
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,700
♫ Please let me love you on my own ♫

668
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,800
Hey pretty!

669
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,430
Why did you bring that out?

670
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:49,370
Because you say weird things I can't concentrate on my work.

671
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,080
If it is weird nonsense, then just move on.

672
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,930
Why are you lingering on that?

673
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,930
Honey...

674
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:00,350
I didn't do anything wrong, right?

675
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,370
About what?

676
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,740
Taking Seo Yeon's child and raising the child.....

677
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,330
It's not something wrong, right?

678
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:11,330
It's not Seo Yeon's child, but our child now.

679
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,320
That's right, of course. You are right.

680
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,260
Of course.

681
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,710
I believe in Ri On.

682
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,040
- Ri On is just a really good brother to Ri Jin.
- Of course, of course.

683
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,240
That's right. Forget about it.

684
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,700
Stop taking it out.

685
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,240
Are you alright now, Cha Do Hyun?

686
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,370
Shin Se Gi?

687
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,080
Why are you here?

688
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,580
Why were you with Cha Do Hyun in his bedroom?!

689
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,400
Why?!

690
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,450
WHY?!!
