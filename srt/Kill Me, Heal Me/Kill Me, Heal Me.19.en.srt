00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,920
Episode 19

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,590
Why don't we just wrap this up now, alright?

3
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,940
Waist up!

4
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,700
What are you doing right now? This is the company!
You should be working.

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,280
The Chairperson in-charge of the General Shareholders' Meeting is totally different from the Vice President who was just playing around.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,230
When did I ever play around? Back then, I also worked hard-

7
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,150
This upcoming shareholders' meeting... will be a battleground without gunshots.

8
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,920
You can't show your blind spots, nor a crack from you.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,330
You must read the opponent's move first, and be fully ready for an attack.

10
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,690
Yes.

11
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,090
Okay. Alright, let's hurry up then.

12
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,270
It would be good for you to wait at the house, Oh Ri Jin.

13
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,140
Why? I'm Cha Do Hyun's secret physician and his secretary in disguise.

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,650
To employ you as a secret physician is his discretion, but to employ you as a secretary is under my authority.

15
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,630
Wow! Wait, are you... exerting authority over me right now?

16
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,190
I guess you must have forgotten, but this is Seungjin Group.

17
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,470
And there are a lot of dangerous eyes here. It's all for your sake, Oh Ri Jin.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Let's go.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,670
Secretary Oh?

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,120
Ah, it is you, Oh Ri Jin.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,570
To be honest, I am really interested in you, Oh Ri Jin.

22
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,110
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry.

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm sorry. It's not the kind of interest you were thinking of. I meant something else.

24
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,820
What do I think it means, and what do you think it means, President?

25
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,390
I mean that I'm not interested in you as a man.

26
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,060
- Well, not yet.
- Not yet?

27
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,960
Since you never know how things will turn out between a man and a woman.

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,170
If you're going to make jokes and play around, then I'll go.

29
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,770
You're a psychiatrist, right?

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,710
Perhaps, are you aware that we are fated to meet, after brushing past each other last time?

31
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,410
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,260
Are you okay?

33
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,720
To be honest, I was a little surprised when I saw you at the company.

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,330
It's not natural for a psychiatrist to become a secretary.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,740
Yeah, well...

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,880
Anyway, I became interested because of that;

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,280
but recently, I've gotten interested in something else.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,500
Something else? What is it?

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,070
Don't you have a guess?

40
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,730
None at all.

41
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,390
Well then... the upcoming Shareholders' Meeting will come as a surprise to you, Oh Ri Jin.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,100
What does the shareholder's meeting have anything to do with me?

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,150
I am planning of having a surprise party at the upcoming shareholder's meeting.

44
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,810
When this party ends, you'll become a very wealthy person, Oh Ri Jin.

45
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,340
It's nice just to hear it. I guess...wealthy like Bill Gates?

46
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,990
Wealthy, like a direct heir major shareholder?

47
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,190
But only if you stand on my side.

48
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,620
What to do?

49
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,100
I, inherently, hate taking sides.

50
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,500
I also definitely don't understand what you're saying when you beat around the bush.

51
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,390
I still have something left to say.

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,350
I've already left the company, and we have nothing to do with each other to meet in the outside world.

53
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,630
That's why I can leave whenever I want.

54
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,240
Excuse me.

55
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,780
I am looking around in the area where the the mail was postmarked from,

56
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,070
but it's like finding a needle in a desert.

57
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,630
If it's just to screw us up, he may have just sent the mail from another place, too.

58
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,280
It's bait.

59
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,550
He's giving us a sample taste, and if it suits our taste, better deposit the money.

60
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,750
It'll be somewhere easy to find.

61
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,980
Who are you?

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,110
Shin Se Gi?

63
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,470
It's me. Cha Do Hyun.

64
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,690
Drink up. It'll wake you up from the alcohol.

65
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,310
Have you been well?

66
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,720
You acted like you wouldn't ever return to Korea, so what happened?

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,270
I think I committed a huge mistake toward you.

68
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,630
Hey, that bastard Shin Se Gi is still the same.

69
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,400
His temper is really something.

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
I shouldn't have told you my secret.

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,990
Seems like you finally want to do business with me now.

72
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,100
When you threatened me for the first time,

73
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,140
I shouldn't have given you money.

74
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,210
I didn't know that it would become the price for marijuana, cocaine,

75
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,540
and the price for gambling.

76
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,710
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,580
I ruined you.

78
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,970
You're still pretending to be nice.

79
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,330
If I didn't want to make you my friend back then,

80
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,820
didn't spill my secret because I saw you as my friend,

81
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,770
and hadn't asked you to keep my secret,

82
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,460
then we wouldn't have a reason to meet like this, would we?

83
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,850
Just suggest an amount of money.

84
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,130
I shouldn't have been scared about whether or not my secret would be discovered because of you.

85
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,150
I should have had the courage to handle it in whatever way it was found out.

86
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,400
"Bad jerk."

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,960
"I'm the bastard for trusting in you."

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,030
I should have just punched you once and ended it then.

89
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,230
I listened to your sermon very well. So how much do you want to offer?

90
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,720
There's no deal.

91
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,110
I'll come back again if my secret is exposed by your mouth.

92
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,400
To punch you.

93
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,990
Since you're still my friend.

94
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,860
Will it be okay like this?

95
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,890
It feels like not getting rid of the timer of a timer bomb.

96
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,310
There aren't that many days left until the shareholder's meeting, you should make sure his mouth is definitely closed and...

97
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,330
- Why don't you resolve this again-
- Has his gambling debt been taken care of?

98
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,800
Yes. I have only taken care of only the urgent things, as you've ordered.

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,400
I also asked you to prepare a plane ticket to the US, travel expenses, a temporary apartment, and have him check in at a drug rehabilitation treatment center.

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,540
He might even escape to somewhere else so please have someone guard him.

101
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
Didn't you say there wasn't any deal?

102
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,170
It's not a deal; it's atonement and sympathy.

103
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,160
What do you mean by atonement and sympathy?

104
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,370
Atonement for living my life cowardly back then.

105
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,500
Sympathy that wants to let him start over again like I did.

106
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,450
Don't act like you're so great, you bastard!

107
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,080
I will tell you the location of the locker.

108
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,270
I found it!

109
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,430
Are you sure?

110
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,930
Yes. I checked it. It fits in perfectly.

111
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,760
Have you checked what was inside?

112
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,020
O-o-one moment.

113
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,050
Nothing. Nothing.

114
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,530
These are the items I brought from the locker Alex told us about.

115
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,960
He planned to give these to President Cha Ki Joon as bait.

116
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,290
Though he changed his mind at the last moment.

117
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,650
They're all movies about multiple personality disorder.

118
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,270
He wanted me to tell you that he was sorry.

119
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,540
In any case, that side is preparing to launch a counterattack,

120
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,240
don't you think we should prepare for something to attack them with as well?

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,910
I announced that this shareholder's meeting will proceed transparently and clearly.

122
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,050
I told you, that won't work.

123
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,080
I already told the Chairwoman as well.

124
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,070
That for this shareholder's meeting I will do it my way, not hers.

125
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,240
I think our urgent priority right now is to seize a card to beat them during the shareholders' meeting...

126
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,980
Just a moment.

127
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,650
Yes. It's Ahn Gook.

128
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,150
Ah, yes.

129
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,760
Did you find it?

130
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,250
I understand. I'll head there now.

131
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
Yes.

132
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,910
What's wrong?

133
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,340
It might not be a simple accident... What kind of evidence lead to that thinking?

134
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,800
That day, the Chairman's chauffeur was new.

135
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,790
They said the man who was his original chauffeur suddenly suffered from intestinal inflammation,

136
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,070
and was hospitalized or something.

137
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,460
Anyway, that new chauffeur

138
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,640
brought Chairman Cha Geon Ho and President Min Seo Yeon to the airport.

139
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,660
But that's also strange.

140
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,730
About what?

141
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,820
The place where the accident happened was not a road to the airport,

142
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,960
but somewhere in the suburbs.

143
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,010
These people who urgently bought plane tickets,

144
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,490
there was no reason for them to intentionally take the longer route.

145
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,840
On top of that, there were a lot of suspicious things here and there but

146
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,740
the investigation came to a close.

147
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,900
As a simple accident caused by drowsy driving.

148
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,910
There's no need to believe him 100%.

149
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,020
Just like flies surround rotten meat,

150
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,680
in the world of conglomerate families, there will always be rumors following around.

151
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,840
If, at that time, the contract between Chairman Cha Geon Ho Chairman and President Min Seo Yeon was terminated,

152
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,770
who do you think benefited from it the most?

153
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,710
Or...

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,920
who hated those two the most?

155
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,360
Sorry that I used you.

156
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,590
But thankfully, Do Hyun changed his mind

157
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,110
and returned to the company.

158
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,480
I'll think of it that it is all thanks to you.

159
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,730
Wake up now if you feel wronged, huh?

160
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,610
Wake up and stand by Do Hyun's side.

161
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,530
Is there still a past for you to dig up?

162
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,080
Why are you suddenly bringing that accident up?

163
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,390
If I do not want to get caught by the back of my neck by the other side,

164
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,780
I have to know the truth about all of my suspicions.

165
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,200
At the time,

166
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,320
there were many mouths that surrounded me, pounded on me, made fun of me.

167
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,020
There was a rumor that I was jealous of the relationship between my husband and my daughter-in-law.

168
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,230
I got rid of them both

169
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,330
to make my son Chairman, that's why I instigated the car accident.

170
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,690
All these filthy rumors that I myself could not even say out of my own mouth.

171
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,790
Then, Chairwoman,

172
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,970
are you saying that you were not the mastermind of the car accident that happened that day?

173
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,480
Your distrust of me is deeper than I thought it was.

174
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,840
You reap what you sow.

175
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,660
No matter what you think, it's not me.

176
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,460
Don't waste your time on unimportant things.

177
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,540
Pick up cards that could be of help during the shareholders' meeting.

178
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,620
One useful card is entering.

179
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,720
Long time, no see, Cha Do Hyun.

180
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,170
Just now, BACK company in America

181
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,110
said that they faxed us documents related to Alex Kang and Chairperson Cha Do Hyun.

182
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,020
You're scary because you're expressionless.

183
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,780
Try to express some emotion.

184
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,740
Whether it's that you're surprised, flustered, tired,

185
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,140
or going crazy. Whatever it is.

186
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,930
- Chae Yeon.
- You don't have to worry because of Ki Joon Oppa anymore.

187
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,900
I already did my 'coming out'.

188
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,050
I've already given my heart to someone else.

189
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,970
I said that for this shareholder's meeting,

190
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,630
I'll lend power for your side.

191
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,680
I wanted to make up for the pain I caused you

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,720
during that time.

193
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,090
I want to have you, even if it's through this way.

194
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,230
I can't take back the heart that I've already given to her.

195
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,040
This is just an obsession, and a strong desire to win.

196
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,050
It's not love.

197
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,590
You shouldn't have messed with me then!

198
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,050
That way, I wouldn't have wavered or gone crazy.

199
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,900
I think the time for me to tell you has come now.

200
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,700
- What?
- The reason why I gave you up back then,

201
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,890
and the reason that I shook you up again,

202
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,540
and the reason why I'm rejecting you like this after I did that.

203
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,520
If you're just going to give me some ridiculous excuse, then just stop.

204
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,580
It's not long. Just one word is enough.

205
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,100
"Cha Do Hyun was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)" at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

206
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,500
DID?

207
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,710
That well-behaved Cha Do Hyun has Multiple Personality Disorder?

208
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,240
The reactions of the people who know my secret vary.

209
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,530
They get terrified, or they feel good because I disclosed it to them,

210
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,130
or feel relief because they are normal,

211
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,350
or use me, or sympathize with me, or treat me as a monster.

212
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,390
How would you act?

213
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,330
Will you still want me even after you know my secret?

214
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,950
Ah, what is this? I said I'll come tomorrow.

215
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,510
Did you already start missing me?

216
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,880
Say it one more time.

217
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,590
Say what?

218
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,050
That you like me.

219
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,240
Wait, aren't you being too much?

220
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm a woman too, but you always order me to do those kinds of things!

221
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,740
- You don't like me?
- No.

222
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
I like you.

223
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,260
I like Cha Do Hyun

224
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,750
a whole lot, really.

225
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,400
I miss you.

226
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,020
No, but has this old geezer already gone senile?

227
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,130
He should call her out during the day! Geez!

228
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,520
Ri Jin, I would like it if you didn't go there.

229
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
Why this again?

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,670
I just have this feeling. Something isn't right.

231
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,430
I wish you would quit this job.

232
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,830
Ah, Ri Jin, don't worry about what she says.

233
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,320
So where should I put your luggage? Should I put it in the back seat or in the trunk?

234
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,230
In the back seat.

235
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,550
The back seat? Deal.

236
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,570
I think I'm a really happy person, Mom.

237
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,650
The base camp where I can return to whenever I'm having a hard time

238
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,560
is strong.

239
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,040
How about me? How about me? How about me?

240
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,790
That's right, that's right. Oh, my kid! Be careful.

241
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,210
Look forward. You're bothering me.

242
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,850
He's out.

243
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,600
You should buy and put a bench in front of the house.

244
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,770
Ri On, thank you.

245
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,930
I'm going.

246
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,680
Oh Ri On,

247
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,560
would you like to drink with me?

248
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,980
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,040
I couldn't fulfill your request of cutting off my connection with her.

250
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,940
Who can I blame? When my sister is the accomplice.

251
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,010
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,360
Do you remember what you told me last time?

253
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,140
I think we have a strange fate.

254
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,430
I hope that it will become a good fate.

255
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,830
Do the two of us... No, the three of us...

256
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,430
Is it really a good fate?

257
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,860
- Oh Ri On.
- Try to think about it sometimes.

258
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,620
If Ri Jin would have just been left alone to live with her mother in America...

259
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:56,820
No, if Seungjin Group would have accepted Ri Jin as family kindheartedly,

260
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,930
somehow, instead of Ri Jin and I,

261
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,170
you and Ri Jin could have grown up as twins instead.

262
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,450
If that would have happened, instead of you,

263
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,300
I could have become a man to her.

264
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,030
After experiencing that, I continuously thought,

265
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,090
"What kind of position should I be in for Ri Jin?"

266
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,200
"What kind of position should I choose?" And...

267
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,940
I made the decision with difficulty.

268
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,090
That I would become the best brother in the world

269
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,590
to Ri Jin.

270
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,910
That's why...

271
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,080
please protect Ri Jin well.

272
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,670
Please don't let her get hurt ever again.

273
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,590
♬ I’m lightly calling out to you ♬

274
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,140

279
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,130
♬ You’re smiling so prettily ♬

280
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,830
- If you're having a hard time, then come back.
♫ Honestly, it's hard for me to only watch ♫

281
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,510
- The best choice is your choice.
♫ There would be many times I would walk in your direction ♫

282
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,090
- I love you, Oh Ri On.
♫ There would be many times I would walk in your direction ♫

283
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:11,530
- You know that, right?
-Yeah. Thank you for loving me.

284
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,730
♬My heart blocks my love♬

285
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,240
- What does first love mean to a man?
♫ Even if the end of my lips ♫

286
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,960
- It's a 'thank you' if it folds up at once.
♫ tremble, I endure ♫

287
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,670
- If it opens up again, then it's lingering attachment. 
♫ tremble, I endure ♫

288
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,030
- If it opens up twice, it's sadness.
♫ Because that's the right thing ♫

289
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,210
If it opens up thrice, it's pain.

290
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,990
And after opening up over and over again until it becomes ragged,

291
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,380
that's how his heart is ripped apart,

292
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,280
and they endure that ripping until it doesn't hurt anymore. Something like that.

293
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,530
I don't want a little sister who just cries. I want a strong one.

294
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,460
If not, then don't be my little sister.

295
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,970
Don't be like this.

296
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,780
Do you know how much I depend on you?

297
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,730
Do you know how much stronger I became because of you?

298
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,780
I'm a person who has nothing to be afraid of when I think that you're behind me.

299
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,200
I was wrong. I won't do it again.

300
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,160
Of course, you did wrong. You...

301
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:35,780
- committed a big wrong toward me.
- So...

302
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,750
Don't say that you won't be my big brother.

303
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,960
Ever since I was young, those were the words I was most afraid of.

304
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,060
Okay. I'll do it.

305
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,300
I'll be your brother.

306
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,630
I won't do anything else.

307
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,180
I'll just be your brother.

308
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,000
♬So I’m letting you go once again♬

309
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,040
You surprised me!

310
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,130
You drank a lot, didn't you?

311
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:46,060
What's up with this? Your voice is Cha Do Hyun's, but you're speaking like Shin Se Gi.

312
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,150
Why are you suddenly speaking informally?

313
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,990
We were friends way back then.

314
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,540
So you're saying we should speak informally?

315
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,980
However way the words come out.
Whatever works.

316
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,090
According to how we feel that day.

317
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,070
What is it? What's wrong?

318
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,300
Did my Brother say something?

319
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,610
Ah... why?

320
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,140
Is there something on my face?

321
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,080
I miss you.

322
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,650
- But you're looking at me right now.
- But I still miss you.

323
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,660
Those are lyrics from a popular song.

324
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,220
We

325
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,580
must be happy.
♬  The deep night shows you, ♬

326
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,050
♬ who was not able to leave  ♬

327
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,420
♬  It wakes me up from my sleep  ♬

328
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,600
♬ and kisses me again  ♬

329
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,690
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

330
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,260
♬ and your scent ♬

331
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,790
- Ah, it feels nice!
♬ echoes in my ears every day  ♬

332
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,410
♬ Where are you?  ♬

333
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,780
You've remembered the pain and memories that caused the separation of your personality,

334
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,360
and we've roughly gotten to know the background of how each personality came into life.

335
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,000
If we just convince each personality and get their cooperation,

336
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,160
it could be a good sign for the amalgamation treatment.

337
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,010
Almost all of my memories have also come back. I think what's left is for me to overcome them.

338
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,800
If we want to access your memories in more depth,

339
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,140
we may have to use hypnosis or Amytal therapy.

340
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,250
Also, if we want to treat your psychological pain,

341
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,990
we may have to use the EMDR therapy as a long-term treatment as well. (EMDR Therapy: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)

342
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,240
For now, the two of us want to work on it on our own.

343
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,500
I have a very great psychiatrist with me as well.

344
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,170
Between people who share the same past and same wounds,

345
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,210
if we match up each piece of the puzzle of our memories one by one,

346
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,160
and reconstruct the broken pieces,

347
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,770
then the memories that were horrible at one time

348
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,200
will gradually become less painful.

349
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,690
That's right. Since you two are each other's cause and effect,

350
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,990
then you could also become each other's strongest treatment.

351
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,380
By the way, I did roughly guess it, but

352
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,180
aren't you too obvious about that? Huh?

353
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,880
It's like I have to recite something, like to officiate a wedding or something!

354
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,830
I mean, well, my student and my patient

355
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,180
that I have known for many years

356
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,010
say that they're going to date in secret, I can't say anything.

357
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,930
Although I would like to reprimand her, whether she's aware as a doctor.

358
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,900
But you two don't have a normal fate. What can I do? I'll just have to give you my blessing.

359
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,850
I hope that the two Do Hyuns

360
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,010
can get through it well together.

361
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,370
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you

362
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:34,580
For now, I think that we don't have to try to get rid of the personalities by force.

363
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,140
Since the personalities and you are one person

364
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,600
and they're pieces of your wounds.

365
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,940
Don't we need a process

366
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,930
by which they acknowledge and accept each other?

367
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,100
The different personalities inside me, the desires, and the pain, you're saying to

368
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,080
acknowledge that I'm me and accept that, right?

369
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,340
Yes. That. By doing that--

370
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,330
you can start loving yourself as who you are.

371
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,760
- Then, what should we start from now, Doctor?
- Hm....

372
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,140
Matching the pieces of your broken memories together?

373
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,080
Then please say what you remember first, Dr. Oh.

374
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,470
- Me first?
- Yes.

375
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,420
Didn't you say that even though you have bad memories, you also have good memories?

376
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,090
I want to hear about those good memories.

377
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,950
It was when it hadn't been long since my mom passed away from the car accident.

378
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,050
That day was my birthday.

379
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:48,860
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you!

380
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:57,260
To Do Hyun whom I love~ Happy Birthday to you!

381
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,000
Do Hyun, happy birthday!

382
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,080
Blow out the candle, Do Hyun!

383
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,350
Look at this, Do Hyun. I brought this after asking the helper Ahjumma.

384
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,490
Wow, it's pretty!

385
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,310
Next time, let's go see really big fireworks.

386
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,630
Yeah! I want to go! I definitely want to go!

387
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,040
At first, I believed that my mom would come take me

388
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,760
and that if my mom just comes, I could leave this place.

389
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,640
But I realized that it was a ridiculous dream. And so, I was very disappointed at that time.

390
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,040
It was the most pleasing and happiest memory

391
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,860
after my mom passed away.

392
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,660
That's a relief. That you were happy.

393
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:11,800
But don't you have any good memories that you remember?

394
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,080
About that...

395
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,000
It was when it hadn't been long since I entered the Seungjin family.

396
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,630
The mansion was overwhelming, and my grandfather was very strict and scary.

397
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,510
-Sit here.
- Because of my father, who became scary after coming to the house,

398
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,170
I was very down.

399
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,610
That day as well, I was scolded for not being able to memorize the multiplication table.

400
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,170
You and I are going to play house.

401
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,690
Play house?

402
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,140
Yeah. She's the baby. Her name is Na Na.

403
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,920
Actually...

404
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,550
she's a present that was given by my dad, who went to Heaven.

405
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,110
I was told not to say that in front of Grandma and Grandpa.

406
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,240
I think I can tell you though.

407
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,200
So, it's a secret!

408
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,330
I understand.

409
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,890
It's a secret.

410
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,240
Honey, this is kimchi I made.

411
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,390
And this is spinach that I made. Hurry up and try it!

412
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,920
Okay.

413
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,150
In the beginning, I couldn't get adjusted to the life in the mansion, so I always wanted to run away.

414
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,800
I was able to endure it because you were there.

415
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,730
The one who was saved first was me.

416
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,400
It's a relief.

417
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,310
That I didn't leave you only sad memories.

418
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,130
What was your father like?

419
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,020
I can't remember at all.

420
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,470
He passed away before I was born.

421
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,260
My mom...

422
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,630
said that she would tell me once I grew up,

423
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,920
and passed away.

424
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,200
Oh Ri Jin.

425
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,810
I thought of something for us to do.

426
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,060
What is it?

427
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,030
Should we go... console the us during childhood?

428
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,440
- Right now?
- Yeah.

429
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,220
Right now.

430
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:00,130
♬ When I first met you ♬

431
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:09,290
♬You were a small girl♬

432
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,970
♬You had♬

433
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,320
♬a violet in your hair♬

434
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,050
♬You told me with a smile♬

435
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:38,170
♬That you wanted to fly far away like a bird♬

436
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:09,090
♬When I met you again♬

437
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:18,280
♬You looked so thin♬

438
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:27,210
♬ Sweat beads on your forehead♬

439
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,590
♬You told me with a smile♬

440
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:46,320
♬That you shed tears over the littlest things♬

441
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,030
- What is that?
- Ah...

442
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,260
I made a list of presents for the personalities.

443
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,810
If I want to calm the personalities down, I must give them a bribe.

444
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,450
Giving and taking bribes are illegal.

445
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm just saying it.

446
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:45,800
I really wanted to get the personalities a gift.

447
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,440
To Nana, I want to give her a new teddy bear, without a ripped back.

448
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,920
Perry Park: fishing rod and beer.

449
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,110
When he came to Ssang Ri last time, he couldn't even put 'God's water balloon,'

450
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,260
my father's greatest drink, near his mouth, and fainted.

451
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,950
If you want to get Perry Park a gift, how about that?

452
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,820
We should put his name on it.

453
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,430
Perry Park.

454
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,420
Perry Park.

455
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,810
Yo Sub said that he wants to write a poem.

456
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,530
How about a diary and a fountain pen?

457
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,370
That's good, too.

458
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,520
Oh! Yo Na will really like this.

459
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,920
Wench. She didn't listen to me at all so I don't want to buy anything for her but!

460
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,840
Anyway, I'm telling you, she's even harder to handle than Se Gi.

461
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,160
But... For Se Gi,

462
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,040
what kind of present will make him happy?

463
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,610
I really don't know.

464
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,900
Are you angry?

465
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,050
So personalities can get angry, too...

466
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,420
But how did you know that I liked fireworks?

467
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,580
You wanted to see it.

468
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,190
Ever since a long time ago.

469
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,350
It's pretty!

470
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,680
Wouldn't it be nice if it continued forever?

471
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,990
Yeah.

472
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:02,410
It's the same for me. I would also like to be with you forever.

473
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:28,370
Last time, because I called you out,

474
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,640
it bothers me that I just sent Se Gi away.

475
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:39,150
Since he has the deepest scar, he becomes reckless when he is angry.

476
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,070
That's probably why he set the house on fire.

477
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,540
The resentment and anger Se Gi has towards Father is too big, so

478
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,700
if that rage isn't released somehow, he will never try to disappear.

479
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,690
To you...

480
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,850
What kind of person was your father?

481
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,620
He was once a caring and good father.

482
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,110
Really? Are you really going to buy me a boat?

483
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:24,180
Yeah! I'll even write a name on the boat. What should I write?

484
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,820
Perry Park. It's Perry Park.

485
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,440
Okay! 'Perry Park' boat!

486
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,920
You really made a promise with me. You have to buy it!

487
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,520
If it's 'Perry Park' boat, could it be...

488
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,800
I remembered it recently.

489
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,130
In my heart, there is resentment towards my abusive father.

490
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:53,910
But there is also a yearning and a sense of guilt toward my once caring father.

491
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,160
So, that's why I think I made Perry Park.

492
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:07,290
Right now... which side do you think is stronger?

493
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,210
Resentment?

494
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,330
Or...

495
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,820
yearning?

496
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,060
How can you be so calm?

497
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,540
You must want to resent him over and over again, even curse him, and even that won't be enough.

498
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,810
Actually...

499
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,280
I'm not really sure. When I saw the photo and remembered my memories for the first time,

500
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,860
I was so scared that I couldn't control my body.

501
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,940
After seeing him lying unconscious on a bed in a photo,

502
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,820
I wondered if that person really is that person.

503
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,020
Should I say...

504
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,780
it felt empty.

505
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:13,790
If you are even a little bit hurt or feel hatred toward him,

506
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,580
Se Gi will run any time and choke my father's neck.

507
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
But that's not what I want from him.

508
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,620
But if you still feel unsafe

509
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,450
or get hurt because of my father, there is still a possibility.

510
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:35,830
Then... in the end, for us to become happy,

511
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:42,900
we have to forgive the perpetrator.

512
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,850
Forgive the perpetrator.

513
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,640
Oh my...

514
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,280
What is this?

515
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,590
Oooh my...

516
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,640
Wow~

517
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,370
It's the God's water balloon you couldn't drink last time.

518
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,520
My head doesn't hurt.

519
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,930
Oh my! It's really delicious! Wow!

520
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:58,370
As expected, chicken and beer is the best midnight snack, yeah? Wow~

521
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,830
Is it that delicious?

522
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:05,520
Of course! If I say it twice, it's nagging, and if I say it three times, it is a serious crime.

523
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,880
Maiden, if you go home, please tell Sung (a satoori version of Hyung) this.

524
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,810
From all the beers that Perry Park has drunk in his lifetime, his beer tasted the best.

525
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,000
Okay.

526
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,010
And please say that to Do Hyun as well. Don't forget.

527
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:33,300
Why did you think about leaving all of a sudden?

528
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,080
Well,

529
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,150
I... am the oldest.

530
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,160
I have to set a good example for those babies to follow my footsteps.

531
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,890
Right? Then Do Hyun will get to live a comfortable life from now on.

532
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,320
That's why.

533
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,390
Oh my...

534
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,900
Why the hell are you looking at me like that?

535
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,250
Really...

536
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,710
Maiden, do you have something to say to me?

537
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,690
Back then... during the leather jacket incident,

538
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,720
you came to save me, right?

539
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,990
No!

540
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,820
Because you felt sorry

541
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:47,800
for not being able to save me in the fire 21 years ago. Right?

542
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:58,000
What are you blabbering? Geez.

543
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:14,730
Since I finished drinking the beer,

544
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:20,690
I'm a bit busy, so I will leave after telling you something.

545
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:29,310
Please take care of my baby.

546
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,960
Thanks to you, I am able to leave on a trip

547
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,580
because I only trust you. Okay?

548
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:43,350
Also, Maiden, always smile, okay? Live while thinking only good thoughts, okay?

549
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,740
The past, it's nothing. It's not important. Okay?

550
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,570
You only live one life. Yeah?

551
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,930
Be healthy.

552
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,580
Perry Park...

553
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,120
That's right.

554
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,140
That's right. I should I have one more glass of bee-- Ah!

555
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,360
Aigoo...

556
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,490
Ah... I'm getting sleepy.

557
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,940
Ah... It would be nice to have one more glass...

558
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,460
Eeing?

559
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:49,730
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

560
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:57,150
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again  ♬

561
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,620
- Perry Park!
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

562
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,820
♬ echo in my ears every day ♬

563
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,830
♬ I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

564
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,310
♬  I can’t touch you or be embraced by you  ♬

565
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,020
I'll buy it for you!

566
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,260
A boat!

567
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,130
Really? Are you really going to buy me a boat?

568
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,220
Yeah! I'll even engrave a name onto the boat. What do you want to engrave onto it?

569
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,670
- Perry Park. How about Perry Park?
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

570
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,520
- Okay. It's Perry Park!
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave ♬

571
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,340
- You promised Dad now. You have to buy it for me!
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

572
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,260
♫ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♫

573
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,290
- Ah! My mood is up! 
♫ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♫

574
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,050
♫ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♫

575
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:21,760
- Yeah... This is it...
♫ It echoes in my ear every day. Where are you? ♫

576
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,820
- This is it.
♫ In the unreachable sky, I see you, who is turning back ♫

577
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:29,190
♬ On the night sky, which I cannot reach, I see you, who is turning back ♬

578
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:36,780
♬ From this hard day, it makes a picture  ♬

579
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:43,540
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me and I call for you desperately ♬

580
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,010
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

581
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,860
- Oh my!
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

582
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,090
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

583
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,050
You're awake?

584
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,560
Just now,

585
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,680
Perry Park has left.

586
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:49,160
Perry Park told me to relay this message to you.

587
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,620
To live freely.
He told me to tell this to you.

588
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:05,890
That you'll well know what freedom means.

589
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,330
- What is to live freely?
- Uhm....

590
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:22,930
Not living according to what other people want

591
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,720
but living according to who I am.

592
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Living while doing what I want to do.

593
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,500
Not getting scolded while living like that.

594
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,290
Give me a glass, too, Mother.

595
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,800
I can't sleep at all.

596
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,060
Even the sleeping pills prescribed by the hospital

597
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:52,360
are not being effective at all.

598
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,420
Actually,

599
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:02,640
I became like this after hearing that our Do Hyun has a disability.

600
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,300
Because I became like this, I came to think of thoughts I never had before.

601
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,770
That you, Mother, must have also had a hard time all this time.

602
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:26,300
How torn up your heart must have been as you watched your son that only lies down on the bed.

603
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,550
You've also aged. Thinking about useless things.

604
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:40,100
No matter how you see it, don't you think this place isn't a good place for the Cha family?

605
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,300
What are you saying out of nowhere?

606
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,140
In the Cha household, there are no Cha's anywhere.

607
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:55,620
Instead, a Seo and a Shin are guarding the house. That's what I'm talking about.

608
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,680
Min Seo Yeon. It's about Min Seo Yeon's child.

609
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,300
Our Do Hyun

610
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,630
met that child.

611
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,070
What exactly is this?

612
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,630
Why would you ask me that?

613
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:13,400
Because I don't know, I called you over to ask you.

614
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,980
I just checked all of the CCTVs. There were no intrusions from outside.

615
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,550
The camera caught you going up to the second floor at the break of dawn.

616
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:33,900
It's certain that you wrote it, Chairperson.

617
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,800
Then, could it be...

618
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,630
Could it be?

619
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,130
Could it be?

620
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,490
A new personality's appearance?

621
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,670
X?
