1
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,600
This is not me.
There is no reason for this sound to be mine.

2
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,240
What!? My heart is pounding again?!

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,420
Who is the cause this time?

4
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,260
He didn't perhaps change already, did he?

5
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,840
By any chance...

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,080
Shin Se Gi?

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,290
Oh Ri Jin,

8
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,610
do you still get confused between Shin Se Gi and me?

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,990
♬ I'm a bit clumsy and awkward. ♬

10
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,260
Should I make it so you don't get confused again?

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,680
♬ Your hands which you hid behind your back. ♬

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,800
♬ I will hold your small hand. ♬

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,940
♬  Even though I'm nervous sometimes, I'll trust you. ♬

14
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,510
♫  Even if we don't meet,  ♫

15
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,990
♫ I'll always stay in this spot. ♫

16
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,440
♫I'll be there.♫

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,190
♬  When you fall and get hurt, I'll hold on to you.  ♫

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,340
♫  I will always be with you,  ♫

19
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,760
♬ It's love. ♫

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,820
♫ Will you believe me? ♫

21
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,720
♫ Are you too scared? ♫

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:22,470
♫ Now, with my heart, I will protect you  ♫

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,780
♬ I'm a bit clumsy and awkward. ♫

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,520
Ah, I'm sorry. I had something to confirm, so-

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,530
As you know, I don't use this heart by myself,

26
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,200
and I'm sharing my heart with all these other personalities.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,670
I didn't really know w-w-who was the reason it was happening. So to check---

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,780
- Why did you stop?!
- What?

29
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,840
If a man took out his sword, you have to go till the end. Why are you so cowardly?

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,670
What?

31
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,870
I also have something to confirm, so...finish what you were doing.

32
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,210
Oh Ri Jin, you seem to be quite drunk...

33
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,980
Even though I'm using my heart by myself, it's becoming confused.

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,550
For several days, a bug has been crawling around in my head!

35
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,460
I mean, why do I have to raise a bug in my head because of you?

36
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,440
With a brain that got 100% on the college exam test, why do I have grow a bug? Do I have nothing else to grow?

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,900
That's great. While it's already happened, let's confirm and end it.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,920
Mom!!

39
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,040
Ah!

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,080
Mom!

41
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,920
Jackpot case.

42
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,840
Episode 6

43
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,710
Put the kimchi in the refrigerator after a day. Put the side dishes into portions that you are going to eat.

44
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,680
The kalbi goes in the fridge.

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,810
You really don't have to prepare so much for me.

46
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,470
Aigoo! I packed just a little bit for you,
because you said you live alone.

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,390
I know, right? It's too little. Aren't you being too stingy to my friend, Mom?

48
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,020
Ah, it's not closing.

49
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,100
- It worked.
- It worked. Hold this and go.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,360
Why is a slightly buzzed person

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,290
trying to drive their car? Just call a substitute driver.

52
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,420
Father, I don't think it's a situation to do that right now.

53
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,630
Then...I will leave first!

54
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,350
Drive safely on your way back.

55
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,560
- Yes.
- Come again!

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,710
- Go.
- See you again.

57
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,420
Call me if you run out of food!

58
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,940
Bye.

59
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,500
Ah, what? Ah, what is it?

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,530
You knew that the storage door was broken. A woman must know how to play hard to get.

61
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,640
You are an eolppa...
(Eolppa: a person who falls for a good looking person)

62
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,020
and a geumsappa...
(Geumsappa: a person who falls in love right away)

63
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,060
Since the buzz is gone, you're embarrassed now, right?

64
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,870
Come in right away!

65
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,530
I didn't lock him there on purpose! Why aren't you listening to me?

66
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,380
Oh Ri Jin, do you still get confused between Se Gi and me?

67
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,680
Should I make you not confused?

68
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I must be crazy!

69
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,350
I didn't do it, right? The alcohol did it, right?

70
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,110
Why can't you say anything, huh?

71
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,020
I shouldn't drink alcohol?

72
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,200
That's why! Why did I do that?

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,240
Oh!

74
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,680
Stupid...

75
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,850
Even though I'm using my heart by myself, it's become confused! Bugs have been crawling around in my head these few days!

76
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,900
I mean, why do I have to raise a bug in my head because of you?

77
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,120
Kill you

78
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,490
It's been a while, Cha Do Hyun.

79
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,480
You made your house into prison while I was gone. That's very admirable.

80
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,830
Very admirable.

81
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,310
You have a way of spending money, since you are rich.

82
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,610
Do you really think you can confine me like this?

83
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,610
Why? After confining me like this, when I'm not here,

84
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,630
are you going to meet my woman again?

85
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,610
"My woman"?

86
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,940
How dare you take away my time

87
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,940
at my happiest moment!?

88
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,620
An idiot who doesn't know how to do anything besides hiding, avoiding, and running away...

89
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,440
Dared to kiss my woman?

90
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,160
Listen well to what I'm saying right now.

91
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,960
If you touch my woman,

92
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,200
your woman will be in danger.

93
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,780
Chae Yeon, pick up your phone.

94
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,150
Cha Do Hyun

95
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,870
Chae Yeon, where are you right now?

96
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,520
Is anything wrong? Are you safe? Are you alright?

97
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,120
Say one thing at a time.

98
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,590
Ki Joon hyung?

99
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,230
Why are you checking the safety of someone else's woman so early on a weekend?

100
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,810
Tell me what you want to pass onto her. The Chae Yeon you're desperately looking for is sleeping.

101
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:25,030
Perhaps...were you with Chae Yeon yesterday?

102
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:33,050
If I said I was, then does that mean that Chae Yeon's well-being and safety are both confirmed at once?

103
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,680
Rest assured then.

104
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,880
You did well. You did well. Thank you.

105
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,860
Is the alcohol you drank yesterday talking? If you're going to say useless things then hang up, you punk.

106
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,430
Wait, wait.

107
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,350
What is it? You still have something left to check?

108
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,120
I have something

109
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
to ask of you.

110
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,090
The coffee smell is great. Whose call was it?

111
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,920
Do Hyun.

112
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,190
Why did Do Hyun call?

113
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,500
He asked if you were well all night.

114
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,210
Is this the Joseon dynasty or something? So what did you say?

115
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,260
That you were with me all night so there's no way you'd be safe.

116
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,730
I taunted him.

117
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,170
He didn't say anything else?

118
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,310
-He said don't ever leave you alone.
-What?

119
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,150
He said always stay by your side.

120
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,650
I almost cried.

121
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,760
Is he sending his little sister off to marriage or something?

122
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:56,330
Chae Yeon has Ki Joon. Nothing will happen.

123
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,080
Chae Yeon is safe.

124
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,730
- She's safe.
- Oh, how sad. It looks like you're miserable.

125
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,640
Exactly 10 minutes... You have called your woman just now

126
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,800
and asked about her safety.

127
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,360
Even after you knew she was safe, you would still be uneasy.

128
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,970
How is it? It's a living hell, right?

129
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,010
If you don't want to go through this living hell again, heed my warning well.

130
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,590
If you meddle with my woman, your woman will be in danger.

131
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,690
This is the first rule for both of us to exist together peacefully. Do you understand?

132
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,630
Bastard.

133
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,010
Shin Se Gi! You bastard!

134
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,340
Vice-President! What's wrong? Come to your senses!

135
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,660
Calm down, Vice-President. What happened here?

136
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,850
- How did this...?
- Secretary Ahn...

137
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,230
From now on I...

138
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,140
am thinking of gambling.

139
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,210
-Why did you stop?
-What?

140
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,560
Take a deep breath before picking up

141
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,290
- Yeobo (means honey, but she was intending to say hello)...
-  Who is your honey, you rascal!

142
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,670
You rascal. Do you think probation is a good thing?

143
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,770
It's not.

144
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,150
But why aren't you showing yourself in the hospital?

145
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,940
Come right now, like Usain Bolt. Do you understand?

146
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,060
Right now!

147
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes. Yes. I understand.

148
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,160
A VIP house call?

149
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,360
What kind of VIP wants a first-year resident to pay him a house call?

150
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,320
How would I know? He pin pointed you and asked for you to be sent.

151
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,190
So, who is it?

152
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,030
He is a VVIP that the president of the association asked us specially,

153
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,040
so pay attention.

154
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,820
Here. Sign it.

155
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,920
What is it?

156
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Non-disclosure Agreement!

157
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,880
Why do I have to write something like this?

158
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,790
Non-disclosure Agreement

159
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,940
Shin Se Gi

160
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,390
Doctor Park! Can't you send someone else other than me?

161
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,480
My mouth is way cheaper than you think. I cannot guarantee that I will keep his secret.

162
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,330
You rascal... Are you in a situation to say something like this?

163
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,030
Hey! Leave, leave! Hurry up and buzz off. Get out!

164
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,540
Doctor Park! Please, please!

165
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,830
No, thank you. Please leave quickly! I have to change clothes! Hurry up and go!

166
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,250
Choose. Is it me or Cha Do Hyun?

167
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,200
I told you, you can't choose both.

168
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,030
I don't want to spend this time together with him.

169
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,880
I don't want to worry about when I could disappear when I'm with you.

170
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,830
Put Cha Do Hyun to sleep. So he can't wake up forever.

171
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,440
It's not something that can be solved just by you avoiding him.

172
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,270
The more you avoid him, his obsession might become worse.

173
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,620
Mr. Shin, is this all your workmanship?

174
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,430
Why did you make this big of a mess this time?

175
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,260
Ah, forget it. Why did you call me this time?

176
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,990
Hey, Mr. Shin, I'm a busy person. I don't have time to play with your prank messages and V.I.P. performances.

177
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,270
Tell me quickly. What? Are you going to tell me to choose between Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin again?

178
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,410
Or are you going to ask me to put Mr. Cha to sleep forever again?

179
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,200
So it seems, that you lied to me.

180
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,340
Cha Do Hyun?

181
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,440
Last time when I asked,

182
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,340
I thought you said that you weren't asked to do anything as a doctor, didn't you?

183
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,500
That...it's not a lie.

184
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,310
Mr. Shin asked me that after I met you.

185
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,490
I was going to tell you yesterday but I was too drunk.

186
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,030
Rather... I think you are the one that lied.

187
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,760
What is the reason you called me here with Mr. Shin's name?

188
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,370
I had a need to gamble.

189
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,610
What do you mean gamble?

190
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,770
If Se Gi called you,

191
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,600
would you or would you not come?

192
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,940
Would you think of the warning I told you and avoid it?

193
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,980
Or would you disregard the warning and still come see Se Gi?

194
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,210
Depending on the results I was going to decide if I have to be on guard with you or

195
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,920
decide to make you on my side.

196
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,730
So, you tested me?

197
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,540
So, have you decided?

198
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,450
Thanks to you.

199
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,590
Can you announce your results?

200
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,420
That the two of you are closer than I thought.

201
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,150
Se Gi is serious about you and

202
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,390
that you could also be serious about Se Gi.

203
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,680
I had a thought that you guys could work together to put me to sleep.

204
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,090
It's dangerous. This is pretty dangerous.

205
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,640
I need to find a way to survive.

206
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,310
So, you decided to be on guard of me?

207
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,330
No. It's the opposite.

208
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,050
I'm thinking of making you on my side.

209
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,080
What would you do if I make the same proposal as Se Gi?

210
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,550
Oh Ri Jin,

211
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,980
will you be my secret physician?

212
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,360
What is there to be confused about?

213
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,580
From now on he's not going to accept managing Han Chae Yeon's fishery.

214
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,720
He drew a line.

215
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,070
Does that mean he's got a girlfriend?

216
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,350
I came here to get rid of one bump, but I got another one instead.

217
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,620
I'm sorry, but you found the wrong address.

218
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm not a professional, and I never treated a patient with D.I.D. (Dissociative Identity Disorder).

219
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,480
- What do you mean by physician?
- You're not a professional,

220
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,010
but there isn't anyone else who would be a better secret physician for me than you.

221
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,390
I'm not a professional, but I'm fitted for the job?

222
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,330
Till now, Se Gi was never cooperative with any doctor.

223
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,100
-So what?
-He listened to you though.
-What about it?

224
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,950
He just acted like a pet just once.

225
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,250
Se Gi is serious about you.

226
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,570
Okay, lets just say that. What about it?

227
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,730
You can persuade Se Gi.

228
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,400
What am I suppose to persuade him about?

229
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,280
My safety and

230
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,790
the active participation in

231
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,980
the amalgamation treatment that will start in three months.

232
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,360
Wait, why after three months?

233
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,890
If you want to get rid of Se Gi that much then you can just get the treatment right now. Of course, from an expert.

234
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,690
I have something I must accomplish during those three months.

235
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,150
After that I plan to go back to America and officially get treatment.

236
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,600
You just have to stop Se Gi while being next to me until then.

237
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,150
Of course, if you get rid of him as well, I won't refuse.

238
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,980
Why are both of you guys doing this to me?

239
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,400
Are you guys game characters? Am I pro gamer? Why are you both asking me to get rid of each other?

240
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,050
I still haven't heard your answer.

241
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,460
-I refuse.
-That isn't the answer I want.

242
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,320
-You can't just live hearing the answers you want to hear.
-Then I will find another way.

243
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,820
But I still refuse. I'm not going to change my mind.

244
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,990
President Lee,

245
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,160
about Oh Ri Jin's leave I asked you about,

246
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,310
please proceed it as planned.

247
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,570
-What are you doing right now?
-Thank you, later then.

248
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,450
Cha Do Hyun!

249
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,090
Sadly, you just became unemployed.

250
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,460
I am thinking about proposing a good job for you.

251
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,360
You want to try it?

252
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,120
The remuneration will probably be beyond your imagination.

253
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,700
Aren't you scared of me?

254
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,840
I don't know who you are just yet so...

255
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,100
What's your name?

256
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,900
What

257
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,500
is your name?

258
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,940
Using Se Gi's woman to get rid of Se Gi,

259
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,150
is that what you mean?

260
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,700
No.

261
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,670
I'm protecting Se Gi's woman from Se Gi.

262
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
-That's what it means.
-If you keep Oh Ri Jin close,

263
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,770
wouldn't it be more dangerous?

264
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,230
But I won't let her be by my side.

265
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,090
I won't let her feel my emotions. A breach of the agreement is necessary.

266
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,840
Couldn't you feel it?

267
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,910
But according to Se Gi's blackmail, Team Leader Han could be in danger.

268
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,270
Gi Joon is next to Chae Yeon, but

269
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,030
Oh Ri Jin is different.

270
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,420
Just because I avoid Oh Ri Jin,

271
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,000
if Se Gi goes and finds Oh Ri Jin, there is no point. Instead,

272
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,950
having her by my side as a secret physician,

273
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,340
will protect both women and

274
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,940
is the only way to protect me.

275
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,470
Han Chae Yeon

276
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,080
I'm in front of your house right now, open the door.

277
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,900
Why are you like this these days? Why are you suddenly lying?

278
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,810
Why wouldn't you be at your house? Just now...

279
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,890
I just saw a woman leave your house.

280
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,050
Do you want me to call the security and forcibly open the door?

281
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,090
Lift up your head. Why are you acting like someone who is indebted?

282
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,290
When did you know Ki Joon was my fiancee?

283
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,880
Are you going through a period of storm and stress because of that?

284
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,860
Why do

285
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,640
I have to go through a period of storm and stress because of you two?

286
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,060
Because I'm your first love.

287
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,440
-Don't say I'm not.
-You knew that the whole time but acted like you didn't know.

288
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,150
I remembered the image of you having an abomination so I smiled a little.

289
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:13,590
- Abomination?
- You are my first love. But after finding out you had feelings for Ki Joon,

290
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,420
I gave up right away.

291
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,570
Without any wrinkle, scar, or evidence, it was easy to give up.

292
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,390
- After that..
- Even after that, you still have...

293
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,980
How are you so confident?

294
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,000
While I was preparing for the exhibition at the New York Gallery you,

295
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,070
came by with flowers, didn't you?

296
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,090
You asked me to pick a picture that is going to be on the pamphlet.

297
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,650
Did you show me about ten pictures? I saw it then.

298
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,060
You took one picture of me

299
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,450
and hid it preciously.

300
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,670
If you meddle with my woman,

301
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,530
your woman becomes in danger.

302
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,580
It didn't feel bad.

303
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:11,150
Being treated so preciously by someone.

304
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,030
That's what kind of existence you are to me.

305
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,000
-A person you want to preciously treasu--
-Chae Yeon.

306
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,630
Stop setting up your fishery.

307
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,770
Now I won't go inside your fishery.

308
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,480
Does this seem like I'm managing my fishery?

309
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,240
You don't want me but you don't want to give me to someone else.

310
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,050
You don't want me to be next to you because I'm the son of a mistress.

311
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,350
Instead you put me in a fishery and sometimes throw in some chum.

312
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,030
Stop doing that. It's become boring now.

313
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,240
Don't come find me because of this from now on. The warning I gave you last time is sincere.

314
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,090
- I'll be going first.
- There's nothing special about you either.

315
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,950
You acted all innocent,

316
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,580
but because of a woman, are you going to throw away our friendship of twenty years?

317
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,820
You want to throw Ki Joon hyung away and come to me then?

318
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,580
You can't do it can you?

319
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,400
Then from now on, in front of me,

320
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,210
don't act like a woman.

321
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,700
I mean, how can a vacation request get approved as soon as it is received?

322
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,340
This seems to be a dismissal!

323
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,360
It's just a three-month break. You're not fired.

324
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,070
It wasn't I who wanted this!

325
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,980
A selfish bastard is controlling my life!

326
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,180
You are like that too. I don't know how close you two are,

327
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,470
but just because a young man called once!

328
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,770
How can you step on the shining future of a resident?

329
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,110
Is that son a son of the President? Is he from a two-generation wealthy family?

330
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,080
It's three generations, not two.

331
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,500
- What?
- Seung Jin Group's heir.

332
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,030
Currently Seung Jin Group's heir; ID Enter's Vice President.

333
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,270
Anyway!

334
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,630
Well, anyway, let's just say that's true. If he's a chaebol, he should definitely--

335
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:46,580
Seung Jin Group is currently having an enormous fundraiser at our hospital.

336
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,110
That's why, Professor, please help me!

337
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,240
About me, Doctor Oh,

338
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,300
- I think that a leave isn't all that bad.
- Professor!

339
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,680
Mr. Cha is in danger during his three months in Korea.

340
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,840
We don't know when he will turn into Se Gi and come looking for you.

341
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,150
It's best to avoid it if you can.

342
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,670
-But professor...
-So because of that,

343
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,870
-why don't you go out and do some studying before you come back?
-What?

344
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,680
There was a proposal from Johns Hopkins University.

345
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,630
They wanted me to suggest a doctor who is suitable to study abroad for a short time.

346
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,340
So I plan to recommend you, Dr. Oh.

347
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,760
Reject being a secret physician.

348
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,270
And just go to Johns Hopkins University.

349
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,930
That's a better solution.

350
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,710
Instead, Doctor Oh,

351
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,740
don't hate Mr. Cha too much.

352
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,460
He is not the kind of rascal who, without any reason,

353
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,540
is selfish all of a sudden.

354
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,620
He's a guy who always takes responsibility for the mess he created.

355
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,680
Oh Ri Jin,

356
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,180
will you be my secret physician?

357
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,350
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave  ♬

358
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,100
Because he is afraid that other people will get hurt because of him,

359
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,820
he worries every single moment of his life,

360
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,080
and he fights hard every day.

361
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,570
It's probably because he was pushed into a corner and can't handle the situation by himself.

362
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,350
I, who has this face and this look in my eyes...

363
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,900
am Cha Do Hyun.

364
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,250
It was something that didn't need hesitation.

365
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,530
That girl had to prepare to leave right away.

366
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,640
She had to forget his secret offer.

367
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,430
In that short moment of hesitance,

368
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,660
the blurry memories

369
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,790
were already beginning to play pranks on the girl.

370
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,300
Now...

371
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,070
a strange box will be placed in front of the two people.

372
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,470
Something that must never be opened.

373
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,450
Something that must not be seen.

374
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,710
A Pandora's Box, something that must not be remembered.

375
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,950
And...

376
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,970
some day, he will hear the whispers in the box.

377
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,810
Open it. Remember it.

378
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,660
That day, what happened between you and her.

379
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,070
About that child.

380
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,440
That child? Who?

381
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,200
Min Seo Yeon's child.

382
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,460
Women are like this.

383
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,040
Do you have a lot of interest in gossip and rumors, too?

384
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,790
Not as gossip or rumor, but if he's really alive somewhere...

385
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,380
If that child is a male, not a female...

386
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,890
What would happen?

387
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,110
What do you mean what would happen? About what?

388
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,350
Anyways, he is still a bloodline of this family.

389
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,820
If that child comes back alive,

390
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,230
Seung Jin Group's judge will change.

391
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,350
I'm asking you if it will benefit Ki Joon or not.

392
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,140
We will have to make him stand on our side, no matter what.

393
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,100
If we need to, our side can look for that child first.

394
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,200
She disappeared!

395
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,550
She disappeared... She disappeared...

396
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,170
I think I killed too many people.

397
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,440
For the time being, I shouldn't write any novels like this.

398
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,190
Ah, I...

399
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,940
Why are you being so noisy?

400
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,220
- She surprised me...
- John Hopkins?

401
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,740
Yeah. I'm going to study abroad for six months. So from today, I'm on a break.

402
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,030
That turned out great! Right, Honey?

403
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,310
Wait a minute.

404
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,570
But why did you roam around the garden like a virgin ghost, even if it's good news?

405
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,170
Oh?

406
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,900
That...

407
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,940
Work got tangled up and complicated.

408
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,670
What and how did it get tangled up?

409
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,130
Some chaebol asked me to be his physician for 3 months.

410
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,440
A physician of a chaebol?

411
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,320
That's good!

412
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,110
It's easier to work than in hospitals, and the pay is higher! Isn't that right, Honey?

413
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,190
This person!

414
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,400
When she became a virgin ghost she must have been distressed about something!

415
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,790
If you're a mom you should have asked that first!

416
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,040
So you have two delicious rice cakes in both hands,

417
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,830
and you're worried about which one you should eat and which one you should throw away?

418
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,160
I never wanted to eat a rice cake and I don't want to.

419
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,220
I want to throw it all away and live freely, barehanded. Like I did until now.

420
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,380
Then do that. What's the problem?

421
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,250
Anyway my leave already happened. I'm in a situation where I have to choose.

422
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,830
If you were me,

423
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,390
what would you choose?

424
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,360
Who cares about what we think. Your heart is the most important.

425
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,880
That's right. No one is here to live your life for you.

426
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,350
What about you Ri On?

427
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,220
The best choice....

428
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,790
is your choice.

429
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,300
-Father!
-Hm?

430
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,060
-Mom..
-Hm.

431
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,490
-Ri On...
-Hm?

432
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,180
- Mom's like that.
- Oh my!

433
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,600
Of course, I respect your decision, but

434
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,380
if you really have to choose one...

435
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,360
Rather than going to Johns Hopkins, I think it's better to become a physician of a chaebol.

436
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,900
Eat a lot and grow bigger Rin.

437
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,490
- Dad's like that.
- Oh my!

438
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,250
I'm your father. Come over here.

439
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,100
If you have to choose one.

440
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,740
I think Johns Hopkins would be better.

441
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,520
They just call it a physician of a chabeol to put it in a good light.

442
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,090
In the end, you are just an employee.

443
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,360
Oh, Ri Jin!

444
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Why? What? I heard everyone is respecting my opinion.

445
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,370
I... I thought that the weather was so nice so

446
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,050
we could take Rin out together for exercise...

447
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,650
Ri On, that's...

448
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,700
I'm sorry... that I'm me...

449
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,030
Ri On!

450
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,220
Ri On!

451
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,580
Oh Ri On!

452
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,180
Yeah!

453
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,690
Ah, but that chaebol has a problem.

454
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,480
What kind of chaebol is he? Is he someone I would know?

455
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,400
I can't tell a patient's history whenever I want.

456
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,150
He's not even your patient.

457
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:51,430
Anyways, because that rich old man started talking about some money bullshit, you were forced to take a break?

458
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,800
He's not an old...

459
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,210
Anyway, you're right.

460
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,680
- I feel sorry.
- For who?

461
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,360
That old man. He basically said that he needs a friend.

462
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,110
Wait, how can you interpret these words like that?

463
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,390
He said that he doesn't want professional treatment from you.

464
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:16,180
He has to hide his disease, and he cannot get treated. And he is fighting alone.

465
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,490
Who do you think a person like that would need most?

466
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,440
- A professional...
- He needs a friend.

467
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,600
Maybe it's because you're a writer but you're too sentimental.

468
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,010
Sis, you see, all these mental illnesses,

469
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,610
are not diseases that can be shouldered alone, but they're also something that can't be treated alone.

470
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,760
Just as the person with the disease exists, so they need to receive treatment through

471
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,960
understanding, attention, and help from many other people.

472
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,390
Are you teaching a psychiatrist right now?

473
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,220
I'm just saying a doctor is not the only thing they need.

474
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,580
They need their family, friends, and significant others.

475
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,270
There's probably no one by that person right now.

476
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,030
"I'm having a hard time." "Help me." "I need friends."

477
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:06,190
He is hiding behind a rough, defensive wall because he doesn't know how to say those simple words.

478
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,090
So do you want me to help that person?

479
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,670
Look, look... The choice is yours.

480
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,470
Don't make someone else choose for you. I never told you what to choose.

481
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,980
I just said that I feel bad for the old man.

482
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,690
But these are things that can be said because it's me. But it's different for you.

483
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,050
Why am I different?

484
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,730
Because you're a pro.

485
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,130
Cold-blooded human being!

486
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,170
Anyway, this brother is very proud of you.

487
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,250
Johns Hopkins or a physician of a chaebol, you are able to choose between the two because you have the skill.

488
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,690
What skills...

489
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:53,180
I'm in an unfair state where I have to buy new shoes because I stepped into poop.

490
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,660
Then just wash it and wear it again.

491
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,730
I said that it is in the worst state.

492
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,970
Then get the one that's prettier!

493
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,550
That's why I'm seriously contemplating about which one is prettier.

494
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,270
It's the sneakers that make you want to run more, jump and fly.

495
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,600
What kind of sneakers like that even exist?

496
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
If there aren't, I'll put them on for you.

497
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,370
So, no matter which one you go with, choose with confidence.

498
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,780
Isn't your bro so cool?

499
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,900
Rin!

500
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,820
Hey, let's go together!

501
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,930
Come over here!

502
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,100
Even if what you choose may be wrong.

503
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,650
Even if you feel like running away when you feel tired.

504
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:00,460
For you to escape more cooler and more elegantly, this brother will

505
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,950
stand behind you with sneakers with wings..

506
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,430
Then we have to get Omega's original copy.

507
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,030
Yes, the scenario lacks a lot of impact.

508
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:17,510
The director wants to see the original manuscript as well, and draw the story from there.

509
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,330
So how about the company in contract with Omega?

510
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,310
We're looking into it through various sources,

511
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:27,360
but other than his editor since his early days, no one knows about his identity.

512
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,820
This is a situation in which we can only communicate with him via his editor.

513
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,780
They are being like this because they don't want anyone else stealing him.

514
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,480
Thanks to Omega, they were able to remodel their workplace.

515
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,220
Why don't you give it a try, Vice President?

516
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,050
It's okay! I'll take care of it.

517
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,660
Our Vice-President has a social position. I don't want him to lose his character.

518
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,360
I am in the middle of securing an MOI with the Chinese Hwamoo Media.

519
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,870
That is being taken care of by Team Leader Jang and I.

520
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:06,290
You still don't know what's going on with your work. That is too much as your first assignment.

521
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,150
From what I remember, we didn't agree to anything beforehand.

522
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,370
I intended to mention this earlier, but I saw that you were absent in the last meeting.

523
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,180
If you change the person in-charge, everything that has been agreed on so far becomes void and you must start all over again.

524
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,050
-This is also a disrespect to the other party--
-Find Writer Omega.

525
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,720
Don't be too angry.
Work is usually like this.

526
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,050
If you don't accept your career, you will be the only one who will go through a hard time.

527
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,690
We have to get a doctor for our company, and I'm wondering if we should get one from Kanghan Hospital.

528
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,970
What do you think?

529
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,310
That hospital is known for its psychiatry department.

530
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:18,790
Who was it? There was one doctor who had a lot of eminence.

531
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,990
Ah, Seok...Doctor Seok something...I can't seem to remember.

532
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,730
Anyways, think about it.

533
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,210
I'm leaving.

534
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,590
Message

535
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,420
Where are you right now? The Chairwoman is looking for you.

536
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,550
- I'm thinking about Kanghan Hospital. What are your thoughts?
- How is it?

537
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,090
It's a living hell, right?

538
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,310
That hospital is known for its psychiatry department.

539
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,290
Do you think you can confine me like this?

540
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:19,410
You can't handle it.
Just live crumpled up like you don't exist.

541
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,230
She's Myung Sung Group's second daughter.

542
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,750
Chairwoman, I'm still...

543
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,030
In the book "Ten Rules to Keep in Mind when Threatened" (baduk book), there's a rule called "Dong Su Sang Eung" (all stones should be connected and move in just one direction to attack).

544
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:50,410
If that side began to make their move just like in baduk, we have to do so as well and block them.

545
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,650
I'm sorry, but I don't understand...

546
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,100
How can you be not informed when you want to run a company?

547
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,880
Why haven't you heard the rumor that has long spread in the market?

548
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,880
Do you want to hear about President Cha Ki Joon's engagement in an economic newspaper?

549
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,020
I may be rude for saying this, but

550
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,790
I don't understand what a couple's engagement and work have anything to do with each other.

551
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:20,340
With the election for Chairman coming up, what do you think rushing an engagement means?

552
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,820
I can't become a well-qualified person for this woman.

553
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,700
Even if you can't become a well-qualified person, she's a well-qualified person to us.

554
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,710
Do you know how many stocks of Seung Jin Group that Chae Yeon's parents own?

555
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,920
He is trying to shake me after gaining control of those stocks. Is it the right time to think about who is right for the position?

556
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:49,550
As I promised, I will try my hardest so that you can keep your power until the selection period.

557
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:55,550
However, after three months, I will return to America.

558
00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:00,140
Is there a reason why you must go to America?

559
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,580
In America... is there another woman?

560
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,280
Don't you even dare to dream about that.

561
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,260
The embarrassment of our family is enough with just your mother.

562
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,030
Please stop drinking!

563
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,140
What's wrong with you, Ahjumma?

564
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,540
What else can I do here but drink?

565
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,370
Why are you trying to stop me!

566
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:36,340
If Big Madame finds out she'll be disgusted. Please stop, Madame!

567
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:42,000
If I have to be scared of what that old bat says, I wouldn't be called Shin Hwa Ran! I'd just be a pile of dirt!

568
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,600
Move, move!

569
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,440
I'm Shin Hwa Ran. Why are you like that?

570
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,780
Ahjumma, what's that?

571
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,460
What's what, Madame?

572
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,810
You don't see that? What's with the stuffed animal in a place without kids?

573
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,230
You're right...

574
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:13,550
When I saw it for the first time, I think it was Vice President who brought it.

575
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,780
Why would our Do Hyun come here? He doesn't even drink.

576
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,020
The day when Younger Mother came to have lunch.

577
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,700
That night, Vice-President was here.

578
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,580
Forget it. I'll clean it up. You can leave, Ahjumma.

579
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,530
But--

580
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,640
I said I'll clean it up! Leave, Ahjumma! Hurry leave!

581
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,850
Hurry, leave!

582
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,900
I'm Nana

583
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,490
It can't be...

584
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,020
Do Hyun doesn't remember her, right?

585
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,700
Are you okay?

586
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,210
Yes. I will be okay.

587
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,010
These are the related articles about Omega's works.

588
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,520
Thanks for you hard work.

589
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,350
Can you give me the novels by Omega?

590
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,750
I think that I should read them.

591
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,090
Is there no answer from Oh Ri Jin yet?

592
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,180
It's not an easy decision to make.

593
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,740
I think you should go home and rest.

594
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,010
I'm going to rest in the dressing room for just an hour.

595
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:40,370
Secretary Ahn, please set up a meeting with the main editor of Omega.

596
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,490
I'm Nana.

597
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,290
He must not remember.

598
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:06,380
Do Hyun must never remember that child.

599
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,530
Please. Please. Please!

600
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,550
Why? You're scared?

601
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,680
Or are you having a hard time? Are you confused?

602
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,550
-It's a living hell, isn't it?
-Shut up! Shut up!

603
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,070
Cha Do Hyun, are you okay?

604
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:48,940
If you meddle with my woman, your woman will be in danger.

605
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,480
You are that kind of existence. A person you want to preciously treasure.

606
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,290
How is Kanghan Hospital?

607
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,470
You have to protect Seung Jin Group, no matter what!

608
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,190
Do you understand?!

609
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,870
I'm.... I'm strangely afraid of fire and basements.

610
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,070
But if I'm together with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

611
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,030
What's your name?

612
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:01,020
What is... your name?

613
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,230
Yes, Professor.

614
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,080
I'm on my way now to the hospital.

615
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,680
Yes, I have decided.

616
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,760
I think that I need to do a little more studying.

617
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,870
Thank you for giving me this good opportunity.

618
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,360
Yes. Talk to you later!

619
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,180
Cha Do Hyun, it's Oh Ri Jin.

620
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,930
I've been thinking...

621
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,260
No, without even having to think about it,

622
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,050
I think that your offer for me to become your physician is a bit too much.

623
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,910
Today, I called to say goodbye.

624
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,470
I'm going to study abroad.

625
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:52,490
You could say that it's all thanks to you.

626
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,690
In the end, I wasn't able to become your physician or friend, but...

627
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,230
it wasn't bad meeting you.

628
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,480
And I've experienced things that I couldn't have.

629
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,990
Oh, thank you for pretending that you are my boyfriend at the hospital.

630
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,410
Thanks to you, it was fun.

631
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:22,080
Ah, and thank you for saving me from the fire.

632
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,260
Anyway... Please be healthy and happy.

633
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,870
I hope that you meet a good physician.

634
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,870
Cha Do Hyun, are you listening?

635
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,170
Cha Do Hyun?

636
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,040
Noona, you're running away from him anyways.

637
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:10,560
In the end, Do Hyun hyung was abandoned by you, Noona. Wasn't he?

638
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:16,360
You...who are you?

639
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,690
Me?

640
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,060
Ahn Yo Sub.

641
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,850
Age is 17.

642
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,950
The nickname Dr. Scofield gave me is...

643
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,920
the suicidal personality.

644
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,350
The suicidal personality?

645
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:05,290
That's right. The suicidal personality.

646
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,880
I quite like that nickname.

647
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,060
What is that sound?

648
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,250
Answer! What in the world are you doing right now?

649
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,780
I'm trying to leave a dying message.

650
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,680
Dying Message?

651
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,580
There is no point in living anymore.

652
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,090
I'm sick of being treated like a monster

653
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,460
or a mutation.

654
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,820
I'm thinking of just dying together with everyone.

655
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,000
Wait! Wait!

656
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,200
Listen to me for a minute Yo Sub.

657
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:57,060
Only death, will make you free.

658
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,450
Most likely, that sky...

659
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,260
-will become my grave.
-Wait!

660
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,700
If you are leaving a dying message,

661
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,410
that means that you have something to say, right?

662
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,640
Please tell me. I'll listen to it all.

663
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,240
I'll head there right now. Just tell me where you are, huh?

664
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,860
Who knows? Where am I?

665
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,330
You should guess.

666
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:34,510
If you can find me before one hour is up then you will be able to stop us.

667
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,610
One hour?

668
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:43,150
That's right. But if you're late even one second,

669
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:49,020
we will already have disappeared and gone.

670
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:54,040
I think I need to hang up now. I need to finish my work quickly. Bye.

671
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,860
Hold on! Wait! Don't hang up! Wait!

672
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:06,130
Do Hyun

673
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,330
Se Gi

674
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,770
Ferry Park

675
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,880
Nana

676
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,210
Yo Sub

677
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:37,070
Kill me!!

678
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,620
♬ The hidden things inside me changed me greatly  ♬

679
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,200
♬ It put me to sleep, tied my hands together, than locked me in a dark room ♬

680
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,890
♬  The lost pieces of time, the memories of love, which I abandoned ♬

681
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,330
♬ I erased them and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell.  ♬

682
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:58,890
♬ Without knowing anything I screamed, and that's all I remember  ♬

683
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,680
♬ My heart, which was as cold as ice, will be forgotten once once I wake up ♬

684
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,890
♬ I want to free myself, from the torment of my sins ♬

685
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,040
♬ Someone take me out, from my spirit full of scars  ♬

686
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,490
♬  The deep night shows you,♬

687
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:15,990
♬ who was not able to leave  ♬

688
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,600
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep♬
