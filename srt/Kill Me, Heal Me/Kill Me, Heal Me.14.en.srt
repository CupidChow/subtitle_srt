1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,820
I told him to change clothes and come out. Just where did he go, really?

2
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,620
For just the remaining two months, can't I

3
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,020
be a man (to you)?

4
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,980
First subsection under the first clause of the contract,

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,270
Party B (Ri Jin) will not fall in love with

6
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,880
Party A (Do Hyun), including the other personas.

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,600
Then I will pay the breach of contract penalty fee stipulated clearly in the contract. I will breach the contract.

8
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,600
What are you trying to do?

9
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,860
You said we have to kiss first.

10
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,430
No, that's not what I meant. Ah, that's not what I'm saying!

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,350
No, that's not what I meant. I'm saying...

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,390
What's wrong?

13
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,520
This picture... Why is this picture here?

14
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,310
Why?

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,070
This is a picture of my mother.

16
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,020
(My mother) On the family register.

17
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,430
That picture is mine.

18
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,970
I said that picture is mine.

19
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,900
Ri On, why do you... Why do you have a picture of Cha Do Hyun's mother?

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,120
Just exactly how do you do your work?!

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
You already got the retaining fee a long time ago, but you still can't find the child?!

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
If you already got the money, you have to work for it!

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,470
Don't worry. We're almost near (finding the child).

24
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,810
You've been saying that you are almost near all the time! Don't you know the meaning of 'near'?

25
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,540
We already found out who took the child on the night of the fire at the main residence.

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,270
Finding her is only a matter of time.

27
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,270
Why my heart had to be broken into pieces,

28
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,560
What those pieces signify, I'm thinking of finding out.

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,730
This is all because of you.

30
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,650
My Do Hyun changing is all because of you!

31
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,310
Get out!

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,710
Take Do Hyun with you and live in the U.S.

33
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,050
Whether you drink alcohol or sing there, live doing whatever you want.

34
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,440
It would have been nice if you had treated him even with just a little affection.

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,330
It would have been nice if you treated him as your grandson,
as a human.

36
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,980
If you had done that, Do Hyun wouldn't have changed.

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,010
Threatening his mom and putting his dad in danger, he wouldn't have changed like that.

38
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,600
Stop giving off your alcohol smell and get out.

39
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,650
Do you still have something to say?

40
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,110
Min Seo Yeon, when that woman decided to get a divorce and
leave the house,

41
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,190
it was me who held onto Joon Pyo.

42
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,690
Your son, when he made his decision to leave this world,

43
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,570
I was the one who held onto him to stay in this world.

44
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,290
Is there anything else you can assert aside from that history?

45
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,510
Up until when are you going to milk those words for your benefit?

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,790
If you really can't forgive what Do Hyun did,

47
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,400
think that you're repaying me.

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,150
If it wasn't for me, he (Joon Pyo) would have been
a dead person back then.

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,540
No matter what you do,

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,020
our Do Hyun is Joon Pyo's only bloodline.

51
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,000
Even if the world changes a dozen times,
Mother, that fact will not change.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,170
So, call Do Hyun back in.

53
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,310
Before he gets more broken, right away! Right away! Right away, Mother, right away!

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,270
Tell me. Tell me!

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,270
Why this picture is yours.

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,610
I didn't know I would be caught like this.

57
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,190
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,520
I am sorry. Actually, I...

59
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,930
I was planning to write a mystery story about conglomerate families,

60
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,390
and I used the Seungjin Group's family as a motif.

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,980
I was treated like a despicable person after Ri Jin caught onto it,

63
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,930
with the meaning of giving up, I burned all of the data I collected.

64
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,150
I didn't know any evidence would remain like this.

65
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,310
Are you saying the truth?

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,820
What other reason would I have?

67
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,900
Is that really all?

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,930
How do I need to explain to make you believe me?

69
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,480
Talk with me for a moment.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,820
You really...! A person's family history...!

71
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,180
Don't think about following us.

72
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,060
What's the reason for having interest in Seungjin Group?

73
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,300
Think of it as a writer's curiosity.

74
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,350
What part of my family's history appeals to your writer's curiosity?

75
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,330
Cha Do Hyun...

76
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,600
What part interested you?

77
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,520
The narrative involving your father, Cha Joon Pyo,

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,970
your mother listed on the family register, Min Seo Yeon, and your birth mother, Shin Hwa Ran.

79
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,120
So? What did you find out?

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,020
I gave up in the middle. There's too much veil covering it to begin with.

81
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,140
Why did you become interested in it (Seungjin Group)?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,940
Let's stop now. I'm not going to write about it.

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,020
Accordingly, it will not be published either. That's why...

84
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,270
please consider it as if it didn't happen.

85
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,840
Ri On, what did you talk about?

86
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,890
Wait a second, Oh Ri On! We're not done talking yet!

87
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,400
Oh Ri On, wait a minute.

88
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
You come here.

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,830
You also come over here!

90
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,630
Hey, hey, hey! What are you two rascals doing right now?

91
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,980
- Father! Father!
- There are two groups of guests here right now!

92
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,880
We're in a state where we would even need to borrow Ri Na's (the dog) hands right now, but you're just goofing around! Come here!

93
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,970
Dad! Why are you showing him like we're some lowly family?

94
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,580
To your guest? There's part-timers! Part-timers!

95
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,000
I sent Young Do on vacation! Also! This guy right here, is he a guest?

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,370
You, go to the kitchen and help your mom!

97
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,820
And also, Perry, you also lend us a hand. Come with me!

98
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,070
- Ah..Ah!!
- Come, come!

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,600
- Dad! Dad!
- Come here. Come here.

100
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,140
Then, is 'The Child in the Basement' also related to Seungjin Group?

101
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,730
What do you mean?

102
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,720
Didn't you use me, the Seungjin family's son, as a motif?

103
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,350
Why would you think like that?

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,270
Because I also

105
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,060
have a fear of basements.

106
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,310
I didn't know that fact.

107
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,270
- Is it the truth?
- It's the truth.

108
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,170
These punks. How can you still be peeling onions?!

109
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,340
When are you going to catch the ducks to go on the customers' table?

110
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,270
- We're working hard.
- We'll finish it quickly.

111
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,110
Ah, I...

112
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,220
We'll peel it quickly!

113
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,310
Where did you get the motif for 'The Child in the Basement' then?

114
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,820
Perhaps is it about Oh Ri Jin and you?

115
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,770
- Cha Do Hyun.
- I heard Oh Ri Jin has a fear of basements as well.

116
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,870
You as well.

117
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,680
Is that novel about the two of you?

118
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,510
These punks, seriously.

119
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,250
Are you filming a melodrama? Are you filming a melodrama?

120
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,230
I almost dropped it.

121
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,770
When are you going to chop the firewood to grill the ducks!

122
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,220
Ah, out of my way! Ah, you really can't work.

123
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,860
You're right. 'The Child in the Basement' is based on Ri Jin's and my childhood.

124
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,390
Then the two of you are not biological siblings.

125
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,920
Didn't you say the boy was afraid of basements

126
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,970
because of love?

127
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,250
Ah, these guys are filming a melodrama all day.

128
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,480
How can you just chop the firewood in half! This brat!

129
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,670
You already know how to do it! You have to chop it in small pieces.

130
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,060
That way, it will burn well! Ugh, what's wrong with you?! Seriously!

131
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,350
So, did you find the reason why Oh Ri Jin is scared of basements?

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Ah, stop it! I'm sick and tired of it to death!

133
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,820
I'm remembering that girl, Ahn Yo Na.

134
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,850
Do you like me?! Stop it.

135
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,690
Cheers!

136
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,510
Happy New Years!

137
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,190
Hey Perry! Really good work today.

138
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,990
That's right. We would've been in big trouble without Perry.

139
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,990
He does his work meticulously well that I want to take him in as a son right away!

140
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,990
That's what I'm saying! If our Ri On

141
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,780
brings us 100 trucks, I'll just be wanting the truck, but I'll just be 'no thank you' to him!

142
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:01,360
-Father...even though you're joking, is that something to say to your own son?
- Hahahaha! Yeah.

143
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,420
Here, let me see...

144
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,710
Perry? Let's see...

145
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,670
Perry, you've worked hard today.

146
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,210
Not at all. It's alright.

147
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,790
You rascal, seriously. Hey, you're supposed to receive what your dad gives you, you punk! Hurry take it!

148
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,360
-That's right.
-Thank you.

149
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,890
You rascal, you end up enjoying it anyways...

150
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,420
Hey, it's a new year, let's take a picture together.

151
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,370
Go bring your selfie stick so my face can come out smaller. Don't you have one that's a meter long or something?

152
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,140
- Bring it quickly.
- Where's the selfie stick? Is that a selfie stick? That's a fishing rod.

153
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,990
Why are you acting like this to your dad today?

154
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,760
Father, why are you being like this to me?

155
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,040
-How strange!
-How strange!

156
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,950
Since we don't have a selfie stick, let's just take it with this.

157
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,390
Look over here!

158
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,530
Now...

159
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,210
Now, now...look over here please. One, two, three!

160
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,240
-Perry! Show your smile!
-Ah, seriously...

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,310
- Gee, smile!
- Are we in some funeral house?
- That's right, that's right!

162
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,520
Today's a day to be smiling. Smile, smile. Honey, move your hair. It's in the way.

163
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,630
Remember this. February 19th, 2015.

164
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,330
The happy moment where we are together.

165
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,120
Ah...what's with that comment?

166
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,500
Here, again! One, two, three!

167
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,140
Hey, my face came out really big. Ri On, you take it. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

168
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,500
Yeah Ri On, try taking it. Take it well!

169
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,190
Here we go. One, two, three!

170
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,610
Hey twins, we look weird on it!

171
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,420
Don't cover my face!

172
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,730
Perry, you punk. Why aren't you drinking the alcohol that this dad picked out?

173
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,820
It tastes bad? Huh? Why? It doesn't seem like good quality? This rascal...

174
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,090
Ah, no...that's not it.

175
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,030
Yeah, just try a sip.

176
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,600
You drank well in the airplane.

177
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,570
I'm quite the bad drinker, that's why. I'm afraid I'm going to make the ambiance here strange.

178
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,190
Don't be like this and have a drink.

179
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,740
The beer you drink after work tastes so good, you know!

180
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,730
No, it's because I have...certain circumstances.

181
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,910
Stop bothering my man everyone!

182
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,860
My man said he doesn't want to!

183
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,810
He said he doesn't want to drink! Isn't this a free country?

184
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,810
Don't we have human rights? Is democracy even alive now!

185
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,200
That Geum-Sa-Ppa (slang for someone who falls in love easily)...  Did she just 'come out' in front of me, of us, just now?

186
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,180
Sister! Where did you learn that habit of getting into a drunken frenzy in front of your parents?

187
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,740
My man, don't worry! I'll be your Black Rose... What was it?

188
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,970
I'll be your Black Rose!

189
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,050
- Oh, Oh Ri Jin!
- Hey! Hey!

190
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,260
She's out. Her fuse already went out. You all worked hard to keep up drinking with Dad. Take her and lay her on her bed.

191
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,660
I'll put her to bed.

192
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,540
No, that's alright. I'll take care of her since this happened because of me.

193
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,040
I'll carry her.

194
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,580
No, but isn't she leaning towards me? I'll take care of it.

195
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,120
She's going to rip! She'll rip!

196
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,710
They've been filming a melodrama the whole day.

197
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,770
I wasn't going to say this, but she's heavy. I'll carry her.

198
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,920
Ah, seriously, your personality is strange. I'll do it.

199
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,580
- I'm her brother.
- I...!

200
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,740
Why did you drink so much?

201
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,480
All of you, stop bothering my man!

202
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,620
Come out now. My mom put a blanket in my room.

203
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,930
Oh Ri On.

204
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm sleeping.

205
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you.

206
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Thanks to you, I was able to meet good people,

207
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,160
a good friend and a good person.

208
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
If you're talking about me when you say a good friend,

209
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,140
you saw me wrong.

210
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,030
I'm not a good friend for you.

211
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,700
If you're okay with a bad friend,

212
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,340
I'll do it, (being a bad) friend.

213
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,010
All of you, stop bothering my man!

214
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,230
My man, don't worry! Should I be your

215
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,850
Black Rose? He said he won't drink it! My man says he doesn't want to!

216
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm ruined in this life! Ruined!

217
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,550
I'm ruined!

218
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:01,460
Ri Na! I want to be born as an animal that can't talk in the next life.

219
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,670
Let's meet again in our next lives. I'll become a Golden Retriever and

220
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:13,200
you can become a Shih Tzu so we can have the conversations we never had in this life.

221
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,110
You don't want to be a Shih Tzu? Then be a Maltese.

222
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,610
I knew you'd be here like this.

223
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,560
Drinking with father when you can't even take alcohol well...

224
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,180
Every time you're like this, Ri Na goes through so much suffering.

225
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,200
Hey, take this. It's hangover reliever.

226
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,850
Nice catch.

227
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,300
So in your dream you were playing with some little boy,

228
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,940
but because you tripped on a stone, you fell over.

229
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,520
So that little boy helped you up but then suddenly

230
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,190
a black shadow covered you.

231
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,460
But you got so scared that you flopped down.

232
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,520
That's not that scary.

233
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,580
Who asked you to be scared? I, who was dreaming, was scared.

234
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,310
That was me.

235
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,560
- Really?
- It is me.

236
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,070
And that dark shadow is...

237
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,540
is this. This.

238
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,590
What is that? Is it a Sadako?
Sadako: The ghost that appears in the Japanese movie 'Ring'

239
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,140
Ah, the advertising dancing balloon!

240
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,790
At that time, there was a big supermarket near our house so

241
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,100
they had an advertising dancing balloon.

242
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,670
Advertising dancing balloon?

243
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,050
Yeah, that's right. But you were so dumb that

244
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,200
you were really scared of that.

245
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,010
So that's what it was.

246
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,620
As expected, I'm most comfortable when speaking with you.

247
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,350
Here~

248
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,930
Eat it. We eat it occasionally as a midnight snack.

249
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,570
Please speak comfortably.

250
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,020
Should I?

251
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,380
My kids like that a lot. Mostly as a hangover reliever.

252
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,860
I'll eat well.

253
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,910
This may be a rude question, but what's your occupation?

254
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,720
Excuse me?

255
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,660
I've been working at a company but I got fired.

256
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,490
Fired? But how?

257
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,630
It's just my superior kept treating me badly, in a fit of anger, I bit the back of his hand.

258
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,740
Contrary to your looks, I guess you have a temper?

259
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,110
But how's our Ri Jin?

260
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,510
Excuse me?

261
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,380
From a man's perspective, how's our Ri Jin?

262
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,900
- Is she not good?
- No.

263
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,730
-She's cute.
-Cute? Really?

264
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm not saying this because I'm her mom, but

265
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:55,040
she's really alright as a person. She's a genuine person, competent and confident.

266
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,720
- She's a kid of overflowing qualities to us.
- I see.

267
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,560
But their relationship as brother and sister looks really nice.

268
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,880
Aigoo, nice? They just growl at each other like they're some male dogs engaged in a fight of rank.

269
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,760
I had quite a hard time raising them because both of them are excessively full of energy.

270
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,840
I think it's because I lived without a sibling that I'm jealous.

271
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,090
Should I show you pictures of our kids when they were younger?

272
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,830
How come I don't have memories of when I was young?

273
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:27,490
We're the same age but you remember everything clearly of when you were younger.

274
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,330
Mom told you about that. There was a big fire in our house in the past,

275
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,410
and it was only you that inhaled toxic gas. That's why your memory was damaged.

276
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,460
I know.

277
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,690
Maybe that's why

278
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,820
I understand Mr. Cha more.

279
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:53,510
For me... you and our mom and dad filled my empty memories every day, but

280
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,930
Mr. Cha's family is trying to hide it.

281
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,260
Trying to cover up the pain of the past or trying to glamorize it,

282
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,340
it definitely does not help with the healing of the wounds.

283
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,340
But

284
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,320
I didn't forget everything.

285
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,290
There are some things that I remember.

286
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,660
Like what?

287
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,190
The day you and I

288
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,040
became twin siblings.

289
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,390
From now on, you guys are siblings. Twin siblings.

290
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,660
Ri On is the older brother, and Ri Jin is the younger sister.

291
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,060
-Ri On!
-Oh!

292
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,240
Hey, hey! What's wrong! Aigoo, hey...what's wrong with you?

293
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,620
Try hitting back, too!

294
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,860
Ri On!

295
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,630
I don't want a younger sibling that only takes hits. I want a tough sibling!

296
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,530
If you're not, I won't have you as my sister!

297
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,210
You...

298
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,200
knew?

299
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,160
What smell is this? Isn't it mom's soup? Let's go recover from our hangover!

300
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,380
Quickly!

301
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,800
This is on their 8th birthday. Weren't they cute?

302
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,810
Now that I think about it, their birthdays are the same since they're twins.

303
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,050
Of course.

304
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,960
This is our Ri On. This is also a picture from then.

305
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,250
Ah, on this day, they fought with each other. Look at her cranky face. Aigoo, aigoo. How cute.

306
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,540
What's... your name?

307
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,680
What's your name?

308
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,710
But if your American name is Perry, what's your Korean name?

309
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,460
My Korean name is Cha--

310
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,410
The smell of noodles! The smell of noodles!

311
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,310
What the? You two are having a night snack by yourselves? What is this?

312
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,350
You guys ate sweet potatoes secretly together!

313
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,740
My insides are hurting right now that I want some soup,

314
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,090
give me some too~ Give me some too!

315
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,270
Me too! Me too!

316
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,210
Half soup, half glass noodles for me.

317
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,830
Lots and lots of soup for me!

318
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,420
-All right, all right!
-Me too, me too!

319
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go!

320
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,660
Hey, you're eating again after eating all those sweet potatoes?

321
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,270
Secretary Ahn, did you have a happy New Year?
{Soellal - Korean Lunar New Year}

322
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,090
Where are you right now?

323
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,120
I called you but you weren't picking up so I'm at your house.

324
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,360
Somehow I ended up at Oh Ri Jin's house.

325
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,350
What? How did you end up all the way there?

326
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,550
Thanks to Yo Na.

327
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,590
Y-Yo-Yo Na?

328
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,700
Are you alright? Did anything happen? Do I not need to go?

329
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,360
Nothing happened and I don't think you need to come.

330
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,470
Right now, I'm very alright.

331
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,480
It's very comfortable...

332
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,520
and warm.

333
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,270
Ah, I received allowance today, too.

334
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,300
Maybe it's because it's my first time receiving allowance, but

335
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,660
I'm happily thinking about what to do with it.

336
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,090
Ah, but for what reason did you call me?

337
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,080
We have secured one person who had witnessed the fire at the main residence 21 years ago.

338
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,650
Who is that?

339
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,930
On the day of the fire, there was a garden party for the appointment of President Cha Joon Pyo as Chairman.

340
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,170
It was someone who entered as an employee of the catering service.

341
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,700
I think he knows something.

342
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,270
You said that someone purposely covered the identities of the people working at the main residence,

343
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,130
so investigating external people could also be a way.

344
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,150
Anyhow, please look into it more. I'll meet with you as soon as I come back.

345
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh Ri Jin! What are you doing over there?

346
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,340
Oh? Where are we going?

347
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,510
I think we need to match our mouths.

348
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,500
By any chance, that mouth isn't that mouth, is it?

349
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,730
If you're curious, follow me.

350
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,630
So where are we going?

351
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,860
Where do you think I'm going right now?

352
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,020
That key, when did you steal it?

353
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,850
Come here.

354
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,590
Hurry on over here.

355
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,870
I'm sorry if you got surprised over my drunken behavior.

356
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,530
Well, there wasn't any deep meaning to it and...

357
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,870
Frankly speaking, you're a man, not a woman, right?

358
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,150
- Oh Ri Jin.
- Yes!

359
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:26,140
I'm sorry. You were really embarrassed in front of my family, right?

360
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,070
If you have something that's giving you a hard time or are curious about something...

361
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,570
Or when you have something you want to talk about,

362
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:40,270
can't I be the first person who you would want to listen to it?

363
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,710
When you're scared of going to the basement and want to go with someone,

364
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,170
when there's something you want to avoid that badly,

365
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,570
can't I do it with you?

366
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,350
I, too, like you, have two bad memories about the basement.

367
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,690
One is from my childhood, of which I am still finding the cause until now.

368
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,310
Another one is the thing that happened recently.

369
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,140
Why did you stop?!

370
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,150
- If a man drew out his sword, he should see it to the end. Why are you so cowardly?!
- What?

371
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,980
Oh Ri Jin.

372
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,830
Yes...

373
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,810
Whatever it is, I want to overcome everything with you.

374
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,320
My bad memories,

375
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,970
I want to erase them with my good memories with you.

376
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,820
-That's why...
- That's why...

377
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
That's why...

378
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,310
I'll do it with you.

379
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,960
♬ The deep night show you, ♬

380
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,440
♬ who was not able to leave ♬

381
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,770
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep ♬

382
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,950
♬ and kisses me again  ♬

383
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,190
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

384
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,730
♬  and your scent ♬

385
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,150
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬

386
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,770
♬ Where are you? ♬

387
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,310
It's the same dream again.

388
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,640
No, that's wrong. It was always me who held on.

389
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,910
Don't leave, play with me.

390
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,020
A girl?

391
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,400
Sorry. I'll come secretly tomorrow night.

392
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,230
Can't we play for a bit longer?

393
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,970
Instead, I'll show you something cool.

394
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,350
Something cool? What?

395
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,890
It's my mom. She's pretty, right?

396
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,370
The picture of my deceased mother!

397
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,970
She said she'll pick me up if I just sleep three times.

398
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,750
She might not come.

399
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,270
- She said she'll come. She said she'll definitely come.
- She won't come.

400
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,770
Your mom...

401
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,600
is dead.

402
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,980
No, she didn't die.

403
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,770
She didn't die!

404
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,230
Who- who are you?

405
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,510
Na Na.

406
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,230
You are...Na Na?

407
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,520
Her name is Na Na.

408
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,310
This is Na Na, who I drew.

409
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,870
It's cute, right?

410
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,310
Then, other than the bear's name,

411
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,900
what is your name?

412
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,220
My name...

413
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,890
Father, I was wrong!

414
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,730
I was wrong! I won't come to the basement to play ever again.

415
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,640
Who did I say will be punished if you can't do it correctly?

416
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,370
Don't do it.

417
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,980
Don't hit her.

418
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,090
Hit me instead.

419
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,100
I'll get hit!

420
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,180
I'll get hit!

421
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,350
-Save me. I was wrong!
-I was wrong!

422
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,360
Oppa! Cha Do Hyun!

423
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,060
Wake up and let's have breakfast!

424
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,020
Hey! Hey! Ah, hey!

425
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,580
Are you a frog?

426
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,020
Ah, what? I won't eat. Stop eating.

427
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,970
Mr. Cha. Where did Mr. Cha go?

428
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,150
I sensed him leaving this morning. He must have left then.

429
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,230
Without saying goodbye?

430
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,890
Ri Jin, come out. Professor is here.

431
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,000
- Here you go.
- Aiyo, thank you.

432
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,620
Thank you for calling me over.

433
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,820
Since I'm a goose father (wife and children live abroad to study),

434
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,230
I was thinking of just getting instant food the morning of the Lunar New Year,

435
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,270
but I think I hit my lucky day for this year.

436
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,460
If you feel bothered preparing food, you are always welcome here.

437
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,150
But is Perry still resting?

438
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,270
It looked like he went home. Seeing how he changed his clothes and left.

439
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,730
Without even saying he's coming or leaving? Did you make him sad about something yesterday?

440
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,820
They were eating sweet potatoes, leaving Perry out.

441
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,230
If it's Perry, who?

442
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,070
-Cha Do Hyun.
- Why is he here?

443
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,800
-Try it, try it!
-Hurry try it before it becomes cold Professor.

444
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,720
Ah, yes.

445
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,610
I'm a picky eater (I have a short mouth) but this is really good!

446
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,690
But your mouth looks as long as a selfie stick. You look like you would eat anything well. Right?

447
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,610
I know right? Have some.

448
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,470
Eat a lot.

449
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,270
Wow, this is tasty.

450
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,310
The people who pay frequent visits to this house up until last year,

451
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,720
I wonder which house they are paying visits to now?

452
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,400
Figures, since they come if the minister's dog dies,

453
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,360
but if the minister dies, no one comes. Ha! (means no one is helping you on times of need)

454
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,040
Old sayings aren't wrong.

455
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,790
You have no successor to put forward,

456
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,960
what use is it to look good in front of you now?

457
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,670
Don't block things that can be blocked with a hoe, with a spade.

458
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,270
I'm saying to secure our Do Hyun firmly to the company before it's too late.

459
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,520
Chairwoman, the people from the second residence are here.

460
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,940
You must be really busy right now.

461
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,420
Anyways, thanks for coming like this.

462
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,050
You're welcome. No matter how busy we are, we have to perform our duty as human beings.

463
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,610
That way, wouldn't our children learn as they see?

464
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,190
Of course. It is only proper to give you their greetings before the engagement.

465
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,540
Your true intention is so obvious.

466
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,190
Like a drama we're watching while knowing how the ending will go,

467
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,230
would there be something as uninteresting as that?

468
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,070
You must be here to brag about the engagement, younger Sister-in-law?

469
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:14,000
As for you, Brother-in-law, you must be here to make sure my Do Hyun has been completely cut off.

470
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,710
Of course, you had to come even if you were busy.

471
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,710
Where else would such an amusing sight be.

472
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,960
How have you been?

473
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,930
It's been a while, President Cha. It's nice not seeing Do Hyun, right?

474
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,070
She is the person I'm going to be engaged to.

475
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,920
Long time, no see, Chae Yeon.

476
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,000
- Yes. Have you been well?
- There's no way.

477
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,060
But you don't look so well yourself. What's with your expression?

478
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,090
It's like that of a girl taken into a rich family as a future daughter-in-law?

479
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,560
- Look here!
- Look at what?

480
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,900
We keep on seeing each other anyway, is there something good to deal with?

481
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,330
I have to go get wine to entertain our precious guests.

482
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,120
Today, I'll bring out very expensive wine.

483
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:05,300
Don't purposely get your face dirty. It's a waste.

484
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,910
Ah, surprised me.

485
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,430
Do Hyun...

486
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,990
If you're home, you should have come in. Why are you here?

487
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,030
The child you're looking for... is my deceased Mother,

488
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,890
Min Seo Yeon's child, am I right?

489
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,090
Min Seo Yeon's child?

490
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,320
That woman had a child?

491
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,890
It's my first time hearing about it.

492
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,210
Is it correct that the child that was with me in the basement

493
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,280
is Min Seo Yeon's daughter?

494
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,590
How many times are you going to ask?

495
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,430
In this house, there was no other child besides you!

496
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,970
Was the child that was abused not me,

497
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,500
- but that child?
- Just what are you saying?

498
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,420
Just who was it who got abused by that gentle man?
- You saw!

499
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,100
You have always been a bystander. And you used that to survive in Seungjin Group!

500
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,570
But why did you lie? Why? Just why?!

501
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,530
My father who was the perpetrator and my mother who was the witness made me into the witness and the perpetrator.

502
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,650
I can no longer be the victim!

503
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,280
I will find that child first.

504
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,770
I will find her and atone and atone again.

505
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,130
If only I could compensate for that scar,

506
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,860
even if I have to sell Seungjin Group, I will compensate for it.

507
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,240
Do you understand, Mother? Do you understand, Mother?

508
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,580
I will no longer believe your words. Only the truth that I find;

509
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,340
I will only believe the memories I remember.

510
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,380
According to my kid, Do Hyun said he won't go back to America because he has something to do.

511
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,610
Is he planning on making a subsidiary, perhaps?

512
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,940
No. He will go to America soon.

513
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,880
I have concluded that he still is lacking in experience based on his management work.

514
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,290
I hastily asked him to come back when he needed to study more,

515
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,450
I was thinking that maybe I asked him to come back too soon--

516
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:38,970
21 years ago, were you aware of what was going on in this mansion?

517
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,020
- Quietly close your mouth and leave.
- I will find it out.

518
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,110
What happened in this mansion 21 years ago,

519
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,060
just what role you had in that incident!

520
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,280
I will reveal all of it!

521
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,100
Mother-in-law, are you okay?

522
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,190
You heard what Do Hyun said before, right?

523
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,970
- What do you think that means?
- Who knows?

524
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,840
If it's 21 years ago, it was when there was a fire.

525
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,180
Other than the fire, what else was there? Perhaps...

526
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,170
that child will have something to do with it?

527
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:46,510
I'm not sure... but a secret that must not come out to the world

528
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,190
occurred in that mansion, that's for sure.

529
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,150
He said Mother-in-law had some sort of role in it.

530
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,250
- Just what could that be?
- Whatever it is, it's interesting.

531
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,930
It will become interesting.

532
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:12,330
I will find that child first.
I will find her and atone and atone again.

533
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,350
If I could only compensate for that scar,

534
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,330
even if I have to sell Seungjin Group, I will compensate for it.

535
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,420
No, Do Hyun.

536
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,260
You can't do that...

537
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,600
Who do you think I lived for...

538
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,270
What do you think is the reason why I endured up till now...

539
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,610
You can't do that...

540
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,670
No...

541
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,500
- Have you found her yet?
- I found her.

542
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,640
- I sent a picture to your cellphone just now.
- I got it.

543
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,210
For now, hang up.

544
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,880
- What...
- Who is this lady?

545
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,290
I'm the new secretary, Oh Ri Jin.

546
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:29,560
When Vice President was young, did he have a friend who was the same age as him?

547
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,370
When I saw him resting in the dressing room yesterday,

548
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,090
it seemed like he was having a nightmare.

549
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:41,290
While looking for some child in his sleep.

550
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,350
Secretary Oh... is Min Seo Yeon's daughter.

551
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,290
She already approached Do Hyun.

552
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:22,270
Catch her. Use any method and catch her.

553
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:28,190
If she doesn't listen, even if you have to make her faint, drag her in front of me immediately!

554
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,270
You felt a déjà vu when you went to the mansion with Cha Do Hyun?

555
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,360
Yes. When I went into the mansion's wine storehouse,

556
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,210
I suddenly remembered an unfamiliar basement.

557
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:46,500
I felt that when I was young, I drew drawings on the basement wall.

558
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,660
But I'm not sure if they are really my memories

559
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,000
or if I'm mistaking Mr. Cha's memories

560
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,800
as if they're my own.

561
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,900
So you lost consciousness from that shock.

562
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:07,090
Truthfully, I have a fear of basements, too.

563
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,970
It's gotten a lot better now but sometimes,

564
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,340
when I go into an unfamiliar basement, I get a bit scared.

565
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,210
But a concrete feeling like this was a first, so

566
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,670
I was a bit confused.

567
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,220
I thought it would be of help that Mr. Cha is recollecting his memories,

568
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,210
but rather, your memories are just getting confused. This is strange.

569
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:33,370
I knew from before that my childhood memories were imperfect.

570
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,430
But there was never a time I was having a hard time or uncomfortable.

571
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,250
Why am I suddenly...

572
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,330
remembering it?

573
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,670
Humans often suppress their bad memories

574
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,800
in order to become comfortable.

575
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,970
Usually it isn't really a bad thing. However,

576
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:01,430
if the imperfection of your memories only brings you confusion or pain in the current situation,

577
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,820
that means then that there are remains of those feelings that haven't been dealt with.

578
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,220
Who knows, this must be the right time

579
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,290
to look back at the wounds of the past.

580
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,300
Come to the office some time. If you can, along with Mr. Cha.

581
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,840
If Mr. Cha is in your memories,

582
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,400
having a conversation with the two of you is also a method.

583
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,670
Yes, I'll think about it.

584
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,390
Before your mother packs food for me, I'm going to run away.

585
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,040
I didn't even finish the food she had given me before.

586
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,570
Professor! Thank you!

587
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,240
Be careful on your way back!

588
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,160
- Ms. Oh Ri Jin?
- Huh?

589
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,390
Who may you be?

590
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:19,270
There is someone who wants to meet you.
Please come with us for a moment.

591
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:23,070
Who? For what reason?

592
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,460
Tell that person to reveal his name and to contact me directly. Then.

593
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,590
Take her.

594
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,980
Let's go! Come with Oppa for a walk!

595
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,470
Ri Jin!

596
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,180
Ri Jin!

597
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,590
I'm sorry I left without a word this morning--

598
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,080
Ri Jin has been kidnapped.

599
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,060
What did you just say?

600
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,720
Do you have any idea as to why?

601
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,850
No, you need to explain it so I can understand!
Why on earth would Oh Ri Jin suddenly get kidnapped?!

602
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,290
If you don't know anything, never mind. I'll be hanging up.

603
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,640
- Oh Ri On!
- I'm warning you!

604
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,190
If it's because of you,

605
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,520
I won't leave you alone.

606
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,770
Oh Ri On! Oh Ri On!

607
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,120
I put a tracking device on Oh Ri Jin's phone.

608
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,570
I brought her to the villa.

609
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,220
Yes, we weren't followed.

610
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,650
Move aside! You can't handle it.

611
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,500
No, I will do it.

612
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,460
If you leave it to me, you'll be a lot more comfortable.

613
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:21,630
No, this is my fight! I will do it!!

614
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:39,900
Remember this. Remember this well.
You called me out. Since a long, long time ago.

615
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,720
- Don't leave.
- Don't leave.

616
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,290
- Play with me.
- Play with me.

617
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,520
- Don't leave.
- Don't leave.

618
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,990
- Play with me.
- Play with me.

619
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,540
Don't leave. Play with me.

620
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,190
You're the one who called me.

621
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,170
Remember.

622
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,920
The memories that Mr. Cha didn't have but only you have,

623
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,060
was I in there?

624
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,550
Oh Ri Jin.

625
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,890
Oh Ri Jin...

626
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,280
It was Oh Ri Jin.

627
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,130
Don't leave. Play with me.

628
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,920
Don't leave. Don't leave.

629
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,790
Play with me.

630
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,830
If I'm alone, I'm scared. But...

631
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,340
If I'm with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

632
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,170
Me...I'm strangely scared of fires and basements.

633
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:17,520
But, if I'm with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

634
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,820
If Dad finds out that I'm here, you'll get scolded.

635
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,160
I'll come here again tomorrow night. I'll come here every day.

636
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,070
Will you really come? You need to come.

637
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:36,770
Okay. Remember. Every night at 10.

638
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,660
The time we promised (to meet).

639
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,170
Remember...

640
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,150
- Every night at 10.
- 10 at night.

641
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,680
- The time we promised.
- The time we promised.

642
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,140
The time we promised.

643
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,270
Remember.

644
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,710
January 7th, 2015, 10 PM on the dot.

645
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,920
♫ You see the things hidden inside me ♫

646
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,830
The time I fell for you.
♫ They changed me greatly. They put me to sleep, ♫

647
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:17,740
♫ tied my hands and locked me in a dark room. ♫
♫ The pieces of my lost time, ♫

648
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:23,620
♫ The memories of love I abandoned ♫
♫ They were erased and I'm left as an abandoned shell ♫

649
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,520
Save me. Save me. I-I was wrong.
♫ Without knowing anything, I just screamed and that's all I remember. My heart which is cold as ice ♫

650
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,820
- I was wrong. I was wrong.
- Save me. I was wrong.
♫ will melt when I wake up. I want to free myself.♫

651
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,020
I was wrong.
♫ From the torment of my sins. Someone take me out, from my ♫

652
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,400
♫ scar-filled soul ♫

653
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:43,860
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to leave  ♬

654
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:52,310
AH!!
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again  ♬

655
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:58,030
I also would like to be with you forever.
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

656
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:03,210
That child should have been saved instead! That child should have been saved instead of me!
♫ echo in my ears every day ♫

657
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,820
That's what's humane!
♫ Where are you ♫

658
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,540
♫ You're hidden in a place where I can't see you. The pain that you received instead of me. ♫

659
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,870
Our father...
♫ My angers become one it will chase my lost memories which fell in deep slumber. ♫

660
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,480
That's why back then...
♫ Even if I want to find the real me, instead of you, ♫

661
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,440
You shouldn't have saved me.
♫ The bruise inside my chest is too big.
Even if I try to hide them, the rascals hiding inside me ♫

662
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,750
I became a monster because of you, Father.
♫ appears and wakes me up. From the other side of my horrific memories, I came to face you ♫

663
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,900
♫ You even embraced my lost emotions and helped me, who was down, up. ♫

664
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,270
You can't handle it. So, cover it up.
♫ So that I don’t let my hand go, I’m trying my hardest to erase the hellish times ♫

665
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,760
Even back then you didn't have the courage to endure the pain so you ran away.
♫ In this place that I locked myself ♫

666
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,670
So I faced that pain instead of you.
♫ I walk through the darkness because ♫

667
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,390
If it weren't for me...You!
♫ I want to find you. ♫

668
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,440
You would have already died while struggling alone in misery.
♫ I can't touch you ♫

669
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,500
But who's calling who a fake right now?!
♫ or embrace you. ♫

670
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,830
21 years ago on that day...

671
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,270
- That child should have been saved instead!
- The person who saved you from the fire...
♫ What controlled me ♫

672
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,000
- was your father!
- That child should have been saved instead of me!

673
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,360
That's what's humane!

674
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,170
♬ Embraces and kisses me, and I can no longer see it anymore ♬

675
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,840
♬ The deep night show you, ♬

676
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,270
Don't go!
♬ who was not able to leave ♬

677
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,830
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep ♬

678
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:16,750
Don't go...
♬ and kisses me again  ♬

679
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:22,710
Play with me...
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

680
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:28,550
Don't go...
♬ echo in my ears every day ♬

681
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,570
Don't go!
♬ Where are you? ♬

682
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:37,590
♬ On the night sky, which I cannot reach, I see you, who is turning back ♬

683
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:45,110
♬ From this hard day, it makes a picture ♬

684
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:50,600
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me ♬
♬ and I call for you desperately ♬
