00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,070
[Final Episode]
- Another new personality, X?
-Ah, yes.

2
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,950
For your reference, I brought the captured CCTV footage with me.

3
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,580
You said Perry Park vanished the other day, right?

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,480
Yes. He vanished after saying his goodbyes properly.

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,890
During the process of amalgamation treatment,

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,530
there are frequent cases where a new personality appears.

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,190
Is it a bad omen?

8
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,250
Well, for now

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,950
this means that the amalgamation process will be not be smooth sailing.

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,210
It all depends on the nature of this new personality.

11
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,340
If this personality is an ISH... (Inner Self Helper: a personality who helps with the fusion of the other personalities, or someone who plays the role of a protector).

12
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,690
That is, if, he is an inner self helper, then it's favorable.

13
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,380
An inner self helper?

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,710
When the patient himself gains a strong will for amalgamation treatment,

15
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,990
- he makes a super-egoistic existence to help him.
- I see.

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,600
But normally, in the cases of ISH's,

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,650
he doesn't reveal his true nature to others.

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,350
So... he's not a helper?

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,670
If that's the case,

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,210
then it all depends if he's here to help with the fusion of the personalities,

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,640
or if he's here to disrupt.

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,030
Who?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Will you open the bag?

24
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,310
As you've ordered, I tried tracking the account from borrowed-name bank accounts.

25
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,330
What's wrong?

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,850
Just now... I was co-conscious.

27
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,620
What?

28
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,140
I think I saw Mr. X.

29
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,990
Chairperson! Are you alright?

30
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,340
Chairperson! Chairperson! This won't do. We have to go home first!

31
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,850
Let's go.

32
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,710
How do you feel?

33
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,030
Yes. I got a lot better.

34
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,440
I've organized the interim financial statements and account books of the affiliated businesses within the Group.

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,350
I've checked and attached the possessed stocks of the company's board members and major shareholders as well,

36
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,150
so please organize them and make them into materials for the meeting.

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,780
When did you get all of this ready?

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,180
I told you already, I didn't only play and eat up till now.

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,890
That...

40
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,870
Yes.

41
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,540
The person who was President Min Seo Yeon's chauffeur

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,230
called.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,780
Yes.

44
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,680
He was unforthcoming, saying it was a matter of the past, but in actuality, during the accident,

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,520
he said that newly-promoted ex-Chairman Cha Joon Pyo seemed to have intervened at the time.

46
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,330
The evidence?

47
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,340
On the morning of the accident, the new chauffeur has said

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,500
that he came under the introduction of Managing Director Cha Joon Pyo.

49
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,810
Are you alright?

50
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,200
I think I better call Oh Ri Jin...

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,240
Ah! It's okay.

52
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,180
Secretary Ahn, please go now and meet the driver and secure his testimony.

53
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,650
Are you really alright?

54
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,910
I need to know the accident's full story.

55
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,410
Please hurry.

56
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,130
I understand. I'll do it.

57
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,110
She's my mother. Pretty, right? She said she's coming to get me after three nights.

58
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,890
Ah!

59
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,490
- Oh my!
- Where is our Princess Ahn Yo Na going?

60
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,040
You know already where I'm going, so why are you being like this? Let go!

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,570
You already you can't do that, but I wonder why you keep rebelling?

62
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,510
- Come with me, hurry!
- Let go, let go!

63
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,580
This fierce bitch!

64
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,710
Where are you going? Hurry!

65
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,370
Mr.X!

66
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,360
Yo Na, do you know who Mr. X is?

67
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,140
Of course, I know who he is. Where are you touching me with your dirty hands!

68
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,070
Of course, I know.

69
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,550
I won't tell it to you for free!

70
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,850
I'm such a cool woman. Give and take out.

71
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,260
You mean give and take.

72
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,750
You ignorant wench!

73
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,970
Give and take...

74
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,590
out.

75
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,720
Hey! You scared me! You..what?
When did you come?

76
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,190
I'm sorry, Oh Ri On. I'm really sorry! I'll live the rest of my life atoning for this.

77
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,830
You must be kidding me. You turn up out of the blue and say cautionary words. Hmph! Seriously...

78
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,390
Oppa!

79
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,400
Oppa!

80
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,530
Oppa!~

81
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,050
Oppa!

82
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,200
- Oppa!
- Mom! Mom!

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,460
Oppa!

84
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,490
- Ugh, my style is getting wrinkled!
- How did you come here? How...

85
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,880
Save me!

86
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,590
I'm sorry, Oh Ri On. Forgive me, Oh Ri On. I love you, Oh Ri On!

87
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,310
Wait a minute!

88
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,070
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

89
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,240
-Oppa! Get up, get up, get up.
-Stop! Stop! Stop!

90
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,310
Get up. Oppa. Come over here.

91
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,620
Hush! Hush, hush, hush~

92
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Wait! Wait a minute! Oppa is going to the military!

93
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,120
Oppa...

94
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,750
Oppa, what are you talking about right now?

95
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,530
Oppa... is going to the military.

96
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,830
Yo Na will wait---
- Don't wait!

97
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,350
I might even stay there. If it matches me!

98
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,150
Stay there...

99
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,560
Eul Ji Unit, 12th Division, TI&E (Troop Information & Education) personnel.

100
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,290
Discharged in 2010. You $#^%&$!

101
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,560
-Huh?
-Seriously, Oppa.

102
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,450
What do you think this is? Huh?

103
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,430
Oppa, your notice for the reserve army training has arrived!

104
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,780
T-t-this...where did you---

105
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,680
If you lie to me one more time, you'll get in trouble with me, Oppa!

106
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,690
Stay still, stay still, stay still, stay still, stay still!
Oppa, smile!

107
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,110
Beautiful!

108
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,890
Heads up.

109
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,150
Smile.

110
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,210
Oppa, you have to look here, Oppa!

111
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,570
Ah!

112
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,010
Lucky~

113
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,290
Ri On...are you okay?

114
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,340
Just don't make a rumor about it.

115
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,370
I'm ruined in this lifetime!

116
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,180
Come on, it's out of focus.

117
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,170
As you promised, tell me who X is now.

118
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,820
This is totally perfect! Oh~ It's so perfect!

119
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,760
My Oppa's everyday life is a pictorial shoot~

120
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,230
Ahn Yo Na!

121
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,120
Smile brightly.

122
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,660
As if you're really, really happy.

123
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,500
What?

124
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,580
Mr. X disappears when you become happy.

125
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,210
What are you talking about? Explain it so that I can understand.

126
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,360
That's it for the information.

127
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,270
I'm sleepy. Yo Na's sleepy.

128
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,320
-Let's talk after I wake up.
-Ah!

129
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,150
Hey! Ahn Yo Na, you seriously-!

130
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Fine...

131
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,000
- Hey, you wench.
- What, you wench?

132
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,730
-Thanks.
-For what?

133
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,530
Thanks for treating me as a friend,

134
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,900
thanks for treating me as a sibling,

135
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,250
and thanks for making my wish come true today.

136
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,730
Anyway, thanks for everything.

137
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:19,760
During my lifetime... you were the first girl I met that could fight.

138
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,150
Take care.

139
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,220
Ahn Yo Na?

140
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,670
You're so rude.

141
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,860
Ahn Yo Na. Come over here.

142
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,030
Ri Jin Noona is by Do Hyun Hyung's side.

143
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,540
We have to dissapear so that Hyung and Noona can become comfortable.

144
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,960
Hurry come!

145
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,030
- The wind is rising, we must try to live.
(Quoted from a poem by Paul Valery.)

146
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,360
Bye, Noona. Thank you.

147
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:05,380
♬ When I first met you♬

148
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:14,600
♬You were a small girl♬
(Paul Valery-The graveyard by the sea)

149
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:23,630
♬You had a violet in your hair♬

150
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,500
♬You told me with a smile♬

151
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,900
Ahn Yo Na

152
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:41,430
♬That you wanted to fly far away like a bird♬

153
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,730
Oh Ri Jin...

154
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,610
- Yo Na... has left.
♬ When I met you again♬

155
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,650
- I know.
♬ You looked ♬

156
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,020
- After doing this...
♫ You were very thin ♫

157
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,730
- After doing this...!
[Fierce wench]
♫ Beads of sweat ♫

158
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,110
♫ on your forehead ♫

159
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,340
- While I was watching over her, I fell asleep for a moment.
♫ You told me with a smile ♫

160
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,400
She left then!

161
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,720
- That mean wench!
♫ That tears fall ♫

162
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,860
♬over the littlest things ♬

163
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,500
Unni!

164
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,070
Your makeup's going to get ruined.

165
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,940
Patient, are you coming to your senses?

166
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,850
Patient? Patient!

167
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,750
Doctor! Doctor!

168
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,920
Ex-Chairman Cha Joon Pyo has woken up.

169
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,860
Your father wants to see you and Oh Ri Jin together.

170
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,400
According to the ex-Chairman, to make atonement for the incident back then,

171
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,250
he couldn't bear to just leave. And if you could just give him a chance.

172
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,370
Wait a minute!

173
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,580
Where are you going, without even saying a word?

174
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,220
Where are you going, leaving your private doctor behind?

175
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,650
I'll see you later at home.

176
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,160
Ah...

177
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,040
The perpetrator has woken up.

178
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,880
That perpetrator is my father.

179
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,440
On top of that,

180
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,430
if the one who killed Oh Ri Jin's biological mother was

181
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,300
my father...

182
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,690
Mr. Cha!

183
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,110
What the? He still hasn't come back?

184
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,280
Cha Do Hyun, what are you doing here...

185
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,180
Cha Do Hyun?

186
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,200
Who...?

187
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,060
Perhaps,

188
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,690
Nana?

189
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,530
This guy's Nana.

190
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,130
My name is...

191
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,390
I know.

192
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,430
Cha Do Hyun, right?

193
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,540
How did you know? My name?

194
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,450
Because you're...

195
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,690
me.

196
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,570
You see, this Unni

197
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,100
is the adult self of you.

198
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,440
And you're...Unni's self when she was a kid.

199
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,660
Do you understand so far?

200
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,890
Is Unni pretty?

201
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,890
Yeah! Pretty.

202
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,980
See?

203
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,110
Unni grew up this pretty and well,

204
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,990
I'm doing very well.

205
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,330
Receiving lots of love from my parents as well.

206
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,860
I have an awesome brother, and have lots of friends, too.

207
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,240
So you are no longer

208
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,360
the child that was locked in the basement.

209
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,990
Really?

210
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,030
I receive lots of love?

211
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,110
Yeah.

212
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,110
Lots and lots, so much that it overflows.

213
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,320
That's good.

214
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,950
If I met you,

215
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,650
there was something that I really wanted to say.

216
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,280
What is it?

217
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,610
That time,

218
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,820
when that Ahjusshi got angry towards you,

219
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,610
it wasn't your fault.

220
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,990
It wasn't because you were bad or a hateful child.

221
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,070
That's...

222
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,070
That's Ahjusshi's fault.

223
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,200
Do you understand what I'm saying?

224
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,530
Yeah.

225
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,700
So don't be in pain anymore,

226
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,200
and don't feel scared, okay?

227
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,700
Okay.

228
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,950
And you know,

229
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:08,030
now Unni will be beside Mr. Cha.

230
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,200
So...

231
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,450
you can now leave.

232
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,140
Can you do that?

233
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Yeah.

234
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,010
But... I can't leave alone.

235
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,010
I don't know the way.

236
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,780
Really?

237
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,580
Then what should Unni do for you?

238
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,490
Call Mr. X.

239
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,650
Mr. X?

240
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,610
Who's Mr. X?

241
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,200
Dad.

242
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,980
My dad.

243
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,200
♫The hidden things inside me♫
♫Changed me greatly ♫

244
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,550
- I want to go out and play.
♫ It put me to sleep, tied my hands together, then locked me in a dark room
♫

245
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,600
♫The lost pieces of time ♫

246
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,700
- We would be able to get out if my dad were here.
♫The memories of love, which I abandoned ♫
♫I erased them and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell.♫

247
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,950
♫ Without knowing anything I just screamed and that's all I remember. My heart, which is cold as ice, ♫

248
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,200
- But they said your dad was already dead.
♫ will melt once I wake up ♫

249
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,240
♫ I want to free myself from the torment of my sins ♫

250
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,070
- I'm sorry!
♫ Someone take me out, ♫

251
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,610
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! He'll come.
♫ from my spirit full of scars ♫

252
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,110
- He'll definitely come to pick you up!
♫ The deep night show you, ♫

253
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,200
- Really?
- Yeah!
♫ who was not able to leave ♫

254
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,590
- He'll definitely be in Heaven watching over you.
♫ It wakes me up from my sleep ♫

255
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,200
- He can see me even when it's dark in here?
 ♫ and kisses me again ♫

256
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,860
- Of course! Wherever you are, he can see you.
♫ Your voice which whispered ♫

257
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,610
♫ "I love you" and your scent, ♫

258
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,700
♫ it echoes in my ear every day. Where are you? ♫

259
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,110
♫ I want to get rid of the darkness and find you ♫

260
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,200
Did Nana come?

261
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,900
♫I can't touch you or be embraced by you♫

262
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,030
Thank you.

263
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,320
What's wrong all of a sudden?

264
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:50,110
For creating another broken piece in your mind because of me,

265
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,970
I'm sorry, and sorry again,

266
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,560
but thank you.

267
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,520
How much you did for me,

268
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,570
how much pain you were in,

269
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,700
I think I know now.

270
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,960
You were really my savior

271
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,990
and my hope.

272
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,900
It's such a relief that we were able to meet again.

273
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,490
So that I am able to tell you how thankful I am.

274
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,380
If the one who killed Oh Ri Jin's biological mother was

275
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,780
my father...

276
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,610
Will you try opening it?

277
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,200
Will you try opening it?

278
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,420
How about it?

279
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,970
Now that you opened it, there was nothing to it, right?

280
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,950
You're right...

281
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,490
Whether there was a bomb inside this suitcase,

282
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,590
or if it is a golden bar, you would not know until you open it.

283
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,600
My imagination decides the size of my fear.

284
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,670
Fear is something created by oneself, and is the fruit of one's imagination.

285
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:12,000
Now then, so what should you do?

286
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
I should check it myself.

287
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Bingo!

288
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,380
So now, confront your past.

289
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't waste your imagination on your past that has already been concluded.

290
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,420
Imagination should be reserved for the future.

291
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,800
For the sake of the future deciding what's going to happen ahead!

292
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,210
You are...Nana's father, right?

293
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,170
Because you said so, that's why I took on this role.

294
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,500
But...

295
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,880
why are you in this image?

296
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,340
You seem more like a magician than a dad.

297
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,340
What a young child imagines of a father,

298
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,130
must be something like this.

299
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:04,000
You don't know how glad I am that I am not Superman.

300
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,960
Now I will protect Ri Jin.

301
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,760
I will become stronger,

302
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,000
so you can be rest assured.

303
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,710
Hm...

304
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,250
That's nice to hear.

305
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,590
Joo...

306
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,960
Are you Joon Young?

307
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,880
You completely

308
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,130
became an adult.

309
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,250
So that I can take a proper look at your face,

310
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,300
can you come a bit closer?

311
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,730
Please don't be mistaken.

312
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,860
I am not here to see you.

313
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,940
Joon Young.

314
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,420
Just because you were lying down in a hospital room for 21 years,

315
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,210
doesn't mean that the perpetrator becomes the victim.

316
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,810
So, don't act like you are the weak

317
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,980
and the victim.

318
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,590
I'm only here for one reason.

319
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,600
I want to ask you something.

320
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,960
Did you instigate the deaths of President Min Seo Yeon

321
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,560
and Chairman Cha Geon Ho?

322
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,290
I would like to exchange opinions regarding the rights of Chairperson Cha Do Hyun.

323
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,480
I don't know if you know, Chairwoman,

324
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,620
but entrusting that heavy responsibility to Chairperson Cha is a grave mistake...

325
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,470
Are you saying that I have a multi-personality disorder?

326
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,370
Yes. That's right.

327
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,090
Assuming a key post in Seungjin while hiding that disorder

328
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,160
is an absurd action to our numerous benevolent investors...

329
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,620
I won't deny it.

330
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,630
I will also take the proper responsibility for it.

331
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,100
Before that, I have a problem that I want to discuss.

332
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,390
21 years ago, it is regarding the truth about the car accident that drove Chairman Cha Geon Ho

333
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,800
and President Min Seo Yeon to their deaths.

334
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,450
Don't you have anything to say, President Cha Young Pyo?

335
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,660
That was your Uncle's doing.

336
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,410
From what I investigated,

337
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,680
the one who bribed the chauffeur was definitely your Uncle.

338
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,940
You mean, Uncle instigated the car accident?

339
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,960
In reality, it was a simple accident.

340
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,480
With the motive to cancel the contract,

341
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,590
he meant to delay those two from leaving the country.

342
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,370
It was only of bad luck that the accident happened just then.

343
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:48,820
But because of that accident, two central members of the Group had passed away,

344
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,960
the company also suffered massive damage.

345
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,010
It was a situation where no one can be held responsible.

346
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,310
Is there any proof of this truth?

347
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,450
I am the living proof.

348
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,680
Blinded by the Chairman's seat,

349
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,190
the one who held hands with your Uncle and covered that up...

350
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,410
was me.

351
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,950
At the time, Father secretly recorded a dialogue between him and President Cha Young Pyo.

352
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,280
I have that recording in a file.

353
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,800
What you're looking at right now is from that recording, Chairwoman.

354
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,120
Even if you have that, you can't cover up your disability.

355
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,590
Then how about this?

356
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,330
These are President Cha Young Pyo's embezzlement breakdown and borrowed-name bank accounts

357
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,520
that he stole through our subsidiaries.

358
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,830
Through the gallery that is operated by your wife, Mrs. Yoon Ja Kyung,

359
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,630
we have also discovered a case of money laundering.

360
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,620
Then let's do this.

361
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,640
In exchange for covering for Chairperson Cha's flaw,

362
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,290
you also cover mine.

363
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,020
No. I do not plan to do that.

364
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,720
Just because I have a multi-personality disorder doesn't mean I will go to jail.

365
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,460
But if your truth comes out,

366
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,410
they say you will have 3 years or more in jail.

367
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,940
Cha Do Hyun!

368
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,950
To avoid this matter causing too much damage to the Group,

369
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,770
I will find a solution to reduce the damage.

370
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Seungjin...

371
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,010
I will secede (and leave) it to you.

372
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,650
Didn't you say that you were not a monster, but only Cha Do Hyun?

373
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,270
You were right.

374
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,930
The monsters... were other people.

375
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,810
The only person who can stop this misfortune is you.

376
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,500
Not the greed-stricken monsters,

377
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,200
but set things right with your own hands.

378
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
As you already know,

379
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,150
I am a patient with a multi-personality disorder.

380
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,440
I will wait. Until you recover.

381
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,550
Go abroad and quietly get treated, before you come back.

382
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,910
Until then, I will protect Seungjin.

383
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,700
- Chairperson.
-Yes. What's wrong?

384
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:13,230
Oh Ri Jin seems to be with your father in the hospital right now.

385
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,540
How did she know where it is?

386
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,570
It seems she asked your mother.

387
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,980
- Chairperson?
- Ah!

388
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,540
Chairperson? Chairperson!

389
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,870
You really...

390
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,220
resemble your mom.

391
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,200
Why are you like this?

392
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,640
I'm sorry.

393
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,700
I know that I committed a sin that cannot be washed away from you.

394
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,700
-Don't be like this..
-I won't ask you to forgive me.

395
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,960
But...

396
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,750
I wanted to at least say this.

397
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,520
For being alive,

398
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,070
thank you.

399
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,550
The reason I opened my eyes even if it's just now

400
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,060
was to confirm that you're alive

401
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,390
and my wish to atone for my sins.

402
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,400
You want to be forgiven?

403
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,950
Should I tell you a method?

404
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,260
Joon Young.

405
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,250
Just die a day quicker!

406
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,890
Disappear from this world as quickly as possible!

407
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,900
Do you understand!

408
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,530
Joon Young!

409
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:05,590
Could it be, you started the fire?

410
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,220
-Don't do it! Oh?
- AHH!

411
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,450
Let go! Stop it! Stop it! Shin Se Gi!

412
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,970
Don't do it, please! Shin Se Gi!

413
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,370
Don't try to enforce forgiveness and understanding

414
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:31,920
on us.

415
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,820
If I try to forgive you and understand you,

416
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,680
that is not going to be for you.

417
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,800
It's going to be for this person.

418
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,210
That is because... this person, instead of you,

419
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,470
was sorry to me his whole life, begged for forgiveness, and protected me.

420
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,950
That's why, you

421
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:04,150
just, just have to wait.

422
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,350
Let's get out. Let's run away, to anywhere.

423
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,910
Starting from our scary memories.

424
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,630
Let's go. Let's go out, let's go out...

425
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,710
Hey, Mr. Shin. Don't you want anything?

426
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,270
I picked out all of the presents for the other personalities;

427
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,980
but strangely, I don't know what to pick out for you.

428
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,410
Tell me. Don't you want anything?

429
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,620
You won't be able to give it to me.

430
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,600
What is that?

431
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,380
You.

432
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,160
♬The deep night shows you, ♬

433
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,110
- It's pretty!
♬ who was not able to leave  ♬

434
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,280
♬  It wakes me up from my sleep  ♬

435
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,180
- Mr. Shin, look at me.
♬  kisses me again  ♬

436
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,330
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

437
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,810
Is this firework more pretty, or am I more pretty?
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

438
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,410
- The fireworks.
- No way.
♫ echo in my ears every day ♫

439
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,480
You must get rid of that useless and baseless confidence.
♫ echo in my ears everyday ♫

440
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:44,230
But what were you thinking since a while ago?

441
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,330
The thought that time could just stop.

442
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:59,100
What method there is to be with you forever... Well, those kind of thoughts.

443
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,070
As expected, you're hoping, aren't you?

444
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,510
You are hoping that I will disappear.

445
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,650
Nevermind. Don't answer me. I understand.

446
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,060
- Don't be like that and look at me.
♬  I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

447
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,880
I don't want to.

448
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,250
- It's because I want to see you.
♬  I can’t touch you or♬

449
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,820
In this world,

450
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:42,580
you were the first person to say that my word is the law.

451
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,780
"Person"?

452
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,800
Finally, you are treating me as a human rather than a personality.

453
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,210
Until I'm treated as a man from a human being,

454
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,100
I would need more time.

455
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,370
If you were going to be like this, you shouldn't have called me.

456
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,620
For calling you out,

457
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm sorry.

458
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,180
For making you create you...

459
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,940
I'm sorry.

460
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,300
So what is the present?

461
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,500
♬  I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me, and I call for you desperately ♬

462
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:43,800
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

463
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,950
I received so much from you.

464
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,400
Now that I am trying to repay it, I can't think of a present.

465
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,890
Except for this.

466
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,180
That is an excellent choice.

467
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:34,310
There is nothing that can surpass this, as a farewell present.

468
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:50,720
♬When I first met you ♬

469
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,670
Don't you wish it would last forever?

470
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:04,450
It's the same for me. I wanted to be with you forever, too.

471
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,530
- Let's go. Anywhere. Let's run away.
♬ violet in your hair ♬

472
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,510
Starting from our scary memories.

473
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,880
- Don't kill me. I don't want to disappear.
♬ You told me with a smile ♬

474
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,830
Alright, let's go.

475
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,470
- Anywhere.
♬ That you wanted to fly far away♬

476
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,870
- Let's go. Let's run away to any place.
♬ like a bird ♬

477
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,340
Starting from our scary memories.

478
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,050
You don't want to leave?

479
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,070
Are you an idiot?

480
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,630
Isn't that obvious?

481
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,260
Then why did you decide to leave?

482
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,970
Now that the seal of the memories is broken, I am not needed anymore.

483
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,680
- You're living, too. Inside me.
It's just that the body and time is mine.

484
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,440
If I need you, I'll call you. Help me.

485
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,830
I don't want to. Solve it by yourself.

486
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,570
Unless you give me your time and body.

487
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,490
You're acting strong by yourself, but you're stingy.

488
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,460
-Hey, Mr. Cha.
-Why?

489
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,080
Keep this in mind. If you become scared of the world or act weak again;

490
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,860
then, I will come back.

491
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,910
So you better live well.

492
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,970
Bye.

493
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,600

-What is it now?

495
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,940
You're me.

you.

559

You're so bad at work!

560
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,050
That guy isn't a natural worker.

561
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,670
He's so bad at work.

562
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,630
But he's handsome.

563
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,960
You don't know how many female customers have increased because of him.

564
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,630
If it wasn't for the twins' request, I would have already fired him. Look at him.

565
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,920
That's enough for a part-timer.

566
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,420
And if you fire Perry, you'll become Ri Jin's enemy.

569
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:50,290

From the morning!

571
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,590
I heard the merger and acquisition of Mimi Pharmaceuticals last week went well.

572
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,340
Thanks to you, my stock values hit the price ceiling every day.

573
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,770
No need to thank me. It's not like I did it.

574
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,340
Wasn't it you who planned all of this, Advisor Cha Do Hyun?

575
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,670
All I did was follow orders.

576
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:39,800
Secretary Ahn... no, should I call you Executive Director Ahn now?

577
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,950
It was all possible because you remained in the company.

578
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,670
Enough of that.

579
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,670
If you say anymore, I'll understand it as you're doing yourself proud.

580
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,820
But there is one thing I am curious about.

581
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,670
How did you know that Mimi Pharmaceuticals would go with us?

582
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:00,630
I mean, we were the lowest in terms of suggested acquisition cost.

583
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,340
It's a company that was inherited through three generations.

584
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,060
I only made a judgment that there would definitely be a high chance of winning,

585
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,420
if you suggested to them the condition that all the current employees will get to stay.

586
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,670
I will ask one more question.

587
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,250
Yes, go ahead.

588
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,340
When are you thinking of coming back to Seungjin?

589
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,550
Although she doesn't show it, the Chairwoman is waiting for you.

590
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,750
For the time being, I want to stay like this.

591
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,800
Well, wasn't I supposed to go overseas for treatment anyway?

592
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,170
Every day here is new and happy.

593
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:40,670
You're making me unable to encourage you. I understand.

594
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,000
I'll come over soon. Oh! This is important.

595
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,020
When I come over this time, I will never drink the beer you made.

596
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,920
No, how many times did I tell you that it was the first time I made it?

597
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,840
What are you doing alone here?

598
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,340
Being carefree.

599
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,670
Your girlfriend is having her day off. You should have been running to her in an instant.

600
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,340
But you're enjoying a carefree day by yourself?

601
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,460
Time is going by fast unknowingly, you know.

602
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,460
It feels like the spring wind blows lately.

603
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,630
You were being jealous just now, right?

604
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,920
Right? Right?

605
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,300
Voila!

606
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,800
Put it on. In front of me.

607
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,670
It'll get in the way while I'm working.

608
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,170
Give me your hand.

609
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,750
Don't you dare take it off. Okay?

610
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,460
I heard couple rings are the world's sweetest handcuffs.

611
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,500
Wow~I have handcuffs on!

612
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,300
There is a dark basement in everyone's hearts.

613
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,750
If ignored and is only observed, the darkness becomes thicker.

614
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,500
You should muster your courage and go down stairs, then turn on the light.

615
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,840
If you're scared when alone, someone can hold your hand.
