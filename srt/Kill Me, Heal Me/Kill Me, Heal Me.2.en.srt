1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,560
Then should we have some fun?

2
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,920
Behind you!

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,050
Everyone, do you want more?

4
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,380
- Do you want more?
- Yes!

5
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,780
Are you ready?

6
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,190
Why... why are you acting like this to me, really?

7
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,840
You called me.

8
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Me? I didn't call you.

9
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,350
You did. From a long time ago.

10
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,190
From a long time ago, I didn't know you.

11
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,830
It's okay. You know me now.

12
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,010
Excuse me. I really don't like cold, rough, or beastly men.

13
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,080
It's okay. I like you.

14
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,780
Why does he keep saying that it's okay? I'm not okay!

15
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,460
Since I already took care of the annoying things, play with me now.

16
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,790
- Why would I do that?
- Because you called me!

17
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm telling you I didn't call you! Seriously!

18
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,350
Can you please not come towards me? I'm going to use violence too!

19
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,880
Don't come toward me! I'm telling you don't come toward me! Don't! Wait!

20
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,430
Don't move.

21
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,380
That's right. You're doing well, you're doing well.

22
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,250
Now, turn around slowly.

23
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,930
That's right! Good boy.

24
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,340
Now stay still like that. Just like that. Stay still.

25
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,060
Stay still like that. You are so well-behaved!

26
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,460
Taxi! Taxi!

27
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,610
Taxi!

28
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,100
Ahjussi, can you go with full speed to Kanghan Hospital?

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,360
Please...

30
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,690
Someone is chasing us. Does he have a death wish or what?

31
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,190
He is crazy! What to do with him!

32
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,040
Kill Me, Heal Me

33
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,980
Kanghan Hospital
Episode 2

34
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,990
Wait!

35
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,640
Don't move!

36
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,270
I don't want to play pets now. Since I played with you, you have to play with me now.

37
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,300
You're all grown-up now! Why are you asking me to play with you?

38
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,810
What are we going to do? Are we going to play with strings or stones?

39
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,360
We can think about that on our way. I don't have that much time right now.

40
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,440
Am I a person who have time deposited in some bank vault that I can withdraw and use?

41
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,620
I'm a busy person as well. A busy person!

42
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,800
I am different from you. I don't know when I'm going to appear.

43
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,120
No... What is he saying? Is he some Crown Prince that escaped from the palace?

44
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,550
Are you possibly, on parole?

45
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,180
It's a place that is harder to escape from than the palace or jail, and is ten thousand times more cramped. Get on.

46
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,010
Please really stop now. I really have to go to the hospital. Okay?

47
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,730
That's enough, please give me a break! I already told you I don't like rascals like you!

48
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,800
I really don't like hospitals.

49
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,200
Take off your clothes. When I saw you fight before, you bled a lot. I will look at your wounds.

50
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,850
Don't we have to go in?

51
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,120
By judging Doctor Oh's screams, she isn't hating it.

52
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,380
Wear your pants! I didn't tell you to take off everything!

53
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,450
You told me to take off my clothes. Do I have to put them back on?

54
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,020
Can you look down?

55
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,680
Psychology Department
Oh Ri Jin

56
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,810
You are a psychiatrist? That isn't good.

57
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,710
You and I could have a bad fate.

58
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,410
Oh my! Did you just find that out now?

59
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,590
What are you doing right now? Excuse me!

60
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,810
Excuse me. What are you doing right now?

61
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,930
Excuse me.

62
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,260
See, this is my name.

63
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,020
Shin Se Gi

64
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,750
Remember this, until you die.

65
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,290
I'm getting goosebumps.

66
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,860
Excuse me, Shin Se Gi. I told you countless times that you are not my type.

67
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,980
Remember. The person who has my face but has a different name is fake.

68
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,740
There is only one Shin Se Gi, who has this face.

69
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,980
I'm the only one. So you

70
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,600
have to remember my eyes.

71
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm done treating you, so you can go now. Bye!

72
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,240
Doctor Park!

73
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,640
Is there anything I can help you with?

74
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,030
Should I stand in on your shift or help you with your dissertation?

75
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,940
Look at how this wretch is rolling her brain.

76
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,230
Hey. Why are you coming now?

77
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,320
This brat, you're just finding a way out when you've lost your patient!

78
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,980
From now on, know that you won't be off for a while.

79
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,040
You must want to die.

80
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,250
Can I take her out for a little while?

81
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,310
Take her out.

82
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,560
What?!
- By all means, take her out.

83
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,810
Doctor Oh, what are you doing, not getting ready to go out?

84
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,140
He's waiting! Quickly.

85
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,820
Put on some makeup prettily and wear pretty clothes. You don't have to come in today.

86
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,810
- Excuse me, Doctor Park-
- Hurry and change into some pretty clothes.

87
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,240
Doctor Park! Doctor Park! It's not like that!

88
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,570
You should have told me earlier.

89
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,810
No, Doctor!

90
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,340
Oh Ri Jin

91
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,710
Secretary Ahn Gook

92
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,180
Yes, Secretary Ahn, what's the matter?

93
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,840
I found Doctor Seok Ho Pil.

94
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,970
Really?

95
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,630
That's great. Which hospital is it?

96
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,510
Really?
Kanghan Hospital

97
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,620
I realized it for the first time at that time. That there was a monster inside me.

98
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,250
The punk's name is, Shin Se Gi. He's the same age as me and...

99
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes?

100
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
...he's very violent and has a savage personality.

101
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,600
Who is this? Cha Do Hyun!

102
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,000
It's been a while, Doctor.

103
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,840
I was waiting for you after getting a call from Secretary Ahn anyway. Wow~ How long has it been?

104
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,730
I'm happy to see you. I'm really happy to see you!

105
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,780
Are you really happy to see me?

106
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,000
Of course, I am. When did you get back?

107
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,160
You tried to kill me through different ways.

108
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,250
Why would I be happy to see you?

109
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,540
Shin Se Gi?

110
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,920
It's taking longer than expected.

111
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,650
Go back first, Secretary Ahn. I'll go home after meeting Doctor Park.

112
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,580
The blade is very sharp.

113
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,520
Isn't it cool? If I give it to Yo Sub as a present, he'll really like it.

114
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,250
You know Yo Sub well, right?

115
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,910
He's the personality of a 17 year old boy who's living in your body, right?

116
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,300
That's right. He's a fellow obsessed with suicide.

117
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm going to give this as a present for staying quietly all this time.

118
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,320
Well, I could use this on you before that.

119
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,860
What is it you want to say?

120
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,550
Tell Cha Do Hyun that he should give up on the amalgation treatment completely.

121
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,250
To also not think about getting rid of us,

122
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,140
interfering with us,

123
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,690
and getting in our way.

124
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,410
If Mr. Cha doesn't give up on the treatment, what will you do then?

125
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,410
Then you should make a move.

126
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,870
Put Cha Do Hyun to sleep.

127
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,540
So that he can't wake up... forever.

128
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,760
That's something impossible.

129
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,690
So?

130
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,660
Mr. Cha is your owner.

131
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,270
You are only one of the alternate personalities he created as a defense mechanism.

132
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,300
Shut your trap.

133
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,280
I am me.

134
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,920
Not Cha Do Hyun, but Shin Se Gi.

135
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,370
If you try to get that guy and I fuse into one,

136
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,450
or make this guy remember his lost past,

137
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,310
then... Yo Sub will use my present very properly.

138
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,620
Do you understand what I'm saying?

139
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,190
If we die, Cha Do Hyun will die and disappear with us.

140
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,280
You pathetic...

141
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Guys!

142
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,690
D-doctor. Doctor! Doctor!

143
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,410
What's going on?

144
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,140
Se Gi,

145
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,880
Se Gi came and left.

146
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,440
Are you alright?

147
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,660
Huh? Ah, I'm alright, I'm alright.

148
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,000
My neck is thicker than most people.

149
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,360
My nickname is "Toad", "Thick Necked Toad".

150
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,250
Anyway,

151
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,530
I think Se Gi has gotten stronger.

152
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,740
How should I put it? Although I can't make a judgement right away,

153
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,900
he wants to be the owner of all the personalities, you included.

154
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,050
Are those words saying that he wants to get rid of me?

155
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:04,340
He asked me to put you to sleep. So that you can't wake up forever.

156
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,280
It's certain that he has an objective.

157
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,870
That objective is making him stronger.

158
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,970
But he said something very notable.

159
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,410
He said he found his first love or something?

160
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,800
It's possible for personalities to love, too?

161
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,180
Of course, it's possible.

162
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,150
However in a case with a violent personality like him,

163
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,880
he can mistake violence and obsession for someone as love.

164
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,280
Also, in the case that he cannot get the other person's heart, that affection, can be changed into violence.

165
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,110
If it comes to that, the other person will be in extreme danger.

166
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,830
He said he found his first love or something?

167
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,440
No way, Chae Yeon?

168
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,480
Yes.

169
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,470
Mom? Yeah, I'm doing well.

170
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,490
Doctor Oh! Aren't you on duty today?

171
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,180
You're so pretty today.

172
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,140
I'm doing well.

173
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,020
Ah, seriously. But why isn't he coming out? I'm going to run into all the hospital employees.

174
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Excuse me...

175
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,250
Excuse me!

176
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,590
Excuse me, I know it's rude, but who are you?

177
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,810
"Although it's rude, who are you?"?

178
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,190
I mean... If you know it's something rude, why would you ask that?

179
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,380
She's a very~ dangerous woman. She's a megalomaniac.

180
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,720
Oh, yes. You came back to the hospital safely.

181
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,960
I see. hat's a relief. That's really a relief.
Uhmmm... Be strong.

182
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,980
But I have to go somewhere urgently. I'm sorry.

183
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,390
Wait a moment!

184
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,670
That's it?

185
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,620
Then what else...?

186
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,200
I really didn't want to say this,

187
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,500
but from the club, you were the one who followed me around like your life depended on it, saying that you like me! It wasn't me!

188
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,070
Wait a moment! Wait a moment.

189
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,190
Get your grip tighter and calm down. Listen to me.

190
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh. Yes.

191
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,000
That's why you misunderstood.

192
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,060
Misunderstood?

193
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,140
I'm sorry. To a person who is already hurt, I caused more pain...

194
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,110
Wait. Who are you saying is hurt?

195
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,750
I understand that hospital life must be difficult, but I hope that you overcome it. Be strong.

196
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,560
Be strong. Be strong. But I really have somewhere to go, so I'm really sorry.

197
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,030
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

198
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,290
What is this? Was I just rejected?

199
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,500
What kind of pathetic melodrama is this!

200
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,570
- Vice-President!
- Secretary Ahn, how are you here?

201
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,450
What happened?

202
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,290
Se Gi threatened the professor.

203
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,130
- What?
- I will tell you the details later. I need to use your car.

204
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,200
What?

205
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,740
Um...

206
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,800
Remember. The time that I fell for you...

207
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,390
Oh, yes. That's why you misunderstood.

208
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,440
Please, Chae Yeon. Answer your phone! Please answer it!

209
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,520
Hey, Cha Do Hyun, where did you run off to?

210
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,170
Oh, Chae Yeon.

211
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,530
Oh my! Did you get in a fight?

212
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,850
I thought that you were a good student who only used your fist to grab pencils.

213
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,880
You even know how to use it to beat people up?

214
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,840
I have something to say.

215
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,200
Is it important?

216
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,630
I hope that you consider it like that.

217
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,360
Go on.

218
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,850
From now on, if I surprise you with words and actions that aren't like myself, ignore me.

219
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,750
What?

220
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,570
If I treat you badly or visit you late at night,

221
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,270
or call you to come out, or cross the line that I must not cross...
If I do those things, that's not me.

222
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,830
Are you drunk?

223
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,510
If someone who has my face has a different name,

224
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,900
or does things that I don't usually do, that's not me. Run away as far as you can.

225
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:50,510
If I don't let you run away, just hit me. You can hit me until I lose consciousness.

226
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,160
- Hey, Cha Do Hyun.
- Chae Yeon, which wine do you want me to open?

227
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,870
I was having a glass of wine with Ki Joon Oppa. Do you want to continue inside?

228
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,910
Oh, it's okay. I'm done. I'll leave now.

229
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,710
Chae Yeon.

230
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,070
Last Christmas, thank you for calling me.

231
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,810
Thanks to you, my Christmas was warm.

232
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,290
I was happy.

233
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,460
This woman is so fearless.

234
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,170
After having me in a shower gown over here, how can you call Do Hyun?

235
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,000
Who is the person who just shouted out that you are here?

236
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,410
This is a territorial fight between men. It's a type of howling.

237
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,110
Oh, so I'm your territory?

238
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,970
You're enjoying this.

239
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,460
A man's pure love is women's dreams.

240
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,470
How should I say it? It's fancy and meaningful,

241
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,730
but it's also like a supplement book that fills the 2% missing in the main volume?

242
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,480
Does Do Hyun know that you are a fox?

243
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,020
If he finds out, he will be more interested. It's sexier than the concept of a childhood friend.

244
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,380
I think that Se Gi grew stronger.

245
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,070
He must have gotten an objective.

246
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,900
The objective will make him stronger.

247
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,820
Make Cha Do Hyun fall asleep forever.

248
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,040
So that he can't wake up.

249
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:36,850
Listen Shin Se Gi. If you touch any of my people, you're dead. Do you understand?

250
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,450
I would rather die to get rid of you. If I'm not alive, you're not either. If you become stronger, I will become stronger!

251
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,060
Are you listening to me, Shin Se Gi? Are you listening to me, you bastard?

252
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,040
Bastard...

253
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,970
From now on, I'm going to start working at ID Entertainment.

254
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,230
Please prepare the financial reports, income statements, and current business condition report of ID Entertainment for the past 3 years,

255
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,950
and the plan for next year. Also the profiles of the employees and the company's artists, without leaving anyone out.

256
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,880
Did you decide to stay?

257
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,170
If he has a goal, even if I go back to America,

258
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,550
he will get on the plane again. Then there is only one solution.

259
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,970
I am not going to run away.

260
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,220
I have to face him directly.

261
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,710
My short term goal is the board meeting in three months.

262
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,000
Until then, nothing can happen to me.

263
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,690
So I need to have the newest technology

264
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,640
that can watch and control him.

265
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,300
Wake up at 6:50 AM

266
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,590
While I'm asleep, I will lock myself in the house using secured lock devices.

267
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,240
January 8th, 2015, woke up at 6:50 AM.

268
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,960
While I am awake, I will make sure that a security camera watches me.

269
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,870
Exercise at 7:00

270
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,160
I need a room to exercise. When I get stressed or feel nervous,

271
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,050
they can attack me.

272
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,310
I need keep my emotions and condition at a normal level all the time.

273
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,140
Lastly, I need a secret physician.

274
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,960
Since Se Gi attacked the professor, it could be dangerous to ask him to treat me.

275
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,740
Look for a secret physician that can replace him.

276
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,520
But he must be a person who can take his secret to his grave.

277
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,480
I will keep your secret until I die, so tell me.

278
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,030
How did you escape?

279
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:42,000
Ms. Heo Seok Hee! If you don't take your medicine and keep on refusing treatment like this, you're going to be delaying your discharge. Do you want that?

280
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,620
This place and my house are both prison.

281
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,310
There are only doctors in my house and the hospital.

282
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,940
All the doctors in my house are going crazy because they can't make me a doctor,

283
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,550
and the doctors in my hospital are going crazy because they can't make me their patient.

284
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,630
Doctor Oh, did you have experience to study six more years in order to enter medical school?

285
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think that's a thing that people do.

286
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,360
I just want to live while dancing. Is that something that is considered crazy?

287
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,350
So, why don't we just go together one day?

288
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,820
If you take your medicine well and get treatment, I'll go with you.

289
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,090
-Really?
- Really.

290
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,900
-When?
- How about when I am off?

291
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,930
Then we can go today. You are off today!

292
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,500
- Why are you surprised?
- Your eyes!

293
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,030
Yes, people kept telling me that I look like a Siberian Husky, so I changed my eyes.

294
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,280
It's twilight burgundy color. It's popular in the clubs nowadays.

295
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,800
Are you sure?

296
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,850
Of course. It's EXO Baekhyun's makeup during the Seoul Music Awards. Don't you know?

297
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,620
You don't know. So lame. But you have a talent of booking a man.

298
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,470
Booking? Who? Me?

299
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,900
Stop denying it, Doctor Oh Ri Jin. It's already spreading throughout the hospital.
- Hello.

300
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,000
They said that you found a man while looking for a patient, but was rejected after two hours.

301
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,140
Serves you right!

302
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,520
They say that a maggot can roll around.

303
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,600
Not in my wildest dreams would I think that Doctor Oh has a genius talent in finding men.

304
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,130
And she was even rejected after two hours!

305
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,390
Our Doctor Oh has to go all the way till the end. She is very fierce, like a general!

306
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:25,430
As I see it, she failed in playing hard to get. When that man tried to take off his pants,

307
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,170
she was screaming at him to hurry up and put his clothes on, but she was saying something entirely different on the inside!

308
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,020
Hey, hey! She is pitiful. Treat her nicely. Do you think that she dated before?

309
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,570
Why haven't she? We should take care of her. She might get PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) from this.

310
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,650
She is denying the fact that she got rejected.

311
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,250
Hey, but is there an opened window? Why did it become so cold all of a sudden?

312
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,920
It's not booking!

313
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,550
Hey! Hey! Hey!

314
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,310
Doctor Oh, aren't you off today?

315
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,770
He was the one who followed me because he liked me, and he was the one who disappeared because he is busy,

316
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,820
and when he played around, I never went along with him. So it's not booking!

317
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:11,120
Oh, Doctor Oh! These were the clothes that the man you booked was wearing, right?

318
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,670
The cleaner told me to give it to you.

319
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,980
It's not booking!

320
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,820

Salvatore Bocchetti

322
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,320
Shin Se Gi.

323
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,780
Don't try to speak up just because you were wronged.

324
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:12,860
If you keep saying that you were wronged, you will just resent that person more.

325
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,540
So the elder said,

326
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,660
"Turn that feeling of being wronged into a door leading to asceticism."

327
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,150
The person you are trying to reach is not answering the phone...

328
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,130
I was rejected. Yes, I was.

Recycling Bin

330
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,210
Yes, this is not lingering feelings or expectation.

331
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,600
I just want to join the 'CSER(Ah Na Ba Da) campaign*'. Why?
(*Conserve, Share, Exchange, Reuse)

332
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,440
Because it's not fake leather but real leather. Why?

333
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,310
Because it's made in Italy!

334
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh my!

335
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,570
It's your father!

336
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,370
You're here! What is this?
Is it a gift to me? Let's see!

337
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,880
Ah! This is not yours! It's not yours! Give it back!

338
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,110
Father! I said it's not yours!

339
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,400
Hey, how is it? It suits me, right?

340
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,570
What do you mean, you look good? It looks cheap now that you've worn it.

341
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,770
You seem to be very satisfied.

342
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,380
Yeah! I know, I know... Take it off quickly.

343
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,960
Now that you're here on your day-off and

344
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,010
you even brought a present for your father. You grew a lot.

345
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,080
This is very vintage. I really like it.

346
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,130
And look at this. Doesn't it look like real bloodstain?

347
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,870
They even made these kind of details!

348
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:25,040
Wow, the leather from Italy is very high quality.

349
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,620
Dad, I will put my life on the line and say this. This is too small for you.

350
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,470
It's not small. It's not.

351
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,070
Honey! Have you chopped all the firewood?

352
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,930
Ri Jin!

353
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,170
Mom!

354
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,370
Omo!

355
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,670
When did you arrive?

356
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,060
I just came! Were you well?

357
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,370
I was well, of course.

358
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,980
I missed you!

359
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,620
Your father caught a wild pig so that he can make a barbecue for you.

360
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Yay!

361
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,260
Honey, have you chopped the firewood yet?

362
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,800
Honey! You're going to chop the firewood, right?

363
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,910
I'll chop them in a moment! You go in first... go in, go in.

364
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,550
Let's go in. Are you hungry?

365
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,230
I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

366
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,010
Honey... This doesn't go up.

367
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,330
It's too small!

368
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,140
Dad is still the same.

369
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,760
Still the same? He is getting better every day.

370
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,300
He still think he's a young master of super rich family who runs a brewery. He squandered away almost all his fortune long time ago.

371
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,940
He just liked people and helped everyone.

372
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,530
He's probably going to be like that, acting like a young child, for the rest of his life until he dies.

373
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,640
Why? That's our father's biggest strength and charm.

374
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,200
If everyone in the world is like Dad, our department won't even exist in the hospital.

375
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,940
Women who take care of people like your father will make sure that the psychological department doesn't end, so don't worry.

376
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,000
But why is Ri On so quiet? Did he go somewhere?

377
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,070
I don't know. He tortured himself writing his novel at daybreak. He's quiet now, so he must be sleeping.

378
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,460
Can you stop your brother from writing mystery novels?

379
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,280
He only talks about people dying.

380
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,100
He writes his own books and cannot sleep at night because he gets nightmares.

381
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,050
Really?

382
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,020
Is he stupid?

383
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,720
Lonely man...

384
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,210
My heart almost dropped!

385
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,350
Are you an item thief?

386
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,400
Who sent you? Is it the next publisher? Is it Eiru Media?

387
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,410
Could it be, Jerry Bruckheimer, that punk?

388
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,280
Your mother sent me so that you can eat.

389
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,420
Oh Ri On came down.

390
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,880
I came.

391
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,540
Look at your dark circles. You are a panda, not a human!

392
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,030
How many people did you kill yesterday?

393
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,540
I killed about two people.

394
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,760
I have two children, and they all do things that just hurts the parents.

395
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm scared that one will get hurt by her patients,

396
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,130
and I'm scared that his mind will get ruined by doing that.

397
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,710
Ri Jin, since you are off, give your brother consultation.

398
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,260
Our family is already excellent. What do you need a physician for?

399
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,400
The beginning and end to the health of the mind is the happiness of the family.

400
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,930
Wow, wow. Are we going to do a public service advertisement now?

401
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,140
Come outside and help me with the fire.

402
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,770
I finished with the firewood. It's too cold.

403
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,550
But where did you get the jacket? It's totally awesome!

404
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,010
Here.

405
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,170
Ah.

406
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,670
This. Put it here.

407
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,840
Wow.

408
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,740
Here are the beers!

409
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,480
Yeah! It's the beer made by Dad!

410
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,350
- Wow!
- Beer, beer!

411
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,080
- Me too! Me too!
- Here's one for you, Mom!

412
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,690
Oh, it's cold!

413
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,660
Shall we toast?

414
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,710
Should we? Toasting is nice. Here, cheers!

415
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,360
- Cheers!
- For everyone's health!

416
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,550
For health!

417
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,800
Coffee Gallery

418
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,590
The stars are nice.

419
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:15,170
If you finished eating, you should go in and sleep. Why are you drinking coffee so late at night? You should be resting.

420
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,460
Are you going to work all night again?

421
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,620
Yeah. I have to sleep after killing at least two more people.

422
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,070
I heard that you are not able to sleep because you get nightmares.

423
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,210
Aren't you getting too into it?

424
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,910
Did the consultation begin?

425
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,850
I don't know how this will sound to a writer,

426
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,530
but you have to differentiate between reality and the imaginary world.

427
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,970
If you get too into it, in the world that you created,

428
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,630
you can get hurt.

429
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,620
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo... Don't worry, this Oppa knows to properly do that.

430
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,880
Why do you think that I decided to become a mystery writer with the pen name Omega?

431
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,460
By the way I see it, it's unnecessary.

432
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,940
Listen well, Doctor.

433
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,720
As Omega, I am a writer with a mystic identity who writes mystery novels

434
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,100
and lives a homme fatale lifestyle.

435
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,860
But as Oh Ri On...

436
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,310
Right there...like that burning star over there,

437
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,610
I'm a freed soul.

438
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,570
And my life as Oh Hwi-

439
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,820
When did you become three? Who is Hwi?

440
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,490
I sometimes use it to seduce women.

441
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,240
Oh Ri On is sounds like a name of a chocolate cookie, (There's an Orion ChocoChip cookies)

442
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,400
so those women call me Oh Hwi.

443
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,510
Oh...

444
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,130
End of counseling.

445
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,490
You have split personality.

446
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,980
I'm saying that I can live a safe, comfortable and pleasant life

447
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:05,580
by defining myself into different people.

448
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,790
Just like...

449
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,360
Jekyll and Hyde.

450
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,140
There is only one Shin Se Gi with this face.

451
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,210
What?

452
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm the only one.

453
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
W-wait a minute.

454
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,000
-What is it? What is this tension? What is this?
- What?

455
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,640
What are you doing?

456
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,710
Ah...

457
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,790
It's nothing.

458
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,450
But...

459
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,620
if you live while separating yourself into different people,

460
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,620
is it fun?

461
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,290
Rather than saying that it's fun, it's a way to protect yourself

462
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,920
from this cruel world. It could be the heart's strategy.

463
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
It is something like that.

464
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,250
What?

465
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,500
- What?
- What?

466
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,580
What?

467
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,910
What? what? what?

468
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,760
What? what? what?

469
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,800
What? What? What?

470
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,050
There is only one Shin Se Gi with this face.

471
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,330
I'm the only one.

472
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,680
So, you...

473
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,220
don't forget about my eyes.

474
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,120
Be strong.

475
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,460
Be strong. But I really have to go somewhere. I'm sorry.

476
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

477
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,060
He is different. The eyes...

478
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,880
You came?

479
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,610
You came earlier than expected.

480
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,350
Yeah.

481
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,030
Did anything happen overnight?

482
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,500
Fortunately, it's been quiet for the past few days.

483
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,800
According to my record, I never lost consciousness or time.

484
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,980
Although what's important is what's going to happen from now on.

485
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,830
Then can we proceed with the board meeting as planned?

486
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,880
Aigoo, Chairwoman.

487
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,260
Hello, Uncle.

488
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,800
I should have visited you to give my greetings, but I meet you like this.

489
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,720
No. That greeting isn't that urgent.

490
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,850
To a child who must not have been even adjust to the time difference yet

491
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,490
after quickly wrapping up his life in the States, having the board meeting on his first day,

492
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,710
would be too harsh, don't you think, Chairwoman?

493
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,700
For the company and for himself,

494
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,520
it's a sound judgement to start working as fast as possible.

495
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,790
You worry too much.

496
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,180
Even though ID Entertainment is just a new venture for Seung Jin Group,

497
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,690
isn't the Vice-President title too burdensome for a child who's just starting?

498
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,890
Because President Cha Ki Joon has already laid out the foundation for him well,

499
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,540
he will learn from you.

500
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,210
Since he was burdened with an important position, he

501
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,090
will become more responsible.

502
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,930
You can go up first. We will use a different elevator.

503
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,750
Then do so.

504
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,890
The door is closing.

505
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,860
Don't fall for his smile.

506
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:53,250
A good-natured persona, a considerate persona, and a benevolent persona,

507
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,880
they are all his disguises. That is his strategy.

508
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,920
The more a person has dark ambitions, he hides his true self.

509
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,030
Oh, nice shot!

510
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,960
I'm always touched by your skill. What is your strategy?

511
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,230
It's not enough to always just hit the ball perfectly.

512
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,100
Sometimes, the ball sets it up itself.

513
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,440
Anyway, the start isn't so bad today.

514
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:28,010
Yes, that's right. It's there. Seung Jin Group!

515
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,080
No, he's not the President yet.

516
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,140
The Vice-President of ID Entertainment.

517
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,920
Ay... why don't you get me?

518
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,970
ID Entertainment. ID Entertainment!

519
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,100
Let's go first.

520
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,750
Honey! Even if my son is the only future successor of Seung Jin Group,

521
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,550
how can he swallow it all in one shot? There are also some intended for others.

522
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:56,530
I told him to earn his position, starting slowly from the bottom.

523
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,570
Aigoo, fine. I will buy you not only one meal, but two,

524
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,750
so just find the date.

525
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,310
Hey, Dong Seo! (wife of her husband's brother)

526
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,840
I'll talk to you later.

527
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,380
Sister-in-law, sister-in-law! It's me!

528
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,760
Aigoo, seriously.

529
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,450
What is this embarrassment, after coming for a round of golf?

530
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:28,250
Because of that vulgar and impudent thing who doesn't know embarrassment...

531
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,750
That vulgar and impudent thing seems to be me.

532
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,570
Sister-in-law, am I right?

533
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,900
I will talk to you later.

534
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,870
Sit down. Let's talk, Sister-in-law.

535
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,010
Please-

536
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,080
Can you not call me Sister-in-law?

537
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,630
I call my sister-in-law Dong-seo. Do I call you North-South then? (Dong-seo can also be East-west)

538
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,120
Why am I your sister-in-law?

539
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,530
Is your name in my family (Seung Jin) registry?

540
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,560
It's just a piece of paper.

541
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,780
Just because there isn't a paper, is there anyone that doesn't know that I am Cha Joon Pyo's wife?

542
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:05,240
Stop dreaming. Nobody in Seung Jin thinks of you as family.

543
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,740
You, really! Hey! Why do I have to stop dreaming?

544
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,280
My husband is still alive, and my son Cha Do Hyun

545
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,200
- is the only successor of Seung Jin. Why would I?
- Talk with me after you let this go.

546
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,620
- Let go.
- Talk after I let go? You rude wretch!

547
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,940
Do you want to be embarrassed by me! How dare you?

548
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,540
Vice President Cha Do Hyun

549
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,620
Do you like the office?

550
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,630
You came, President?

551
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,290
What is this? You are already creating distance between us after calling war?

552
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,620
What do you mean, a declaration of war?

553
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,220
Stop acting all innocent.

554
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,450
The battle between the successors of Seung Jin Group started.

555
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,340
People who are watching us from outside are very interested.

556
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,780
Aren't you overdoing it, when we just do entertainment management business?

557
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,340
Let's go easy. Easy, okay?

558
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,010
It's been 500 years since the King was chosen through descent, but that was the Joseon dynasty.

559
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,620
I haven't even properly introduced myself to the Board.

560
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,660
Why are you already talking about a bloodbath?

561
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,030
I'll see you at the board meeting later.

562
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,200
That day, I saw you leave the club.

563
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,160
You transformed into a completely different person.

564
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,700
Oh, that day?

565
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:58,030
My friends who studied with me abroad

566
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,780
suddenly contacted me.

567
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,160
You must have partied a lot in America.

568
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,870
Did you do drugs?

569
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,990
What?

570
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:17,660
Be careful. This is Korea. Many people are watching.

571
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,910
I'm leaving.

572
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,760
What do you mean I'm having a hard time?

573
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,370
Your daughter is very strong.

574
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,760
You don't have to act tough.

575
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,620
Just pick someone decent from the hospital and marry him. Just stay at home after.

576
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,000
But you have to pick one from the doctors, not the patients.

577
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,870
Mom, I have to park now. I'm hanging up.

578
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,630
Daughter, thanks for the present.

579
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,330
It's a little small, but I'll wear it well!

580
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,530
Oh Ri Jin.

581
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,760
Oh Ri Jin

582
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,340
Hello?

583
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,200
Is it Shin Se Gi?

584
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,160
Who are you?

585
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:06,330
Me? I was a person who was embarrassed by you in Paradise Club.

586
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,800
Where is my jacket?

587
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,180
Where is my jacket right now?!

588
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,180
Jacket? If you can tell me in detail what jacket you are talking about--

589
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,780
-You bastard!
- Don't touch a single thing in my leather jacket that you ran off with,

590
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,910
and just bring it to me as how it is.

591
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:26,830
If you don't, your woman is going to die in my hands.

592
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:33,030
- My woman?
 - You coward! You're going to pretend not to know anything, huh?

593
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,480
Don't you know the owner of this phone?

594
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,990
Oh Ri Jin from Kanghan Hospital.

595
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,080
Listen carefully.

596
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:50,330
Bring the jacket to Taesan Textile Distribution Factory by 1 o'clock on the dot.

597
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,700
The woman will die if you don't have the jacket,

598
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,550
and if you are late, then she'll die.

599
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:02,650
If you report to the police and bring someone with you, she will die.

600
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,240
Hello?

601
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,700
Hello?

602
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,370
Where are you going?

603
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,700
I'll be right back.

604
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,580
Vice President!

605
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,490
Vice-President, you can't be doing this right now.

606
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,430
The board meeting is starting soon!

607
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,990
I have to find it.

608
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,080
Vice President!

609
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,180
For now, go back to the company.

610
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,280
You have to attend the meeting, no matter what.

611
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,780
I will take care of this after reporting to the police.

612
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,380
Unless I go, a woman's life will be in danger.

613
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,120
It's something that Se Gi did!

614
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,830
Even if you, who doesn't know anything, go, you can't solve this!

615
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,910
It's something that has to do with someone's life. I have to at least go, even with empty hands...

616
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:43,600
Secretary Ahn, please hit me.

617
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,730
What? What are you talking about?

618
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,200
I have to call out Shin Se Gi.

619
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,580
- Vice President!
- The only person that knows what happened that night and where the jacket is located is him.

620
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,670
The only person who can solve this is Se Gi.

621
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,090
But even if I do that, it isn't guaranteed that he will come out.

622
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,740
He reacts keenly the most when I get angry or hurt.

623
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,040
This is the only way. So hit me.

624
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,280
I can't do that!

625
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,930
It's a command as your superior.

626
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:19,470
I will endure and take responsibility for everything that will happen after this.

627
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,220
So help me, Secretary Ahn.

628
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,660
Hurry! There isn't enough time!

629
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,580
Okay.

630
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,090
Hit me.

631
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,010
Hit me!

632
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,200
I'm sorry.

633
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,620
It's too light. Hit me harder.

634
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,530
It's not enough.

635
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,770
Hit me harder! Please hit me harder!

636
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,470
Alright.

637
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,230
I got it. Then I'll do it in one shot.

638
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,380
Yes!

639
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,370
Vice President!

640
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,610
Are you okay?

641
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,370
Shin Se Gi?

642
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,130
Geez~ Did you just hit me?

643
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,280
You rude rascal.

644
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,200
Did you just hit me? Huh?

645
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,470
Perry... Park?

646
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,030
That's right. I'm Perry Park.

647
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:48,200
Look at how he packed this firmly!

648
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,140
You rude rascal!

649
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,630
Call (Deal)!

650
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,410
Good choice.

651
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,380
What did you just say?
