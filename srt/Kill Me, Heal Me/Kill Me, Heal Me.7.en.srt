1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,830
They come out of me without my permission.

2
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,090
and steal both my body and my time.

3
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,270
But what's even worse is that I can't remember it at all.

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,070
Do you know what this means?

5
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,320
Of course, I do. D.I.D...

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,370
People commonly call it Multiple Personality Disorder.

7
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,930
From now on, all of your time and your body is mine.

8
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,210
Why? I found that child first.

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,680
Now a strange box will appear in front of them.

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,330
And eventually, what's inside of it will start whispering to him.

11
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,010
Open it. Remember what happened

12
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,080
between you and her that day.

13
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,960
I...I'm strangely afraid of fire and basements.

14
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,300
But if I'm together with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

15
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:21,140
He can't remember. Do Hyun must not remember her.

16
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,520
Please! Please! Please!

17
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,460
The Omega 3 Murder Case

18
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,030
You must be a fan of the author Omega.

19
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,530
Isn't this writer's work really interesting?
He's also really handsome.

20
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,140
I thought he doesn't reveal his face.

21
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,550
That's what the rumors say. They say that his looks

22
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,130
are on the Won Bin level. Right up there.

23
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,370
I'm well aware that Writer Omega hasn't revealed his identity.

24
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,570
That's why I'm asking this favor of you, Editor.

25
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,160
Yes, I know. But just as I said,

26
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,980
the Vice President really wants to meet Omega in person.

27
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,900
Yes. Yes, I ask this favor of you.

28
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,370
I have something to say to you, so come ride with me for a moment.

29
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,980
Hello, Vice President.

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,300
Is there something wrong with Vice President Cha?

31
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,350
Yes? What do you mean, something wrong?

32
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,240
From now on, I'm going to look for the answer to that myself.

33
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,330
Kill me, Heal me

34
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,570
Oh Ri Jin.

35
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,840
Cha Do Hyun, it's Oh Ri Jin.

36
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,790
I've been thinking. No, even without thinking about it,

37
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,630
I think that your offer for me to become your physician is a bit too much.

38
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,440
Today, I called to say goodbye.

39
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm going to study abroad.

40
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,720
You could say that it's all thanks to you.

41
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,750
In the end, I wasn't able to become your physician or friend, but...

42
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,340
it wasn't bad meeting you.

43
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,570
And I've experienced things that I couldn't have before.

44
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,130
Ah.Thanks for pretending that you were my boyfriend at the hospital.

45
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,510
Thanks to you, it was fun. Ah, and...

46
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,030
thank you for saving me from the fire.

47
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,790
Anyways, be healthy and happy.

48
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,700
I hope you will meet a good physician.

49
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,510
Cha Do Hyun. Are you listening?

50
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,510
Cha Do Hyun?

51
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,340
You're running away from him anyways, Noona.

52
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,960
In the end, Do Hyun hyung was abandoned by you, too. Wasn't he?

53
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,610
Who... are you?

54
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,450
Me?

55
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,830
Ahn Yo Sub.

56
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,770
Age 17. The nickname that Dr. Scofield (Seok Ho Pil) gave me is...

57
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,850
The Suicidal Personality.

58
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,260
The Suicidal Personality?

59
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,120
That's right. The Suicidal Personality.

60
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,480
I quite like the nickname.

61
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,860
What's that sound?

62
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,530
Answer me! What in the world are you doing right now?!

63
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,390
I'm trying to leave a dying message.

64
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,220
Dying Message?

65
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,620
There's no point of living anymore.

66
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm sick of being treated like a monster and a mutant.

67
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,910
I'm thinking of just dying with everyone.

68
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,440
Wait! Wait! Listen to me for a minute, Yo Sub.

69
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,530
Only death, will make you free.

70
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,150
Most likely, that sky... will become my grave.

71
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,290
Wait! If you're leaving a dying message,

72
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,030
then that means that you have something to say, right?

73
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,190
Please tell me. I'll listen to you.

74
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,430
I'll head there right now. Just tell me where you are, huh?

75
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,430
Who knows? Where am I?

76
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,430
You should guess.

77
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,930
If you can find me before one hour is up, then you will be able to stop us.

78
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,440
- One hour?
- That's right.

79
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,170
But if you're late by even one second, we...

80
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,710
will already have disappeared and gone.
I think I have to hang up now,

81
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,590
since I need to finish this quickly.

82
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,220
- Bye.
- Hold on! Wait! Don't hang up! Wait!

83
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,680
Oh Ri Jin.

84
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,030
Does Vice President Cha happen to have a woman?

85
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
No, he does not.

86
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,390
And he doesn't have a woman hidden in America either?

87
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,330
As far as I know, he doesn't.

88
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,840
Then, during that time, why didn't he come to Korea

89
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,510
no matter how many times I called for him?

90
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:35,000
After he went abroad to study when he was 15 years old, he never once came back to Korea on his own will or without me calling him.

91
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,390
He turned a deaf ear even when his own mother called for him to come back. There's a reason why he put himself in exile, isn't there?

92
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,600
-That's because...
-Don't use the excuse that he was scared that I would be watching him.

93
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,650
It's different.

94
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,080
There's definitely another reason.

95
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,740
Tell me why he wouldn't leave America and come here.

96
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,760
And why he simply has to go back to America in three months no matter what.

97
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,970
What in the world is Cha Do Hyun hiding from me?

98
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,360
You said that he's going to commit suicide?

99
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,700
Are you sure? That the person who told you that, is someone called Yo Sub?

100
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,720
Yes. I don't have time.

101
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,540
I have to find him within one hour. That way I can stop him.

102
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,950
What about Secretary Ahn? Have you contacted him?

103
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,810
The calls keep going through, but he's not answering.

104
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,050
Please help me, Professor. Don't you have any idea where he would be?

105
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,740
Like something Yo Sub finds worth doing or something that he likes.

106
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,070
Anyway, anything would work.

107
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,270
Ahn Yo Sub is 17-years old. He is Yo Na's twin brother, who is also one of the personalities,

108
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,980
He is very smart, almost genius level. He has a lot of pride.

109
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,910
While he has a remarkable aesthetic sense, he morbidly dislikes ugly things.

110
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,480
Ah. He's also pessimistic and he wishes to die.

111
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,460
He's has a deep knowledge in art. Ah, he likes painting especially.

112
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,900
Painting? Did you just say painting?

113
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
The spray bottle...

114
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,150
He didn't talk about anything else but the dying message?

115
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,970
Anything else?

116
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,400
He said the sky would soon become his grave.

117
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,730
- It's a rooftop!
- What?

118
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,740
Yo Sub had once tried to commit suicide by jumping off of a roof.

119
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,650
So, where are you going right now?

120
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,430
I'm going to Cha Do Hyun's company to start off with.

121
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,010
I'm almost there now. Then, I'll go to the rooftop of his company...

122
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,070
It's not the company rooftop.

123
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,000
There are a lot of CCTV's in that building and a lot of people who recognize Cha Do Hyun.

124
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,220
More than anything else, it's going to be an unknown place where he can jump from any time he wants.

125
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,600
You think he would he still choose the company's rooftop? Someone as smart as Ahn Yo Sub?

126
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,090
He wouldn't wait for an hour somewhere where he could be found quickly and easily.

127
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,150
Then what should I do?

128
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,780
Calm down. You're the only one who can save Cha Do Hyun right now.

129
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,960
So what am I supposed to do? I only have thirty minutes left! So how am I supposed to...

130
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,250
Professor, I'll hang up now.

131
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,560
Why? Did you find something out?

132
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,110
I'm taking chances. I'm either right or wrong. I have to at least try.

133
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,420
Why did President Cha Ki Joon visit the psychiatry department of Kanghan Hospital?

134
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,820
It seems like you didn't know.

135
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,560
If you're going to hide something, you need to do it right.

136
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,050
Chairwoman, how much do you know?

137
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,040
Do I even know anything?

138
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,200
I'll let you know as much as you want.

139
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,830
I guess you don't know me that well yet.

140
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,960
I don't care what's going on with that child
or what secret he has.

141
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,240
I don't need to know, nor do I want to.

142
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,050
You weren't telling me to answer you when you asked those questions earlier?

143
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,250
Whatever his secret is,

144
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,220
make sure that Cha Young Pyo doesn't find out.

145
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,760
No matter what, that kid... has to be safe until my son wakes up.

146
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,940
Nothing must happen to him. Do you understand?

147
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,640
Until then, use any method to stop it.

148
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,450
That is what you must do.

149
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,200
Do Hyun

150
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,620
Se Gi

151
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,790
Perry Park

152
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,960
Na Na

153
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,260
Yo Na

154
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,690
Yo Sub

155
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,380
Kill Me!!

156
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,250
To buy things to paint with, he stopped by the craft store.

157
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,010
Then he will look for a place where he can paint without being interrupted.

158
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,730
We will come back after we are newly remodeled.

159
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,240
A place where he can jump right after he writes his dying message.

160
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,710
Perhaps, that sky...

161
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,870
will become my grave.

162
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,380
♬ The hidden things inside me, changed me greatly ♬

163
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,900
♬ They put me to sleep, tied my hands together, then locked me in a dark room ♬

164
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,710
♬ The lost pieces of time, the memories of love, which I abandoned  ♬

165
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,030
♬ Are erased and I'm left as an abandoned empty shell. ♬

166
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,610
♬ Without knowing anything I screamed, and that’s all I remember ♬

167
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,560
♬ My heart, which was as cold as ice, will melt once once I wake up ♬

168
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,620
♬ I want to free myself, from the torment of my sins ♬

169
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,770
♬ Someone take me out, from my spirit full of scars ♬

170
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:31,610
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave ♬

171
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:39,220
♬ You wake me up from my sleep and kiss me again ♬

172
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,890
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

173
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:53,740
♬ echoes in my ears every day, but where are you? ♬

174
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,460
♬ I want to break out of the darkness and find you ♬

175
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,450
♬ but I can’t touch you or be embraced by you ♬
- No!

176
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,920
♬ The things that are taking over me aren’t the bastards living inside me ♬

177
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,510
♬ The strong medicine will not heal me, only the word love ♬

178
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,280
♬ The voice that echoes in my ears wakes me up ♬

179
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,740
♬ Embraces and kisses me, and I can no longer see it anymore ♬

180
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,090
Come down.

181
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,050
Come down and talk with me.

182
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,830
After dying, what's the use of that dying message?

183
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,660
At least it'll be known that we lived in Cha Do Hyun's body.

184
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,490
Did you ask the other personalities? Do they all want to die?

185
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,870
There's no personality that wants to live? Without even asking that, you're going to die on your own right now?

186
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm saying I'll do what the cowards can't do.

187
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,710
You don't have the right to die whenever you want.

188
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,450
Your body isn't just yours!

189
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,390
Because we're all mixed into one body, we're called mutants.

190
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,660
You're not mutants! They're not only saying that to you!

191
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,240
Everyone has several people living inside them.

192
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,980
There's the me who wants to die and the me who wants to live.
I live every day fighting with the me who wants to give up

193
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,680
and the me who wants to at least grab at straws!

194
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,170
You don't have the courage to fight!

195
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,100
What do you know that you act like you know everything?

196
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,020
Come down.

197
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,240
Please!

198
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,990
Come down.

199
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,180
You were going to abandon Do Hyun Hyung anyways.

200
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,570
I said come down.

201
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,010
If you wanted to save me that badly...

202
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,550
you shouldn't have been late.

203
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,510
Please!

204
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,650
You're two minutes late.

205
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,070
A game's a game. Time over.

206
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,690
No!

207
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,230
- No! No! No!
- Let go.

208
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,230
- No! No
- Let go of me!

209
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,110
No!

210
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,810
Don't interfere!

211
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,800
Don't interfere...

212
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,080
No!!

213
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,060
Cha Do Hyun!

214
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,910
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

215
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,970
Cha Do Hyun! Come to your senses!

216
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,250
Come to your senses! Come to your senses!

217
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,130
Don't shake me. Stop...

218
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,090
Cha Do Hyun, come to your senses.

219
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,290
Come to your senses, Cha Do Hyun!!

220
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,830
Do you really want to die?

221
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,470
Is that what you really want?!

222
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,170
That can't be.

223
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,910
If that's the case, then you wouldn't have any reason to work so hard to live every day!

224
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,270
Come back!

225
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,050
Stop hiding and come out immediately Cha Do Hyun!

226
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,790
♫ A secret ♫

227
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,110
♫ that can't be told to anyone. ♫

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:28,170
♫ Everyone has at least one of those. ♫

♫ Don't love the me who is like this ♫

♫ What can I do about my heart being like this? ♫

234
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,800
If you hear me, come out!

235

♫ With a face that is unfamiliar when I first see it ♫

Come out and stop Yo Sub! Please!

241

Come out!

242
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,260
Come out and stop Yo Sub.

243
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,000
Don't die like this!

244
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

245

Cha Do Hyun!!

Come out!

247
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,190
I am Cha Do Hyun.

248
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,790
♫ You're like an old friend. ♫

249
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:52,910
♫ I can become familiar with you ♫

250

♫ Don't love the me that's like this ♫

252

It is you.

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,420
You really are Cha Do Hyun.

254
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:18,780

I thought you were really going to die!

258

[Kill Me!!]

269
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,030
The sky is like a blanket that is full of water.

270
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,210
If it snows at this rate, the traffic is going to be bad.

271
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,590
Did you bring your car?

272
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,520
Just get straight to the point.

273
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,130
You don't have the skill of talking indirectly.

274
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,710
I heard you asked Doctor Oh to be your secret physician.

275
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,100
Yes.

276
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,060
I recommended Doctor Oh

277
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,960
to go to Johns Hopkins and study abroad for a little while.

278
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,530
And Doctor Oh said she'll go there.

279
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,680
It's already her second time in the emergency room.

280
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,790
If you keep associating with her, Doctor Oh will be in danger.

281
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,630
It's not like I don't know your circumstances but

282
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm asking you this favor.

283
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,730
I would like it if you

284
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,820
no longer have Doctor Oh deeply involved in the fight between you and Se Gi.

285
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,830
When my time was stolen by Yo Sub,

286
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,860
I heard Oh Ri Jin's voice.

287
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,610
She was calling my name desperately.

288
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,290
I woke up because of that sound.

289
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,920
That was the first time something like that happened.

290
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,780
At that time, I suddenly had this thought.

291
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,370
That without me knowing, every time my time and memory were taken away...

292
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,100
I would like it if someone called me like that.

293
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,510
Is it greed?

294
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,780
As expected, is it something that can't happen?

295
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,200
Must I keep

296
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,670
living like a monster?

297
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,260
Is someone else over there?

298
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,110
If it's Yo Sub, tell him that I'm not leaving him alone the next time I see him.

299
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,590
Oh Ri Jin.

300
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,810
Yes.

301
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,680
Don't you want to become rich?

302
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,720
What is this? Perhaps some kind of a cure-all medicine or life-saving water, those things...

303
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,480
Are you trying to get me to sell something like those?

304
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,370
Everyone who knows my secret becomes rich.

305
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,550
Wow. Then I'm already a billionaire. I've already seen...
One, two, three.

306
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,380
Three people.

307
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,210
After they became rich, everyone left my side.

308
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,780
When I was young, I was sad about that.

309
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,710
Why do people want to become rich

310
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,130
and not want to become friends with me?

311
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,210
As I grew older, I found out.

312
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,140
They were smart.

313
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,450
That if you become friends with me, you'll be in danger.

314
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,910
After realizing that, I didn't make any friends.

315
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,600
Instead, I built a wall,

316
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,840
built a castle, and confined myself inside there.

317
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,220
I erased my emotions.

318
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,090
Cha Do Hyun!

319
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,590
Cha Do Hyun!

320
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,110
Don't die like this!

321
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,820
I thought that if I make you rich, I could

322
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,000
keep you by my side without feeling any emotions.

323
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,830
But...

324
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,260
I've lost confidence.

325
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,210
Oh Ri Jin,

326
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,700
I take back the offer of being my secret physician.

327
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,840
Oh Ri Jin,

328
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,870
while playing ball, you've made the small mistake of

329
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,700
throwing your ball at a monster living in his castle.

330
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,560
I'll give you back your ball, so please leave my castle.

331
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,940
Leave. Don't come back.

332
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,920
Cha Do Hyun...

333
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,550
For the price of not telling everything you saw, heard, and

334
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:43,250
felt inside the castle, you will become rich.

335
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,590
If you felt any compassion or curiosity toward me,
then please get rid of it all.

336
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:56,490
I'm not a wild beast that will turn into a charming prince after the magic wears off.

337
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,280
I'm just...

338
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,490
a monster.

339
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm just... a monster.

340
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,210
- Yes, Mom.
- Son! How are you?

341
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,450
Why haven't you visited? I'm going to forget how you look.

342
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,150
Sorry, I'll go there soon. Have you been well?

343
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,200
Well, aside from receiving scorn from the old tigress, I'm fine.

344
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,190
How about you?

345
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,250
Do you, by chance, still get nightmares these days?

346
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,500
Wait. Why are you suddenly asking me that?

347
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,590
Ah... It's not that.

348
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:07,220
You used to get nightmares often when you got stressed or when your environment changed.

349
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:13,000
Ahjumma told me you stopped by the wine cellar that day.

350
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,590
Hearing how a rascal like you who can't even take in alcohol stopped by there before me

351
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,230
made me worried about whether you were going through a hard time.

352
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,640
I didn't go there because I was going through a hard time, and for nightmares...

353
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,040
I...I'm strangely afraid of fire and basements.

354
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,550
But if I'm with you, I don't think I'll be scared.

355
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,210
I don't get them, anymore.

356
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,410
Really? It's the truth, right?

357
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,260
I can believe you, right?

358
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,210
Oh, Do Hyun, my guest came. I'll talk to you later.

359
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,120
Yes?

360
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,280
Find a child for me.

361
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,370
It's the picture of the child's mother who died 21 years ago.

362
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,400
If you investigate starting from things around that woman, you'll find clues.

363
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,340
As you might already know, no one can know of this.

364
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,960
Work more cautiously than ever.

365
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,990
Editor! I'm here~

366
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,210
Oh, right. Come in.

367
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,270
What brings you here? Is it okay for you to be here? What did you tell the workers?

368
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,760
I just told them I was the president of Omega's fan club.

369
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,700
Oh, really? Drink this.

370
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,420
Thank you.

371
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,220
A ton of calls are coming in for the copyright of the movie, but

372
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,610
you haven't changed your mind, right?

373
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,310
Well, just block them as moderately as you can.

374
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,820
Ah, right. Have you read the project proposal for the novel?

375
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,910
I've read it, of course.

376
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,900
I read it and it's great. I totally liked it.

377
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,200
I couldn't sleep because I got curious about the ending.

378
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,330
It's just about a chaebol mixed in with some mystery and things like that.

379
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,130
You're being stingy again.

380
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,600
You're feeling rather urgent again. You will find out in the right time.

381
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,940
This story goes back 21 years ago. A child got adopted;

382
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,800
however, the child is in a state where he lost all the memories of what happened before his adoption.

383
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,220
That child grew up living in the house he was adopted in as a twin sibling.

384
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,670
Then one day, he coincidentally hears his parents talking.

385
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,960
Then he finds out, the fact that he was adopted.

386
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:25,040
Then he hears it. The name of a chaebol who may have relation to his lost past.

387
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,610
The child becomes an adult and begins to investigate the secrets of that chaebol family to find out about his past.

388
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,340
He also finds out that there's a boy who is the same age as him in that household, and approaches him.

389
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,870
And then...

390
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,310
To be continued!

391
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,960
Why'd you do that? It was just getting interesting!

392
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,830
You'll get hurt if you know more.

393
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,990
Is this fiction or non-fiction?

394
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:14,010
Seeing how you even went to America to cover it, it looks like it's not totally fiction.

395
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,870
I need to cover more of it to know,

396
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,840
whether it's fiction or non-fiction.

397
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,970
- You just need to go this way.
- Yes, thank you.

398
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,330
His looks are totally on the level of Won Bin.

399
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,300
I think it would be difficult to meet up with the author of Omega directly.

400
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,760
The writer is continuously rejecting the distribution rights for the movie.

401
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,170
Is there any different information other than that?

402
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,030
I'm not sure. I don't know if this'll be information; but

403
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,550
in front of the publishing company, I coincidentally saw Writer Omega's fan club's president.

404
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,330
From what the editor said, in a while he's going to go do a recitation.

405
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,300
He's doing a recitation?

406
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:19,380
It's a fan club event where the fans can read the novels written by Omega's author or stories written by themselves.

407
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,460
It seems that sometimes the author of Omega comes there to see how his fans feel.

408
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,240
First, find out when and where the recitation is taking place.

409
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:37,370
Also, find out if he provided the meeting place, or if he's giving out some kind of merchandise to the fanclub members.

410
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,860
Whatever it takes, find a method to grab Omega's interest.

411
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,460
Yes.

412
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,360
Are you going somewhere?

413
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,970
I'm going on an arranged date, on the Chairwoman's command.

414
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,380
Don't look at me so pitifully like that, as if I'm going to sell my soul.

415
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm just going to at least be respectful, and come back right away.

416
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't follow me. I'm going alone.

417
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,510
You're here?

418
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,490
Oh, Chae Yeon, you're here. We're not late, right?

419
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,960
-I also just came. Go in first.
-Let's go in.

420
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,320
You're here, Madame.

421
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,540
Did my child come?

422
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,380
He is not here yet.

423
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,860
- Is he going to be late?
- He didn't say anything about it.

424
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,120
Is he working at the company?

425
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,180
Of course. A company was created so that people work.

426
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,460
He must be busy. Let's go in and wait for him.

427
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,360
There isn't anyone here who isn't busy.

428
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,320
I'll call him. Go in first.

429
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,800
Will you?

430
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,680
Let's go.

431
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,410
Chae Yeon!

432
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,810
Why aren't you coming? Your parents are already here.

433
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,310
I'm sorry. I don't think I can go today. I forgot that I have something important to do.

434
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,390
Do you think that I'm not busy?

435
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,090
Then you shouldn't have emphasized that I have to come.

436
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,550
What does cancelling all my schedules and coming here make me look like then?

437
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,150
I'm sorry. I'll call you again later.

438
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,350
Prepare what? A gun that doesn't make a sound?

439
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,610
It's meant as getting it ready as a weapon to keep the Board in check until the selection period.

440
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:37,550
Why are you acting like you are stupid? You understood everything.

441
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,930
So getting engaged is in the back of his mind because he is busy making weapons?

442
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,850
Don't rush them. They will take care of it when it's the right time.

443
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,170
You are really foolish.

444
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,690
It's a weapon to get engaged with Chae Yeon and become economically stable.

445
00:41:54,690 --> 00:42:00,490
Chairwoman is already planning to marry off Do Hyun with Myeong Seong's second daughter.

446
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:04,030
What if we are in a disadvantageous situation at this rate?

447
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,000
A person like Chairman Hong who cares a lot about people's background

448
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,710
won't give his daughter to Do Hyun easily.

449
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,100
Do Hyun, are you listening to me?

450
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,370
I'm sorry. It's just that it's snowing.

451
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,610
You are still innocent, the same as before.

452
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,260
That is making me cringe.

453
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,850
That's what I'm saying.

454
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,860
You don't know, but he's not all that innocent. Aren't I right?

455
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,310
Unnie, how did you know we were here?

456
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,830
I was having a meal with Ki Joon's parents upstairs.

457
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,640
But you, who already has a girlfriend who is a doctor, became eligible for marriage very soon.

458
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,570
Why are you so surprised, as if you are a deer caught in headlights? Our marriages are all strategies of the elders.

459
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,450
There isn't anyone who sits here without any sad memories of love.

460
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,110
You dated Yoo Seung Group's third son for a while.

461
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,370
But I never expected this from you.

462
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:14,500
From what I hear, you embarrassed your first love greatly.

463
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,970
I thought that you were serious with that doctor.

464
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,770
There was a saying for situations like this.

465
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,410
Oh, I remember now.

466
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,510
"Taking care of your fishery".

467
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,950
Did you threaten her that you will step on her pride if she crosses the line as well?

468
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,770
And did you also tell her to run away and avoid you?

469
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,310
Ji Sun is uncomfortable right now. Let's talk later.

470
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,680
No. I'm done.

471
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,570
I just wanted to say hi, but the conversation ended up being longer than I thought.

472
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,890
He isn't innocent, but does seem to be ambitious. Good luck!

473
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:01,760
Personally, I don't want you to date him because I really like you.

474
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,670
-Ah, right. I heard that you got your tickets.
-Yes.

475
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,980
You did well. Yeah.

476
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,620
I was worried that you would change your mind because of what happened that day with Yo Sub.

477
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,770
I shouldn't have worried.

478
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,490
Is that all your luggage?

479
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,540
Yes. Because I'm not leaving yet.

480
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,760
That's right, you're not leaving yet.

481
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,200
Well then.

482
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,760
Bye.

483
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,080
Yes. Goodbye.

484
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,400
- Dr. Oh.
- Yes, Professor.

485
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,300
A psychiatrist is not a savior.

486
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,470
You cannot save everyone, and you must not be under a delusion that you can.

487
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,860
Department of Psychiatry

488
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,110
So if something is bothering you,

489
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,180
if that is pity or guilt,

490
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,290
put off your weight and go.

491
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,740
Come back after you grow as a doctor.

492
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

493
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,460
Are you alright?

494
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,610
Then.

495
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:17,120
Is it just my greed? Can it not happen?

496
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Do I have to keep living

497
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:28,050
like a monster?

498
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,420
Ah. Yes.

499
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,940
Oh, what is it? What? Do you have things left to say?

500
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,980
Hello.

501
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,680
You came all the way here, but I'm sorry.

502
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,320
I knew that it wouldn't be easy because you are quite a respectable doctor.

503
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,760
Truthfully, my cousin suggested you.

504
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,380
ID Entertainment- Cha Ki Joon.

505
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:21,660
I heard that you helped him in America and told me that you are a great doctor.

506
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,540
Yes.

507
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,220
But this rascal isn't telling me what kind of help you offered him.

508
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,900
If he has a problem, I want to help him as a brother and as a family.

509
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,920
So you didn't come here because of medical purposes.

510
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:49,240
Am I caught? Then I will get straight to the point.

511
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,120
What problem does Do Hyun have?

512
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,180
Did you check Patient 1103?

513
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,260
Yes, I did.

514
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,500
- Excuse me.
- Yes, what is it?

515
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,560
I don't know what it is, but ask me anything.

516
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,830
I want to see Dr. Oh Ri Jin.

517
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:20,310
Doctor Oh Ri Jin? She took a break.

518
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,570
Doctor Oh said she's going to say her goodbyes to Doctor Seok and leave right after, right?

519
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,730
Yeah.

520
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

521
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,860
Are you okay?

522
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,590
Yes.

523
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:06,100
Come out! Come out and stop Yo Sub!

524
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,320
Don't die like this!

525
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:45,600
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave ♬

526
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:53,180
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

527
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm not a beast who will become a charming prince

528
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,420
after the spell is broken.

529
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,260
I am just a monster.

530
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,340
♬ I walk through the darkness because I want to find you, ♬

531
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:03,310
♬ I can’t touch you or be embraced by you ♬

532
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,190
♬ The things that are taking over me aren’t the bastards living inside me ♬

533
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,840
♬ The strong medicine will not heal me, only the word love ♬

534
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,650
♬  The voice that echoes in my ears wakes me up ♬

535
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,280
♬ Embraces and kisses me, and I can no longer see it anymore ♬

536
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,970
♬ The deep night shows you, ♬

537
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,180
♬ who was not able to leave ♬
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep, ♬

538
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:32,750
♬ and kisses me again ♬

539
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:39,460
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

540
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:46,540
♬ echoes in my ears every day, where are you? ♬

541
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:53,570
♬ In the unreachable night sky, I see you, who is turning back ♬

542
00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:01,120
♬ From this hard day, it makes a picture ♬

543
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,900
♬ I’m sorry. I hold on to you, and tell you to not get far away from me ♬

544
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:16,250
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

545
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,260
What are you doing?! Aren't you going to bring your bags?

546
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,470
That's why I told you not to come here.

547
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,720
You're about to get on a plane, so how can your parents not come?

548
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,520
Do you know the hell that your parents' hearts are in until they get a phone call saying that you arrived safely?

549
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,070
You can't even send your daughter off with a smile.

550
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,730
Making her heart feel all uncomfortable... Why are you doing that?

551
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,760
It's barely six months, so what's the deal?

552
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,320
Should I buy you something when I come back? Is there anything you want, Mom?

553
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,370
What do you mean, present?

554
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,410
All you have to do is be healthy when you come back.

555
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,650
But still, tell me.

556
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,230
Is there anything you want, Dad?

557
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,310
Hey, hey! You're even giving her a letter now?

558
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,630
You'd think their daughter was a troop getting dispatched somewhere from looking at them.

559
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,100
I was worried that you would spend a whole lot of money for no reason, so I made this.

560
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,470
But if you're going to buy me a gift, just get that.

561
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,130
Dad, I saw these personally,

562
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,920
but carmel brown is better than black.

563
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,380
-Carmel brown is better?
-Yeah.

564
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,180
Limited edition.

565
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,090
Deal.

566
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,320
You call yourself a father?

567
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,660
Should we take a picture somewhere?

568
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,530
- A picture?
- Yeah.

569
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,790
Hey, other people are busy, so don't become a public nuisance.

570
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:30,560
Here.

571
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,740
Here.

572
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,470
Bbuing~

573
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,260
Get in there! Alright! One, two...

574
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:53,850
John Hopkins! John Hopkins!

575
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,370
One more time?

576
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:01,550
John Hopkins! John Hopkins!

577
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,070
Happy now?

578
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,080
What is this?

579
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,670
I'm going to go get my luggage. You guys stay here, alright?

580
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,740
Thank you.

581
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,630
Take this.

582
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,650
If you regret your choice or if you're having a hard time, run back here.

583
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,330
With class and elegance.

584
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,890
while flying with all your strength!

585
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,540
You know that, right?

586
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,790
The best choice is your choice.

587
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,110
I love you, Oh Ri On.

588
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,900
She left on the plane this morning.

589
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Secretary Ahn,

590
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,820
I hear I'm going to be getting a new secret psychiatrist.

591
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,100
If I do, please make sure it's a man.

592
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,090
Women are a bit troublesome.

593
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,930
Alright then. Shall we go to work?

594
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:06,500
Is there someone else who knows my secret passcode?

595
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,240
Oh Ri Jin! How come you're here?

596
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,880
Ah, I was a bit late in introducing myself.

597
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,650
From now on, I'm Cha Do Hyun's physician, Oh Ri Jin.

598
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,720
I'm sorry, it's not a male doctor.

599
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,190
I conversed with her on the phone before,

600
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,550
and she had become more passionate.

601
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,270
Number 1.

602
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,080
You probably know this, but I'm not a professional.

603
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,710
I also don't have the confidence to put either Mr. Cha or Mr. Shin to sleep,

604
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,120
so I will decline any of those kinds of requests.

605
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,880
But I will try to calm Se Gi down and stop him from creating trouble.

606
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Number two.

607
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,570
If Mr. Cha and Mr. Shin need to communicate with one another, I can become a psychiatrist who will mediate between you two fairly.

608
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:16,260
Number 3. So that the other personalities won't interfere with Mr. Cha's daily life,

609
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,670
I will try to talk and make a compromise with them.

610
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:23,960
And I will turn in my demands for the contract later.

611
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,610
What do you think? Did you understand everything I said?

612
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,750
Alright then, any questions?

613
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:39,050
Mom, dad, Oh Ri On. I'm sorry for lying.

614
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:46,210
But... somehow, I've started to want to help this person.

615
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,870
Even though I have some shortcomings and faults,

616
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:11,240
I have a family that will help me and embrace me.

617
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,090
But this person... has no one.

618
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:24,970
I have a lot of good memories that I can think of whenever I'm having a hard time,

619
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:33,850
but this person doesn't have anything like that. He lives each and every moment losing his memories and his time.

620
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:42,970
I have a lot of people who love me,

621
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:49,530
but even if this person has people that he loves, he can't hold onto them.

622
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:01,310
That's why... I want to help him. I want to help him get out from his castle.

623
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,290
And I want to let him know...

624
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,640
That if you want to be friends, you hold your hand out...

625
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,920
If you don't have any questions, then is that all, Sir?

626
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:21,820
And that it's okay to grab onto someone else's hand if they hold it out to you.

627
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,420
Vice President.

628
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,270
How cold.

629
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,530
Alright then, I'll just be on my way to John Hopkins again.

630
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,290
Why are you acting so indecently?

631
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:59,240
If I grab onto the hand you're holding out, you won't be able to go back from this moment forward.

632
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,640
Even if it's just a ball that accidentally came over the wall, I am not giving it back to you.

633
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,690
Would that still...

634
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,420
be okay?

635
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,250
How is it harder for me to grab your hand than to shake hands with a Hallyu star?

636
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:58,630
Do you walk on stone bridges? Why are you so picky! Just go for it!

637
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,480
What kind of woman keeps... Ow!!!

638
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,520
So... please support me.

639
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,780
Secretary Ahn! Ah!

640
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,390
Tell me that I did well...

641
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:19,420
Just like you always have.

642
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,080
Ow!
