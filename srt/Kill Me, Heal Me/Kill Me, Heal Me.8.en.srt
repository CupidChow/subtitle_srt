1
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,390
Ah! Ow!

2
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,190
-Ow! Ow! Really, seriously...
-Ah, Vice President! Vice President!

3
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,750
- Let go now.
- Ah!

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,760
Really! It hurts!

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,750
Shin Se Gi?

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,730
I'm Cha Do Hyun!

7
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,530
I thought that you were Mr. Shin because you were so unyielding.

8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,440
It's my first time seeing the Vice-President getting so angry.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,010
I thought he was shy but he has more of a temper than I thought.

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,420
Be careful. If he gets stressed or his blood pressure rises, another personality can come out.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,470
What are you two doing?

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,400
Did you see him get annoyed just now?

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,310
Slightly.

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,330
I didn't get annoyed!

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,950
It's ok. It's not embarrassing to truthfully express your emotions.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,120
If you get annoyed, get annoyed. That's normal.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,190
You're doing so well right now.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,150
I didn't get annoyed! I said I didn't!

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,270
Shin Se Gi?

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,450
I'm Cha Do Hyun!

21
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,390
Kill Me, Heal Me

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,870
Episode 8

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,460
It's a report on my alternate personalities' characteristics, features, and behavior patterns.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,420
Ah. Yes.

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,070
This is the history of records of Dr. Seok Ho Pil's psychotherapy.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,310
It's the records of other psychiatrists.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,530
These are the files that have the progress of my treatment.

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,300
And this was my diary, which I wrote every day for the past eleven years.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,210
There are a lot of things, so you don't have to read all of them.

30
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,870
Just check the parts I've checked and the monthly summaries.

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,030
This really comforts me.

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,550
I will look over them after I organize my things.

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,570
Ah, right. Where's my dormitory? Is it near here?

34
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,920
You didn't tell Oh Ri Jin where her dormitory was?

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,540
Ah.

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,050
I sent the contract to your cellphone.

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,790
I think she couldn't check it because she came so hurriedly.

38
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,070
Explain it to her.

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,540
As you know, until the shareholder's meeting, Vice-President must be extremely careful.

40
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,660
Following that, you Oh Ri Jin, who has become a secret physician, must care for Vice President 24/7.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,910
In other words, you have to live in this house with him.

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,700
That...

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,970
That means...

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,710
you're saying I need to live with him?

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,030
Se Gi and Perry like to drink beer at night.

46
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,900
I don't know when Yo Sub will attempt to commit suicide again.

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,310
I can't be reassured whenever I'm sleeping.

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,390
Am I a shaman who takes in bad luck? Why would I need to watch over while you sleep?

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,470
There's no need to be sitting right next to me.

50
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,490
You just have to deal with emergency situations when they arise.

51
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,590
No...I...

52
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,990
If my duty is to take care of Mr. Cha 24/7,

53
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,900
let's just say it's ok for home: but, at work,

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,900
what do I watch you with? Do I do it with a CCTV?

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,350
- You didn't explain it to her?
- I did send the contract by phone.

56
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,910
Explain it to her.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,100
- You have to have a disguise...
- What do you mean 'disguise'?

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,110
What is it?

59
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,510
What do I have to disguise with?

60
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,190
Please inform the company that I'll be working outside the office for the time being.

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,450
We have to let Oh Ri Jin know about the situation.

62
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,400
I got it.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,270
No way. This is a fraud contract! It's a slave contract!

64
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,260
- It looks like she checked the contract.
- She won't want to change it, right?

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,290
If she does want to change, are you thinking of sending her away?

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,060
You're not letting her be near you or let her feel your emotions.

67
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,150
And pretending to be evil is necessary.

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,080
Do you have the confidence?

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,940
What are you trying to say?

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,720
After seeing you always holding it in and working hard to keep it down,

71
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,100
I saw you getting annoyed for the first time today.

72
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,730
I didn't get annoyed.

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,620
It's a first after 11 years.

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,060
A person that let you drop down your guard like that.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,270
That's why...

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,870
don't lose her.

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,690
Oh Ri Jin,

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,630
where are you going?

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,960
I'm sorry. I didn't think it through. I just thought that I had to give you consultations for an hour

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,080
and visit you on emergency situations. I didn't know that I would have to live with you and pretend that I am your secretary.

81
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,790
I don't think I can just do this with my will. Then.

82
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,740
Shin Se Gi?

83
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,010
I'm Cha Do Hyun.

84
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,470
Can you be rough like this? If you're like this, I'll be confused.

85
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,170
Mr. Cha, let go of me and talk. Let go and talk.

86
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,100
Ah! Seriously! Ow!

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,310
Is there a law that allows a doctor to leave their patient?

88
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,480
This is definitely a slave contract!

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,180
It's also your fault, you who held out your hand without reading the contract.

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,050
Wow~

91
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,380
I saved a person that was drowning, and now you ask me for your bundle!

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,300
You're wrong. It's correct that I fell in the water but you haven't saved me yet.

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,740
I asked for your help after revealing the bundle.

94
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,420
Bundle? What bundle?

95
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,280
The contract fee that was sent to your account.

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,260
You haven't checked it yet?

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
Whoa~

98
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,070
Didn't I tell you? That all the people who knew my secret became rich.

99
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,030
Are you childishly bragging about your money right now?

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,000
If you say you'll disguise yourself as my secretary, I'll double it.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,270
Oh...This guy, really!

102
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,380
Do I look like a heroine from a romance comedy who ends up in a fake marriage just because of private loan debts?

103
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,970
I refuse. I will refuse your refusal.

104
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,410
Then I'll triple it.

105
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,150
Don't misunderstand. I'm not doing this right now because I'm surprised,

106
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,130
it's just that I got a slight cramp in my leg. Just know it like that.

107
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,630
Then... Goodbye... Ah!

108
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,490
Didn't I tell you?

109
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,700
That the moment you grab my hand I hold out, you can't turn back.

110
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,670
I can't send you away.

111
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,730
Even if it's a ball that came over accidentally, I won't return it.

112
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,910
Sit down.

113
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,320
Ah, what's wrong with me? Seriously. I suddenly got a cramp in my leg.

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,180
I know right.

115
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,090
I'm okay. Why are you doing this?

116
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,900
Oh my, why are you doing this?

117
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,050
I'm imitating Se Gi.

118
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,160
You got him a secret physician?

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,440
That's right, Chairwoman.

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,890
Is she trustworthy?

121
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,100
She's a person who Vice President needs more than anyone.

122
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,740
Find out her background.

123
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,950
Not even a speck of dust must come out.

124
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,110
She's a pure person.

125
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,140
Do I have to assign a person who will find out her background?

126
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,420
No. I'll do it.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,470
When you're done, please leave.

128
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,100
I told you to leave, so why are you still standing there?

129
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,730
Did you already know

130
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,230
what was wrong with the Vice President? Or...

131
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,180
did you really not want to know?

132
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,710
What are you going to do with that even if you know?

133
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,540
If I know, then that's just one more mouth that we have to watch out for.

134
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,950
You knew?

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,230
The reason why I provided your education and hired you was

136
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,980
not just because of your excellent brain.

137
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,670
Your ability to keep secrets played a big part as well.

138
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,770
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,330
I was presuming.

140
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,360
There will be a hand that the other side will offer.

141
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,910
Don't hold it and wait by Do Hyun's side.

142
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,460
That'll become useful.

143
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,820
You are concluding as if there is something wrong with him.

144
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,700
I've witnessed many different sides.

145
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,990
He was leaving the club with a different gaze of a completely different person.

146
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,990
Or when I mentioned the situation with you, his hand would violently shake.

147
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,080
It seemed to be a point where I think I should be worried.

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, that would differ depending on the motive.

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
Is it drugs or alcohol?

150
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,150
Will you be satisfied if it's one between those two?

151
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,410
If it isn't both of them, just what is the problem?

152
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,590
I, as a psychiatrist, have nothing else to tell you.

153
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,410
Mr. Cha is just

154
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,610
one among the many students

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,010
that I have taught in college.

156
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,230
Doctor Seok's mouth was closed by Secretary Ahn.

157
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,040
He got rid of the girl he dated in America.

158
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,180
Now he is getting engaged before the shareholder's meeting.

159
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,680
That's pretty good, Cha Do Hyun.

160
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,790
Hey, Ji Sun. What's going on?

161
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,900
Chae Yeon and I?

162
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,930
There's nothing wrong.

163
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,410
Why did you suddenly... ?

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,880
Why do I have to do that?

165
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,330
You were rude.

166
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,290
Give Ji Sun presents and apologize, so that this rumor doesn't come up again.

167
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,620
What rumor came up?

168
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,590
Don't ask. Don't ask and just do as I tell you.

169
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,450
What are you doing?

170
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,310
I am going to ask her what the rumor that you swallowed is, and hear it from her personally.

171
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,610
Why?

172
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,650
The rumor is that you became a dog who chased around a chicken. Are you satisfied?

173
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,870
- What?
- The moment Cha Do Hyun became the first successor of the line,

174
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,760
your eyes flipped around and began to fret.

175
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,780
Because you couldn't stand to see Cha Do Hyun become somebody else's man,

176
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,970
you even went to his blind date and made a ruckus, but Cha Do Hyun didn't even pay attention to you.

177
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,300
But that Han Chae Yeon's fiancee is Cha Do Hyun's second cousin!

178
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,400
The scenario is a killer, seriously.

179
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,930
Do more? Should I do more?

180
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,310
Should I write more soap operas with my mouth?

181
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,910
It was because I couldn't stand the sight of Do Hyun wanting Ji Sun's stocks, even when he already had a girlfriend.

182
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,000
I did it for Ji Sun!

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,860
It doesn't matter to people!

184
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,610
People just remember the cold and provocative things.

185
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,060
You look like you're no different right now.

186
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,010
There's no need for long talk. Get engaged. With an engagement, get rid of this rumor.

187
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,690
Oppa, is this how you propose?!

188
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,000
What? Should I sing you a song? Call for a choir? Set off some fireworks?

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,600
The person who ruined my engagement, which should be celebrated and be the center of attention, is you.

190
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,160
My engagement?

191
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,410
You volunteered to be part of a rumor that is going around.

192
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,960
You even dragged me into this and put me on the chopping block!

193
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,460
Do you think you're such an amazing person?

194
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,910
Why do you think that people pay attention to you and love you?

195
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,640
There will be news that will be released by the promotion team tomorrow.

196
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,110
Until the shareholder's meeting, I'm not getting engaged.

197
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,440
If you say to do it, am I a person who'll just do it? Just what kind of confidence is that?

198
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,260
I'll decide my engagement day.

199
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,530
For now, it's the best thing to study about the different personalities and their natures.

200
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,520
That way, when the personalities appear,

201
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,770
you won't be shocked and handle the situation.

202
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,180
Nana.

203
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,990
Ahn Yo Na.

204
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,450
I still haven't met Nana and Yo Na.

205
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,730
What kind of personalities are they?

206
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,060
Nana is a new personality who appeared recently, so there's nothing that's been understood about her for sure.

207
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,400
Yo Na...

208
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,280
Yo Na...

209
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,670
Yo Na must not be an easy personality either.

210
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,000
These are the people I need to be absolutely cautious and careful of.

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,740
If I show symptoms of my illness in front of these people,

212
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,630
you have to use any method to stop it.

213
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,870
If the situation isn't for that, at least use ropes to tie me.

214
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,350
You mustn't lose me.

215
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,350
Yes, Sir!

216
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,340
You will not let her be near you. You will not let her know your emotions.

217
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,220
And pretending to be evil is necessary.
Are you confident?

218
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,350
Oh? She's a total beauty.

219
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,730
President Cha Ki Joon's fiancee and your childhood friend?

220
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,890
Hey, she's such a beauty, there's no way she was just your friend.

221
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,710
Tell me truthfully,

222
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,500
You liked her, right?

223
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,140
Let's go in and talk.

224
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,610
Do it here.

225
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,080
Why are you doing this to me, really?

226
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,610
You're in front of my house. Lower your voice.

227
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,820
What are you? What are you that you

228
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,210
make me into the main character of a soap opera?

229
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,220
- Chae Yeon.
- Who do you think you are that you can shake me up?!

230
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,580
You said that I was your first love and that you liked me.

231
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,170
But why did you change?

232
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,360
Why are you suddenly acting like a coward?

233
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,420
Is it because of Ki Joon Oppa?

234
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,310
- Is it a rebellion for me to leave Ki Joon and come to you?
- Chae Yeon.

235
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,790
Who's in your heart?

236
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,470
Is it that woman, Oh Ri Jin?

237
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,420
-Or... Ji Sun?
-Chae Yeon...

238
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,950
If it's not,

239
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,830
do I just need to leave Ki Joon and come to you?

240
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,920
Answer me! Answer me, hurry!

241
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,110
You...

242
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,070
really want to know my answer?

243
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,050
Oh Ri Jin! Come out!

244
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,370
Come out, Oh Ri Jin!

245
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,380
What's wrong with him, all of a sudden?

246
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,330
-Oh Ri Jin!
- Oh..seriously.

247
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,960
Hello.

248
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,550
I... that is...

249
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,560
Does that answer your question?

250
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,290
Excuse me! I think you misunderstood something.

251
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,620
Excuse me, excuse me, wait a minute, excuse me!

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,220
Excuse me... Are you alright?

253
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,600
If you're not okay, I'll be your alcohol buddy...

254
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,690
Let's end the study for today.

255
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,720
She's probably arrived safely, right?

256
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,100
I don't know if she took everything without missing anything.

257
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,950
I wasn't all that focused that day either.

258
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,490
Father, if you're not going to eat that, I'll eat it for you.

259
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,800
Punk! After sending your sister to a faraway country, you're not even sad?!

260
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,320
You're being too much over a measly six months, seriously.

261
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,180
You guys are overreacting and overprotective of her!

262
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,700
That's why she only looks fine on the outside but is all messed up on the inside.

263
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,950
That's why she thinks that other peoples' pains and her pains are her own!

264
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh, I'm done eating.

265
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,660
I have to write my script, so don't look for me.

266
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,010
I won't look for you. Why would I look for you?!

267
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,210
That compassionless rascal. Why did he take somebody else's soup?

268
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,160
Aish.

269
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,780
Cheese! One, two, three!

270
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,080
If you smile, it'll look nice. Aren't you going to smile?

271
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,240
Why aren't you smiling?

272
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,790
From now on, you two are oppa and dongsaeng.

273
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,400
You're twin siblings. Isn't that nice? It'll be fun, right?

274
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,910
Right? Right? Right?

275
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,920
Here, our Ri On is the older brother and Ri Jin is the little sister.

276
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,890
Here, you two hold hands. From now on, get along.

277
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,730
Now, I'll take another one.

278
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,030
- It's fun!
- You have to look here.

279
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,410
Here, here.

280
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,990
Let's see here.

281
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,670
-Ri On!
-What's wrong?

282
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,180
What's wrong?

283
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,840
Ri On!

284
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,820
-Ah!
-Hey!

285
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,010
Ri On! Let go! Let go!

286
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,800
-Ri On!
- Aish.

287
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,490
Aigoo...

288
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,780
Hey, Ri Jin. Sis, let go of me and talk. Let go.

289
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,050
You're dead! You've brought my homework I've worked on all night? You're dead!

290
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,290
Hey, how can you do this to your brother...

291
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,790
How could you steal your younger sister's homework!

292
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,810
Hey! I raised my little sister too tough...so...

293
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,040
He's not rude!

294
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,340
It's just that he gets embarrassed easily. Do you know how well he treats me when we are alone?

295
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,860
Hey, he's showing interest in you because it's the exams period. To borrow your notes.

296
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,820
Since our goal is the same, we decided to go to the same University.

297
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,830
How can a dude like that get a lower grade than you?

298
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,970
He looked at me as if I am his parent's enemy.

299
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,210
Hey, you don't know the situation that well because you are growing slowly.

300
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,180
A boy and a girl's emotions...

301
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,380
Oh, right.

302
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,470
What's wrong with you, you scared me.

303
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,130
Is it this book?

304
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,170
It's not.

305
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,900
So, it's not.

306
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,440
Hey! What's wrong with you? Is this a headlock?

307
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,810
Is this a new skill? Are you saying you want to try me?

308
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,810
The library is chilly. It's cold.

309
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,430
It's because the library is so cold. Aigoo, it's cold.

310
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,220
Let go!

311
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,160
When are you going to grow up and become a man?

312
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,310
Mom! Please knock! Knock!

313
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,250
Why did you close it? What are you hiding?

314
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,720
You were watching porn, weren't you? You were watching porn!

315
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,840
Mom, I'm not a teenager! You have to think of my level. Sheesh!

316
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
How do I look at your level?

317
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,080
I look at it like this! Like this!

318
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,270
This, this Unnie... Why do you have it, Mom?

319
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,490
You had dark circles underneath your eyes,

320
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,640
so I thought that you were working hard. I thought that my child is going to become a panda!

321
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,460
And I was feeling bad for you!

322
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,550
What were you looking at all night?

323
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,790
- What are you watching all night?
- Mom!

324
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,980
Ri On, I'm sorry.

325
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,610
I was really worried about Sis...

326
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,890
How can you not understand how an older brother is feeling?

327
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,000
Hey!

328
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,650
Ri On!

329
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,190
What's wrong with him?

330
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,160
Nothing. I just misunderstood something.

331
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,210
He's already tired from working the whole night.

332
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,860
You should have gone easier on him.

333
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,540
Look at this... !

334
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,960
Why are you taking that?

335
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Go out and get ready for business!

336
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,180
I understand. I understand.

337
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,120
Aiyoo...

338
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Honey. Honey...

339
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,820
About Ri On...

340
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,970
Why Ri On?

341
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,170
It can't be, must not be.

342
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,070
About what?

343
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,200
That.. Ri On... Ri Jin...

344
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,610
You're really crazy!

345
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,630
No... I've heard many rumors. And sometimes,

346
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,910
their family was in the gossip magazines.

347
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,070
It's just because I'm a bit nervous.

348
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,170
Stop saying useless things and just wash the anchovy container!

349
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,040
Ah, move!

350
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,240
Why is she so angry?

351
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,560
I already talked to the fanclub about your suggestion.

352
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,570
They accepted your suggestion, and will go about the recitation today as planned.

353
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,840
That's good.

354
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were having a meeting.

355
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,530
No. It's okay. I've just brewed coffee. Have some.

356
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,870
Yes.

357
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,860
So, what is the possibility of Writer Omega attending the recitation?

358
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,690
According to the editor, the plan was cancelled and then created again.

359
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,540
He says the possibility of him not coming is 99%.

360
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,260
We should still go. There's a possibility of 1%.

361
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,010
Did you get the photo of Omega that I requested for?

362
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,340
The thing is... It will be hard to get his picture unless the editor cooperates.

363
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,070
But from the rumors I heard...

364
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,380
They say his face is Won Bin's level.

365
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,000
I heard that he's like a celebrity.

366
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,290
I'm sorry!

367
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,770
Let's go. First let's just go and look for someone that looks like Won Bin.

368
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,740
Ah, about that...

369
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,970
Truthfully, I don't think I can bring you there today.

370
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,890
I suddenly have a different appointment.

371
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,430
So....

372
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,890
What? Why are you looking at me?

373
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,680
These people! I'm already a shaman that takes in bad energy and a secretary.

374
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,540
What more are you telling me to do?!

375
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,930
Rule number 2 of the contract.

376
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,740
For the duration of the contract period, except for unavoidable circumstances,

377
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,350
it is to be followed that you must be beside Party A and watching over him 24/7.

378
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,850
I have no choice! I have no choice!

379
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,180
Will you really be okay by yourself?

380
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,690
I'm okay. Don't worry.

381
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,140
But what if suddenly Perry Park pops out...

382
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,150
Well, I guess even if he does appear,

383
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,480
all he would do is throw bombs, right?

384
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,170
Rule #4, 2nd clause. Parties A and B,

385
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,230
except when they are disguised as secretary and Vice-President, respectively, are of equal standing.

386
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,970
Right?

387
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,270
That's right.

388
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,000
I have a condition for going with you today.

389
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,870
Tell me.

390
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,860
Every day for an hour, give it to me so I can counsel you.

391
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,430
I said I don't need treatment.

392
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,690
Not treatment,

393
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,270
I'm saying to be friends. Deal?

394
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,180
I also told you I don't need friends.

395
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,450
Alright. Then I'll just go back to Johns Hopkins.

396
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,850
Deal.

397
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,990
Ah, deal.

398
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,630
Deal.

399
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,300
I'm sorry for being late.

400
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,020
A person who has nothing to do should come first and wait. What can we do about that?

401
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,720
Sit down.

402
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,260
Yes.

403
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,390
So, why did you suddenly... ?

404
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,530
Secretary Ahn, are you a spy that the old woman put next to Do Hyun?

405
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:51,330
Is that why you stop by her office regularly?

406
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,570
So that you can tattletale on Do Hyun?

407
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,320
- There's no way.
- Secretary Ahn! Just whose side are you on?

408
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,060
Are you in Do Hyun's side or that old woman's side?

409
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,600
Don't make a person confused and behave clearly!

410
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,950
- Madame...
- If...

411
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,900
you stab my Do Hyun in the back,

412
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,380
I won't stay still.

413
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,790
You understand me?

414
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,870
What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?

415
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,810
You miss Unnie already?

416
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,950
I know right. Why do you already want to see her. Right?

417
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,820
I should have just told her to be a physician of a chaebol.

418
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,140
Yes, Editor.

419
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,850
Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you going to that recitation today?

420
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,230
Recitation? Wasn't that cancelled?

421
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,180
I thought the meeting location is going to undergo an interior renovation.

422
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,790
Don't even talk about it. ID Entertainment is totally going into war mode to get your permission for copyright.

423
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,870
I am not sure what's going to happen at the recitation, but the fanclub says

424
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:16,020
they are just going to roughly go through it at a franchise cafe that offered the space at no cost plus food and drinks.

425
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,710
If it's ID Entertainment, the one under Seung Jin Group, right?

426
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,110
That's right. Since we don't know what's going on, don't go.

427
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,740
What if your identity gets revealed?

428
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,290
I thought about it. No-no, I have a bad feeling about it don't go.

429
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,500
[We want Omega]

430
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,660
Along with a shattering scream, K was having another nightmare.

431
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,670
K opened his eyes and found himself in an unknown place.

432
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:55,050
"Where am I? Where are you, Hyung? You're there."

433
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,860
What is that? The forgotten memories. The horrendous nightmare.

434
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,580
An unstoppable chaser. A thrilling suspense under the moonlight!

435
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,570
At that moment, a black shadow jumped on K.

436
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,880
No! No! Don't come closer! Don't come closer! No one can control my body!

437
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,860
No, you're...! No, you're...!

438
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,630
That's all for today.

439
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,510
Thank you. This has been Gamma-Linolenic Acid (his nickname).

440
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,970
Thanks for your hard work.

441
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:40,500
Mr.Gamma Linolenic Acid, who is called the great titan of the MegaLove fanfic world. "Evening Primrose Oil Murder Case"!

442
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,480
We are now officially concluding the recitation, and moving into reception.

443
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,740
It's my first time coming to a recitation. It's more fun than I thought...

444
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,290
What is the reason you are acting like this?

445
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,810
Just as I have to keep your promise, I have a promise I need to keep for someone.

446
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,150
Have you ever thought that this state makes you stand out more?

447
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,500
- I'm here!!!
- Mr.Alpha Lipoic Acid!!

448
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:36,180
- I'm sorry to be late, Sunbae-nim...
- Mr.Helicobacter, Mr.Vitamin, Mr.Squalene!

449
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,870
Where are you going?

450
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,180
My brother is here!

451
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,450
Why is your brother here?

452
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,410
Because my brother is Writer Omega...'s fan! Huge fan!

453
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,860
But why are you are you running away?

454
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,840
I am supposed to be in America right now, so I can't get caught.

455
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,090
Then, let's get out.

456
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Mr. Gamma-Linolenic Acid!

457
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,190
Ah, I really wanted to listen to you!

458
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,990
- What should I do?
- It's too bad we have to part like this.

459
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,660
Sorry, I have a call right now. I will be going first. I'm sorry.

460
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,610
I understand. Yes.

461
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,830
Perry?!

462
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,570
I'll take care of the rest so run away.

463
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
Oh Ri On!

464
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:34,610
Oh, I see you're Writer Omega's fan. But who is that weird looking lady?

465
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,760
Wow! It's so nice to meet you at a place like this! What brings you here?

466
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,180
- There are a lot of people here right now. Let's not act too friendly.
- Right. Ears...

467
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,140
I wonder why I did that.

468
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,100
Ah, seriously!

469
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,340
You came here to meet the writer, Omega?

470
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:14,650
Yes. I heard that he attends recitations sometimes, so I came.

471
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,980
But since I don't know his face, it's hard to find him.

472
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,960
From the rumors they say he has Won Bin level looks.

473
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,430
No matter how much I look around, I have no idea who it could be.

474
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,060
Truthfully, is a face at Won Bin's level common? It must be a rumor.

475
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,020
But anyways, I didn't know you were also a fan of Writer Omega.

476
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,760
Then you must have read most of his works.

477
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,570
Of course. Starting with the previous 'Twin Switch-up Murder Case',

478
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,350
to the recent popular series The Child in the Basement. There's nothing I haven't read.

479
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh darn it. Unfortunately, I read all but the two you mentioned.

480
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,290
Are you saying you still haven't read The Child in the Basement?

481
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,970
It's filled with interesting things and the quality's amazing.

482
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,830
Is that really that fun? What is the plot?

483
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:16,830
Ah, I wonder if it is okay to fly spoilers.... There is a boy and a girl.

484
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,900
Due to an unfortunate accident, the two stuck together like siblings.

485
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,670
Yes, yes.

486
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:29,420
But for some reason the girl is afraid of basements.

487
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,960
The girl's parents, so that the child can get rid of her fear,

488
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,810
sent the girl on chores to the basement frequently.

489
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:43,840
Every time this happens, the girl asks the boy to come with her.

490
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,510
The boy goes with her.

491
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,330
Even though he is afraid of basements, too.

492
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,150
Suddenly one day, the boy wonders,

493
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,470
"Why did we become scared of basements?"

494
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:23,050
The boy figures out why he became afraid of basements.

495
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,300
But the girl couldn't remember till the end.

496
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:45,300
At that moment, the boy decides. That he would find the lost memories in her stead.

497
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,180
How is it? Isn't it interest... Perry, what's wrong? Are you okay?

498
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,910
I'm alright. Just a minute... Some water...

499
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,370
Sit down. I'll be back.

500
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,010
Are you okay?

501
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,060
Rest assured. I'm here.

502
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,530
Perry! Perry!

503
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,920
Ri Jin?

504
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,400
Cha Do Hyun, are you okay?

505
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,390
Yes. I'm alright.

506
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,590
We are going to arrive home quickly.

507
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,230
Cha Do Hyun! You're Cha Do Hyun, right?

508
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,370
Yes. That's right.

509
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:37,010
Hang in there, we are almost there. You can't lose, okay?

510
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:42,310
When we are at home, I'll take on any of the personalities so don't worry.

511
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,950
You know, right? I have met all of your personalities except for Yo Na.

512
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,820
Cha Do Hyun! Are you Cha Do Hyun?

513
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,720
Cha Do Hyun! Answer me, Cha Do Hyun!

514
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,970
Cha Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

515
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:13,900
Stop it, you're so annoying. Stop calling me, you wrench!

516
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,380
You talk so much.

517
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,360
So annoying I could die.

518
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,500
Stop the car!

519
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,100
Ugh, really!? You are seriously so loud.

520
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,590
Loud, loud, loud, loud, so loud. You talk so much.

521
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,720
Oh my, look at the color of your tongue. How sexy. Ah, seriously!

522
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,780
Close your mouth. What are you going to do with those teeth of yours?

523
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,500
Don't show me your teeth! Close your mouth!

524
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,140
This girl is so loud, seriously.

525
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,640
Who...are you?

526
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,100
Me?

527
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,210
Yo Na.

528
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,070
Ahn Yo Na.

529
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,340
Ahn Yo Na. 17 years old. Yo Sub's twin sister.

530
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,560
Your hair clip's pretty.

531
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,300
The nickname Dr. Seok Ho Pil gave was manager of suffering.

532
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,520
Manager of suffering?

533
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,700
When I'm under extreme suffering but in a situation where I have to move along quietly,

534
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,500
Yo Na appears and takes in my distress.

535
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,640
It's because she is very simple and holds no grudges.

536
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,080
Then you can be rest assured. At least she's not a dangerous personality.

537
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,940
Not dangerous? Yo Na isn't dangerous?

538
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,480
To me, she's the most dangerous personality.

539
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,040
Why? She's only just a 17 year old girl.

540
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,740
That's precisely the problem. She has no interest in studying and only thinks about dating.

541
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,860
A 17 year old girl who stalks idols.

542
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,520
Give me that.

543
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,420
Wow, isn't it pretty?

544
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,620
What's with your expression?

545
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,620
This girl...do you feel upset because I took it from you?

546
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,660
Look at this girl with her blank expression. Blank!

547
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,660
So annoying! Look at this ahjusshi's face, seriously!

548
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,920
I should just go get plastic surgery.

549
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,460
Oh my-oh my!

550
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,820
A pimple. What should I do?

551
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,880
Oh my, it won't pop, it won't pop, it won't pop...

552
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,620
I'm sick and tired of milium (milk spots)! Seriously!

553
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,920
Oh well, whatever.

554
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,660
I'm hungry.

555
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,600
Yo Na is an unpredictable troublemaker.

556
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,750
When she appears, you should never lose sight of her. She can't be lost.

557
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,640
It's my Oppa!

558
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,510
Stop! Stop right there!

559
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,020
Hey!

560
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,360
Stop right there!

561
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,390
Hello, we are Rocking!

562
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:51,710
Wow, it's really nice to see you guys!

563
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:57,430
As soon as you guys released the second album, you swept off the music charts.

564
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,630
What sets Rocking apart from the other idol groups?

565
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:06,010
Since our music is more tough, our advantage is that

566
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,990
we have more male fans than other idol groups.

567
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,370
Male fans...wow! Now that I look, there are quite a lot of male fans here!

568
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,310
Over there, one, two, three, four, five, six, wow...

569
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,830
Move!

570
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,790
Oppa! Oppa! Oppa! Move!

571
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:30,240
Move, move, move, move!

572
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,230
Move! Are you blind!?

573
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:40,210
Oppa! Jay Oppa! Look over here!

574
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,540
Ah yes, thank you.

575
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,010
He is a really passionate male fan.

576
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,150
Can you come up to the stage? Would that be okay?

577
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,110
-I can go up there?
-Come up here!

578
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,290
What should I do, she's telling me to go up there!

579
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,450
What is he?

580
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,460
What's your problem, Mister? She told me to come up there. These ahjusshis are so annoying.

581
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,530
Seriously, these Ahjusshis!

582
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,740
Oppa! Oppa, Oppa...

583
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,170
What the? What's going on?

584
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,520
Who is she?

585
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,390
Come here while I'm asking you nicely.

586
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,990
Do you want to die, you wretch!

587
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,020
Just a moment. I'm sorry.

588
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,490
I'm sorry, it's just that he drank a lot of alcohol. I'm sorry!

589
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,730
Hey, don't act like this in front of my oppas.

590
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,170
Hurry come with me. I'm sorry!

591
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,160
Oppa, I'm sorry.

592
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,930
Don't be like this in front of my oppas.

593
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,800
-Hurry come with me!
-I said don't be like this in front of my oppas.

594
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,130
I'm sorry! Please excuse us!

595
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,250
Oppas, I'm sorry!

596
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,450
Oppa, I'm sorry!

597
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, sorry to the oppas as well!

598
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,340
-Hey!
-Hey!

599
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,480
Hey! Hey you, come here.

600
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,900
Hey, let go. I said let go.

601
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,520
I can't let you go. I won't. How dare you stop me? What are you?

602
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,820
Let go. Let go!

603
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,300
You let go first. Then I'll let go.

604
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,820
You bad wretch. You fierce wretch! You really fierce wretch!

605
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,100
You wretch! Let go!

606
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,020
-Are you joking?
-You let go first.

607
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,320
-Are you joking?
-You let go first!

608
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,720
Are you joking? Come here.

609
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,210
Come here, come here.

610
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:26,480
You're seriously dead meat, you really.

611
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,360
Hey, he's hitting a girl!
What's going on?

612
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,350
A guy's hitting a girl!

613
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:37,470
Ow! This wretch!

614
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:42,440
-Let go!
-Ah!

615
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:47,420
Excuse me, please don't take any pictures, okay? You guys can be under responsibility through legal measures.

616
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,680
-Let go, let go!
-I said not to take pictures!

617
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,800
Let go, let go! I'm telling you they're taking pictures!

618
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,200
Let go, let go...

619
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,010
Excuse me! Please stop!

620
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,300
Over there! Stop taking pictures!

621
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,030
Take legal responsibility!

622
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,680
Excuse me, please stop taking pictures.

623
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,820
Stop taking pictures.

624
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,240
Hey! Ahn Yo-- Cha...Mr. Cha!

625
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,080
Did you come back to your senses?

626
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,300
I was about to wait 30 more minutes, and if Mr. Cha still didn't come back,

627
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,160
I was about to take you to the hospital.

628
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
But why are we at a train station?

629
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,500
My car got towed and I couldn't bring myself to take you to the hospital since your identity would have been revealed,

630
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,940
and it's cold too; because of those circumstances, I chose this place.

631
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,240
But at least you have a doctor that is taking care of you 24/7.

632
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,700
I'm sorry.

633
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:05,550
I didn't act like your physician today anyways.

634
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,700
No. If you weren't by my side,

635
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,000
my identity would have been known across the whole world.

636
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,110
What exactly happened today?

637
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,950
When you're under extreme suffering

638
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,930
but is in a situation that needs to move quietly along. You said Yo Na appears in those cases.

639
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:40,000
What kind of extreme suffering were you under today?

640
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:48,930
Did my brother say something upsetting to you earlier?

641
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,270
If not,

642
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:02,050
is it about that girl last time?

643
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,550
Never mind. It's not the first time you haven't answered my questions anyways.

644
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,670
If you don't want me to be your friend, I won't question you any further.

645
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,490
I will just become rich.

646
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,710
If I'm curious about something, I can just ask Se Gi next time.

647
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,980
Because at least Se Gi talks to me.

648
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,080
Although the problem is that he says whatever he wants.

649
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,100
If you already came to your senses, then let's go.

650
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,060
Do you want to go out for a drink?

651
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:03,110
You told me yesterday that you would become my drinking friend.

652
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:08,310
But you don't really like drinking or friends.

653
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,760
Oh.

654
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:15,850
Let's just say that we are starting

655
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,580
the consultations that we decided to do every day.

656
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,180
Wow!

657
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,500
How did a big drinker like you

658
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,480
contain yourself this whole time?

659
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,290
Se Gi, Perry Park...

660
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,170
would have satisfied that.

661
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:10,830
Now, what should we start with first, Doctor?

662
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,800
-What?
-The consultation.

663
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,880
Ask me questions if you're curious about something.

664
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,830
Why are you coming in so directly from the first day?

665
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,030
Let's just...

666
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,390
I guess the first thing to do is to apologize and explain what happened yesterday.

667
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:29,170
Well, it's not that I really want to know...

668
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,780
I'm sorry about last night.

669
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,700
As I explained during our study, that friend you saw yesterday,

670
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,980
is my cousin's fiancé.

671
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:47,370
Also, it's true that Chae Yeon was my first love.

672
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,480
Ah... first love.

673
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,230
She treated me well, so I liked her.

674
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,880
But it wasn't because she liked me.

675
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,670
I found out it she acted that way because I was Ki Joon's cousin.

676
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:12,660
So I was hurt and moved on.

677
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,850
Seeing you yesterday, your gaze said otherwise.

678
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,330
It's not easy moving on from your first love.

679
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:27,020
After I knew that I had D.I.D., I've never liked anyone

680
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,010
or put anyone in my heart.

681
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,110
Because then they will be in danger.

682
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:36,040
So whenever I see Chae Yeon now,

683
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,570
I remember the time when I was able to like someone as much as I want.

684
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:49,610
Perhaps what I loved was not Chae Yeon, but rather

685
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:57,210
loving that time where I was able to love someone.

686
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,780
Did that answer your question?

687
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,820
I never asked though...

688
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,830
There's only 30 minutes left before our consultation time is over.

689
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,940
That's not right.

690
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,880
This is not a consultation but a personal conversation.

691
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,530
If you want a consultation then time it right, starting now.

692
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,360
All right. Remember this well.

693
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,270
January 29, 2015.

694
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:56,160
10 PM. First consultation starting time.

695
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:04,090
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave  ♬

696
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:08,060
January 7, 2015 at 10 PM on the dot
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep, and kisses me again ♬

697
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,990
The time I fell for you.

698
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:18,450
-Oh.
♬  Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent  ♬

699
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,230
♫Everyday, ♫

700
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,280
-Shin Se Gi?
♬  they echo in my ears every day  ♬

701
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,790
I'm Cha Do Hyun.
♬  Where are you?  ♬

702
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,240
Oh, that's right. It's you, Mr. Cha.

703
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,670
I must be drunk again...

704
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,190
Oh Ri Jin.

705
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,310
Yes.

706
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,460
Are you perhaps actually secretly hoping for Se Gi to come out?

707
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:47,360
Right now...you felt jealous, right?

708
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:49,330
No, I wasn't.

709
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,860
Come on, you were!

710
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,650
-No I wasn't!
-You were, you were!

711
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,620
I wasn't, I'm telling you, I really wasn't!

712
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,510
You're so funny. You were being all jealous of yourself.

713
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,710
I meant it when I said I wasn't...

714
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,000
Just drink up.

715
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,770
Wow! It's a snowman!

716
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,610
It would be nice if it could snow...

717
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,420
It was actually a good thing my car got towed.

718
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,020
We drank, and if it were here, it would have been a burden.

719
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,600
Right?

720
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,880
- Oh Ri Jin.
- Yeah.

721
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,690
I have something I want to ask.

722
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,060
Consultation time is already over, but

723
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,150
since I'm a pretty cool doctor, sure!

724
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:51,130
Oh Ri Jin, why did you stay by my side?

725
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,810
Is it out of pity?

726
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:06,860
Or is it perhaps, because you can meet Se Gi through me?

727
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,320
Do you really have such low confidence about yourself?

728
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,690
If I had to explain,

729
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,650
you can say it's because of Yo Sub.

730
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,970
Yo Sub?

731
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,820
When people are going through a hard time, they always say "Help me".

732
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,680
They ask for help.

733
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,920
But Yo Sub doesn't.

734
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,260
Rather than "Help me", he left a message for me that said "Kill me".

735
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,300
"Kill me," to me,

736
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,860
sounds like a cry for help.

737
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:06,320
And because of you. When my decision wavered,

738
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,210
you held it in place.

739
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:14,130
Saying how a ball that already crossed, can never be returned.

740
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,540
That time you were cool.

741
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:29,350
Someone told me, that the time that a person helps someone is not decided by the person who is giving the help,

742
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,210
but the person who is receiving the help.

743
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,680
When you told me that you wouldn't return the ball to me,

744
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,050
I realized that you really needed me.

745
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,500
It felt nice.

746
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,800
Oh Ri Jin,

747
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,870
aren't you scared of the personalities that live inside of me?

748
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,080
I'm not that scared anymore.

749
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,730
Even when you had to go through Yo Na like that?

750
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,540
Well, it's a little tiring.

751
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:14,270
But anyways, I want to be close with all of them.

752
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,770
And comfort them...

753
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,930
I have things to say to them as well.

754
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,040
You want to comfort and have something to say to them?

755
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:31,290
From now on, rather than "Kill me"

756
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,380
ask to "Heal me" instead.

757
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,240
Even if that happens, you guys will not die.

758
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,150
You guys will be still

759
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,090
alive in here.

760
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:50,680
Instead, you guys will no longer be scattered pieces.

761
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:58,540
But like connected puzzles, you will become a cooler picture.

762
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:06,280
With the name of Cha Do Hyun, you guys

763
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,630
will become a cooler person.

764
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,740
