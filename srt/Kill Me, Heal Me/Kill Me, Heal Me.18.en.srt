Episode 18
- Aigoo, our Ri Na must be hungry from getting dragged around all day.

2
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,980
Ri Na, listen to me. Aigoo, our Ri Na must be hungry from being dragged around all day. Bring the dog food.

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,030
You little--- you're ordering your older brother around!

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,600
Ah, Oppa! I need the dog f-f-f-f-food.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't do that! I got it, wait.

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,420
Ri Na, Oppa said he'll bring the dog food. Come here, let's go.

7
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,070
Not there! No, not there. Come here.

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,210
You're hungry? Why isn't Oppa coming?

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,820
Cha Do...

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,800
Shin Se Gi?

11
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm sorry for coming late.

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,920
Let's go.

13
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,600
- To where?
- Anywhere.

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,720
Let's run away.

15
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,780
Starting from our scary memories.

16
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,600
Let's run away from this house!

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,670
Run away? To where?

18
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,120
Take the train and go far away.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,200
Train?

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,750
But I don't have money.

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,070
But...

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,080
I don't have money right now.

23
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
I have money.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,410
I have money.

25
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,320
Cha Do Hyun's Black Card (luxury credit card).

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,770
Alright. Let's go.

27
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,030
Wherever it is.

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,610
Ri On, Shin Se Gi came to look for me so I'm going out for a while.

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,300
♫ I can’t touch you or be embraced by you ♫

30
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,370
Don't worry. It's not dangerous.

31
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,880
I know the instruction manual for Shin Se Gi very well.

32
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,780
Did I tell you?

33
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,480
That Se Gi is the most wounded piece

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,020
that fell out of Cha Do Hyun.

35
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,250
That wound... is connected with me.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,510
I am going to start looking into Mr. Cha's wounds.

37
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,530
That... is the same

38
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,850
as looking into my own wounds.

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,480
Where should we go? Tell me any place.

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,920
From now on, your words are the law to me.

41
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,280
- Mr. Shin.
- What?

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,190
When you first met me,

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,290
why didn't you act like you knew me?

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,180
You recognized me.

45
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,020
But why didn't you act like you knew me?

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,920
Because I hoped for you

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,870
to not remember the painful memories again.

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,460
I hoped that regardless of having memories or not,

49
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,400
you would choose me.

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,870
You already remembered everything, didn't you?

51
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,950
How did you know I found my memories?

52
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,210
Somehow, I ended up sharing memories with him.

53
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,360
You shared memories?

54
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,080
Cha Do Hyun and you?

55
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,550
I said not to mention

56
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,850
that bastard's name in front of me.

57
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,060
It's not even his name anyways.

58
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,720
Then... you already knew?

59
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,830
Does Mr. Cha know now?

60
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,700
Of course.

61
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,410
After knowing the reason why he had to live as Cha Do Hyun,

62
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,760
from the shock,

63
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,890
he's in a state of 'logged out' right now.

64
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,310
Why? What's the reason why Mr. Cha came to live

65
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,530
with the name of Cha Do Hyun?

66
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,900
21 years ago, that day,

67
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,760
the one who started the fire was you.

68
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,380
Mom! Ahjumoni!

69
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,920
Joon Young!

70
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,740
You...

71
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,720
Perhaps, is this your doing?

72
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,440
Joon Young!

73
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,850
Dad, save me.

74
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,440
Have you come to your senses?

75
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,950
Just what in the world did you do?
Did you really start the fire?

76
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,050
What do you mean fire?

77
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,390
Anyways, let's hurry up and get out of here. The fire is going to spread over here.

78
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,360
Dad! Then what about Do Hyun? We have to bring Do Hyun, too!

79
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,130
No, please save Do Hyun first.

80
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,900
Dad, Do Hyun! Do Hyun first...

81
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,060
Please take this child out first. I will follow out soon.

82
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,200
Do Hyun!!! Do Hyun!!

83
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,420
It's a fire!

84
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,230
It's a fire!!

85
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,300
What about other people inside?

86
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,070
His father's still inside. I'll go back in so take care of the child.

87
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,820
Yes!

88
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,150
Kid, come to your senses. Kid. Kid?

89
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,840
Kid. Kid.

90
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,380
Kid. Kid? Come to your senses. Kid!

91
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,560
Are you coming to your senses? What's your name? Can you understand what I'm saying?

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,130
Kid, what's your name?

93
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,570
You can't talk? Huh?

94
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,870
- Cha...
- Cha?

95
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,520
Do Hyun.

96
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,420
Do Hyun...

97
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,590
What did you say?

98
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,010
My name is Cha Do Hyun.

99
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,560
It's because of me. It's because of me.

100
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,910
Do Hyun!

101
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,760
Do Hyun! Cha Do Hyun!

102
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,820
Before losing his consciousness, your father had said this.

103
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,970
Do Hyun!

104
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,760
When he went to find her,

105
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,950
that child had already disappeared.

106
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,200
No, there, have you called?

107
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,020
A few days after the arson incident,

108
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,630
I received a letter from someone who claimed she was Min Seo Yeon's friend.

109
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,630
She asked me not look for the child.

110
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,870
That she'll raise her well.

111
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,310
Joon Young? Joon Young.

112
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,970
Joon Young.

113
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,660
Joon Young?

114
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,300
Do Hyun.

115
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,360
That's right. Forget it all.

116
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,820
The fire, the thing regarding your father,

117
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,160
your name, that child. All of it.

118
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,730
That's right. From now on, you're Cha Do Hyun.

119
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,460
You are Cha Do Hyun, the only heir to Seungjin Group.

120
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,230
Cha Joon Young had always thought that you died in that fire.

121
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,360
Because of his despair and guilt, he formed you.

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,340
One personality from the 7-year-old you.

123
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,370
So Nana...

124
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,290
is not a new personality

125
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,060
but the 7-year old me?

126
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,570
After the age of 7, Nana was continuously asleep.

127
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,130
Until meeting you again.

128
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,340
And so that's why he didn't know that Nana even existed either.

129
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,660
Was it because of me, that the fire happened?

130
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,200
It was to save you.

131
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,700
You could've died.

132
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,640
But I'm alive like this. Thankfully.

133
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,510
Because of me?

134
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,690
Mr. Cha started the fire... because of me?

135
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,130
If I think about it now,

136
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,330
back then you probably...

137
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,640
already had your mental state broken into pieces.

138
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,100
Joon Young! Play with me! Joon Young!

139
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,400
From now on, you're Do Hyun.
Cha Do Hyun.

140
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,830
Daddy!

141
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,360
-Please, don't hit Do Hyun!
-I was wrong!

142
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,980
My name is Cha Do Hyun.

143
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,930
Joon Young! Play with me!

144
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,540
My name is Cha Do Hyun.

145
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,560
It's because of me! It's because of me!

146
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,840
That was when you first created me.

147
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,150
I saved that child.

148
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
The one who saved the child...

149
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,150
was me.

150
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,790
My name is...Cha Do Hyun.

151
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,560
Because of me,

152
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,730
Mr. Cha suffered from D.I.D?

153
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,710
So, are you saying I did the wrong thing?

154
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,350
-Who is it?
-Hey, man!

155
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,760
It's me. Alex.

156
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,830
Alex?

157
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,410
Alex?

158
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,880
This bastard is still alive.

159
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,310
Someone keeps asking about you.

160
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,870
It's really annoying me.

161
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,570
He keeps waving five hundred thousand dollars in front of my face

162
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,690
and keeps asking me to meet him.

163
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,920
I kind of do need some money right now,

164
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,620
but I just thought I should give you a chance also.

165
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,770
We should meet.

166
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Where are you now?

167
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,990
500,000 dollars?

168
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,270
Yes, that's right.

169
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,890
What's the basis of calculation?

170
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,910
He says he has a massive amount of information and evidence about Cha Do Hyun,

171
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,050
and he will sell all of it generously.

172
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,770
He's proudly saying that it'll be the level of an atomic bomb.

173
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,090
He said that if we are hesitating, he will just hand it over to the economic newspapers.

174
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,990
This friend named Alex...he's a very funny guy.

175
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,070
There was a reason why it took a while to find him.

176
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,240
What is it, the reason?

177
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,330
He is a graduate from a prestigious school but he has immense gambling debt.

178
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,850
Because of that, he seems to be chased by some syndicate group.

179
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,140
He came into Korea secretly, but even now, he still is making trips to casinos.

180
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,220
And so...500,000 dollars?

181
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,100
So...what will you do?

182
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,470
Try making a deal with 100,000 dollars first. Then transfer 10% into his account as a down payment.

183
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,310
After sending the information over to us, the rest of the money will follow. Tell him that's the condition.

184
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,790
I don't think that (amount) would work.

185
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,360
The information I have cannot be exchanged with that price.

186
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,170
If I just open my mouth, the stocks of Seungjin Group will break down into pieces in a second.

187
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,560
Tell that to your owner, and call me back.

188
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,860
Ah...

189
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,170
I told you, but I can't really give you a lot of time.

190
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,130
Who exactly is Alex?

191
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,240
There's someone like that.

192
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,490
Beginning from high school days,

193
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,380
he's a parasite who has subsisted his existence by threatening Cha Joon Young.

194
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:55,220
Those kinds of parasites need to be exterminated before they propagate even more.

195
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,750
I kept him alive for too long.

196
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,410
Manager Ahn, Se Gi is back. Emergency situation erupted. Asking for documents related to Alex. After receiving threat call, we are on our way to meet him. Location....

197
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,660
Stay in the car, it's dangerous. I'll end this in 10 minutes.

198
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,800
As you mentioned, it's dangerous. So YOU wait in the car.

199
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,630
I'll meet the person called Alex first.

200
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,700
Why would you?

201
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,030
You are no longer Cha Do Hyun's physician and secretary.

202
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,120
Did you forget? You won't get angry. You won't use violence.

203
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,310
You won't ruin each other's reputations.

204
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,570
Although the contract with Mr. Cha and me was terminated,

205
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,670
the deal between you and I has nothing to do with that.

206
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,140
It's still valid. Did you know?

207
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,250
Still no. I'm going to go.

208
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,590
You said that my words were your law!

209
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,250
Damn it, damn it!

210
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
If you get hurt,

211
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,890
that bastard will die by my hands today.

212
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,550
Okay. Deal.

213
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,170
Um...

214
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,010
Excuse me.

215
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,020
Alex?

216
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,010
Excuse me, Alex?

217
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,990
I don't really like dark places.

218
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,090
I guess you must like the dark.

219
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,050
Aigoo, how dark.

220
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,550
Oh, it's a 'new face.' Who are you?

221
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,640
Ah, yes. I'm Cha Do Hyun's secretary.

222
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,300
Cha Do Hyun suddenly had something to do so

223
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,320
I came instead.

224
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,850
Okay. Then starting with business first.

225
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,840
-What is the amount Mr. Cha is offering?
-Uh...

226
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,020
Um...I don't really know how much he is proposing....

227
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,600
How much would be enough?

228
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,110
President Cha Ki Joon has promised $500,000.

229
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,250
So... double that. A million dollars.

230
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,010
1... 1 million... dollars?

231
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,830
But my thoughts are changing.

232
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,230
If you do well, I think it'll be enough with half of that.

233
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,740
I will not get angry. Damn it.

234
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,640
I will not use violence. Damn it. Damn it.

235
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,750
I will not ruin each other's reputations.

236
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,880
Damn it.

237
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,910
-Uh... I don't know what you mean by that...
- So coy.

238
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,390
I'm telling you that you're my type.

239
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,040
Let's just make the money come from Cha Ki Joon, and make you friendly with me. You know?

240
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,310
Don't come closer...huh? Don't come closer!

241
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,300
Oh shit! Goddamn it!

242
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,970
You f**king b****!

243
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Uh----I don't think it will work with a conversation.

244
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,810
Secretary Ahn will be coming soon,

245
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,640
so until he comes, please wait over here.

246
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,680
Damn it.

247
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,740
I will not ruin each other's reputa--

248
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,200
I will not? That's bulls***!

249
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,510
You dare to touch my girl?

250
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,190
-You must want to die, right?
-This bastard...

251
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,480
Can you remember memories from the past now after getting beat up?

252
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,370
Please....

253
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,360
Stop it! You're going to kill this person!

254
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,910
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

255
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,940
Stop it! Come out, Cha Do Hyun!

256
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,950
Are you alright, Oh Ri Jin?

257
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,850
Are you alright?

258
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,790
I will send the treatment fee bill to Secretary Ahn from now on.

259
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,030
It's pretty expensive so be ready.

260
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,620
He hears his name like a ghost again.

261
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,830
Because I shouted "Cha Do Hyun, come out!,"

262
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,850
you come out at once.

263
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,680
Perhaps...

264
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,650
did you remember?

265
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,760
About what?

266
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,770
About the name Cha Do Hyun...

267
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,590
I'm sorry.

268
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,090
I'm sorry for stealing your name against your will.

269
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,780
- Cha Do Hyun.
- How you, Oh Ri Jin, call my name...

270
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,840
I like it a lot.

271
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,750
I hope that....

272
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,870
you don't feel sorry towards me.

273
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,190
It's not perfect yet, but after getting my memories back,

274
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,250
there were some painful memories,

275
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,040
but there are some good memories as well.

276
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,920
In the good memories...

277
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,250
there was Mom that saved me from the fire,

278
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,200
and also...

279
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,760
there was the young Mr. Cha

280
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,890
that came to find me every night at 10.

281
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,750
For me, who was alone and didn't have one person to rely on,

282
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,630
it was dark and cold.

283
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,200
For me, who was abandoned in the basement I fear,

284
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,790
Mr. Cha, who came to look for me every night while putting his life on the line,

285
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,900
you were my savior and hope.

286
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,630
And so I was able to go through the pain. Thanks to you.

287
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,400
That's how I was able to endure it.
As I waited for you.

288
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,820
The reason why my mind wasn't broken into pieces...

289
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,040
was probably...

290
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,130
because of you, Cha Do Hyun.

291
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,890
♫ Even if I act indifferent, ♫

292
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,380
♫ it hurts  ♫

293
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,490
I'm sorry.

294
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,670
Because of me... your mind became broken into pieces.

295
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,010
♫What can I do about my heart being like this? ♫

296
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,340
As you struggle with the other personalities every single day,

297
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,680
to protect the name Cha Do Hyun,

298
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,870
I know how hard you worked, Mr. Cha.

299
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,050
And so, I'll give it to you as a present.

300
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,520
The name, Cha Do Hyun...
♫ With a face that is unfamiliar ♫

301
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,400
If someone asks, 'Who are you?'

302
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:23,070
I would be happy if you could answer "I'm Cha Do Hyun," just like how you did in the past.

303
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,590
If I call out 'Perry Park,'

304
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,790
I would be happy if

305
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,360
you would get annoyed and say, "No! I am Cha Do Hyun!"

306
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,660
Also...

307
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,420
the person with this gaze

308
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,970
and this face...

309
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,090
I hope that his name is... Cha Do Hyun.

310
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,990
♫ Don’t love me, who is like this ♫

311

♫ What can I do about my heart being like this?  ♫

312
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,970
♫ The only thing I can give you ♫

313
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,340

320

Then, live well. Don't faint or be in pain anymore.

321
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,060
That won't happen. You're the one

322
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,630
who shouldn't be in pain.

323
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,270
-Don't dream nightmares ever again.
-As for you, Mr. Cha,

324
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,790
don't ever dream nightmares and cry.

325
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,730
Don't worry about me.

326
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,840
You don't worry about me either, Mr. Cha.

327
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,960
What the~?

328
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,880
Euh~~tah! Ah tah!

329
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,120
What the heck? What the heck is this bandage?

330
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,580
Wow--- the smell of aged rice wine!

331
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,820
But these little things have been making a huge unnecessary fuss and sitting around here.

332
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,840
Just film a tear-jerking soap opera, a tear-jerking soap opera!

333
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,020
If the heart goes, then the body follows.
Just because something happened, they fuss over this and that.

334
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,970
After all that, when on earth can they share affection? Wow, idiots.

335
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,130
It's so frustrating dealing with these guys that just have ink in their stupid skulls.

336
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,390
Also, this is only a small cut! Why even put a damn bandage on it?

337
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,040
Good grief!

338
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,520
Wow~~~this smell of fermented rice wine!

339
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,450
Wowww~~ the smell of fermented rice wine!

340
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,810
Hey, are you perhaps, Perry?

341
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,660
Who are you?

342
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,920
Do you know me?

343
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,880
Ah, this rascal! Hey, you rascal!

344
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,380
You should have called if you were coming! I would have not been able to see you!

345
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,110
Hey, no wonder the fish weren't being caught too well today!

346
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,880
What... What did you say? Fishing?

347
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,910
Ah, so it seems we have something in common.

348
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,990
Hey. You must have been drinking before coming here, haven't you?

349
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,400
Your accent is starting to come out, you fool. This cute little thing, aigoo!

350
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,300
What the heck? Why are you hitting me?! Who the heck are you to keep hitting my head!

351
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,510
Because you're cute. Because I miss you.
Look at this little one.

352
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,920
You get hit once! Huh?

353
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,710
Hey, this... Your drinking habits... So these are your drinking habits!

354
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,620
- Awesome!
- Hit me after you give me a glass of alcohol, at least.

355
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,080
I'll give it to you. Let's go in.
Let's go inside. Come.

356
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,630
-Are you good at fighting?
Of course!

357
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,040
- You look like Ssang Kal (Double Daggers), huh?
(A reference to the 2002 famous drama 'Rustic Period', where Ri Jin's dad played the role of a great fighter named Ssang Kal)
- Let's go!

358
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,620
I missed you, you rascal! It's ok. It's ok. Come in. Come in.

359
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,190
-Hey, but my hands are hurting...
-Yeah, yeah, alright.

360
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,140
- Ah, seriously.
- Let's go, let's go. let's go.

361
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,090
Ri Jin, Ri On! Perry's here! Come on out quickly.

362
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,780
Aigoo... Perry, try eating this. What are you doing?

363
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,390
Ah, this, do you think it'll do with this? Bring out some more.

364
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,270
Wow, this rascal. The more I see you, the more greedy I get.

365
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,600
Instead of being Ri On's friend, be my younger brother.

366
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,860
So I should serve you as a Hyungnim (older brother) from now on.

367
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,700
Yeah! Say it, say it.

368
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,010
Sung~ (a satoori version of Hyung)
- Yes!

369
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,900
Good job! Good job!

370
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:56,010
Wow, so this is what it feels like to have a younger brother! Hey, I'll give you something amazing.

371
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,130
Hey! You. Go and get the.. what you call it? God's water balloon. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

372
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,700
- Ummmhmmm~ God's water ballo...
- Yes, God's water...

373
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,750
Dad, you don't even give that to me, since you feel like's it's a waste (giving it to me).

374
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,900
-Seriously.
-Hey! This dad of yours,

375
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,180
who lived over 50 years as an only son, is now able to feel what it's like to have a younger sibling.

376
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,190
What's the big deal with that? Just bring it out. Hurry!

377
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,220
-Hurry, hurry!
-Go.

378
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,070
Ay, even your temper is very high-spirited! It's just exactly my style!

379
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,220
Because you're so great, your great daughter grew up so well.

380
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,550
Right?

381
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,880
Perry! What are you trying to say..?

382
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,370
From what I experienced,

383
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,610
you know, that is... her dance... is a bit...
whatchamacallit.

384
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,330
- Don't you agree? Your dancing skill is not that good anyway!
- She can't dance?

385
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,810
-That's right, you're right.
- She can't dance, can't dance.

386
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,410
-But she is enormously tender-hearted. It's really a piece of work.
- That's right!

387
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,250
She knows how to care for a person, you know? Her strength is great. She has loyalty. Wow!

388
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,830
You don't know how much I am relieved.

389
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,450
But... Perry, you sound a little suspicious.

390
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,840
You aren't secretly dating Ri Jin are you?

391
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,460
Ah, Hyungnim! Why are you talking like that again?

392
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,420
I'm just saying that.

393
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,790
- Oh! Oh my God!
- Oho~ God's water balloon.

394
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,000
Woooow! Even the color is different!

395
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,420
- Wow....
- Thank you, Hyungnim!

396
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,270
Here...

397
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,070
Oi~ Sung! Sung!

398
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,750
Ah dda~ I'm so thankful for this, I don't know what to do.

399
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,060
Wow... Ha~

400
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,370
Okay, okay, okay. You shouldn't be doing this.

401
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,120
It's right in front of my nose...

402
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,640
You guys are seriously...!

403
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,720
Ah hyoo, ah hyoo... This precious stuff!

404
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,610
Aigoo..he must have been drinking a lot before coming here!

405
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,640
Oh dear.

406
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,330
Go, go, go.

407
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,080
- Pe-Perry Park!
- Oh, we should lie him down. We should lie him down!

408
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,690
Ah...

409
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,670
Ugh! This... really...!

410
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,950
If he just drank it, it'll be over with!

411
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm going to go crazy, really.

412
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,400
Hey, what's going on? Didn't you say you were going to meet Shin Se Gi?

413
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,160
Exactly. Why are they switching from one to another so fast?

414
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,200
For now, let's get out.

415
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,870
Where are we going?

416
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,190
Just come.

417
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,150
Hey!

418
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,880
For some reason I'm worried about this. At that rate, wouldn't he get exhausted?

419
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,130
Why do you think he's like that? Try to interpret it with a medical opinion.

420
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,090
He must have been having a tough time.

421
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,940
Because his balance is wavering, the alternate personalities are getting more chances (to come out).

422
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,990
From how I see it as a writer,

423
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,150
since Cha Do Hyun can't go to you with his own personality,

424
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:36,330
doesn't it seem like his personalities are staying around you in his stead?

425
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:42,090
To have Gyeon Woo and Jik Nyeo meet, the crows and magpies that can't talk had come forward to make them a bridge. (an East Asian folktale about two star-crossed lovers)

426
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,080
Because they are Cha Do Hyun's personalities,

427
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,160
isn't it possible that they are acting as the control to put the right man in his right place?

428
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,890
Anyway, I have some more manuscripts to send. This is trouble.

429
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,840
I don't know if I'll go crazy at the sound of Perry Park's snoring.

430
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,140
What the?

431
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,810
What is this?

432
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,040
Where did this person go?

433
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,680
Ahn Yo Sub?

434
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,070
It has been a while, Noona.

435
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,120
Yo Sub.

436
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,860
Are you reading a book? What book?

437
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,390
It's by Writer Omega.

438
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,430
How is it? Is it interesting?

439
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,170
No.

440
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,690
The writing style is too sloppy. It feels like my soul is getting hurt.

441
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,960
I was just about to give the book up.

442
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,950
If only time permits...

443
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,410
I want to write a beautiful poem.

444
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,640
Then do that, what's the problem?

445
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,010
Having something you want to do is a very, very good thing.

446
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,780
But...

447
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,440
time isn't on my side.

448
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,000
Can I ask you something?

449
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,040
What is it?

450
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,450
Why is your name Yo Sub?

451
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:11,010
(Cha Do Hyun) tried to commit suicide for the first time when he was in high school.

452
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,630
It was a mission school.

453
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,710
But because the model student tried to commit suicide,

454
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,330
it created a huge sensation at school.

455
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,670
(Yo Sub) was his baptismal name then.
(Yo Sub is a Korean variation of Joseph)

456
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,270
And then, in contrast, through his will of wanting to live,

457
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,190
my twin sister, Yo Na, was born.
(Jonah in Korean)

458
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,460
Noona,

459
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,580
it now seems like Do Hyun Hyung won't be having any suicidal thoughts.

460
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,690
So I don't know how much I have left till I disappear.

461
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,350
I'm afraid I won't be able to say farewell before I disappear,

462
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,900
so I'm saying my goodbyes beforehand.

463
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,980
Perhaps, is Perry Park in this room...

464
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,040
Perry Park! What is an old man doing right now?

465
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,630
Get away from my sister right now!

466
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,180
Hey! What are you doing? He's not Perry Park.

467
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,090
Then who is it? Why is he wearing my glasses?

468
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,770
Seriously.

469
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,650
Ow, it hurts.

470
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,310
Oppa!

471
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,100
He said Oppa! Sh-

472
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,040
Oh? That talkative intimidating wench...

473
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,930
I told you not to show your teeth, you wench.

474
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,930
Oppa! Oppa! Ooopppaa! Oppa!

475
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,550
Oppa, look at me. Oppa, look at me. Do you know what this means?

476
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,220
Do you get it?

477
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,990
I didn't hear you well.

478
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,210
I... am going to you right now!

479
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,930
-No, Please no!
-Oppa! Oppa!

480
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,750
Oppa! Oppa!

481
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,850
Oppa! Oppa!

482
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,150
-No, save me!
-Oppa!

483
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,880
Please sister!

484
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,930
Oppa! Oppa!

485
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,840
Is this some kind of a year-end music festival? Why are the personalities suddenly getting mobilized?

486
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,270
Ah, so what are we going to do?

487
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,710
Perry Park, and even Yo Sub, I can handle them, whatever.

488
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,340
Yo Na, I can't ever handle her. No, I can't.

489
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,080
Then how are we going to do this? Is he going to sleep in my room, he's a guy!

490
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,850
Then, is he going to sleep in my room, as a girl?

491
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,540
You guys are making me so annoyed. Where am I going to sleep?

492
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,910
-Just wait a second, for god's sake!
-Just wait a second, for god's sake!

493
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:07,640
Oh, @#$%. There's an amylase hyper-secretion here!
Seriously, so annoying!

494
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,390
Oppa, I'll be in your room.

495
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,570
No! No. No.

496
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,410
-Let's just make her sleep in the living room.
-Hey, don't you know she's a beagle?
Beagle: An internet slang for someone so energetic and cheeky that they keep on causing trouble without rest.

497
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,900
So it's not even enough to tie her up, but we also have to put her to pasture?

498
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,720
Fine, you stay here.

499
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,440
I wasn't about to use this method, but let's just decide using that.

500
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,530
-Do you really have to go that far?
-Yeah be quiet, and

501
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,230
1, 2, 3.

502
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,430
Rock, paper, scisssors!

503
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,320
Paper! Paper! Paper!

504
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Oppa.

505
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,420
Do you want to die?

506
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,320
What's up with the dolling up in the middle of the night?

507
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,850
You're jealous, huh. Come here, I'll do it for you.

508
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,340
It's fine.

509
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,250
- You b#$%^, when I say I'll do it, please!
- Ah!

510
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,860
We can go to a ssambab restaurant. Ssambab. 
(Ssambab is a kind of Korean food where you put rice and meat on an edible leaf and then eat it with sauce.)

511
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,800
Do you really want to die? Seriously!

512
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,340
I am going to go to the bathroom.

513
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,060
Don't use underhanded tactics on me, you wench. I know you're going to sneak into my brother's room. You think I don't know?

514
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,330
You wench, you catch on so freaking fast.

515
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,560
My bed, right?

516
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,250
Ground!

517
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,640
- I'm not sleeping on it because it's dirty.
- Hmph!

518
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,870
My throat's dry. I want to drink water, ah.

519
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,900
I should just drink water--- Ah!

520
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,810
I told you. You're not going to my brother's room, you wench.

521
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,670
I told you not to show your teeth, you wench.

522
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,410
Ah, seriously.

523
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,290
What are you doing?

524
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,110
Omo... What are you doing?

525
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,780
Heol! What kind of situation is this?

526
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,970
Can't you tell? I'm tying you up.

527
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,640
What in the world.

528
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,040
Am I a dog? Are you going to haul me to the police?

529
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,020
What kind of situation is this? What the?

530
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,930
- Don't dream an unreasonable dream and go straight to sleep!
- Ah!

531
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,550
Wench... Intimidating wench.

532
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,240
Ri On Oppa.

533
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,310
Ri Na's house.

534
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,380
Ri On Oppa...

535
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,400
Do Hyun!
♫  On the first time I met you ♫

536
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,770
- I'm not going to catch you~
- Are you kidding? 
♫ You were a small ♫

537
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,170
- Come here. Come here.
- I don't want to~
♫ girl ♫

538
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm coming!

539
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,040
♫ There was a violet in your hair ♫

540
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,540
♫ While smiling you told me, ♫

541
00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:01,170
♫ that you want to fly far away like a bird. ♫

542
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:31,870
♫ When I met you again, ♫

543
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,870
♫ You were very thin ♫

544
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,020
Who are you?

545
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,580
Yo Na?

546
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:57,990
♫ While smiling you told me. ♫

547
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,780
I am Cha Do Hyun.

548
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:09,820
♫ That you cry at even small things ♫

549
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,120
Sounds good.

550
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,640
That name.

551
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,020
Now that I think of it,

552
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:28,740
for as long as I have lived, the words I have heard the most and spoken the most

553
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,700
are Cha Do Hyun, the name.

554
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,430
That's why, you and I,

555
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,660
although we parted in our childhood,
♫ The last time I saw you ♫

556
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,300
I feel like our connection was never severed,
♫ The last time I saw you ♫

557
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,240
and has always been connected,
♫ You looked very peaceful ♫

558
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,870
under the name "Cha Do Hyun."
♫ You looked very peaceful ♫

559
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,080
I thought it would be painful for you if you were by my side.

560
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,100
And I thought the me who would be seeing that,

561
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,090
would feel much more pain.
♫ You said to me while laughing ♫

562
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,080
So I sent you away, but...
♫ You said to me while laughing ♫

563
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,570
I realized that you not being by my side was more painful.

564
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,280
So, that's why I'm saying this...

565
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,240
Don't go.

566
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,270
Stay with me.

567
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,320
No matter how much I think about it, letting another man sleep in your room is a bit...

568
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,330
AH!

569
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,140
What are you doing now?

570
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:30,950
Oppa?

571
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,810
Is it the stage when a boy's voice changes? I wonder why your voice is like that?

572
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:54,960
No matter what, I think that I can't fall asleep because I'm sleeping in a different place. Well then...

573
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,980
Are you going to keep wearing these clothes?

574
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,460
Hey, Yo Na, you are still a high schooler. Do you think you can drive now?

575
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,760
Well, this is a piece of cake.

576
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,090
Well then.

577
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,800
Well then~

578
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,880
Let's go back.

579
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,430
-He's not Yo Na, right?
- Huh?

580
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,510
It's Cha Do Hyun, right? Right?

581
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,020
Yeah... how did you know?

582
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,340
There's no way Yo Na would look away from me.

583
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,040
What's with that...that confidence out of nowhere?

584
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,220
Perhaps... are you sad?

585
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,570
Sad?! When was I?!

586
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,000
Aigoo...ch!

587
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,500
So I'm saying,

588
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:56,950
don't go. Stay with me.

589
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,950
My name is Cha Do Hyun, responsible for the preparation process and any related things

590
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:29,840
of the Seungjin Group Shareholders Meeting.

591
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,220
President!

592
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,570
I definitely said I want to be alone for a second.

593
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:47,440
I know that. But this was sent to you.

594
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,280
What is this?

595
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,580
It's a package with the postage stamp from yesterday.

596
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,570
It's from Alex Kang.

597
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:08,340
It looks like a locker key.

598
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,950
Look for it.

599
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,240
So you know how to keep promises.

600
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,730
I will try my best, but don't expect too much.

601
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,890
To a businessman, modesty is not a noble attribute.

602
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm not being modest.

603
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,880
Then are you giving excuses before even showing your abilities?

604
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,280
It's not a display of modesty or an excuse, it's a warning.

605
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,570
From now on, I'm thinking of going with my method, not yours.

606
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:41,610
With the conviction of what I think is right,
and to the direction of what I think is right,

607
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,290
I will walk from here in my own way.

608
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,830
Please look over how it will all end up.

609
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,050
21 years ago, a kid under the name of Cha Do Hyun was registered in Seungjin's family registry.

610
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,840
It was thoroughly put aside as a secret, and together with the fire in the mansion,

611
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,300
the child vanished without any word.

612
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,750
The current Cha Do Hyun

613
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:19,690
is just a fake who lived borrowing the family register of that vanished child.

614
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:23,800
But is that even possible?

615
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,460
If it's done using Seungjin Group's power, then anything is possible.

616
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,780
Then what happened to the child who was the real Cha Do Hyun?

617
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,900
Oh Ri Jin

618
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,970
was the real Cha Do Hyun.

619
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,730
This...

620
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,810
What kind of a key would it be,

621
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,290
Cha Do Hyun?

622
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,950
You came, Secretary Ahn?

623
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:30,270
Hello, Vice-President. No, it's Chairperson.

624
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:37,040
I'm the secretary and secret physician who re-signed the contract, Oh Ri Jin.

625
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,290
Please look after me.

626
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:46,210
A little while ago, she called and volunteered. I highly valued that passion.

627
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:51,410
Whether you'll employ her or not, you can decide with a final interview.

628
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,540
You said you wanted us to stay together.

629
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,420
I meant to simply stay together, not that I needed a secret physician.

630
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,730
And it's also a contract that has already been terminated.

631
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,380
The contract... You can just write a new one.

632
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,920
Article 1, Section 1, Party B does not

633
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,820
fall in love with Party A and his other personalities.

634
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,330
You're telling me to adhere to that?

635
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:32,470
Because I couldn't adhere to that rule, I had to pay an enormous amount for the contract penalty fee.

636
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:39,010
Well, I'll reimburse you that. Since we're mutually at fault.

637
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:44,490
But the thing is, I'm not confident I'll be able to abide by that rule.

638
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,050
Well, that might be a problem.

639
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,680
Then, we rewrite the rule for Article 1, Section 1.

640
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,580
- How?
- Hm...

641
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,000
Party A and Party B...

642
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:03,490
stay together no matter what hardships they may face.

643
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:15,120
That sounds good. We're going back to square one and restarting.

644
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,540
Reset. Restart.

645
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:27,080
- You're telling me to... run into there?
- Yes!

646
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:33,720
You're playing hard-to-get. Who's the desperate one?

647
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:50,860
♬ When I first saw you, ♬

648
01:00:53,190 --> 01:01:00,530
♬ you were a small girl ♬

649
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,200
♬ You had a violet in your hair ♬
