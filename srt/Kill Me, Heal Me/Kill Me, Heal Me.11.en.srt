1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,460
You have less of a right than I,

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,200
because you are a son of Seungjin Group.

3
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,800
Give Seungjin Group to me, Grandmother.

4
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,880
You must still be waiting for father to wake up.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,770
How dare... How dare you!

6
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,810
Shall I end that lingering feeling for you?

7
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,700
Why did you disturb me?

8
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you know how hard it was for me?

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Shall I end it for you?

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,700
My father...

11
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,350
I… should now let you rest in...

12
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,850
peace.

13
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,300
Kill Me, Heal Me

14
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,820
Episode 11

15
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,410
Disappeared?

16
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,810
Yes. When we arrived he had already left with the VIP patient.

17
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,410
How about the CCTVs?

18
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,540
All of the CCTVs in the hospital room were already broken.

19
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,220
The CCTVs in the nursing room and surroundings are being secured.

20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,100
When completed I will send them to you.

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,670
Collect all of them before they go into someone else's hands.

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,700
Use all methods and find those two.

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,590
Move quietly so that the police don't get involved.

24
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,930
Do you understand what I said?

25
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,590
Was Cha Do Hyun ever abused when he was young?

26
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,750
Did Mr. Cha say that?

27
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,650
Get up!

28
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,110
Se Gi did..

29
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,260
Unconsciously, he called his mother a bystander in abuse.

30
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,270
Mr. Cha has a fear of basements.

31
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,410
Being trapped in the basement,

32
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,530
he seems to hold immense fear over an unknown person; but

33
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,440
unfortunately, that's the extent of Mr. Cha's memories.

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,390
On who the assaulter is...

35
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,610
and on what the assaulter wants...we still haven't figured that out.

36
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,690
Professor, Se Gi says he remembers all of Cha Do Hyun's forgotten memories.

37
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,810
SeGi said that? He said that to you directly?

38
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,920
Don't you think Se Gi was a personality created

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,810
to take in all the painful memories of Cha Do Hyun's childhood?

40
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,870
If that's the case...

41
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,320
The reason why Mr. Cha had no choice but to separate himself into fragments,

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,330
Se Gi could know.

43
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,530
[Cha Do Hyun]

44
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,200
Cha Do Hyun?

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,110
What's wrong?

46
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,260
How did you know I was here?

47
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,430
What's wrong?

48
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,690
Did something happen?

49
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,880
Should I steal Seungjin Group?

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,910
What?

51
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,220
If you want, after taking Seungjin group, I'll give it to you.

52
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,810
What are you saying?

53
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,380
You don't want it?

54
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,350
Then I'll steal Seungjin Group and destroy it.

55
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,880
Mr. Shin! What else are you going to do?

56
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,610
That's why...

57
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,900
Don't kill me.

58
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,960
I don't want to disappear.

59
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm fine

60
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,430
with being Cha Do Hyun's false image,

61
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,890
so just let me stay by your side.

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,990
Let's go.
With me.

63
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,470
Let's go.

64
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,310
Ri On?

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,380
Don't make the circumstances bigger.

66
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,690
Our parents are inside.

67
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,380
Then you yourself have less of a right than I,

68
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,410
because you're a son of Seungjin Group.

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,490
Ri On, wait a minute!

70
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,980
Ri On! Wait, listen to me first!

71
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,170
Ri On! Ri On, wait!

72
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,000
Wait, I said let go! It hurts!

73
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,030
Aish...

74
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,790
Hey! Wait.

75
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,240
You... why are you treating me this way lately?

76
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,060
You used to always be on my side.

77
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,190
Even now, I am on your side.

78
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,170
I'm on your side, I'm doing this because I'm on your side.

79
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,650
One day, you'll always be grateful to me for the rest of your life while remembering this moment today.

80
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,740
What in the world are you even talking about?

81
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,690
So you believe me, too.

82
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,680
Stop asking me to believe you and believe me, too. Please!

83
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,980
Hey! Hey! Ri On...

84
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,860
Ri On! Hey!

85
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,910
Oh Ri On, open the door!

86
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,510
Let's talk face to face!! Ri On.

87
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,100
Oh Ri On.

88
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,980
I'm sorry,

89
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,990
No matter what, I have to go.

90
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,380
You said to me last time,

91
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,760
"You're a pro, so the decision is yours."

92
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,550
I want to take responsibility for the decision I made to the end.

93
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,970
And...

94
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,330
I don't know how this kind of expression will come across, but

95
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,830
I can't become free from this game.

96
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,240
I think I'm connected with this game.

97
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,290
I think

98
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,650
I hold responsibility in this.

99
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm leaving without saying my goodbyes because I don't think I can bear to look at mom and dad.

100
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,840
Please do me a favor, Oh Ri On.

101
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,160
AH!

102
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,490
Follow me, I'll drive you.

103
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,330
You didn't bring your car.

104
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,230
Now you're like Oh Ri On!

105
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,310
Hey. You're heavy. Heavy. Not anyone can take your weight.

106
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,330
Hey! Do you know that you being serious really doesn't fit you?

107
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,160
Hah! What's wrong with you?

108
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,310
Hey, you're the one who's sub par. When I go out,

109
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,550
girls go crazy over me!

110
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,820
Okay, if you are popular carry me over there.

111
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,450
Go, Go, Go.

112
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,540
Okay, okay.

113
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,780
Hah!

114
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Hey. For old time's sake, should we do that thing?

115
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Do what?

116
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
You know... the thing we did frequently when we were young.

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,490
The thing we did frequently when we were young, what?

118
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,600
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

119
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,630
Do you know how old we are?

120
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,970
How can we do that here?

121
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,650
Why? Let's try it.

122
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,410
No, I will never do it.

123
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,430
If you ask who we are...

124
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,340
It is human nature to answer!

125
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,620
To prevent the destruction of this world.

126
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,960
To protect this world's peace.

127
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,130
To bring darkness in love and truth!

128
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,070
Experts on Pokemons! Cutie villains!

129
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,920
-I'm Ri On.
-I'm Ri Jin.

130
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,010
For our Team Rocket running around the universe!

131
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,600
We are waiting for a beautiful future of tomorrow!

132
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,440
- I'm going.
- Go.

133
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,980
You came.

134
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,220
Why aren't you sleeping,

135
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,860
and here like this?

136
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,030
Because if I fall asleep,

137
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,390
I might disappear.

138
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,520
Between Se Gi and Mr. Cha, do you, perhaps...

139
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,820
Are you asking if it's confusing?

140
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,720
Huh?

141
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,530
Yes.

142
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:51,450
In the beginning I was confused, but it's not like that anymore.

143
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,070
I think that Cha Do Hyun is Shin Se Gi,

144
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,980
and Shin Se Gi is Cha Do Hyun.

145
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,430
These two people...

146
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,240
are oddly similar.

147
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,750
Remember this.

148
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,990
January 29th, 2015.

149
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,880
January 7th, 2015. 10PM on the dot.

150
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,410
The first consultation starts.

151
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,410
The time I fell for you.

152
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,270
Whenever I find something similar about them, I hope that they can understand each other

153
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,620
and can reconcile with one another.

154
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,260
Se Gi is... a wounded piece that fell out of Cha Do Hyun,

155
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,820
don't you think?

156
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,090
He would probably be the one who needs the most care

157
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,460
and the one who needs to be hugged and held the most for his pain.

158
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,980
By the way, who did you come here for?

159
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,810
For me or Cha Do Hyun?

160
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,690
Please!

161
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,410
I see you still haven't made a decision.

162
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,850
Stop with the small talk and go to sleep.

163
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,310
I'll lend it to you.

164
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
A man...

165
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,260
doesn't borrow a woman's shoulder.

166
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,380
♬ The deep night shows you, who was not able to leave ♬

167
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:44,860
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

168
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,570
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” and your scent ♬

169
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:58,670
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬
♬ Where are you? ♬

170
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:05,750
♬ In the night sky, which I cannot reach, I see you, who is turning back♬

171
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:13,210
♬ I escape from this hard day, it makes a picture ♬

172
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,230
Guess who I am?

173
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,670
You're Shin Se Gi.
♬ But the sadness surges in because I cannot see you, and my tears fall ♬

174
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,230
At this rate, is Mr. Cha... really not thinking of coming back?

175
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,980
It seems Chairwoman Seo Tae Im collapsed.

176
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,760
Did something happen?

177
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
She was healthy, wasn't she?

178
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,540
I think it was God's intervention that you grabbed the date for engagement ahead of time.

179
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,030
This situation is making it to our advantage in many ways.

180
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,140
Try to find a weak spot at this moment.

181
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:24,810
Drag more people over to our side, even it's just one person. Power, in the end, is just a fight between people.

182
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,230
Did the Vice President come back?

183
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,730
No.

184
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,770
He's still Shin Se Gi.

185
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,540
I understand.

186
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,260
I will just say that he went for a rural business trip... so just stay home for today.

187
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,310
Then, I leave him in your care.

188
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,010
I didn't know there's such an elaborate network to cover for the Vice President skipping work.

189
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,080
So there was a reason for the sudden hiring of that new secretary.

190
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,880
He said he wasn't feeling so well.

191
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,650
But... so early in the morning,

192
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,310
what brings you here President?

193
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,380
Tell him to stop with his fake sickness, immediately get to work and come to my room.

194
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,160
What… is that?

195
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,830
Cha Do Hyun
Shin Se Gi

196
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,900
I prepared this because you seemed to have difficulty choosing.

197
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,000
If you can't make a decision, leave it to the gods.

198
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Humanely speaking, don't you think that's way too unfair?

199
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,260
Cha Do Hyun
Shin Se Gi

200
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,980
Turn it.

201
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,160
-1.
-1.

202
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,440
-2.
-2.

203
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,330
-3.
-3.

204
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
Cha Do Hyun.

205
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,720
Damn it!!!

206
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,770
Damn it. Damn it! This is invalid!

207
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,190
Excuse me, Mr. Shin! You don't have time to do things like this.

208
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,490
You have to head out to work right now. You're being summoned by the President.

209
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,620
We turned it too hard!

210
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,250
We have to turn it again. We have to turn it again!

211
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,170
Okay, this is invalid. So let's go over there

212
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,740
and calm down. Come over here.

213
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,850
This is invalid.

214
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,710
It's invalid. So let's talk, okay?

215
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,340
It's invalid, invalid.

216
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,020
Invalid.

217
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,400
You said with your mouth that it is invalid.

218
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,740
I understand, it's invalid. I haven't finished deciding yet.

219
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,540
In return...

220
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,950
In return?

221
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,800
In order for me to choose you on my own,

222
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,060
appeal your charms to me.

223
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,340
What can I appeal more? My existence itself is a lump of appeal.

224
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,120
If you appeal a charm that Mr. Cha has and you don't have,

225
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,890
you can earn more points.

226
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,280
Does he even have any charm?

227
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,210
He's considerate towards others and always takes responsibility for the things he does.

228
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,040
That is not a charm but a critical weak point.

229
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,760
Are you going to do it or not?

230
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,450
Why do I have to do that? I am me.

231
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,740
Then you shouldn't act like you're Cha Do Hyun.

232
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,330
Why do you act like Mr. Cha while destroying his world?

233
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,630
Are you asking because you don't know? That guy destroyed my world first.

234
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,370
He tried to steal you from me!

235
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,990
I told you already! I'm not yours yet!

236
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,330
If Mr. Shin's world is important, then Mr. Cha's world is important, too.

237
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,130
If you protect each other's reputation, then a peaceful process is possible.

238
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,190
So when you are in Mr. Cha's space,

239
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,920
act as Mr. Cha as much as possible.

240
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,350
It's unfair.

241
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,660
It's more fair than that crappy board.

242
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm going to ask Mr. Cha the same thing. To appeal to me

243
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,850
the charms that only you have that he doesn't have.

244
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,510
To respect and understand your world.

245
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:00,750
Mr. Cha will most likely try really hard, just like his nature.

246
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,820
So what are you going to do? Are you going to do it or not?

247
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,560
How should I do it?

248
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,910
Number one, you are not to get angry.

249
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,330
Is that possible?

250
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,460
Number two, no matter how mad you get you will not use violence.

251
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,820
I asked if that is possible.

252
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,500
Number three, you won't ruin each other's reputations.

253
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,920
There's no reputation left to ruin.

254
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,750
Okay. I understand.

255
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,390
Then we'll say that wheel of luck is valid.

256
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,280
Deal?

257
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,780
Deal?

258
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,020
Ah, deal?

259
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,360
Deal.

260
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,040
Mr. Shin, are you ready?

261
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,870
By any chance... you're not going to wear this to work, right?

262
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,780
You told me to go to work.

263
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,110
Did you forget? You won't ruin each other's reputations.

264
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,140
Cha Do Hyun, this bastard, has been totally managing to protect his reputation.

265
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,420
Take it off, take it off. Ah, how nice!

266
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,090
Come here.

267
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,820
Come here.

268
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,460
It's pretty.

269
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,480
Let's...bring this down, a tiny bit...

270
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,640
What are you doing?

271
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,920
This is my last piece of pride. Right when you touch this, our compromise is over.

272
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,020
No, that can't happen, Mr. Shin. Spike it up. Breezy and up! Yeah? Spike it up. Yes.

273
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,940
Mr. Shin, let's go together!

274
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,240
Oh my! Oh my! Eye blinding!

275
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,490
Who's daughter are you that you're so pretty?

276
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,710
You're overreacting.

277
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,760
It's not overreacting, you really are pretty.

278
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,090
Mistress Jeong, try pinching the cloth around the waist more. It looks a bit loose.

279
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,910
Yes.

280
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,450
Let's see.

281
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,000
Aren't you uncomfortable?

282
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,950
I'm okay.

283
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,110
Now the line is alive.

284
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,470
How unfortunate that we are the only ones who get to see this beautiful sight?

285
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,490
The one who should really see you isn't here.

286
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,220
He's busy with company work. Go easy on him.

287
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,390
Mistress Jeong, there was a dress with some decorations around the waist, right?

288
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,900
I want to see the cocktail dress, too.

289
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,880
Yes, Madam.

290
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,790
Chae Yeon, which one do you like better?

291
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,840
-Chae Yeon?
- Yes?

292
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,620
I like all of them. I'm going to go fix my makeup real quick.

293
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,360
As my longtime friend, I congratulate you on your engagement.

294
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,680
Are you being serious?

295
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,390
Well... I don't have the choice.

296
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,430
You don't have the courage to throw away Cha Ki Joon.

297
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,700
And I don't have the courage to hold onto you.

298
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,160
So all I can do is congratulate you.

299
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,130
But...

300
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,960
my heart does hurt.

301
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,480
Can you believe, that for over ten years,

302
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,230
I only looked at one girl?

303
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,640
I couldn't even hold her hand, but I couldn't look somewhere else.

304
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,500
If others heard, it would be something to laugh at.

305
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,810
So now I changed my thought.

306
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,660
What do you mean you changed your thought?

307
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,580
I will give you the choice.

308
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,950
If you want, even after you get engaged,

309
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,500
we can keep meeting...

310
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,470
Without even Ki Joon hyung knowing.

311
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,730
Without even rats or birds knowing.

312
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,070
Think about it well.

313
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,770
Don't make me wait too long.

314
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,840
This is so stifling.

315
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,430
Are you a leader of a high school bully gang? Put the tie on properly.

316
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Don't carry that bag around.

317
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,340
Why? I like it.

318
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,690
I don't like it, I'll buy you one so get rid of it.

319
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,750
You probably don't like the person that gave me the bag, not the bag itself.

320
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,640
I told you not to talk about that woman.

321
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,460
Get rid of it.

322
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,270
You aren't going to get rid of it?

323
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,020
Then I, too, won't wear the neck tie.

324
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,870
-Are you a kid? Put it back on quickly. This is the company.
-I won't wear it.

325
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,550
-Wear it.
-I won't wear it.

326
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,110
-Wear it.
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.

327
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,670
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.

328
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,510
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.

329
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,630
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.

330
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,800
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.

331
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,730
-I won't wear it, get rid of it.
-I won't get rid of it, wear it.

332
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,060
I w-w-w-won't wear it, g-g-g-get rid of it. I won't wear it, get rid of it!

333
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,460
What are you doing right now? We're at the office!

334
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,590
I'm sorry, but it's because he keeps not listening to me.

335
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,130
That's why I told you to get rid of it.

336
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,630
First off, you should go see the President.

337
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,080
I'll be waiting at your office.

338
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,950
Aren't we going together?

339
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,520
He said not to bring anyone with him.

340
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,190
I won't get angry. I won't use violence. I won't ruin his reputation.

341
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,630
I won't get angry. I won't use violence. I won't ruin his reputation.

342
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,360
How did you tame him?

343
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,680
I'm not sure if he's been tamed or not.

344
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,700
You know the 5-member idol group named Rocking that belongs to our company, right?

345
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,250
Should I know that?

346
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,170
You are not to get angry.

347
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,140
Leader J.I. will be finishing his exclusive contract soon.

348
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,930
Before he enters the FA (Free Agent) market, get his signature for a contract renewal.

349
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,540
You are not to use violence.

350
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,810
It won't be easy. He included a baffling condition.

351
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,300
Would that be more baffling than how I feel right now?

352
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,230
I don't know where he got and how he read the scenario of

353
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,150
the movie to be produced by Director Cha Min Seok we acquired through much effort, but

354
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,260
he said that if he doesn't get the main character there, he will never renew his contract with us. He's holding out right now.

355
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,970
Then all you have to do is give him the lead role, and he would renew him contract.

356
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,770
It's not possible. He has such severe foot acting (bad acting), I can't even put it in words.

357
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,540
Then give up on the contract renewal.

358
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:02,910
That's not possible either. The money the group Rocking makes annually is more than 80 billion won (about $80 million).

359
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:08,430
So... make him give up the movie but get him to renew his contract?

360
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,410
Use that skill that got the writer Omega.

361
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,840
The more that time goes on, the more you make me do all kinds of things.

362
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,110
All you have to do is just tell me to screw myself.

363
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,770
Your ways to torture me are unnecessarily of high quality.

364
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,360
Is that the power of studying abroad?

365
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,300
There's also a limit of what I think is cute enough for me to overlook. Do you want to die?

366
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,590
No way. I want to live more than anyone else. So...!

367
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:50,120
Number two, no matter how mad you get you are not to use violence.

368
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,890
That's the reason why your neck is still hanging in there.

369
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,120
J.I.?? Did you just say J.I.?

370
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,630
How many times are you asking me?

371
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,410
J.I. Oppa!

372
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,300
Ah, yes. Thank you.

373
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,180
This is Vice President Cha Do Hyun.

374
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,240
Are you the Nay-I?

375
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,140
Excuse me, Vice President. He's not Nay-I, he's J.I.

376
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,400
Your name seems really nice.

377
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,460
I heard that you want to play the leading role in Director Cha Min Seok's movie.

378
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,020
If you don't listen to my conditions, I will go out to the FA market so do what you want? Understa...

379
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,850
- Sorry.
- Oppa, I'm sorry!

380
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,160
- Don't do this in front of my oppas.
- Hurry up and come here!

381
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,710
- I told you not to do this in front of my oppas!
- I'm sorry!

382
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,190
Y-You!

383
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,350
Are you possibly pointing that finger at me?

384
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,940
Hey, hey, hey, stop. What are you doing in front of the Vice President.

385
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,790
That guy is the Vice President? No way.

386
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,300
Different from your name, you are impudent. Sit.

387
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,550
Now that I think about it, you all do sorts of things, even did a fan cosplay,

388
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,480
just to get me to renew my contract?

389
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,550
Oppa!

390
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,040
Come here while I'm speaking nicely.

391
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,950
You're really crazy. I can't renew the contract.

392
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,430
I won't do it. The negotiation is over.

393
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,610
If you keep acting like this,

394
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,670
I will bury you into the ground so that even rats and birds don't know.

395
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,380
Let go! Let go right now!

396
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,990
That is not the answer I want.

397
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:31,270
I was wrong! I'll do the renewal of the contract!

398
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,460
What did you say?

399
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,040
What are you doing?

400
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,530
By any chance, do you really like me?

401
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,460
Do you really want to do that movie, or

402
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,330
are you just making up any kind of excuse because you really don't want to renew your contract?

403
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,510
Of course, I want to do it. But the company is telling me don't even dream about acting.

404
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,980
So if I let you be in that movie, will you renew your contract?

405
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,910
Are you really going to let me do it?

406
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,760
After I see how you act.

407
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,870
(Lines from Masquerade)
I want to become a king. But if I have to kill someone,

408
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,650
in order to gain the seat, then I don't want to become a king.

409
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,970
Next.

410
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,560
(Lines from Ahjusshi/Man From Nowhere)
You guys live your lives only focusing on tomorrow, don't you? Those who only live for tomorrow

411
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,420
will be killed by those who only live for today.

412
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,900
I only live for today.

413
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:03,510
- Next.
(From The Roaring Currents)- Tell me that it's possible!

414
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:14,480
It's possible!

415
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,920
Wherever you look it's crappy acting!

416
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,560
It matches the world's trend these days perfectly!
What an clever concept!

417
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:29,270
Maintain what you are doing right now, and don't lose your determination!

418
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,670
Alright then. A contract renewal......ok?

419
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,830
Yes.

420
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,370
Get his signature for the movie contract and the contract renewal right now.

421
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,570
Before he changes his mind.

422
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:49,100
Ah, Vice President. Vice President! This is not right!

423
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,680
Vice President!

424
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,860
How could you just come out after ending things like that?

425
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,230
What did I do?

426
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,140
Instead of making him give up about the movie casting, how could you just cast him yourself?

427
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,820
Who cares. I did what I did to make him renew his contract.

428
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,880
Cha Ki Joon should taste what if feels like to be screwed over.

429
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,810
Then Mr. Cha has to clean up behind you again!

430
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,740
No... What I meant...

431
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,360
What was I supposed to do?

432
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,290
You did well. I was in the wrong, me.

433
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,100
I did what you told me to do. You told me not to get angry so I held it in. You told me not to use violence so I didn't.

434
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,370
You told me not to ruin his reputation so I came to the office and worked.

435
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,980
So why does Cha Do Hyun, that bastard, come out in this situation, why?

436
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm sorry. I was in the wrong.

437
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,910
Thank you for keeping your promise, seriously.

438
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,980
It must have been hard but thank you for holding it in.

439
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,090
For keeping the promise,

440
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,100
thank you.

441
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,270
Where are we trying to go in the middle of work?

442
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,150
I worked as much as I could. And I cosplayed Cha Do Hyun as much as I could.

443
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,700
I'm going to play now, with you.

444
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,510
Wait! You haven't even been at work that long!

445
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,120
♫ I want to put you into my two eyes ♫
- I caught it! I caught it!

446
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,720
What are you doing??

447
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,310
♫ I want to whisper love ♫
- A little bit more!

448
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,790
♫ Without you realizing, ♫

449
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:52,340
♫ Sometimes, you can lean on me ♫

450
00:39:53,370 --> 00:40:01,580
Go! go!
♫ I want to be your only woman ♫

451
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,700
♫ What do I call this kind of feeling?♫

452
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,270
♫Is it called love?♫

453
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:18,100
♫ Just like the main character in a fantasy ♫
 You are my star

454
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,080
♫ Even if I don't talk about this happiness ♫

455
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,530
♫You'll know how I feel♫

456
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,340
♫ Should we meet?♫

457
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,600
This came out well.

458
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,280
Why? Where are we going? Wait, wait, wait!

459
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,160
Wait! Why are we here?

460
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:03,400
I don't like your appearance. Your makeup is old-fashioned.

461
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,430
Your skin regimen is also a mess.

462
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,850
What's wrong with my makeup and skin?

463
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,290
Look, look.

464
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,250
I know it's hard, but this girl... transform her.

465
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,160
I like it. Then, this, this, this... pack up all of them.

466
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,180
Yes.

467
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,720
Why are you buying so much?

468
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,020
I said I'm going to buy you all of them.

469
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,120
I don't need it. Either way that is Mr. Cha's money---

470
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,540
but it is your money too. So thanks, I'll use it well.

471
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,450
But I'm going to give this to someone as a present so I'll buy that on my own, okay?

472
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,050
Mr. Cha, Mr. Cha.

473
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,300
You put this on your lips?

474
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:42,670
From now on, rather than "Kill me,"
ask to "Heal me" instead.

475
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,530
Even if that happens, you guys will not die.

476
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,460
Peace.

477
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,350
So... don't kill me.

478
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,710
You guys will still be alive in here.

479
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,620
You guys will no longer be scattered pieces but like connected puzzles.
♬ The deep night show you, who was not able to ♬

480
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,570
You will become a cooler picture.
♬  leave♬

481
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:13,810
With the name of Cha Do Hyun, you guys will become a cooler person.
♬ It wakes me up from my sleep and kisses me again ♬

482
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:18,800
♬ Your voice, which whispered “I love you” ♬

483
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,930
♬ and your scent ♬
♬ echoes in my ears every day ♬

484
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,370
♬ Where are you? ♬

485
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,290
Mr. Shin, I have a request.

486
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,320
A request?

487
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,360
What is it?

488
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,960
You know the pain you have,

489
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,390
can't you now

490
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,990
share a little bit of it with Mr. Cha?

491
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,950
What are you trying to say?

492
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,260
The memory of when you were a child that only you have,

493
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,340
can't you share some of it with Mr. Cha, too?

494
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:18,040
Then won't Mr. Shin and Mr. Cha both become more comfortable?

495
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,370
Share the memories? With that weak guy?

496
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,430
He isn't weak. Mr. Cha is

497
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,190
a lot stronger than you think.

498
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,920
The other personalities disappear the moment they have to take responsibility, but

499
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,300
Mr. Cha appears the moment it's time to take responsibility for them and goes behind them and cleans everything up.

500
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,850
And that is proof that Mr. Cha is strong.

501
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,320
He will be able to recover. He will be able to take it.

502
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,230
That's why, right now,

503
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,210
can't you share some of your pain?

504
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,620
Mr. Shin, where are you going?

505
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,670
I'm going to work. My mood is ruined.

506
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,580
Even if it's just the two of us, it feels like the three of us are dating.

507
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,700
I'm sorry!

508
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,340
I...

509
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,420
stuck my nose in where it doesn't belong.

510
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,860
I don't even really know what it's like, but I still gave you advice.

511
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,550
I'm sorry. I'll apologize, Mr. Shin.

512
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,600
Where did you guys go?

513
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,510
Why? Did something happen at the company?

514
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,790
Not at the company, but at the main residence.

515
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,610
The Chairwoman is urgently looking for you...

516
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,570
Really? Then I should go.

517
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,680
The response is slower than what I expected. This is a bit disappointing.

518
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,860
I will take care of it from now on. Secretary Oh,

519
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,970
whether you go to Vice President's place or do whatever's on your personal schedule, do what's comfortable.

520
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,310
It's bothersome to go around looking for you so just stay at the office.

521
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,560
And leave notice if you go somewhere.

522
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,060
Then I'll get in contact with you once I see what the situation is.

523
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,790
Yes.

524
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,160
First, let's go to my car. I'll drive you there.

525
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,980
No, I will drive.

526
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,770
I know where that household is and all its corners very well.

527
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,410
Mom.

528
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,860
Ri Jin, where are you? Should mom go to where you are, or do you want to come to me?

529
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,930
I'm holding it in because your dad told me to let it go for just this once.

530
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,810
This is your dad!

531
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,760
I'm sorry.

532
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,630
You know what happens if this happens again, right?
There won't be any mercy.

533
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,300
If there won't be, then I can't even defend you.

534
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,810
Mom, Mom, Mom... My mom!

535
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,220
Roots rot easily so either fry them up or mix them up to eat.

536
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,000
I still have the ones you sent me in the fridge.

537
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,940
Mom, this is too much for Ri Jin to eat on her own.

538
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,890
Whatever. She should bring this much to eat since she only visits once a week.

539
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:29,280
Honey, the water is probably boiling in the pot. Bring this and prepare the duck soup.

540
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,020
Ah, I understand.

541
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,440
Hey, Ri On. Follow me.

542
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,190
There is only one duck left.

543
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:40,040
That's right. I bought something to give to you mom.

544
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,060
What?

545
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,520
Come here, come here.

546
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,780
What is it?

547
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,960
When I was young I heard I was pretty quite often. But these days, what I hear in the morning is different from what I hear at night.

548
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,330
Why? You are still pretty.

549
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,330
Look at me. My V-line is a killer, right?

550
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,160
Mom, too? It's pretty, right?

551
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,070
Why? Is something strange?

552
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:11,170
No.. If you look younger than now, I'm worried you might look like my younger sister.

553
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,060
Oh my! Look at how this girl speaks!

554
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,330
But Ri Jin...

555
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,490
tell me the truth...

556
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,560
Where's the chaebol's house that you became a doctor for?

557
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,740
Mom, you can't ever tell anyone.

558
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,920
I understand. You can't trust your mom?

559
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:51,000
I can never... tell you.

560
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,610
This...!

561
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,010
Did you go to the main residence yesterday?

562
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,860
The reason why the Chairwoman collapsed was you, right?

563
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,460
That's the problem with you, Secretary Ahn.

564
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,560
What's the point in finding out now? You should have stopped me before it happened.

565
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,210
Spit it out! What exactly did you do?

566
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,910
You... have to keep this in mind.

567
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,280
The elders in the main house must not find out that there's something wrong with Vice President.

568
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,420
If that happens, you'll gain nothing from it.

569
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,540
Who knows?

570
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,970
If it's known to the world that Cha Do Hyun has DID,

571
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,430
would it be unfortunate for me,

572
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,820
or would it be more unfortunate for Cha Do Hyun, that punk?

573
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:31,410
Non-disclosure contract

574
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,190
Five million dollars

575
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,730
The Chairwoman...

576
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,460
Is at the office.

577
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,690
Secretary Ahn, you can head out first.

578
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,860
We meet again, Grandmother.

579
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,890
So...

580
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,100
did you think about it?

581
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,330
Is Joon Pyo okay?

582
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:26,920
I don't know. I'm not a medical expert.

583
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,360
If something happens to Joon Pyo...

584
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,200
So hand over Seungjin Group over to me and

585
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,130
spend the rest of your life quietly with your son, Grandmother.

586
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:42,660
He's a son to me, but to you, he's your only father.

587
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,090
No matter how greedy you are,

588
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,100
how can you act against your father?

589
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,530
Did you forget all that your father has done for you!?

590
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:54,560
I cannot forget, even if I try to, what kind of father he was to me.

591
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,030
What the person that's called my father did.

592
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:03,910
I don't know what and how much you still remember, but

593
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,760
there's something I will still say even when a knife is brought to my throat.

594
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,260
On that day, 21 years ago...

595
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:17,390
it was your father who saved you from the fire.

596
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,010
Until he became his current state,

597
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,770
the one who saved you was my son, Joon Pyo!

598
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,820
AH!

599
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,180
I never asked to be saved.

600
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,550
I never once asked to be saved! I never begged to be saved!

601
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,280
The other child should have been saved instead.

602
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,600
Instead of me, that other child should have been saved. That's what's humane!

603
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,890
Seungjin, which is controlled by you,

604
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,070
I am going to take everything and give it to that child.

605
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,270
To atone for the past.

606
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,250
Make your decision, Grandmother.

607
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:08,420
Is it your son's life or is it Seungjin Group?

608
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,710
To you, I can never,

609
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,700
ever give it.

610
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:32,640
You still aren't saying that you will choose your son over Seungjin Group.

611
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,780
I clearly gave you a chance.

612
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,980
It's you, Grandmother, that is choosing the company over your son.

613
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,490
The one who blew off the last chance of saving your son,

614
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,200
is none other than Chairwoman Seo Tae Im,

615
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,010
you.

616
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,740
Quickly, follow him.

617
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,880
Ri On.

618
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,080
He said he was going to drive me, where did he go?

619
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:41,080
You can know one's mental state based on what their desk looks like.

620
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,870
I can almost imagine the insides of your brain.

621
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,810
Seriously...

622
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,090
Oh...

623
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,770
Seungjin Group.

624
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,280
The chaebol secret that goes back 3-4 generations.
"Why did he go to America?"

625
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,590
What are the chaebols trying to hide?

626
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,210
The chaebol secret that goes back 3-4 generations told by experts.

627
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,350
Ri Jin.

628
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,950
Ri On.

629
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,680
What exactly...

630
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,270
is all of this?

631
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,590
Tell me. What is your purpose?

632
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:54,320
How exactly are you connected with him to be doing these background investigations?

633
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,190
You...

634
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,790
To me...

635
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:10,800
How you told me not to bring up Cha Do Hyun's name in front of mom and dad

636
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,520
and to not talk about Seungjin Group,

637
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,490
it's connected with all these, right?

638
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,740
Right?

639
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,460
Don't go.

640
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,270
Play with me.

641
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,180
That other kid should have been saved instead.

642
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,710
Instead of me, that kid should have been saved.

643
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:54,160
The one who saved you from the fire 21 years ago was

644
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,440
your father.

645
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,060
The one who saved you was my son, Joon Pyo!

646
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,590
That child should have been saved.

647
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,310
Instead of me, that other child should have been saved!

648
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,810
That's what's humane!

649
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,470
Where is this place?

650
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,190
Is it the basement again?

651
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,500
What is this?

652
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,290
What did I figure out?

653
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,600
In this basement...

654
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,220
There was one other person other than me?

655
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,000
Who is it?

656
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:09,300
Who is it? Just... who are you?

657
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,890
Father.

658
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,920
How could this...

659
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,970
Father...

660
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,430
Father, I was wrong.

661
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,390
Father, I was wrong...

662
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,920
Father, I was wrong!
