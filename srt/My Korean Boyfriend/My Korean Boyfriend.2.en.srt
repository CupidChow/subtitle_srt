{\an8}<i>Anxiety often accompanies the unknown.</i>

2
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:15,015
{\an8}<i>I have no idea who said that,</i>
<i>all I know is I agree.</i>

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>The best feeling is</i>
<i>when anxiety leaves your chest</i>

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,769
<i>and becomes butterflies in your stomach.</i>

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>That's your body getting ready</i>
<i>to face something for the first time.</i>

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>How do I know</i>
<i>if the guy I've been talking to</i>

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>is the same guy that's coming to meet me?</i>

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,707
Mari!

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,596
How are you?

10
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,765
I thought I wasn't going to see you.

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,349
Why not?

12
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,351
I came here to surprise… Oh!

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,646
You did not pick me up at the airport. No!

14
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,774
That's how you…

15
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:10,487
<i>He left me waiting at the airport</i>
<i>and thinks a flower will fix it?</i>

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,613
It's from my heart.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,406
That's why. Here.

18
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,326
<i>What's worse is… it actually does!</i>

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>He's perfect, I can't stop smiling.</i>

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,752
I was waiting here by myself and
I really thought that no one was coming.

21
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,462
No, of course I'm gonna come.

22
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,214
'Cause you came to Korea to see…

23
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,758
me? I hope, right?

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,720
Okay, okay.

25
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,721
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,515
I really… Yeah, nice to meet you.

27
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,102
Hello, Danny, I'm Mari.

28
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,937
- Hello.
- Hello.

29
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm happy to see you.

30
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,359
I'm happy to see you too. <i>Jinjja.</i>

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>Jinjja?</i>

32
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>- "Jinjja" </i>means "really". Yeah.
<i>- Jinjja!</i>

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,655
Wow, you're tall!

34
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,697
I'm tall.

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,783
- Maybe you're in heels, that's why.
- Yeah. I'm not.

36
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,451
- You're not?
- I'm tall, yeah.

37
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,121
How do you say "pretty" in Portuguese?

38
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,789
<i>Bonita.</i>

39
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,832
Ah, <i>bonita.</i>

40
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,375
Yes. <i>Bonita.</i>

41
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>- Bonita?</i>
<i>- Bonita.</i>

42
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,503
<i>You're the pretty one.</i>

43
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,715
So, what should we do now?

44
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,217
I want to show you around this area,

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,844
- 'cause it's really pretty.
- Okay.

46
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,595
Yeah, let's go. I will follow you.

47
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,555
- Okay.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,098
Are you ready?

49
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,599
- I'm so ready!
- Okay.

50
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,442
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

51
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,789
<i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>you simply leave things up to fate. Like…</i>

52
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,251
<i>…going to a Korean night club.</i>

53
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,301
- Hey, sexy ladies!
- Sexy ladies!

54
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,020
<i>What happens in Seoul stays in Seoul?</i>

55
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,148
Wow, they're so hot. Oh yeah!

56
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,863
Cheers to our trip!

57
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,539
You should go check out the boys.

58
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,791
I'm trying to avoid eye contact.

59
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,883
Where are you from?

60
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,009
Oh, Brazil.

61
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,969
- Brazil?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,513
Hello!

63
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,932
- Hello!
- Hi! Yes! Hi!

64
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,516
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,476
Hi!

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,728
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you!

67
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,855
My name is Jiuan.

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,107
- Jiuan.
- Welcome to Korea.

69
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,609
Thank you!

70
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,527
Welcome to Korea.

71
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,612
Welcome to Korea.

72
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,655
Thank you.

73
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,244
Are you Korean?

74
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,662
Yeah, I'm Korean.

75
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,748
I was born here, but I live in Brazil.

76
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,168
So, when did you go to Brazil?

77
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,754
When I was three years old.

78
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,797
Three years old?

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,714
Yeah.

80
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,634
I thought it had been longer.

81
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,802
Huh?

82
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,428
It's not as long ago as I thought.

83
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,888
What? Three years?

84
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,349
- I was three years old.
- Huh?

85
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,850
- That I was three.
- You were three?

86
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,810
Yeah.

87
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,312
<i>He's nice to look at,</i>
<i>but this conversation is rough.</i>

88
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,482
<i>I guess annoying guys at clubs</i>
<i>are a universal thing.</i>

89
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>Well, at least the girls are having fun.</i>

90
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,821
- You speak Korean?
- I speak Korean.

91
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,283
Just job or travel?

92
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
- I'm travel.
- No, no, no!

93
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,453
- Okay!
- No, no, no!

94
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,289
I'm… Uh…

95
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,290
Never!

96
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,874
- Vacation.
- Vacation?

97
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,959
Yeah.

98
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,128
Hey, this one is cute, babe.

99
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,756
I don't want anything.
He's so freakin' annoying.

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,926
Wow, Camila's really picky, isn't she?

101
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,398
You brought me to this place
for a specific reason?

102
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,566
You like this place?

103
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,650
Yeah, I mean, like…

104
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
This is one of the landmarks of Seoul.

105
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,323
I thought it would be
a good place to start, you know?

106
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,368
We've been talking for, like,
almost half a year now, right?

107
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,245
In the airport… Uh…

108
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,163
Oh, right. Yeah.

109
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,831
In the airport, it was a little bit, like…

110
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,166
Hmm, that's not…

111
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,251
I wish he was here.

112
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,713
What really happened that day?
You told me it was a family problem.

113
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,340
Yeah, I mean, like…

114
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,924
So, I had to…

115
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,177
Basically I just had to help my dad, like,

116
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,971
with something with his company.

117
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,348
Yeah.

118
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,849
I'm sorry. So sorry.

119
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,184
How can I reply to that?

120
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,685
- Like… No problem.
- No problem.

121
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,270
- It's all good…
- Yeah, all good.

122
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,522
- Really, no problem.
- Okay.

123
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,316
Well, anyways…

124
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,860
Oh, you've been going to the gym, right?

125
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,570
- Especially this morning.
- Oh my God.

126
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,073
You went to the gym this morning?

127
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,700
- Okay.
- Yeah.

128
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,618
Show me.

129
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,370
- Oh my God!
- No, I'm just kidding.

130
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,877
Do you think that I look similar
from the photos and videos?

131
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,381
Actually, yeah. Like,
when you turned around, I was like…

132
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,091
Mm.

133
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,009
It was overwhelming, I mean…

134
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
- Handsome?
- Pretty.

135
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,931
- Pretty.
- That's right.

136
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay, got it.

137
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,975
Do you have anything you wanna do?

138
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,520
Anything you need?

139
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,854
Just tell me.

140
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,815
Just you in my life, Danny.

141
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,942
Just kidding.

142
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,154
Did you cut your hair?

143
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,489
Yes.

144
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,366
Can I touch your hair?
I'm already touching it.

145
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,283
No!

146
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,701
Yeah, you can touch my hair.

147
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,746
Yeah, you cut it a little bit, right?

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,832
I mean, it was very messy. So…

149
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,833
I gotta…

150
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,792
I like your hair.

151
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,085
- I gotta look clean.
- Yay.

152
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,174
<i>The way he looks at me,</i>
<i>damn, I just can't.</i>

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,301
<i>Do I feel like kissing him?</i>

154
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>Yeah.</i>

155
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,936
<i>But let's take it slow, because</i>
<i>things are different here in Korea.</i>

156
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,148
Right now, I think I have to go.

157
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,067
Because I'm a little bit tired
and, actually, I'm freezing cold.

158
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,360
- Okay, yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,362
Let me say goodbye to you.

160
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,197
Yeah. I mean…

161
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,740
Okay.

162
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,536
Mm. Thank you for coming.

163
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,663
- Thank you.
- All right, see you soon.

164
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,123
- Okay.
- Okay?

165
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,666
- Okay.
- Okay, bye-bye.

166
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,166
Does she have a boyfriend?

167
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,585
- Yeah, she has a boyfriend. Yeah.
- Oh.

168
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,045
What did he say?

169
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,880
If you have a boyfriend.

170
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,716
Girl, he's cute!
I don't get why you don't like him.

171
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,135
- Oh yeah, but…
- Come on, just kiss him.

172
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,095
No way! I'm not gonna kiss him.

173
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,807
<i>I tried, I swear.</i>
<i>But it's not gonna happen, not now.</i>

174
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,726
<i>I've been all over the place</i>
<i>since I got here.</i>

175
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,061
We have to go.

176
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>I'm really confused. I don't think</i>
<i>it's the right time to get to know anyone.</i>

177
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,194
Bye-bye.

178
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,862
Bye.

179
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>You've been always on my mind</i>

180
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,379
- It's hard to get out of bed today.
- Good morning.

181
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,839
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, girls.

182
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,425
- What's up?
- Morning, my loves.

183
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,760
Sit here, Morena.

184
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,304
I need my girls'
undivided attention, please.

185
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
'Cause I need to tell you
what happened yesterday.

186
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,725
- Oh yeah?
- Tell us, tell us, we wanna know.

187
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,937
I mean, I swear, it was like a scene

188
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,732
directly out of a K-drama. I was waiting
for him, like, "Oh God, where is he?"

189
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,194
And suddenly,
I hear my name coming from behind me.

190
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,654
I almost choked.

191
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,322
He was holding a flower in his hand.

192
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,158
He was hiding it
and then he gave it to me.

193
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,829
Then he apologized
for not picking me up at the airport.

194
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,957
I mean, the chemistry is undeniable.

195
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,294
You can feel there's
something there, you know?

196
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,213
Like a… a desire to be together.

197
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,631
I mean, damn, girlfriend.

198
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,633
I can't wait to see him again. For real.

199
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,512
Did you set a date? Did you talk about it?
Do you know when you'll see him again?

200
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,555
Oh yeah, for sure.

201
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,307
- Anything you want to do?
- And his height?

202
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,850
- Is he tall?
- He's my height.

203
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,144
- That's good!
- Yeah, like…

204
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,646
Oh, well, that's good.

205
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,442
<i>Even better than experiencing</i>
<i>something for the first time…</i>

206
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,945
<i>is talking about it.</i>
<i>It's reliving the best parts.</i>

207
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,906
<i>But then, once it's out there,</i>
<i>you start overthinking,</i>

208
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,034
<i>and you're back to square one.</i>

209
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,119
I like guys who make me suffer.

210
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,829
We can see that.

211
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,082
No, babe, love is stable, it's calm.

212
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,083
Is it?

213
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,501
Yeah. Of course it is.

214
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,087
It's not fighting and
craziness all the time.

215
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,173
No, no, we don't fight all the time.

216
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,424
No?

217
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,302
I like excitement in a relationship.
Am I supposed to have a boring one?

218
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,429
My first relationship was chaos.

219
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,431
You don't think this one is also chaotic?

220
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,433
The first one was much worse.

221
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,019
Like, to the point where he wanted
to rip my clothes with a knife.

222
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:53,819
The people you've been in relationships
with all have similar characteristics.

223
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,822
Their actions repeat a pattern.

224
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,451
And that's something
you don't even notice,

225
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,995
but it's always happening.

226
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,456
- He treats me like a princess…
- Lots to unpack.

227
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,126
…he doesn't curse at me,
he doesn't humiliate me, you know?

228
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,587
- He doesn't do those things.
- Who?

229
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
- Si-won doesn't do those things.
- That's good, right?

230
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,270
Sometimes I think, "My Lord,
I came to Korea of all places

231
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,357
and then met a guy
who was a perfect match for me."

232
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,776
At times I had my doubts,
like, does he like me,

233
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,530
or am I totally making it up it because
I'm crazy and excited, you know?

234
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,574
I don't know if you notice
the way he looks at you.

235
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,744
You look at each other,
like, the same way. With a lot of love.

236
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,329
I thought, "that's real love."

237
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,956
Where's the ring?
Where's my friend's ring?

238
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,708
That's so sweet!

239
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,294
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't wait!

240
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,505
- Absolutely!
- Yeah, I can't wait to go to your wedding.

241
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,673
- I'm all like…
- Me too!

242
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,133
Ah! Hold up.

243
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,468
- They express themselves…
- A message.

244
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,429
Wait.

245
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,639
Is everything okay?

246
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,853
Can you help me translate this?

247
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,979
"Luanny,

248
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,650
the day we meet again,
I want to confess something

249
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,026
you didn't know."

250
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,240
"Maybe you'll be shocked
if you hear my story,

251
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,035
but now I want to be as honest
as possible with you."

252
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,500
"It's already in the past and
I don't want to hurt your heart."

253
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
"The day we meet again,

254
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,172
I'll tell you everything."

255
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,173
"See you soon."

256
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,800
What's he gotta tell her?

257
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,267
It must be serious
if he thinks it'll shock her.

258
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,019
I'm having an anxiety attack.

259
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,397
<i>What is it now?</i>

260
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,565
<i>Does he have another family?</i>

261
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,776
<i>Was he arrested? Fuck!</i>

262
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,195
<i>Not a single moment of peace</i>
<i>with this guy.</i>

263
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,032
I wouldn't be able to take
the suspense. I'd call him now.

264
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,867
I would have called him already.

265
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,494
I… I should wait.

266
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,079
And let him say it to my face.

267
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,924
Girl, I hope it's something positive
that will help your relationship.

268
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,717
Because if it's just another issue…

269
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,220
- Yeah, no more problems.
- More dilemmas?

270
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,556
Well, yeah, it's a problem.
There's no way it's not a problem.

271
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,144
You should prepare yourself for the worst,
and then when you get there,

272
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,312
it might not be that bad.

273
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,189
- That's the worst part.
- But that's shitty,

274
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,733
- 'cause you'll just be wondering.
- He knows I have anxiety.

275
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,987
I didn't sleep last night
and I won't again tonight.

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,073
Look.

277
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,951
It's out of your control, you know.

278
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,495
So you should just wait, stay calm.

279
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,541
Just ask him when would be
the best time for you two to talk.

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,924
{\an8}Now I'm shaking.

281
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,094
{\an8}He keeps typing and deleting.

282
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,180
{\an8}Yeah, let's wait.

283
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,475
- He said we should meet tonight.
- Tonight?

284
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,894
Have some water.

285
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
I need it.

286
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,365
<i>Tonight is full of possibilities.</i>

287
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>On one hand, there's tension and doubt.</i>

288
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,454
<i>On the other,</i>
<i>an unexpected invitation to dinner.</i>

289
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>As the minutes drag on,</i>
<i>the only thing I'm sure of</i>

290
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,711
<i>is that this night</i>
<i>will change our lives forever.</i>

291
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,213
Yeah, honey!

292
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,007
You slayed babe, slayed.

293
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
- Preach.
- Girl, I love it.

294
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,176
- Perfect, stunning.
- Honey, that's it.

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,303
- You'll be matching.
- Yeah.

296
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>He sent a car.</i>

297
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,545
<i>Flowers.</i>

298
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,256
<i>Su-woong has never done this.</i>

299
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,134
<i>I don't think today is just a dinner.</i>

300
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,855
Okay, let's go.

301
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,455
<i>He wrote, "We're going to meet where</i>

302
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>the horizon kisses the sky,</i>
<i>and tonight will be unforgettable."</i>

303
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>Where is this place,</i>
<i>and why is it unforgettable? Oh my God!</i>

304
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,749
Oh my goodness!

305
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,461
Oh, my God!

306
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,089
- Hi, Su-woong.
- Hello.

307
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,632
Oh, my God!

308
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,176
How are you? What you mean?

309
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,140
- Nice flowers?
- Yeah, thank you very much!

310
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,516
How handsome!

311
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,561
- So beautiful, pretty today.
- Oh my God! My heart! Thank you.

312
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>Look at this restaurant! And this view!</i>

313
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>He's going to propose to me.</i>

314
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,952
And I always thought you are not romantic,
but you are romance.

315
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,080
- You're red here. Can I clean?
- Red?

316
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, sure.

317
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,249
Lipstick.

318
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,088
I love your lip color today.

319
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,590
You like red, I know.

320
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,718
- Cheers. To us.
- Cheers.

321
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,261
- To us.
- Thank you very much.

322
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,721
- This is so nice.
- You're welcome.

323
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,640
Romantic boy, I very love.

324
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,482
Oh, thank you.

325
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,111
Actually, I was thinking
I need to wear a dress,

326
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,697
but I didn't bring a dress for this.

327
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,115
Yeah, yeah. And cold.

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,787
And when I saw this picture I said,
"Oh my God, I don't have clothes to wear."

329
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,456
Ooh, you look really good.

330
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,875
- And I like blue. Blue.
- Blue?

331
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,002
- Yeah, I like color.
- Mm.

332
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,129
- Mm…
- You don't use so much color,

333
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,714
but I like color.

334
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,553
<i>Eat very carefully,</i>
<i>maybe the ring is in there.</i>

335
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,889
So, I prepared…

336
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh no.

337
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,143
<i>Morena, don't cry.</i>

338
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,729
<i>Don't cry, it'll ruin your makeup.</i>

339
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,106
- Hm?
- Show me.

340
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,191
- Hm?
- Show me, please.

341
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,984
Show you or should I read?

342
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,903
Oh, I don't know. You choose.

343
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>No, it's not just dinner.</i>
<i>Oh my God, now what?</i>

344
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>A letter?</i>

345
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,135
<i>Oh God, what does he have to say?</i>

346
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,680
<i>Will I know when to call it quits</i>
<i>in this relationship?</i>

347
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,241
Luanny!

348
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,163
You're not wrapped up well,
so I brought you this.

349
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,707
You remember this coat, right?

350
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,459
I figured you wouldn't have
enough warm clothes.

351
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,961
So I got it for you.

352
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,925
Can I take it back to Brazil?

353
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,430
Of course you can,
but isn't it always hot there?

354
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,059
This place is beautiful, don't you think?

355
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,353
Look at those lights.

356
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,855
Over there, see?

357
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,065
Aren't they beautiful?

358
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,324
Luanny…

359
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,954
There's something I need to confess.

360
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,295
You didn't cheat, right?

361
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,881
You asked me…

362
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,801
about my financial… situation.

363
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,720
And now I want to tell you the truth.

364
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,971
The reason why I had

365
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,514
such a…

366
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,642
complicated life…

367
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,895
is because my family…

368
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,567
went through some hard times.

369
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,112
When I was a student,

370
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,491
my parents were in serious debt.

371
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,288
We'd have loan sharks
come to our house all the time.

372
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,625
And so I…

373
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,879
grew up…

374
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,468
I grew up exposed…

375
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,221
to that kind of stuff.

376
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,850
Wait. Ah…

377
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm not good at dealing
with this kind of stuff.

378
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,901
I get really anxious
and my heart starts racing.

379
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,787
I want to read for you.

380
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,625
"Hi, Morena."

381
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,462
"You used to live
on the other side of the world."

382
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,590
"So, how did we meet?"

383
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,221
"The way we made it through this distance

384
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,393
must have been
more than just a simple attraction."

385
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,021
"There must have been
something special beyond that."

386
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:03,530
"Sometimes I feel like time flew by
like lightning since I met you."

387
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,870
"During that time, I was very happy,

388
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,205
and I believe you were happy too."

389
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,547
"Of course we faced some challenges
and misunderstandings,

390
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,632
especially when we were apart."

391
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,429
"But even with that,
I can feel something clear."

392
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,723
"You always gave me your true heart."

393
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:35,103
"I may not remember
all of your words and wishes,

394
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,522
but I know what you want the most."

395
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,196
"I want to make those hopes come true."

396
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,448
"Because…

397
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,575
I want that too."

398
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,244
Me too.

399
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,872
"Let's stop being apart."

400
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,250
"And on the same side,

401
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,004
and build our family together."

402
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,589
Mm-hmm.

403
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,841
So…

404
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,813
So…

405
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,981
Will you marry me?

406
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,197
- Answer. Answer me.
- I want, yes.

407
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,659
Thank you. I love you.

408
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,669
Oh, my God!

409
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,546
Thank you.

410
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,049
- Su-woong!
- Thank you so much.

411
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,217
I love you.

412
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,468
I love you.

413
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,310
<i>This is a dream.</i>

414
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,147
<i>My Korean boyfriend</i>
<i>became my Korean fiancé.</i>

415
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,608
<i>Our "happily ever after"</i>
<i>is just beginning.</i>

416
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,154
<i>I just hope his mother feels the same.</i>

417
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,699
How do you know my size?

418
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,505
In our house…

419
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,760
Mm, don't cry.

420
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,971
It's okay, baby.

421
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,183
We could barely make ends meet.

422
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,854
When I went…

423
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,775
to college to study and I…

424
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,237
made new friends, they wanted

425
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,240
to go out to eat one day…

426
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,701
and I…

427
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,124
Don't cry, baby.

428
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,918
Back then, I didn't…

429
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,466
have a penny to my name.

430
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,261
So I made up an excuse.

431
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,679
]Luanny] Sorry.

432
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,227
I said I was still… full from breakfast.

433
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,812
I lied to them.

434
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,318
I can't tell you

435
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:33,573
how much I cried in the bathroom that day.

436
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,499
I didn't understand
why my childhood had been so hard.

437
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,835
And why I had to be poor.

438
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,339
And why I couldn't have

439
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,675
a regular cellphone.

440
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,553
Like everyone else had.

441
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,930
When I was a student,

442
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,935
I'd envy my friends
because of their phones.

443
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,853
So,

444
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:09,150
ever since I was young, I wanted to make

445
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,778
quick and easy money.

446
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,489
But I'd lose everything…

447
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,408
investing.

448
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,034
Then at one point,

449
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,788
I just started losing more and more.

450
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,456
And now,

451
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,917
I'm paying off…

452
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,296
all my debt.

453
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,258
And to be honest,
when you first came to Korea…

454
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,724
I felt so guilty, because you came

455
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,184
from another country.

456
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,813
And…

457
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,818
- I couldn't afford to offer you much.
- Don't cry, baby.

458
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,697
I really couldn't afford it.

459
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
I felt so…

460
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,336
I'm going to try really hard.

461
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,713
Because I'm seriously considering

462
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,090
a future

463
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,300
with you.

464
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,347
And I'll do it for Ayla as well.

465
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,099
From now on,

466
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,354
it'll be you, Ayla, and me.

467
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,440
We'll have a stable, peaceful life.

468
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,319
We'll build our future together.

469
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,447
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,158
You know why…

471
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,286
I'm a little harsh sometimes?

472
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,122
Because…

473
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,167
it hurts me to see you work so hard.

474
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,630
Every day, you call me and say, "Oh,
my back hurts, I'm working all the time,

475
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,007
and in the end, I have nothing."

476
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,134
Do you think that makes me happy?

477
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,970
How are we going to build a life?

478
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
That's why I'm hard on you.

479
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,975
You think I wanna see you like this?

480
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,062
Big baby.

481
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,360
<i>I already have a daughter.</i>
<i>I can't take care of a grown man too.</i>

482
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,072
<i>It makes me sad to hear those things.</i>

483
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,574
<i>But if we're together,</i>
<i>we have to join forces.</i>

484
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,536
Can I tell you something?

485
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,541
Hey, hang on.

486
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,335
There's something I need to tell you.

487
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,714
When you first got here, I was…

488
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,300
I had absolutely no money
when you first came.

489
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,302
I was totally broke.

490
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,722
I was so, so broke.

491
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,683
But my family thinks I paid for your trip!

492
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,602
But I actually paid for it.

493
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:52,981
I know.

494
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,734
Then I'm going to tell your family
I paid for it.

495
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,527
Forgive me.

496
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
I don't forgive you.

497
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,408
It's all good.

498
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,744
We can get through this.

499
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:07,996
Okay?

500
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,916
Now, if you screw up again,
I'll hit you over the head.

501
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,501
Clear?

502
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,086
All right.

503
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,256
I promise I'll do exactly

504
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,301
what you tell me.

505
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,429
I'll straighten out from now on.

506
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,995
He opened up about really personal things.

507
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,584
His parents divorced
when he was really young.

508
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,295
They divorced because
his father was in a lot of debt.

509
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,547
Loan sharks would come
to his house and break things.

510
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,510
That kind of traumatized him.

511
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:07,263
And that became a cycle.
He would always think about that.

512
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,141
He wondered why life
had to be so hard for him.

513
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,852
Why did everyone have
the things he couldn't have?

514
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,815
Why did his family have
to be so messed up?

515
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,150
But I didn't know how to help him,

516
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,571
because I could tell it was
very hard for him to talk about that.

517
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,240
It was hard for him to open up.

518
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,283
I don't know how to handle
these situations.

519
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,496
I don't wanna be anyone's shrink.

520
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
Because I have my own issues.

521
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,168
And I also want someone
to help me through them.

522
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,378
Yeah, girl. For sure.

523
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,840
So it's hard to deal with
my personal problems…

524
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,217
- No, it's…
- …and other people's problems.

525
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,301
Yeah, look…

526
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,387
His issues…

527
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,889
Hearing all this now,

528
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,685
I understand what's going on
in his head a little better.

529
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,732
But that doesn't cancel out your issues,
your story and your life. Right?

530
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,651
Because everyone has issues, babe.

531
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,611
Isn't his family wealthy?

532
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,697
- Nowadays they are.
- Not back then?

533
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,156
Not back then.

534
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,285
Why doesn't he ask
his family for money then?

535
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,619
He's 35 years old.

536
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,371
He can't keep asking them for money.

537
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,081
Then why does he ask you?

538
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,959
I don't know.
I think he feels less humiliated

539
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,169
asking a woman for help
than asking his family.

540
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,841
You're working hard every day to make
ends meet, to take care of your daughter,

541
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,509
your mom, have your things.

542
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,596
Then here comes pretty boy
asking you for money,

543
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,556
even though his family is wealthy?

544
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,473
What?

545
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,392
For God's sake!

546
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,353
<i>They don't get that</i>
<i>Si-won also has great qualities.</i>

547
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,858
<i>But I also understand that the few flaws</i>
<i>that he has can ruin our future.</i>

548
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,698
{\an8}We feel like there's a huge weight
on your shoulders, you know?

549
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,492
{\an8}And I don't want you
to have to carry that weight.

550
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,787
So, I want you to really think about
what you want for your future.

551
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,748
Sometimes,
even if you want to be with him,

552
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,458
it may not be the right path for you.

553
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,585
Because it will just hurt you.

554
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,423
It's really good to hear
what each of you have to say.

555
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,343
Because you guys see the big picture.

556
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,803
I'm inside the relationship,
so we get a little…

557
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,305
- Blinded, right?
- Yeah.

558
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:17,143
So, hearing your opinions,
it makes me even more confused, you know?

559
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
'Cause a lot of these things
seemed normal to me.

560
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:24,025
I love him, so I would just deal with it.
I saw it as part of the relationship.

561
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,488
When I see you guys talking about
what relationships should be like,

562
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,199
that certain things are not normal,

563
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:36,079
then I start thinking, "What am I
getting myself into? What am I doing?"

564
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,039
"How is this going to affect my future?"

565
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,540
So now I have doubts.

566
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,835
I'm not saying I'm going to be like,
"It's over, fuck off."

567
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,214
I'm just saying
it's really making me think twice.

568
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,548
It really is.

569
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,597
<i>When doubt takes over,</i>
<i>the only thing left to do is</i>

570
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,723
<i>go back to what's certain.</i>

571
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,142
<i>And in Seoul, that means skin care.</i>

572
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,104
<i>Because comfort also comes in little jars.</i>

573
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,696
Girls, this is
the perfect neighborhood to shop. Right?

574
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,114
Girl, there's so much stuff.

575
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,116
- I can't wait!
- Where should we get our skin care?

576
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,659
- Oh no, we need it.
- Makeup.

577
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,494
- We need the makeup…
- I'm gonna need your help.

578
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,954
I don't know anything about this.

579
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,164
I really need to take care of my skin,

580
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,209
because I have some big
news to tell you all.

581
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,752
- What's that?
- I have to look gorgeous.

582
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,129
So let's buy a lot of skin care,

583
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,714
because I'm getting married.

584
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,134
Let's see!

585
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,345
Girl.

586
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,306
- Let's go get you a Chanel dress!
- Let's go!

587
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,267
Let's trade this ring for skin care!

588
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,603
- Congratulations, honey!
- Thank you!

589
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,897
- You must have cried so much!
- Oh my God.

590
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,691
Come here, group hug!

591
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,404
- We have a bride-to-be in the group!
- Finally, girl!

592
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,864
You're gonna get run over!

593
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,824
We have a lot of things to buy then.

594
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,076
First, our skin has to look gorgeous.
'Cause the wedding…

595
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,162
- Yes, girl, for the wedding.
- It's this year.

596
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,371
I'm getting married this year.

597
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,922
- Don't you wanna go in?
- Let's go.

598
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,053
<i>Ugh, I can't even fit</i>
<i>everything I want in my luggage.</i>

599
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,722
<i>This is the only thing better than Danny.</i>

600
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,725
Amazing!

601
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,311
- I want an eyeliner.
- Guys, I want that thing

602
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,521
that makes your lips red, you know?

603
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,606
- The one like…
- Lip tint?

604
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,149
- Lip balm.
- It's right here.

605
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,233
- Yes!
- There's a lip tint.

606
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,152
- I saw these…
- More expensive, you know.

607
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,155
Guys, I'm loving this girls' moment.

608
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,575
And we have a bride-to-be in the group.

609
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,743
Did you cry?

610
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,536
Oh my Lord! I died!

611
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,539
- I can't even. I didn't cry, I died.
- No way!

612
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,042
- Ladies!
- It's all good.

613
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,085
Sorry, babe.

614
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,920
Guys…

615
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,632
I'm so happy with my ring. Oh God!

616
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,099
We're home!

617
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,267
- Guys, I'm so tired.
- Damn!

618
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,019
- It was so nice.
- I'm legit exhausted.

619
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,438
So much fun.
There's all sorts of things over there.

620
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,524
Girls, I went all out with my shopping.

621
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,486
This feels so good!

622
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,697
We could have
a little celebration tonight.

623
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,158
You know, have a party here at home.

624
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,451
- I'd love a party.
- Right?

625
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,577
I'm in.

626
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,413
- Let's call all the boys?
- I'm going to see my fiancé!

627
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,208
- Wear something white!
- Party!

628
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,106
Hello!

629
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,816
- Hi!
- Oh my God. Wait!

630
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,861
How are you guys?

631
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,112
Hello, Mari!

632
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,655
Hello, Danny!

633
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,240
Nice to see you again.

634
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,534
Oh, nice to see you too.

635
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,077
- Hello, guys.
- Hi.

636
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,538
How are you? I'm Mariana.

637
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,582
{\an8}- I'm Iurii.
- Oh, that's nice.

638
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,959
{\an8}- Welcome to the crib!
- Wow!

639
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,591
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. I'm so ready. Can I look?

640
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,676
- No, you cannot look now.
- I can't look yet?

641
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,720
- Okay, when can I look?
- Wait, wait, wait.

642
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,679
When can I look?

643
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,014
Now, now you can look.

644
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,391
Whoa!

645
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,894
Now you can look.

646
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,229
- Wow. Whoa, whoa, look at that.
- Yeah!

647
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,648
This is the… All this is the view.

648
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,317
You guys live here?

649
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,610
Yeah, we do.

650
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,777
Can we join you guys?

651
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,905
- Yeah, you guys just move here.
- Yes, of course.

652
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,199
Cheers!

653
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,950
Cheers!

654
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,202
Drink mine, drink mine.

655
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
Jack!

656
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,209
Jack is here!

657
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,127
<i>Good drinks, good company.</i>

658
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,673
<i>Let's see if Jack loosens up a little</i>
<i>bit more, here in my natural habitat.</i>

659
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,676
- Jack is here! Hello, Jack!
- Hello!

660
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,345
- Hello.
- Hi, Jack.

661
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,139
Hello! How are you?

662
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,682
Katy is screwed.

663
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,311
- Hello.
- Jack has arrived.

664
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,563
Nice to meet you.

665
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,274
Let's hear, like, who is Jack.

666
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,235
Introduce yourself.

667
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>Wow, what a great start.</i>
<i>He went and sat way the hell over there.</i>

668
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>Perfect.</i>

669
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,201
No, nothing.

670
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,994
Do you?

671
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,706
Oh yeah, you've been here for ten years.
So you speak three languages, right?

672
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,916
Yeah, three languages.

673
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,169
Yeah, I speak three… I speak two.

674
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,131
I understand a lot of Spanish,
because I used to have it at school.

675
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,801
It was like English and Spanish.

676
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,178
And…

677
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,808
And Mandarin now. One day I'll be fluent.

678
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,311
It's gonna be good. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

679
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,147
I'll ask you to teach me. "How are you?"

680
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,440
- How are you?
- Hi, everyone.

681
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,984
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, everyone. I'm Katy.

682
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,819
Yeah, exactly.

683
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,788
In Portuguese, <i>"baitola."</i>
Yeah, and <i>"bicha."</i>

684
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,748
<i>Bicha.</i>

685
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,958
<i>- Bicha?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

686
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,088
<i>Five minutes talking to Danny's friend</i>

687
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,591
<i>is already feeling better than</i>
<i>a whole afternoon with Jack.</i>

688
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,843
<i>Is it a sign?</i>

689
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,146
No, just sometimes.

690
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,815
Oh my God! Oh my God!

691
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,026
- Oh my God!
- Hello!

692
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,738
Hey, hey, hey! Too much!

693
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,364
Too much! Stop! Stop!

694
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,241
Oh, kill me now!

695
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,242
Hello.

696
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,204
- I'm gonna go jump off a bridge, hold up.
- Damn, girl, please stop.

697
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,502
Here comes the fiancé!

698
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,422
Oh, praise the Lord!

699
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,049
How handsome!

700
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,805
- Cheers to the bride and groom!
- Cheers to the bride and groom!

701
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,853
I think their ring taste is really bad.

702
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,522
So, Danny is Camila's couple.

703
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,068
Never!

704
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,195
Honestly, I'm very nervous.

705
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,571
Why?

706
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,655
You with me?

707
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,240
I don't know.

708
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,535
Because… I think…

709
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,912
It's such a big couch.

710
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,164
They are Brazilian girls.

711
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,379
They have a very strange… strange…

712
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,005
Strange?

713
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,923
…personality.

714
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,883
Me too?

715
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,218
That's why you and me fight?

716
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,470
The thing about Camila… Let me explain.

717
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,471
Strong. Strong.

718
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,389
They are…

719
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,100
This is Brazilian type of personality.

720
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,185
We are stranger,

721
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,938
and crazy, and noisy…

722
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,817
- This is Brazil.
- Mm.

723
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,446
If you don't like it,
just take your stuff and go.

724
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,532
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

725
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,079
What do you think about
our future together?

726
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:16,872
I don't know.

727
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,790
You don't know?

728
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,876
Now, I don't know.

729
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,754
Now? Now you don't know?

730
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,049
Because I just say to you

731
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,595
Brazilian girls have a personality,
a strong personality.

732
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,513
Yeah.

733
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,390
- A strong personality.
- But every time you just say,

734
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,058
"Brazilian, blah, blah, blah, blah."

735
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,560
What do you want?

736
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,400
<i>I just wanted him to meet my friends</i>

737
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,986
<i>and for them to realize what I see in him.</i>

738
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,573
<i>But he just got here</i>
<i>and we're already arguing.</i>

739
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,242
<i>We can barely understand each other.</i>

740
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,871
<i>But, come on, I'm not gonna use</i>
<i>the translator at a party.</i>

741
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,207
I don't like this guy.

742
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,167
Who?

743
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,544
- Luanny's boyfriend.
- Why?

744
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,423
I really want to know more about him,

745
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,509
and I want to hear from him.

746
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,887
But he's not…

747
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,804
What?

748
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,557
He doesn't make good to her?

749
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,809
Really? He's not good to her?

750
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,727
Yeah.

751
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,563
He's not someone that…

752
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,025
You guys talked about this?

753
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,776
Yeah. Um…

754
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,156
There's a few things
that he's been doing about, um…

755
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,534
Wrong things he's been doing.

756
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,828
And she's still there.

757
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,997
She's still there for him.

758
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,209
And she's been suffering a lot.

759
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,460
Yeah.

760
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,048
- Wanna switch seats?
- You can say. Tell me.

761
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,508
I can speak Korean.

762
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,968
- Well.
- Really?

763
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,428
- You speak well.
- Very well.

764
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,765
I was just telling Luanny
that you girls seem to be

765
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,683
just a little bit…

766
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,228
You're just…

767
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,690
kind of straightforward
and you've got strong personalities.

768
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,569
- That's what I was saying.
- Is that how… we seem to you?

769
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,487
Yeah.

770
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,239
Strong personalities?

771
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,866
What is that…

772
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,576
supposed to mean?

773
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,916
- I don't know what the problem is…
- Who's got strong personalities? We do?

774
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,876
- All of us?
- Yes.

775
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,045
- The girls.
- Just the girls?

776
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,798
When you explain that in Korean…

777
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,093
I can understand.

778
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,928
But in English…

779
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,266
- Mm, right.
- It's different, you know? Is…

780
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,392
Mm.

781
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,730
Why do you look upset?

782
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,983
It's just…

783
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,360
I don't like the way she talked to me.

784
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,320
It made me upset.

785
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,780
Why is that?

786
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,407
Wait.

787
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,534
It's because she…

788
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,744
When I said that,

789
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,371
I didn't mean--

790
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,291
- It's hard for you two to communicate.
- Yeah.

791
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,127
I know we have a communication problem.

792
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,753
We do.

793
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,879
Low… Down…

794
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,298
Okay, okay.

795
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,509
I know we have a communication issue.

796
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,888
I don't know why she's saying she's having
second thoughts about our relationship.

797
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,391
Why? Because that's how she's feeling.

798
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,352
She can't do that?
She can't tell you that?

799
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,771
That topic is over.

800
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,651
What a joke.

801
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,447
What happened?

802
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,865
Nothing. What a fucking asshole.

803
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,326
He can go fuck himself.
So fucking annoying.

804
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,286
He was upset for no reason.

805
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,751
Camila, are you okay?

806
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,878
Girl, that guy is so annoying.

807
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:55,215
All he says is "Brazilian women
have a strong personality."

808
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,925
Shit, if you don't want a Brazilian…

809
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:57,885
No!

810
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,638
That's what I'm saying,
you can't communicate.

811
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,015
He meant that in a good way, you know?

812
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,645
But he's so fucking annoying. So annoying.

813
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,023
Don't let her touch his hair.
She likes touching hairs.

814
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

815
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:13,859
Are you okay?

816
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,113
You okay? Really?

817
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,115
No?

818
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
Why?

819
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,161
Don't cry now. Girl, now's not the time.

820
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,663
Let's go downstairs.

821
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,749
Let's go downstairs, come.

822
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,584
Downstairs, come on.

823
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,379
<i>What do we do when</i>
<i>who we thought was our person</i>

824
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,422
<i>turns into a complete stranger?</i>

825
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,263
<i>The butterflies in your stomach go</i>
<i>up to your chest and become anxiety.</i>

826
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,683
<i>Is this how it's all going to end?</i>
