1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,633
<i>Flight 3321 to Seoul--</i>

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,843
Wow…

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,345
The camera is catching my butt, for sure.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>- …fasten your seatbelts…</i>
- Those are comfy, right?

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,558
- Time for <i>My Korean Boyfriend!</i>
- Oh, no way, wow!

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,518
- All good?
- Hey, how are you?

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,146
- Oh, no shoes inside a Korean home.
- Please.

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,399
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND: REACT

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,109
You said it, girl!

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,777
Stop being crazy.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,154
I would be her friend.

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,613
Oh, beautiful!

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,492
- Don't do that!
- You felt the Korean flavor.

14
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,995
Oh, slay! I can't believe it.

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,621
- Okay.
- That was beautiful!

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,748
Do you like K-dramas?

17
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,709
I think they're dope,
I love the Korean universe in general.

18
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,626
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,129
- I'm already in love.
- Ever gone too far to chase a man?

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,508
- Who hasn't, right?
- Who hasn't, honey? I'd go to Mars.

21
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,885
- If I fall in love--
- Exactly.

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,053
But if I'm not in love,

23
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,514
I won't even travel
to the nearest neighborhood to see them.

24
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,559
- He has to be good.
- But if he's good, you can keep going--

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,645
- Then we go to Mars, we go far away.
- Like those girls who ended up in Korea.

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,563
I'm shook!

27
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,815
The thing is, I always root for couples.

28
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,442
Ah…

29
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,110
- I'm super excited.
- Me too.

30
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,196
- You are?
- I am ready to talk a lot.

31
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,822
Would I make a good Korean boyfriend?

32
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,449
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah?

33
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,950
Oh. Have you ever dated a Korean?

34
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,368
No, have you? Have you?

35
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,787
A Korean woman.

36
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,704
No.

37
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,164
- Never?
- Never.

38
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,666
- It must be an experience, right?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,626
We'll see soon enough.

40
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>Attention…</i>

41
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,505
- Let's do this!
- …<i>passengers bound for Seoul.</i>

42
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,423
- Seoul?
- It's far.

43
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,259
- My skincare routine is all Korean.
- So is mine.

44
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>Boarding has now begun</i>
<i>for the </i>My Korean Boyfriend <i>experiment.</i>

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,975
- Oh, slay!
- It's starting, Nicole!

46
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,853
Wow, will she let us
experiment with her boyfriend?

47
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,147
- No, that girl--
- Bring us two!

48
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,524
<i>I want a second date…</i>

49
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,692
- Yeah…
- These are the girls, aren't they?

50
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,903
Oh, poor girl.

51
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,697
Whoa…

52
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,366
That's the kind of thing you should tell.

53
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,826
It takes courage.

54
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,163
Yeah. I don't even have the guts to leave
my neighborhood to go on a date.

55
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,541
- They were already together.
- Check out the looks, so pretty.

56
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,417
Oh, I wish I were them in Korea.

57
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,669
If their wish comes true,

58
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,296
- I'm going to go over there.
- Me too.

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,508
He didn't pick up. Been there, done that.

60
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,635
- Oh my God…
- I'm already nervous.

61
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,928
- Check out the look.
- Wanna stop?

62
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,971
Oops.

63
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,349
Each situation is worse than the next,
they're all awful.

64
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,143
All K-dramas start like this, okay?

65
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,686
They all start badly, then…

66
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,106
They start well,
then get worse, then get better?

67
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,023
Yeah.

68
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,694
Imagine crossing the world,
then calling and not being answered.

69
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,654
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to look like a fool, but damn.</i>

70
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>I came from the other side</i>
<i>of the planet, and then he disappeared.</i>

71
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,200
She doesn't know if he's real.

72
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,120
I think my biggest fear would be
the person not being real.

73
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,038
- Dear Lord.
- Like, being catfished.

74
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,832
- He ghosted her.
- He hasn't answered her.

75
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,834
I already don't like Mari's man.

76
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,752
Man, they talked for a month and a half,

77
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,921
then the guy messaged her a bunch,

78
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,217
and she thought they would meet and
he'd be the ideal man. Come on. And she--

79
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,802
She was ready to get married.

80
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,304
- <i>Sit.</i>
<i>- Million-dollar question.</i>

81
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>Will we experience a K-drama,</i>
<i>do you think?</i>

82
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,933
She's gonna get screwed.

83
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,728
<i>I borrowed money</i>
<i>from my friends so I could travel.</i>

84
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,854
My God…

85
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,732
How long have we known each other?
I can ask you for money, right?

86
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,733
Apparently not.

87
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,527
They don't have Venmo.

88
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,196
What is she doing there?

89
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,156
She nearly ruined her credit
to go meet him.

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,199
For this Korean guy?

91
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,826
These girls are in too deep
with these men.

92
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,621
- Don't have to be psychic to know that.
- So naive. You don't have to be psychic.

93
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:26,998
<i>Luanny!</i>

94
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,586
He looks like a walking therapy bill.

95
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,421
At least he exists.

96
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,384
What's that? Is he proposing?

97
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,428
Is that a ring box?

98
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,638
Is he proposing?

99
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
Oh my God!

100
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,350
In Brazil, this would be crazy.

101
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,894
Proposing that quickly?
Only my brother and Virgínia.

102
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,479
I've never seen this before.

103
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,272
- Let's see what happens.
- Let's see.

104
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,066
Already?

105
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,192
No way! How come?

106
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,781
Oh my God, are those hearing aids?

107
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,033
It's a flash drive?
Oh, they're headphones.

108
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,951
Headphones?

109
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,078
He may be weird but he's cute.

110
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,038
Headphones?

111
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,749
Ahh!

112
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,334
Is he planting a bug on her?

113
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,753
- Look at me, all traumatized.
- Oh, come on.

114
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,215
- That's so cute, translation technology--
- That's what's missing in Brazil.

115
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,883
- Initiative.
- We're missing so many things.

116
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,804
- Oh, come on…
- Hey, worst prank ever, man.

117
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,098
But they say
Korean men are really charming,

118
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,016
- they treat women like queens.
- Yeah?

119
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,814
- He's already touching her, look!
- Already touching her.

120
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,107
This guy is forward.

121
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,526
Whoa, what the heck?

122
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,445
He's petting her? He's doing it like this.

123
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,281
I love a man like that, who takes charge.

124
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,158
Yeah. See, when you least expect it,
love shows up.

125
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm not expecting anything, okay?

126
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,204
Do you have one for me?

127
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,622
Well, at least he's honest.

128
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,832
He's shameless.

129
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,084
- Whoa!
- No way!

130
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,128
<i>No way! It's Jack. Jack is here!</i>

131
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,797
Oh, "Jack."

132
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,676
- <i>Run, girl!</i>
- She's going on a date!

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,761
You can't see anything,
not even at the door.

134
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,976
Man, he's handsome.

135
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,603
- Oh, he's so cute.
- I like him.

136
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,022
- He's hot.
- Handsome, very handsome.

137
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,858
His hair is parted,
just the way she wanted.

138
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,318
Oh, very princely.

139
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,194
- Very princely.
- Oh, he's gorgeous.

140
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,280
Look at those eyebrows, perfectly styled.

141
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>Look how tall he is!</i>

142
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,075
- She's trying to steal her friend's man!
<i>- Damn, he's hot.</i>

143
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,453
<i>She has good taste in men, huh?</i>

144
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,122
He's got a sweet face. But is he really?

145
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,125
- His clothes… he's well-dressed.
- Look, how cute.

146
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,085
He's wearing a suit.

147
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,546
- The other girls want him now. Vultures.
- They're all excited.

148
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,673
- Gossips!
- So good.

149
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,967
And the other girls are all jealous…
Look, look.

150
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,968
Yeah.

151
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,179
How tall is he? Like, 5'9"?

152
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,139
He looks six feet to me.

153
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,390
And 175.

154
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,808
- What?
- And he's a Sagittarius.

155
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,018
They need chemistry, though.

156
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,019
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

157
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,563
Do you think they like Brazilian food?

158
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,774
- Some nice beans, cracklings…
- Yes, honey. Who wouldn't?

159
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,986
You think they can resist a nice <i>feijoada?</i>
You're so funny.

160
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,822
- I'd cook for the boys right away.
- That's how you…

161
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,866
'Cause then they'd get attached
to Brazilian food.

162
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,869
Honey, right away. They can't find
our seasoning anywhere else.

163
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,662
Bitch, I can't cook, what do I do?

164
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,664
- Really, bestie? I'll teach you.
- It's a low blow.

165
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,416
I'm not going to say what I'd do instead.

166
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,003
- It's like he's got a character limit.
- He…

167
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,758
- <i>What else?</i>
<i>- We talked a lot.</i>

168
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,801
<i>We do.</i>

169
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,260
Yeah, he's not going to…

170
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,847
This isn't going anywhere,
the guy is a systematic army man.

171
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,017
- What?
- Cat, cat. I have cat allergy.

172
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,894
- <i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

173
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,938
- I'm a cat person.
- Oh, I like dogs better.

174
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,189
Yikes, this is bad.

175
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,358
Imagine if your boyfriend
didn't like animals.

176
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,943
- You have a huge farm.
- It'd be a mess.

177
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,279
I wouldn't trade my animals for some guy.

178
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,073
- You'd have to be crazy.
- I think--

179
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,158
You have so many.
Goats, chickens, everything.

180
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,077
Maybe he'd get used to it
little by little.

181
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,329
Wouldn't you get rid of some of them?

182
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,290
No, there's plenty of men out there.
My animals are mine.

183
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,960
God forbid. My little animals.
I only have one of each.

184
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,211
<i>I'm a party girl.</i>

185
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,964
<i>- Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Yeah.</i>
<i>- I like going out and drinking.</i>

186
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,173
I would be her friend.

187
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>A person who…</i>

188
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,093
See?

189
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
- There's the conflict!
- He doesn't like going out.

190
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,638
- Oh man.
- Oh no.

191
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,890
They have nothing in common, my God.

192
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,976
She's slowly withering, the poor thing.

193
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,020
I really, you know, recently care
about health more.

194
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,481
But then, the guys
that are so straight-laced

195
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,442
are the ones you want the most, you know?

196
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,652
- Speak for yourself.
- To lead him astray.

197
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,196
- Oh, to corrupt him.
- You know? Yeah.

198
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,783
<i>Your family doesn't know</i>
<i>that I have a daughter.</i>

199
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,618
Ee… Tension.

200
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,203
Oh, honey!

201
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,788
<i>You're 35 years old.</i>

202
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,583
- Oh, damn!
- Thirty-five years old?

203
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,043
Thirty-five? With that skin?

204
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,087
Oh, I want to go to Korea.

205
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,341
Oh, an old man. Just kidding.

206
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,302
Well, he's experienced, right?

207
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,720
I don't trust that smile.

208
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,181
<i>If we stay together,</i>

209
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,766
<i>I'm not going to…</i>

210
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,854
<i>hide anything from you.</i>

211
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,814
Girl, that man is a liar.

212
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,650
Yeah, he looks like a scoundrel.

213
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,779
<i>He makes a lot of bad investments,</i>
<i>and that makes things really hard for us.</i>

214
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, so he's a big spender, is that it?

215
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,326
- Do you trust him?
- No. No.

216
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,163
I mean, what's he spending money on?
Headphones?

217
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,500
- The headphones are going to win her over.
- But since it started translating,

218
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,335
she's only gotten more stressed out.

219
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,963
Do you see any positives?

220
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,007
- I haven't seen any.
- Neither have I.

221
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,176
<i>There's a saying</i>
<i>that I think suits you guys.</i>

222
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,844
<i>It says, "I'm not perfect,</i>

223
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,848
<i>but flowers may grow even</i>
<i>between the cracks in the stones."</i>

224
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,600
- Wow.
- She came like…

225
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,062
- She really… She turned it around.
- Wow!

226
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,898
When I don't know what to say,
I just start dropping quotes, you know?

227
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,566
- Like…
- My God!

228
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,902
"Even stone wears away
under constant dripping."

229
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:55,368
<i>You have to wear properly to meet my mom.</i>

230
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,745
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

231
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,289
- What? Oh, come on!
- Seriously?

232
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,249
- My God!
- Wow, man!

233
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,167
Did I hear that correctly?

234
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,752
- Wow…
- No.

235
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,295
I'm already annoyed. No.

236
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,714
No Korean man
is going to tell me how to dress.

237
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,924
Now I'm pissed off.

238
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,635
- Oh, I don't like that boy.
- That man got on my nerves.

239
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,804
I can't believe
they're all going to annoy me.

240
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,597
No!

241
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,349
That's a guy who wants to marry his mom.

242
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,476
Do I even want to meet your mom?

243
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,936
Stay with your mom, then.

244
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>Please grant me patience.</i>

245
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,690
- Look at him.
- Look.

246
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,025
- She touched him.
- I think he's cute.

247
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,320
He's in love. A kiss?

248
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,866
He's very different.

249
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,826
On their first--

250
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,744
He just said, "Let's"?

251
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,706
- Oh, wow.
- She got a taste of Korea!

252
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
- Did they kiss?
- They did!

253
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,586
<i>That's crazy,</i>
<i>the internet is no-mans land.</i>

254
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,464
What now?

255
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,301
- She's gorgeous, isn't she?
- Wow, the hair.

256
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,261
- Are those extensions?
- Definitely.

257
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,430
Is she being exalted now?

258
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,723
He does have his flaws.

259
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,560
He said he was going to pick her up at
the airport when she arrived from Brazil,

260
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,103
- but he didn't--
- That's awful.

261
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,229
I think that's awful.

262
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,731
I'm anxious.

263
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,107
Oh my God.

264
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,109
- Turn around in slow motion.
- Wow.

265
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,069
- <i>Mari.</i>
- He showed up!

266
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,447
And we were judging him!

267
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,700
She had to go down all those steps?
Oh, how tiresome.

268
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,578
<i>Mari.</i>

269
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,041
How can she turn around with
such a big smile after he stood her up?

270
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,375
- But he's handsome.
- Gorgeous.

271
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,377
- I'd be furious.
- No, he could have his reasons.

272
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
- They're all idiots!
- Look, no.

273
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,174
Something could have happened.
An accident, you know, on the day.

274
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,300
His phone could have died.

275
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,136
Unless he lost both hands in the accident,
he could have answered.

276
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,220
He was mugged.

277
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,057
<i>I came here to surprise… Whoa, whoa!</i>

278
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,102
- Oh, she's head over heels.
- Yeah, Mari is totally in love.

279
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>He left me waiting at the airport</i>
<i>and thinks a flower will fix it?</i>

280
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,067
<i>It's from my heart, that's why.</i>

281
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>Here.</i>

282
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,195
It actually does.

283
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,822
- A single rose?
- No, then he shows up, gives her a rose…

284
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,407
Guys! Guys!

285
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,452
He probably looked better on Instagram

286
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,703
- than in person.
- You think so?

287
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,997
- Know when you start acting really silly?
- Yeah.

288
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,794
Like, he says something,
and she's like, "Oh, stop! Stop it!"

289
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,798
<i>I was waiting here by myself</i>
<i>and I really thought no one was coming.</i>

290
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,927
<i>No, of course I was going to come.</i>
<i>Because you came to Korea to see…</i>

291
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>me, I hope, right?</i>

292
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,766
- They take so long to kiss, right?
- They do, I would've kissed him already.

293
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,727
- If he were Brazilian…
- She was dying to kiss him, you know?

294
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,771
- Can't she?
- <i>But let's take it slow.</i>

295
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,981
- Man, take it easy?
<i>- Things are different here in Korea.</i>

296
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,525
- It's different there.
- Okay, fine.

297
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>- I'm worried of touching you.</i>
<i>- No, no.</i>

298
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,823
Come on, give him a little kiss.

299
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
- What a stiff hug.
- Honey, he left her hanging.

300
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,035
That's how I hug my uncles.

301
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,371
She's respecting his time too, you know?

302
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,831
- If she… yeah.
- If we were to act

303
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,041
- like we do here in Brazil…
- They run away, right?

304
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,251
- they get scared.
- They would.

305
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,420
Even I get a little scared sometimes.

306
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,507
- <i>Is it?</i>
<i>- Of course it is.</i>

307
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,136
This girl needs to see a therapist.
She's not ready for a boyfriend.

308
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,178
Oh my God.

309
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,930
<i>He treats me like a princess.</i>

310
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,559
<i>He doesn't curse at me,</i>
<i>he doesn't humiliate me, you know?</i>

311
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,270
"How's your girlfriend?"
"Good, she didn't insult me today."

312
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,688
"She didn't insult me."

313
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,192
- Poor thing. She's used to toxic people.
- Oh my God!

314
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,069
<i>Can you help me translate this?</i>

315
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,030
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

316
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,951
- Oh my God.
- Wow.

317
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>"Luanny, the day we meet again,</i>

318
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,208
<i>I want to confess something</i>
<i>you didn't know."</i>

319
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,418
- What?
- He was engaged?

320
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,170
- He lived with someone?
- I thought so too.

321
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,171
Ah…

322
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,297
My God, what could it be?

323
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,050
I think he's gonna tell her
that he's actually 15, not 35.

324
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,093
With that skin, no doubt!

325
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,054
<i>He's going to propose to me.</i>

326
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,182
Oh, she's so naive, the poor thing.

327
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,559
<i>Eat very carefully,</i>
<i>maybe the ring is in there.</i>

328
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,312
Guys, that's not how it works.

329
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,315
She thinks the ring is in the lettuce!

330
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,274
<i>No, it's not…</i>

331
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,067
- No way, guys.
- No, man.

332
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>Oh my God, now what?</i>

333
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,490
<i>A letter?</i>

334
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,910
It's a gift card from
a store he likes, you know?

335
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,411
I'm expecting too much.

336
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,288
Ahh! Come on!

337
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,126
Look how beautiful it is
behind them, Nicole!

338
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,253
Is the proposal coming?

339
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,301
Oh, wow!

340
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,512
Oh, that's wonderful!

341
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,846
The best couple.

342
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,556
Nice. Nice.

343
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,642
- That's great!
- She's gonna hurt her knee!

344
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,352
Oh, that's goals.

345
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,814
- Aw, that was cute, man.
- I thought it was cute, really sweet.

346
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,235
She threw herself at him,
she's got snot in her nose and everything!

347
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,655
- The trip is already worth it.
- It was so worth it.

348
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,907
She came back
with a husband as a souvenir.

349
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,034
Her friend is going to lose it
back at the house.

350
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,744
She will, she'll be very envious for sure.

351
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,288
Definitely, and soon
they'll be in a fight.

352
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,998
<i>I need to confess.</i>

353
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,875
- He's going to confess.
- Yeah.

354
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,710
- Oh dear…
- My God.

355
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,170
What do you guys think it is?

356
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,172
- I don't even wanna look.
- My God in heaven!

357
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>You didn't cheat, right?</i>

358
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,219
"You didn't cheat, did you?
Oh, you were arrested?"

359
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,471
She's Brazilian, she's straight-forward.

360
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,473
- He's so shameless.
- If he lies to his mother,

361
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,101
- think he wouldn't lie to that blonde?
- Said he paid for the trip.

362
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>I already have a daughter,</i>
<i>I can't take care of a grown man too.</i>

363
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,398
Exactly.

364
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,899
- Look at the difference.
- Oh man…

365
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,442
- Yeah.
- The inequality.

366
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,362
- A proposal at a fancy restaurant…
- No comparison, right, Gabi?

367
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,864
They're not even in a nice place,

368
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,448
he's telling her about his trauma

369
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,908
- on the street.
- On foot!

370
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,160
- Just-just end it, just end it all, right?
- On foot!

371
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,996
Manchild.

372
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,415
- I'm gonna grab some candy.
- Go ahead.

373
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,625
Grab some for us.

374
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,587
I've never had Korean candy.

375
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,714
Me neither. Damn it, it won't open.

376
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,513
Oh my God, man.

377
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,600
What is this thing?

378
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,192
It gets sweeter later.

379
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,110
When?

380
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,653
Just give it a few sucks.

381
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,655
It will get sweet, you'll see.

382
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,993
<i>Katy's screwed.</i>

383
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,002
<i>What a great start.</i>
<i>He went and sat way the hell over there.</i>

384
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,004
<i>- Perfect.</i>
- No way, he sat away from her?

385
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,797
He sat on the other side… He sat next to--

386
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,883
- What the hell, man?
- What are you doing?

387
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,510
- Oy.
- I told you, it's because of the cats.

388
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,721
But hitting on her
in front of the dude is dirty.

389
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,847
Look, he's just staring.

390
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,767
<i>I think their ring is very ugly.</i>

391
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,310
<i>So, Danny…</i>

392
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,771
Wow, what a jerk!

393
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,732
Honey, you can't even buy candy!

394
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,526
- Criticizing the ring, so trashy!
- Criticizing someone else's ring!

395
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,945
Oh, he's so jealous!

396
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,530
- The fights are already starting.
- Did you feel the vibe shift?

397
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,908
When he got there,
I feel like the vibe just died,

398
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,284
the whole place.

399
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,535
Doesn't know when to shut up,

400
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,788
- doesn't know when to talk.
- Wow, she does not give in.

401
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
<i>I think…</i>

402
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,126
<i>they are… Brazilian girls…</i>

403
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>have very strange…</i>

404
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,009
<i>- Strange?</i>
<i>- …personalities.</i>

405
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,180
Man, who is this guy?

406
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,851
- For God's sake.
- Never met a guy like that.

407
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,061
- Jesus Christ.
- He's impossible.

408
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
Yeah, he's something else.

409
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,647
Goddamn.

410
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,816
<i>Girl, that guy is so annoying.</i>

411
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,528
She said it! Camila said
what we're all thinking.

412
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,155
- So fucking annoying, that's right.
- She said it.

413
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,658
- I want to go there and shake her.
- Me too.

414
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,743
Can't she just, like, find another guy?

415
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,161
Poor thing.

416
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,249
It's a temple, right?

417
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,459
- Look, how beautiful!
- "Boochon Hakon"? Is that it?

418
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,838
Don't try, babe. Don't even try, Nicole.

419
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,382
Just leave it, okay?

420
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,473
<i>Oh my God! I'm speechless.</i>

421
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,144
- Oh, it's her man, that's amazing!
- I'm gagged!

422
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,438
This man is full of surprises.

423
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,232
- Look, they have matching outfits!
- So sweet!

424
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,568
- He's scoring a lot of points.
- He's so cool.

425
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,069
I'm already in love with him.

426
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,904
He proposed to her, yeah.

427
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,740
Oh, how beautiful!

428
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,492
Yeah, they really,
like, they stand out, right?

429
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,494
- They're working.
- This couple is working. They are--

430
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,121
He acts with love.

431
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,956
First episode and they're already engaged.

432
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,916
And they don't have
financial problems, right?

433
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,044
- Everything is fine.
- And he'll come to Brazil.

434
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,295
If you're about to cry--

435
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
Girl, just grab a tissue.

436
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,922
Grab a tissue.

437
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,216
Thanks. I think you grabbed it wrong…

438
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,596
You're supposed to pull it here.

439
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,638
Oh dear.

440
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,931
Good thing I didn't cry.

441
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,103
She's going to fall in love,

442
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,438
- and he'll be jumping.
- She will.

443
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,898
Look at his size.

444
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,734
- He's so fit, what a stud!
- Look at his arms!

445
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,152
Oh wow!

446
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,655
- Girl, he's a Korean dreamboat.
- I want one like that!

447
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,327
- Wow, look at him working out, whoa!
- Nicole! Take me there, look at his legs!

448
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,079
It's a different kind of date, right?

449
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,580
- Taking her to work out.
- Look, let him…

450
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,541
Oh, that's clever.
They're gonna work out and…

451
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,585
If they don't have anything to talk about…
Break the ice.

452
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,046
- …they can just jump rope.
- Yeah, they'll have an activity.

453
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,843
<i>Are you like a morning person,</i>
<i>more than… more than night?</i>

454
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,138
<i>No, I'm a night person.</i>
<i>I like going out at night, drinking.</i>

455
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,475
This girl must be going crazy,
she can't get a kiss!

456
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,519
- Yeah, yeah, oh! Wow.
- She must be delirious.

457
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,063
- I'm in agony here!
- She must be feverish by now.

458
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,689
- Just the two of them…
- She doesn't touch him,

459
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,150
she doesn't do anything,
and he's all ripped.

460
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,277
He has the charisma of a doorknob, right?

461
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,321
- Totally.
- He doesn't laugh at anything.

462
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,697
They're polar opposites.

463
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,367
I think it's more of a friendship
than a relationship, huh?

464
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,203
So far, they have
absolutely nothing in common.

465
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,788
Yes, they do. They both breathe.

466
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:49,128
It's not like there's a huge problem
or something, like, "Wow!"

467
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,838
But they're just too different, you know?

468
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,340
- They don't have a connection.
- Too different.

469
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,634
I wouldn't even be his friend. So meh.

470
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,052
He has nothing to talk about.

471
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,762
So bland,
he doesn't even know how to talk.

472
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,056
- He doesn't talk.
- I'd rather talk to a wall.

473
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,685
<i>I want to be your friend,</i>
<i>like, keep as friends.</i>

474
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,812
<i>- Mm-hmm. Yeah, me too.</i>
<i>- Okay? Yes.</i>

475
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,647
They didn't work out.

476
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,733
Yeah, but at least
it was sort of clear, right?

477
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,486
- It was an end, like, she was clear.
- They have nothing in common.

478
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,906
- Also, he didn't make anything up.
- She's a night person, he's a day person.

479
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,534
Yeah, and he didn't make up any excuses.

480
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,120
I think they're just not very compatible.

481
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,746
- Not at all.
- He was okay with it,

482
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,541
- that they're better off as friends.
- They're too different.

483
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,755
- <i>Welcome to…</i>
- <i>Wow, it's so nice.</i>

484
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,049
- <i>…this bar.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

485
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,136
<i>Now I have a K-drama to call my own.</i>

486
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,679
She's living it, isn't she?

487
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,265
- She's living in her own show.
- Her own K-drama. She's living it.

488
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,810
- <i>Is it allowed to hold…</i>
- <i>It's allowed to hold hands.</i>

489
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,936
- Ahh!
- Your hand.

490
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,021
What's this?

491
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,317
I'm shaking. I'm getting anxious.
I'm sweating, look.

492
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,568
Damn!

493
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,487
- Girl, Koreans are so respectful!
- So cute!

494
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,656
Wow, if we took this guy to a funk party,

495
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,700
- he would die.
- Wow!

496
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,993
But she's looking so smitten.

497
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,871
Like, "Dude, just kiss me already!
Take some action!"

498
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,040
But he's also kind of smitten.

499
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,375
The pace really is different there,
isn't it?

500
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,128
Look at that, how cute,
he asked if he could hold her hand,

501
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,007
and here people are like,
"Oh, do you spit or swallow?" You know?

502
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,258
Oh my God, dude!

503
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,885
- They're so polite.
- They are.

504
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,637
- One of the things I admire…
- That's great.

505
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,263
…the most about them, about their culture.

506
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,598
- Quite charming.
- I think so too.

507
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,392
Here, we rush things… and then,
there's nothing left to happen.

508
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,394
- No… yeah.
- Here, it's a process.

509
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,648
- They prolong the process of passion.
- Yeah, you take it slow,

510
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,441
you talk… It becomes more intense

511
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,276
- and long-lasting.
- Let me ask you a question.

512
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,321
Today they held hands.
To kiss, it'll take two months.

513
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,572
What if the kiss is bad?

514
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,617
Then you find a way, you do other things.

515
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,952
Do you think they'll kiss now?

516
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,622
- Could it happen?
- No, no. It's only the second date.

517
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,541
<i>We will hug each other</i>
<i>and we're gonna, like…</i>

518
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,501
<i>- Mwah.</i>
<i>- Oh my--</i>

519
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>…kiss the cheek.</i>

520
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,004
- What?
- Called it!

521
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,632
- She's already jumping on him.
- I don't think he liked it.

522
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,633
He pulled away.

523
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,468
- Wow, girl!
- Never got to do that.

524
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,137
- On the cheek, on the mouth--
- Hey, watch it. Easy there.

525
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,181
Take it easy.

526
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,975
He was shocked
when she kissed him on the cheek.

527
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,476
He was super shocked.

528
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,354
- Imagine when they go to bed.
- Imagine he came to Brazil as a tourist.

529
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,605
Like, "Hey, how are you?"

530
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,983
He'll get kissed on the cheek,
like, 15 times…

531
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,359
- 15 little kisses.
- He'll go crazy.

532
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,319
- They'll put their hand around his waist.
- Right.

533
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,738
- In Korea, it's not very common to, like--
- Kissing?

534
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,948
No, not just kissing.

535
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,574
- Out of the blue…
- Hugging too.

536
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,785
…kissing on the cheek
on the second date, you know?

537
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,995
So, it kind of startles them.

538
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,830
He's so embarrassed!

539
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,625
<i>You're not going to be like, "Ooh."</i>
<i>You're going to be like…</i>

540
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,294
<i>Yeah, that's normal in Brazil.</i>

541
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,586
<i>Let's do it again, I guess.</i>

542
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,839
Mr. Korean liked it!

543
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,049
- He's a fast learner!
- He likes it!

544
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,303
- Mr. Korean likes it!
- Dirty boy!

545
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,429
Look, he likes it.

546
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,141
- He's a cutie. "Oh, stop it!"
- He's like, "Stop with these sexy games!"

547
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,061
<i>- Ppoppo!</i>
- Not cool, not cool!

548
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,896
She's asking for it.

549
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,232
He's loosening up a little bit.

550
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,361
<i>How is he going to react</i>
<i>to a big kiss on the lips? I'm ready.</i>

551
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,821
That came out wrong.

552
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,739
Saying…

553
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,949
Imagine a butt on his mouth!

554
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,078
I thought he was using slang
for "booty", like "butt."

555
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,497
- Let's take it easy, Nicole.
<i>- Ppoppo.</i>

556
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,999
This is not that kind of show.

557
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,834
<i>Is there something specific…</i>

558
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,587
She already wants to move on
to the next phase!

559
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,548
What would it be?
Is she wearing her lingerie?

560
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,924
Imagine wearing new panties

561
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,509
- and never getting to use them.
- Never!

562
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,762
- We're back to-to Luanny.
- Luanny.

563
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,221
Poor thing.

564
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,641
She's making a list of the pros and cons.

565
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,185
<i>He's romantic.</i>

566
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,812
- Is he? Is he, though?
- Romantic?

567
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,649
Oh, guys, she's delusional.
Aw, I feel sorry for her.

568
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,320
- Grab your purse and go with your friends!
- You're gonna drink soju and sing karaoke.

569
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,114
Girl, for God's sake, stop being crazy.

570
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,075
She went and fell in love
with the wrong person.

571
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,618
Girl, honestly…

572
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,120
- I've been there.
- Yeah, who hasn't, am I right?

573
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,081
But when I feel like it's over, I end it,

574
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,624
- I don't keep dragging it out.
- Yeah.

575
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,502
- I wanna hear what his excuse is today.
- She has to be straight with him.

576
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,961
Don't keep dragging it out.

577
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,214
- He should be wearing…
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

578
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,173
He didn't even say hi.

579
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,925
He just went in, didn't even kiss her…

580
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,676
- He didn't even look her in the eye.
- Just…

581
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,095
- Arms like this.
- Look.

582
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,639
- Oh, he's mad.
- He didn't even say hi to her.

583
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,725
- Oh, you mad, baby?
- Seriously, guys…

584
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,644
Now is the time
for her to break up with him.

585
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:20,232
These girls are around 27, 28 years old?

586
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,318
In astrology, there's something
called the Saturn return.

587
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,405
When you're around that age,
you're suddenly dying to get married.

588
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,156
And when does Saturn leave?

589
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,992
- At 27 or eight, Saturn leaves--
- And what about the return?

590
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,745
No, it starts and returns
between those ages.

591
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,789
- Oh, then I guess I'm 28.
- You are?

592
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,748
Yeah.

593
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,333
Why, are you…

594
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,045
Dying to get married.
I must be about 28 years old.

595
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,881
Your Saturn must be really… Either that,

596
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,634
- or your Venus is well-aspected.
- Could be.

597
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,929
<i>I gotta be very honest with you.</i>

598
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,556
What is it today?

599
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,975
Could it be just that he needs money?

600
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,226
I think it's more than that.

601
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,853
<i>How come you're upset?</i>

602
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,646
- Trying how?
- What did he even do?

603
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
<i>But you stress me out every day.</i>

604
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,986
- Wow, she's going to feel so guilty, man.
- Oh, he plays games, like…

605
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,155
Emotional blackmail.

606
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,614
I stressed you out?

607
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,575
You cheated on me, you know that?

608
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,577
- We didn't know that!
- Cheated?

609
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,121
Bombshell! The Turkish girl, remember?

610
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,914
Oh, my goodness.

611
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,040
Bombshell!

612
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,876
Turkish girl?

613
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,920
- What a scoundrel he is!
- Stop being crazy, girl! Just end it!

614
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,881
- No, this guy is bad news.
- Totally.

615
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
Someone has to tell her. They have to.

616
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,884
Please, for God's sake!

617
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,219
Oh, then it's all wrong, man.

618
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,388
- Oh, it's over.
- Poor girl! What is she doing in Korea?

619
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,890
Manchild!

620
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,891
Immature.

621
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,602
- My God, what a scandal!
- That's crazy!

622
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,937
- She never told us that!
- Oh my God, yeah!

623
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,899
Man, he cheated on her!
With the Turkish girl!

624
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,109
But how'd he get the money
to get this Turkish girl too?

625
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,694
- Yeah, if he doesn't have money?
- Yeah!

626
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,323
- I am shook--
- Man, that Korean guy is naughty.

627
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,617
Oh my God! I'll go get her
on my bike, for God's sake.

628
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,911
Bro, I can forgive cheating,
but don't get back together.

629
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,287
If you cheat, you're on your own.

630
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,873
Can you imagine leaving Brazil…
I'm speechless.

631
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,750
- …to go suffer in Korea?
- Wow!

632
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,793
- No.
- To get cheated on in Korea?

633
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,921
- Wow.
- How do you say "cheating" in Korean?

634
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,173
- I don't even know, I'm shook.
- Wow, my friend.

635
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,053
- So he cheated on her?
- I cannot believe he wants to dump her.

636
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,095
It's over? Ahh!

637
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,348
- Oh my God.
- How come?

638
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
- Hang on, my love.
- Girl…

639
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,228
- Oh no, I'm curious. Where's the next one?
- Netflix, I want to know more.

640
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,439
Where's that Turkish girl?
I want to have a word with her too!
