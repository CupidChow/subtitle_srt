00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>Good evening, Seoul!</i>

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,683
<i>The temperature is</i>
<i>17 degrees with clear skies.</i>

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,934
<i>Enjoy the day.</i>

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,983
- Oh, how pretty!
- That one!

5
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,986
Wow!

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,363
Are you ready to make your wishes?

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
- I am!
- I'm so ready!

8
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,621
<i>I want a second date</i>
<i>as special as the first one.</i>

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>His mother needs to know</i>
<i>I have a daughter.</i>

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>Should I really have returned to Korea?</i>

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>I really wanna leave here married.</i>

12
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,220
<i>Does that guy even exist?</i>

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>I don't want to go through</i>
<i>the same thing again.</i>

14
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,563
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

15
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,154
THE DAY BEFORE

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,089
So, babe? Did you talk to him?

17
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,381
It's ringing.

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,927
- Do you think he'll come?
- I don't know.

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,930
- Come with us by train then.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,309
Let's go back inside.

21
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,688
<i>This is Mari.</i>

22
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>This is after talking to this guy</i>
<i>on the internet for a year,</i>

23
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,445
<i>30 hours of flight and</i>
<i>a lot of expectations.</i>

24
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>He didn't show up.</i>

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>Well, let's be honest,</i>
<i>this happens even in the best K-dramas.</i>

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,290
<i>But the difference is that</i>
<i>this is real life, you know?</i>

27
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,301
Oh, we're here!

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>- It's our time, let's celebrate now</i>
- Girls, look at the tower!

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,597
There!

30
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,058
<i>Let's celebrate now</i>

31
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,730
I want to live here!

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>All night, all night</i>
<i>With my best friends, party, fiesta</i>

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,571
<i>It's our time</i>
<i>Let's celebrate now</i>

34
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>We are five Brazilian women</i>
<i>with five love stories in Korea.</i>

35
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>We have a month in Seoul</i>
<i>to solve our issues of the heart.</i>

36
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,333
<i>And also have fun, right?</i>
<i>'Cause you can't live on drama alone.</i>

37
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,793
Ahh!

38
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,545
Girl, hold on, hold on! Your shoes.

39
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,588
Take off your shoes.

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,464
- Let's take them off.
- That's wild.

41
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,465
We have to.

42
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,800
- It's the culture.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,179
We're going to stay in this
perfect place for a month.

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,097
I could definitely live here.

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,307
Would you guys?

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,225
- Sit here.
- That's the million-dollar question.

47
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,686
- We have to gossip.
- Will we experience a K-drama?

48
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,731
Girl, I'm already living a K-drama, okay?

49
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>My name is Katy, and I swear on my cats</i>
<i>that I'm living a real K-drama.</i>

50
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:21,201
I… The-the-the last time I came here,
I went to Busan, right?

51
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,370
On the way back,
on the train, I went to the bathroom.

52
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,039
When I came out of the bathroom,

53
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,627
there was this guy there all dressed
in army green in a military uniform.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,420
Huge, like this.

55
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,671
- Waiting for me.
- No way!

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,090
- That only happens in K-dramas.
- Yup.

57
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,508
Waiting for me outside.

58
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,012
And then he started talking to me,
we exchanged numbers.

59
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,224
- And we're still talking to this day.
- So it's already real life.

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,559
- And when was that?
- Since 2023.

61
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,520
- Aren't you going to meet?
- We are, obviously.

62
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,314
- Anytime now.
- Yeah!

63
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,527
I'm gonna go live in the train, you guys.
I'll stay on 24 hours a day,

64
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,281
sitting, waiting all week for someone
to bring me a bouquet of flowers.

65
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,616
Can I say what I'm iffy about?

66
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,034
Of course.

67
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,247
I'm afraid that I'm either going
to love him even more than I do now,

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,624
or I'm going to fall out of love.

69
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,251
With your current boyfriend?

70
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,169
- Why?
- I don't know.

71
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
I'm scared.

72
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,509
<i>And this is Luanny.</i>

73
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>She fell in love with</i>
<i>the most complicated guy in Korea.</i>

74
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>They met through an app.</i>

75
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,517
<i>Well, I think</i>
<i>she should tell this story herself.</i>

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,102
Where did you meet him?

77
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,478
- On an app.
- There?

78
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,771
- Yup.
- So you…

79
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,066
As soon as we started talking,
he said I was the ideal girl for him,

80
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,193
because our personalities were the same.

81
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,445
But I made it very clear
that I have a daughter.

82
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,656
So if you're not okay with that,
go on with your life.

83
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,157
I'll go on with mine, and that's it.

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,993
When he asked to call me to see her,

85
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,578
he said he felt
as if she were his daughter.

86
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,789
- Those things got to me.
- Think he's being honest?

87
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,166
- I think that's a lie. No?
- No, I don't think so.

88
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,963
Those things moved me.

89
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,172
And then,

90
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,801
like, he started saying,
"I'll send you the money I make,

91
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,594
and you'll manage it."

92
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,014
And then I waited
for him to come to Brazil.

93
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,390
December comes, and he's like,

94
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,810
"I'm not going to be able to come.
I don't have the money."

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,981
"Borrow money from your friends
and pay for the ticket here,

96
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,859
and I'll pay you back on December 25th."

97
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,861
So I borrowed money from my friends

98
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,238
- so I could travel. I swear.
- You're kidding me!

99
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,115
- Girl, that's crazy!
- It was totally crazy.

100
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,993
And how long had you guys been… talking?

101
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,455
Umm… I think a…
a month and a half, two months.

102
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,332
That was our biggest source of stress.

103
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,917
He would tell me one thing,
and when the day came,

104
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,920
he would change everything.
He would change the entire plan I made.

105
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,215
- But how many times has he done that?
- Oh, many times.

106
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,969
The thing is, I love him.
I love him so much.

107
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,513
But I'm afraid he'll mess me up…

108
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,723
- Yeah.
- He already has.

109
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,559
You're already in debt
because of this relationship.

110
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,395
It's up to you, girl,
but let me give you some honest advice.

111
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,563
Yes, please tell her.

112
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,065
I would get out.

113
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,706
<i>Look what happened to Luanny.</i>

114
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,667
<i>Danny might be one of those.</i>

115
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,630
<i>I don't wanna look like a fool, but damn,</i>
<i>I came from the other side of the planet,</i>

116
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>and then he disappeared.</i>

117
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,604
<i>I'm not available at the moment.</i>

118
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,482
<i>Please leave a message with your name</i>
<i>and number, and I'll call you back.</i>

119
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,781
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

120
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,241
I wonder where we're going today.

121
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:53,287
I think, like, when we… Because we left
the airport and came straight home,

122
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,748
I think that, you know,

123
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,167
at night, if we decide to do something…

124
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,252
…we…

125
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,673
We'll get to know the city better.
We'll see, like…

126
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,883
Yeah, then we can see
if we'll want to go out.

127
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,846
The boy is texting me.

128
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,681
- Your man? No way!
- Yeah. My guy.

129
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,765
- I swear!
- What'd he say?

130
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,058
Um, he said,

131
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,936
''Hello, Katy, this is Jack,
how are you doing?" Uh…

132
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,189
"Let's meet today. I'll pick you up,
if you're fine with that."

133
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm shook!

134
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,401
Like a date?

135
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,695
Mm-hmm. Probably.

136
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,988
Hey!

137
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,783
Say hi, "Hi! How are you? I miss you!"

138
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,868
I'm already here!

139
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,376
Jack is on his way to pick me up,
but what did you want to talk about?

140
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,128
That stuff, you know…

141
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,006
That makes me a little upset.

142
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,883
- Oh, let's talk about it. Yeah.
- I'm not comf…

143
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,343
And also see
what the future holds for us, right?

144
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,680
Because we made so many plans,
but never made any of them happen.

145
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,849
So you guys really have to talk

146
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,310
and see if that's what
you guys really want.

147
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,769
And what about yours?

148
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
He's so nice, girl. He's a sweetheart.

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,399
I don't understand
how you haven't kissed him yet.

150
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,319
This is not Brazil, is it?

151
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,864
Are you going to, if you have the chance?

152
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,618
No, I'm gonna wait to do that.
You have to get to know the person.

153
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,329
I'm not like that,
I don't kiss the night away.

154
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,663
Will the chemistry be there?

155
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,873
I hope so.

156
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,625
Will it? Will it?

157
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,335
- You'll tell me everything?
- Everything.

158
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,128
- And you will too, okay?
- I will.

159
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,756
- I hope we don't go back on bad terms.
- What's going on?

160
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,009
- Look at her!
- Wow! Gorgeous!

161
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,385
Well, thank you very much!

162
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,888
Oh, my God!

163
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,264
Whoa!

164
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,558
No way! No way!

165
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,477
It's Jack. Jack is here.

166
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
Help!

167
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,524
Come!

168
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,108
Let's gossip.

169
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,944
Run, girl!

170
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,488
You can't see anything,
not even at the door.

171
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,824
- You can't see anything.
- Where is she?

172
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,288
Girls, she's on her way.

173
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh, I'm so nervous.
I'm so nervous for her.

174
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,175
Wow, I'd have run away already.

175
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,768
- I'm shocked!
- Wow, what a hottie!

176
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,689
Look how tall he is!

177
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,274
Damn, he's hot.

178
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,071
How are you?

179
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,990
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

180
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,158
- How are you? Yeah.
- Give me a hug.

181
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,578
Damn, you guys,
is he wearing a suit? Is he?

182
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,496
I want to see her face.

183
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,873
She has good taste in men, huh?

184
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,501
White shirt, he's fancy, huh?
He's dressed up.

185
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,919
He's wearing a suit.

186
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,045
No way!

187
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,547
- No way!
- He's fancy.

188
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,299
- A suit?
- Yeah, he's at the door.

189
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,891
I'm shook, I can't believe it.

190
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,935
- He's hot. Oh my God!
- Will they leave holding hands?

191
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,187
- Wow.
- Let's watch them leave.

192
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,274
- No, I think it's too soon.
- No.

193
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,817
So what if it's too soon?

194
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,943
To hold hands?

195
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,654
- They'll hold hands on the first date.
- What do you mean?

196
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,655
Holding hands?

197
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,615
- Yeah.
- You can't.

198
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,866
- Why not?
- No, not yet.

199
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,410
- It's too soon.
- I do. I get excited right away.

200
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,180
This is so beautiful.

201
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,890
- Right?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,476
- I'm glad to be here, actually.
- Yeah?

203
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,811
Yeah, to, like, get to know you better.

204
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,938
- Mm-hmm.
- Spend some time together.

205
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,856
Yeah, me too.

206
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,525
- Yeah, see the cherry blossoms.
- Right.

207
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,780
Cherry blossom is basically,
um, for only one week.

208
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,074
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, basically, in Korea.

209
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,244
- So I'm, like, the luckiest person ever?
- Yeah, you're kind of lucky.

210
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,290
Is there cherry blossom even in Brazil?
No.

212
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,833
- No? Really?
- No, not really.

213
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,918
- No.
- Oh.

214
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,629
And this is, like,
one of my favorite flowers ever.

215
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

216
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,757
So is that your first time, or…

217
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,300
It's my first time seeing it.

218
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,469
- Really?
- Yes, yeah. So I'm really excited.

219
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,971
- Like, very emotional about it, you know.
- Really?

220
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,767
- It's actually, um…
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,895
…been quite a long time
not to see each other, right?

222
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,731
- Yeah, I think more than a year.
- Also not to talk to each other.

223
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,566
- Maybe, yeah. Probably.
- Yeah.

224
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,735
And then I've been super busy…

225
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,612
- Mm-hmm.
- …you've been in the military.

226
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,030
- That's right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

227
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,866
This looks so beautiful.

228
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,493
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

229
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,870
Like a painting and everything,
all the colors.

230
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,080
Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,920
- Okay. So…
- Yeah.

232
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,047
What do you want to talk about?

233
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:01,721
So, uh, like, you know, uh, we, like,
never seen each other for a year, right?

234
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,931
- Yeah. We haven't seen each other…
- Yeah.

235
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,725
…for a year since we met on the train.

236
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,352
- So how was your first impression of me?
- Mm…

237
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,020
You're really nice.

238
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,316
Yeah, and at the time,
you were really, um, attractive.

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,609
Mm-hmm.

240
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,115
Is there any, like, change for you?

241
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,533
Well, I got promoted.

242
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,993
- Oh really? Congratulations.
- Yes.

243
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,286
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

244
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,412
To me, also, like,

245
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,290
um, I just discharged
from military service, right?

246
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, so, um,

247
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,128
sometimes, you know,
the person who just discharged

248
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,922
is like, you know,
"I don't know where I have to go."

249
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,549
- Oh yeah.
- Like that. Yeah, but, um…

250
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,761
This is also really good timing
to get to know each other.

251
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,805
Yeah, exactly. And, like, it's beautiful.

252
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,641
- Right, yeah.
- I feel like it's the perfect timing.

253
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,770
I really, basically,
like nature things, so…

254
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,854
Yeah.

255
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,648
What about Korean food? Did you have one?

256
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,859
Yeah, I had… The other day, I had it.

257
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,861
- Like, spicy one, or…
- Yeah.

258
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,613
- Of course. I love spicy food.
- You like it?

259
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,864
I do love it, yes.

260
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,532
We have to eat something spicy.

261
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,284
- Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely.
- Yes.

262
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,037
- I'm not actually--
- I'm here to do stuff with you.

263
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,163
- Come on.
- Right, yeah.

264
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,499
Actually, I'm not really good
at spicy things.

265
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,958
- No?
- Yeah.

266
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,877
- But, um…
- You're a fake Korean.

267
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,088
- But, um, yeah. I will… I will try.
- Yes.

268
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,966
Do you have any, like, allergy, or stuff?

269
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,636
- No. Not at all. Yeah.
- Not at all? Okay.

270
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
So it's good. I can eat everything.

271
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,680
Yeah, good. Yeah.

272
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,557
I don't have allergy too.

273
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,434
No, okay, so that's a good thing.

274
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,560
Except cat.

275
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,772

00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,070

- Yes, I have cats.

279
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,446

<i>How could he not like cats?</i>
<i>So cute and so mistaken.</i>

"You talk a lot."

288
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,013
But this time, I'm letting you talk more.

289
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:08,931

00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,609
You exercise a lot.

00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,945
You also care about that? Health?

296
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,697

You know, I'm not, uh, the person who

301
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,001
Mm-hmm.

- You know, I'm quite a boring guy.
- Ah.

303
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,051
<i>We will find something in common.</i>
<i>I'm sure we'll find something.</i>

304
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,263
<i>Do we have anything in common?</i>

305
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,854
<i>There are K-dramas that are</i>
<i>marked by misunderstandings,</i>

306
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,398
<i>which are meant to test</i>
<i>whether opposites really do attract.</i>

307
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,486
<i>And there are stories</i>
<i>that are all about the plot twist.</i>

308
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>In Korea, you don't marry</i>
<i>a woman who already has a child.</i>

309
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>So we need to talk about that.</i>

310
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,586
<i>But how? My English isn't great,</i>
<i>and his is worse than mine.</i>

311
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,879
<i>What do I do?</i>

312
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,765
Luanny!

313
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
Luanny!

314
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,818
Wait, why are you crying?

315
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,113
Mm…

316
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,037
Hey, anyway…

00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,499
I will give you something for you.

00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,712
Are you ready for it?

319
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,672

Are you happy?

322
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,765
Happy, happy, happy!

323
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,368
Are you cold?

324
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,917
- My jacket.
- Thank you!

325
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm really happy.

326
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,804
Because I see you again.

327
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,246
- You comfortable?
- Mm.

328
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,251
Beautiful.

329
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,343
Mm-hmm…

330
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,140
I have something for you.

331
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,740
What is this?

332
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,244
What is it?

333
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,670
What is it?

334
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,673
You can try it.

335
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,178
We can speak…

336
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,181
language…

337
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,143
- Each other, understand it.
- Are you stupid?

338
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,860
From now on, we will be able
to talk to one another.

339
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,987
I did this for you.

340
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,907
Are you crazy?

341
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,163
Now we can talk to each other.

342
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,625
There is something else,
another surprise for you.

343
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,879
Do you want to know what it is, Luanny?

344
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,549
You have another surprise?

345
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
What is it?

346
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,972
Can you grab that paper
that's in my pocket?

347
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,974
In that pocket.

348
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,729
Before you came to Korea,

349
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,401
I tried practicing a bit,
but Portuguese is very hard.

350
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,488
But that wasn't going to stop me
from singing to you.

351
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,120
One, two, three, four!

352
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:30,919
<i>This ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum inside me </i>

353
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,672
<i>It goes ba-dum, ba-dum, when-- </i>

354
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,592
I don't… I don't remember the melody.

355
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,886
Can you help me out?

356
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:44,266
<i>- This ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum</i>
<i>- Inside me</i>

357
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,188
<i>That goes ba-dum, ba-dum</i>
<i>When you walk by me</i>

358
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:54,151
<i>My eyes memorize every move </i>

359
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,697
<i>Even your smile makes me shy </i>

360
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,991
<i>If I could hold you tight </i>

361
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>Dominate your feelings </i>

362
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,874
<i>Control your steps</i>
<i>Read your agenda and thoughts </i>

363
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,670
<i>But my fragile heart beats faster </i>

364
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,759
<i>And goes ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum </i>

365
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,929
That was so good!

366
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,224
I actually practiced for three days.

367
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,727
Three days? That was really good.

368
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,728
I promise to…

369
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,525
keep practicing until I can sing it right.

370
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,445
Where's the ring?

371
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,290
I look forward to the day when

372
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,834
I'll put a ring around your finger.

373
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,380
Know that it might be soon, right?

374
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,133
Let's plan our future together.

375
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,219
Let's move forward.

376
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,889
Always together.

377
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
I love you, Luanny.

378
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,521
I love you too. Very much.

379
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,065
Very much.

380
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,945
Are you scared of something?

381
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,840
- So…
- Yeah.

382
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,717
Do you work out though?

383
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,094
Yes, but I'm not really
working out right now.

384
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,973
But as soon as I go back to Brazil,
I'm gonna start Pilates.

385
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,267
Maybe start doing Muay Thai again.

386
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,102
- Oh really? Oh, right.
- Yeah.

387
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,229
I like it. I like fighting.

388
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,440
- You know, when I was younger, um…
- Mm.

389
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,027
I was really into, like,
um, mixed martial arts, right?

390
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,487
- You know, in Brazil--
- Jiu-jitsu?

391
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,906
- Like, Jiu-jitsu or, like, you know…
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,491
Uh… Like…

393
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,535
- Even MMA, you know?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

394
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,205
- And UFC is really big in Brazil, right?
- Yeah. It's huge.

395
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,123
Even now.

396
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,875
- Even now. Yeah.
- So, uh…

397
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,377
Do you know Anderson Silva?

398
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,629
- Yes. He's really famous.
- Really? You know him?

399
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,132
- Everybody knows Anderson Silva.
- Really? Yeah.

400
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,343
<i>I respect him, I think he's a king,</i>

401
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,179
<i>but that can't be the only thing</i>
<i>that connects us, right?</i>

402
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,432
Okay, so you came here
all the way from Ulsan?

403
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,726
- Right.
- And are you… going…

404
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,935
I should go back soon.

405
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,896
- Okay, so maybe we should go, right?
- All right.

406
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,147
- Yeah.
- It's getting colder.

407
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,608
Yes, it's getting way too cold in here!

408
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,571
<i>Well, now I'm already here.</i>

409
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,241
<i>I crossed the world</i>
<i>to see where this story goes.</i>

410
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,328
<i>If it's going to go anywhere at all.</i>

411
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,248
<i>Will we go out again after this?</i>

412
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,594
Well, your family doesn't know

413
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,513
that I have a daughter.

414
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:15,018
And I think we've reached the point
where we have to talk about it.

415
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,815
We can't hide it anymore, right?

416
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,151
Yes, of course. I know.

417
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,445
The first step is…

418
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,701
First we need
to meet my parents, you know.

419
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,954
And once that happens,

420
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,666
we won't need to hide Ayla from them.

421
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,668
Not anymore.

422
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,215
It won't be long

423
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,220
until the day… we can be together.

424
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,140
Nothing will stop me.

425
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,604
I think we made plans… in our minds, but

426
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,151
we didn't…
do anything to make them happen.

427
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,280
We just made promises and promises.

428
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,700
But nothing changed.

429
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:17,289
And sometimes I just feel like
we're just moving backwards,

430
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:21,001
because we just promise
and don't do anything.

431
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,463
And I don't want to spend so much
time living away from each other,

432
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,673
because it's hard for me too.

433
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:37,058
I will try harder to…

434
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,771
To make our dreams come true.

435
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,316
Don't worry.

436
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,194
But I'm scared.

437
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,739
Scared of what?

438
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,700
The fact…

439
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,913
that you spend money.

440
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,331
That's what I'm scared of.

441
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,000
That it hasn't stopped.

442
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,543
Oh, okay.

443
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,296
I'm well aware.

444
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,632
Mm…

445
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,510
- But I swear--
- Do you swear to God you stopped?

446
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,470
Mm…

447
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,849
Swear.

448
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
Huh.

449
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,438
I see. So, I quit, okay?

450
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,774
- Starting now.
- Now?

451
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,359
I mean it.

452
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,610
Just now?

453
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,530
From now on.

454
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,949
No.

455
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,450
What?

456
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,579
You told me you were going to stop before,
and you're still doing it?

457
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,709
Why are you shaking?

458
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,921
I'll be honest, I won't lie.

459
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,299
I kept doing it, yeah.

460
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,009
But I was…

461
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,972
trying to keep it under control.

462
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,557
And…

463
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:04,020
If I really care about our future,
I should call it quits.

464
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,356
So…

465
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:11,528
From now on, I promise I will always
follow your advice. I mean that.

466
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,364
Do you trust me?

467
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,116
No.

468
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,996
What can I do to make you trust me?

469
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,625
I'll go talk to your mom.

470
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,673
My mother? You'll talk to her?

471
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,596
Because if I don't talk to your family,
you'll never change.

472
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,680
Never.

473
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,849
And I don't wanna drown.

474
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,644
How many times will you say
you'll change and then don't?

475
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,689
You're 35 years old.

476
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,697
Sorry.

477
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

478
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,582
Continuing where we left off,

479
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,461
I've told you this many times. Hm?

480
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,545
Mm.

481
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,090
That if we stay together,

482
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,385
I am not going to…

483
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,054
- Hm?
- Mm.

484
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,722
…hide anything from you.

485
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,434
Not my monthly salary,

486
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,021
uh, not my cell phone.

487
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,109
I won't hide anything.
There won't be any secrets.

488
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,904
You'll have access to everything.

489
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,116
You'll be the one
in charge of our finances.

490
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,454
Last time, you said the same thing.

491
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,458
But we're not married yet.

492
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,336
Is that necessary?

493
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,131
Aren't you thinking about the future?

494
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,553
So you really need to get married and
join the church to start living your life?

495
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,598
Those are just empty words.

496
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,602
Wait, you don't want to marry me?

497
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,565
You think I don't want to?

498
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,735
That's not it.

499
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:20,156
You think I just came
all the way from Brazil,

500
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,451
and I don't want to marry you?

501
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,297
<i>I don't know what's going to happen.</i>

502
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,759
<i>He says he wants to marry me,</i>
<i>and I want to marry him,</i>

503
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,679
<i>but everything he says</i>
<i>is the opposite of what he does.</i>

504
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,640
<i>How am I going to build a life</i>
<i>with someone I don't trust?</i>

505
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,965
You wear it better than I do, babe!

506
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,217
The necklace looks great on her!

507
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,427
I want every detail.

508
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,304
- What's up, girlfriend?
- Don't keep secrets.

509
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,222
I came here to tie up some loose ends,

510
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,769
and so I could say everything
that's been on my mind for a long time.

511
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,982
And I brought something up that
he's sensitive about, which is money.

512
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,987
He makes a lot of bad investments,
and that makes things very hard on us.

513
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,992
Because he's a person with
an extremely good heart.

514
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,953
He has so many more positive things
to him than negative ones,

515
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,914
but he's starting to lose himself.

516
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,458
Girl, speaking for myself,

517
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,294
I know your story, I know you've
been through a lot of hardships,

518
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,130
your life hasn't been easy,
no one's life here is easy,

519
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,592
everyone has problems. That whole
fairy tale fantasy doesn't exist.

520
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,347
But given everything you've been through,
I don't want you to…

521
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,015
- Get hurt, you know?
- …get hurt.

522
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,811
Yeah, but I hurt
just by seeing him in this situation.

523
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,189
Because I don't want him to, like,
hit rock bottom, you know?

524
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
There's a saying that
I think suits you guys, it says,

525
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:24,280
"I'm not perfect, but flowers may grow
even between the cracks and the stones."

526
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:28,576
- So, don't be sad. There's hope, okay?
- There's hope. Yeah.

527
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,245
And we can see that you're trying.

528
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,162
- You know?
- Yeah.

529
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,542
You talk about him so kindly,
you want to help him.

530
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,254
But, like, there are things
that sometimes are harmful to us.

531
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,341
When we try hard to hold onto something,
sometimes we don't need to hold on.

532
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,427
- We have to release. You have to let go.
- Yeah.

533
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,348
Girl, you're young,
you're beautiful, you're a fighter.

534
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,518
You have a huge future ahead of you.

535
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,105
There are things we can avoid, you know?

536
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,399
You don't have to go through this.

537
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,030
<i>Sometimes the writer of our lives</i>
<i>goes heavy on the drama.</i>

538
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,244
Let's wake up, princess!

539
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,745
Good morning, girls!

540
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,082
- Time to wake up, princess!
- Aren't you going to wake up?

541
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,668
- Hello?
- Good morning.

542
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,669
Hello?

543
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,921
- I feel so lazy.
- She's in a bad mood, huh?

544
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,922
Oh my God.

545
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,759
Let's wake up 'cause
I'm in a good mood today!

546
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,554
Oh my! Did you all sleep well?

547
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,559
<i>And then there are days</i>
<i>when the writer of our life wakes up</i>

548
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,728
<i>ready to talk about love.</i>

549
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,981
- Is someone at the door?
- Let's go see.

550
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,316
- Wait.
- Who could it be?

551
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,236
Hey, are you girls waiting for someone?

552
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,237
- No.
- No, not me…

553
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,287
- Balloons? Who has balloons?
- I think it's over there, look.

554
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,373
No, no, stop, girl, I don't know!

555
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,042
- I think it's…
- You think it's…

556
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,919
- What if it's not--
- Oh, my God!

557
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,590
Who is it?

558
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,052
You guys! Hi, babe!

559
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,807
Cry some more, girl, cry!

560
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,101
Oh, wow, how beautiful!

561
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,357
- Girls, I got flowers!
- Are you happy, my friend?

562
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,444
<i>That is Su-woong,</i>
<i>Morena's Korean boyfriend.</i>

563
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,031
<i>They met a year ago here in Seoul</i>
<i>and have been together ever since.</i>

564
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,368
<i>The guy is even moving to Brazil.</i>

565
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,787
<i>It's the perfect love story.</i>

566
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,789
<i>There's just one tiny problem.</i>

567
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,165
<i>His mother doesn't want him to.</i>

568
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,214
Oh, so romantic!

569
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,215
Oh my God!

570
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,217
- I'm so happy!
- It's all so pretty!

571
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,551
I'm gonna freshen up.

572
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,136
Bye-bye.

573
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,265
So, Morena is a very sweet girl.

574
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,266
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,060
Morena is <i>yeppeo.</i>

576
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
Very, very.

577
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,688
Very, very!

578
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,314
Repeat after me. Very…

579
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,066
- Very…
- Pretty.

580
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,275
Pretty. She's beautiful.

581
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,360
You have to tell her when…

582
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,279
When she comes down the stairs,
you can say,

583
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,990
"Morena, very pretty."

584
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,243
Thank you, thank you for teaching.

585
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,452
Teaching you, yeah.

586
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,590
That was quick.
I've never gotten ready so fast.

587
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,385
- Yes!
- Very pretty.

588
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,469
Oh, thank you!

589
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,473
This is perfect!

590
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,934
- Bye, girlfriend!
- Goodbye!

591
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,853
- Enjoy it!
- Have fun, girl!

592
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,480
- Put my flowers in water, please. Okay?
- We will!

593
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,858
- I'll take it to our room.
- Put them in water.

594
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,152
Bye-bye, see you!

595
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,778
Nice to meet you!

596
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,321
Bye-bye, have fun.

597
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,286
Girls, that was crazy!

598
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,205
- Girls, I thought he was the best.
- He's a sweetheart, such a sweetheart.

599
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,915
- A total cutie.
- So sweet.

600
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,500
- Very polite.
- Very polite.

601
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,212
And, you see that he really likes her,
you can tell by the way he looks at her.

602
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,215
- And they have similar personalities.
- Yeah, girls, their height!

603
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,175
- Yeah.
- He's tall.

604
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,676
- He is tall. Yeah.
- So is she.

605
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,137
Oh, it's just beautiful, right?

606
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,894
How have you been?

607
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,732
Even if I am knowing very much about you?

608
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,109
- Yeah. Oh, coffee!
- Yeah.

609
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,278
Yeah, let's drink something.

610
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,114
- And talk a little bit. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,492
- Yeah, long time no see.
- Yeah.

612
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,911
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

613
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,246
- Let's see the menu.
- Yeah.

614
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,041
- May I help you?
- Just a second.

615
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,459
One Vienna Matcha.

616
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,044
One Vienna Matcha, all right.

617
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,046
Iced strawberry?

618
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,757
Yeah, I want iced tea, strawberry.

619
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,343
One strawberry ice tea,
and one cheesecake.

620
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,390
- Morena?
- Yeah?

621
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,850
How was your flight?

622
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,769
Yeah, very good.

623
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,479
- Good?
- Very good, yeah.

624
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,689
I slept enough.

625
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,734
- But now I'm very happy because I'm here.
- Me too.

626
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,862
Very long time, not see you. Hm.

627
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,949
Oh, so nice place!

628
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,284
- Wow!
- Yeah, that's why we came here.

629
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,911
You can sit here?

630
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,330
- Here? Okay, I'll try.
- Yeah, come here.

631
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,456
Yeah, this is better.

632
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,625
Yeah?

633
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,544
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

634
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,811
- What about your boy?
- Danny?

635
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,980
You two have been talking for how long?

636
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,942
Girl, for almost… almost a year.

637
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,735
- Yeah.
- I would be super anxious.

638
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,154
Yup, just about.

639
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,780
- That's a long time, huh?
- Yeah.

640
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:02,910
And… it's, uh… you know, we have
very similar things in common, you know?

641
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,787
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

642
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,331
<i>I don't want to tell her,</i>

643
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,960
<i>but the truth is I'm scared to death</i>
<i>that he won't show up.</i>

644
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,213
<i>Or even worse,</i>
<i>that he doesn't exist. Can you imagine?</i>

645
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:19,177
Girl, if… if you don't mind,

646
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,180
I was wondering
what happened to your parents.

647
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,515
I can tell you about it later.

648
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,147
<i>Some stories are so powerful</i>
<i>that they seem like fiction.</i>

649
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:36,485
<i>Like Camila's. She left Korea when she was</i>
<i>three years old and never went back.</i>

650
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,529
<i>She has her reasons for that.</i>

651
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,949
<i>All I know is that</i>
<i>it's a story full of holes</i>

652
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,119
<i>and she's here to try</i>
<i>to piece that puzzle together.</i>

653
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,748
<i>And who knows, maybe find a guy.</i>
<i>The girl deserves it!</i>

654
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,882
It's very hot.

655
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,971
So, I was very depressed and sad.

656
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,266
And I need to… Needed to…

657
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,186
maybe not express my bad feeling to my…

658
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,941
We think about other people,
especially family, a lot.

659
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,275
- Mm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

660
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,194
That's why I…

661
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,364
I noticed you,

662
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,910
that you had to wear properly…

663
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,495
…to meet my mom.

664
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,081
Yeah, I know.

665
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:34,835
So my mom also said
that you looked a little strange

666
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,797
when she met you the first time.

667
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,842
You were wearing some jeans, destroyed.

668
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,302
- Yeah.
- Torn, so…

669
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,596
Destroyed jeans not good?

670
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,268
- Hard to imagine for Korean people.
- This is fashion.

671
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,812
- Destroyed jeans.
- So I said to my mom,

672
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,774
"Mom, that's Morena's best choice,
and she also thought about it a lot."

673
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

674
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:02,029
<i>Oh, Koreans are so different from us.</i>

675
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,448
<i>Please grant me patience.</i>

676
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,450
<i>Ugly to them is beautiful to me, you know?</i>

677
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,537
What should I wear next time?
Now I'm really nervous, because…

678
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,166
Because even the first day,
she don't like my clothes.

679
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,044
And second day, what she said?

680
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,672
- About flower jacket?
- Nothing.

681
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,549
- You hated my flower jacket.
- Nothing, nothing.

682
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,217
She said nothing.

683
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,304
But now I don't know what to wear.

684
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,807
Let's go to the, yeah, store together.

685
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,892
- No, I have clothes.
- And then try Korean ones.

686
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,645
No, Korean clothes, it's too small for me.

687
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:40,443
Yeah. I also didn't expect my mom would,

688
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,488
yeah, kind of permit to go to Brazil

689
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,240
this fastly.

690
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,159
Mm-hmm, after meeting you.

691
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,211
- Kiss?
- Kiss.

692
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,969
Here has really nice view on the top.

693
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,054
- Mm.
- Yeah.

694
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,348
- Let's go. yeah. Okay.
- Let's go. Okay.

695
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,270
<i>I thought Su-woong would</i>
<i>bring me piece of mind, but no.</i>

696
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,772
<i>And now there's this.</i>

697
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,399
<i>What do I wear to meet my mother-in-law?</i>

698
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,512
What did you think of Su-woong?

699
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,390
- Are you thinking about marrying him?
- Of course, God willing!

700
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,477
- I'd marry him tomorrow if I could.
- Oh, get over here!

701
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,730
That is the dream!

702
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,859
But I'm, like, so grateful to be here and
to be living this moment with all of you.

703
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,569
- Me too.
- Me too.

704
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,321
Everything's just perfect.

705
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,407
Shall we make things even more perfect?

706
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,242
- Let's!
- Let's make our wish.

707
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,286
- I think we…
- And end the night with soju?

708
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,206
- And we end the night with soju?
- Soju!

709
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,541
- Let's go?
- Let's go!

710
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,045
- I think we're here.
- Let's go over here.

711
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,260
So, are you all ready to make your wishes?

712
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,303
What if things were as beautiful as this?

713
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,097
Gorgeous, huh?

714
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,014
I love it.

715
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,102
Now I want you all to think of something
very positive, something really nice,

716
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,856
so we can start our trip,
like, on the right foot, okay?

717
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,773
Are we ready?

718
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,317
From now on,
it's gonna be like anything can happen.

719
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,832
<i>Our fate is sealed.</i>

720
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,961
<i>Now whether fate will be generous or not,</i>
<i>is a whole other story.</i>

721
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,687
Tall, he has to be tall.
Older than me, and…

722
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,314
with straight teeth, for God's sake.

723
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,356
- That's it.
- With what?

724
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,941
Straight teeth.

725
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,153
- Straight teeth.
- No one wants that, right? No.

726
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,489
Why don't we go clubbing tonight?

727
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,575
- So I can enjoy myself while I still can?
- While you still can, right?

728
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,535
While you still don't have
a ring on your finger.

729
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,829
You can still go out
when you're married, right?

730
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,873
Yeah, but… You know.
Then it gets complicated.

731
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,333
He's far away, honey, let's go out.

732
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,543
- For as long as this lasts.
- Let it all go. Yeah. Let's go.

733
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,722
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

734
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,434
<i>Finally he picked up.</i>

735
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,854
<i>Everyone had met with their guy.</i>
<i>I wasn't about to be left out.</i>

736
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:19,286
<i>Tell me, have I lost control?</i>

737
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,831
<i>Too high, can't come down</i>

738
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:27,586
<i>Going round and round</i>

739
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,090
<i>Am I out of my head?</i>

740
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,468
<i>Don't care what they said</i>

741
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,222
<i>Every story has a beginning.</i>

742
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,433
<i>But nothing guarantees a happy ending.</i>

743
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,471
<i>Traveling across the world</i>
<i>to meet some guy from Instagram?</i>

744
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,308
<i>That's crazy,</i>
<i>the internet is no-man's land.</i>

745
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,643
<i>Who can say that the guy</i>
<i>I've been talking to all this time</i>

746
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,437
<i>is the same that's coming to meet me?</i>

747
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,443
Mari!
