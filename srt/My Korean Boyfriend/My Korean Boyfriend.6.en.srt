00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>We grow up believing</i>
<i>that every story has a happy ending.</i>

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>That's what fairytales teach us.</i>

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>They just skipped the part where</i>
<i>the princess has to tell her mother-in-law</i>

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,353
<i>that she has a daughter.</i>

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,817
- Hello!
- Hi!

6
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,238
Oh…

7
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,576
You are… so pretty!

8
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,577
Oh, thank you!

9
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,633
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,428
Uh…

11
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,305
Have you been eating?

12
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,307
What is this?

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,392
We can talk.

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,311
What is this? Earphone?

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,440
Now we can understand each other.

16
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,319
Yes. It's good to meet you!

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,696
So, now we can finally talk to each other.

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,199
I'm happy to meet you, ma'am.

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,326
Is Si-won okay?

20
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,370
Oh, he's fine.

21
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,707
As a mother,
I am always worried about him.

22
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,129
How can I say this?

23
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,881
He has a good heart.

24
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,550
He's a… good person.

25
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,762
He never gave me any trouble
when he was a kid.

26
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,431
Si-won can give me
a bit of a headache sometimes.

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,351
But he has a very kind heart.

28
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,435
Mom…

29
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,063
can I…

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,273
ask you something?

31
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,691
Mm.

32
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,153
<i>Everyone has the power</i>
<i>to write their own story.</i>

33
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,239
<i>But fate can change everything.</i>

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,622
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

35
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,589
Hey.

36
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,507
<i>Olá!</i>

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,424
Hi!

38
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:15,969
Coffee?

39
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,053
Thank you.

40
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,721
You're welcome.

41
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,058
- Cheers!
- Cheer…

42
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>Saúde!</i>

43
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>- Saúde!</i>
<i>- Saúde.</i>

44
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,687
Are you ready?

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,814
Let's go.

46
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,527
- It's cold!
- Walking in the sun will warm you up.

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,445
Yeah.

48
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,157
- Is that where we're going jogging?
- Over there.

49
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,700
On the other side.

50
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,743
So, where that dog is?

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,287
- It's past the dog.
- Past the dog?

52
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,246
Yeah.

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,748
That's where the jogging track is.

54
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,042
- Slowly?
- Slowly.

55
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,670
One, two, one, two?

56
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:55,008
Yeah, because your legs
are way longer than mine, so…

57
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,343
You're gonna have to keep my pace.

58
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,470
- Of course. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

59
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,388
Your pace.

60
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,098
Yeah.

61
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,399
My pace. Yes!

62
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,400
You know?

63
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,820
- Do you run like this in Brazil, too?
- I…

64
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,990
- run every day.
- Yeah? Every day?

65
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,908
Every day.

66
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,912
Co-- Competition.

67
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,663
- Running. Competition.
- Competition running?

68
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,500
Yeah, I was… training for competitions.

69
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,127
And were you running here?

70
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,503
A bit further down.

71
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,322
- Here?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,910
I knew today was gonna be a hot day.

73
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,537
I wanted to give you

74
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,747
something before you leave.

75
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,667
Do you know the Korean word for this?
<i>Buchae?</i>

76
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,795
Ah, yeah. I know. This in Brazil--

77
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,838
Are you familiar with carnival?

78
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,591
- Oh, carnival?
- Yeah, they use this in carnival,

79
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,842
'cause it's hot.

80
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,026
How cute.

81
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,445
I really like the color black.

82
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,114
You got it just for me?

83
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,283
- I bought it just for you.
- Really?

84
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,284
Thank you.

85
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,161
- I don't have anything for you.
- Oh, don't worry.

86
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,208
You know the next time you come to Korea,
I'll make sure to cook for you.

87
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,751
- You cook?
- I do.

88
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,669
What do you cook?

89
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,004
Ah, Korean food.

90
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,131
- Korean food?
<i>- Kimchi jjigae, doeniang jjigae…</i>

91
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,424
- I like kimchi.
<i>- Kimchi jjim.</i>

92
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>- Kimchi jjim?</i>
- Yeah.

93
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,467
I like <i>kimchi jjim.</i>

94
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,262
Can I ask you something I'm curious about?

95
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,388
- About me?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,639
Okay, sure.

97
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,143
In Brazil, what's the…

98
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,729
Uh…

99
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,233
What's the dating scene like over there?
Do you do blind dates? Or…

100
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
Ah…

101
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,321
- We do blind dates, friends of friends.
- Oh yeah?

102
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,572
Yeah, friends in common.

103
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,282
- Friends of friends?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,743
- What about you?
- What?

105
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,785
What?

106
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,412
Usually…

107
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:30,997
Like…

108
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,999
- Have you dated before?
- Yeah, sure.

109
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,168
- Ever had a relationship? Ah.
- Of course I have!

110
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,627
You're 38?

111
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,423
Thirty-eight. Yeah.
I'll be 40 pretty soon.

112
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,632
- Forty?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,717
You…

114
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,219
don't look like--

115
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,346
Ah, thank you.

116
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,097
How many relationships? And when?

117
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,058
- Hm…
- Just curious.

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,809
Well…

119
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,605
- After I turned 20 years old.
- After you turned 20?

120
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,482
Yeah. After I turned 20.

121
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,901
Mm… Maybe…

122
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,823
- Really?
- No. Just kidding. Um…

123
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,992
Five relationships.

124
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,369
- Five times?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,788
Oh my God. That's a lot of relationships.

126
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,289
- You think so?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,917
I've had two relationships.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,502
- Two.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,669
Uh, if it's okay…

130
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,923
You know,
I'd love to see you one last time

131
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,217
before you have to leave for Brazil.

132
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,094
Okay, you can text me.

133
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,346
I'm not that into…

134
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,140
uh… texting a lot.

135
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,768
In Brazil, I'm offline

136
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,978
- most of the time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,105
Because…

138
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,402
I'm not really into
spending a lot of time online.

139
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,030
But I use the internet a lot for chatting.

140
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,782
Well, I'll, um…

141
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,575
- text you.
- Okay.

142
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,493
Yeah.

143
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,328
So, um…

144
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,416
In Brazil, how do you guys say, "Bye-bye"?

145
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,333
Bye-bye?

146
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
- In Brazil, yeah.
<i>- Tchau.</i>

147
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,335
<i>Tchau?</i>

148
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,212
Yeah, that's what we say.

149
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,589
We say bye-bye like this, okay?

150
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,759
- Kiss here, kiss here. Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

151
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,594
The Brazilian way.

152
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,557
- And when this is goodbye and hello.
- Goodbye…

153
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,643
- Goodbye and hello. Oh, the same.
- The same. Yeah.

154
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,978
- Yes. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

155
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,604
- See you.
- See you. Bye-bye.

156
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,485
Bye-bye.

157
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,075
<i>I don't believe in happily ever after.</i>

158
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>But I believe in</i>
<i>happy moments along the way.</i>

159
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,375
<i>Being at peace is</i>
<i>just as important as being happy.</i>

160
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,420
I've always tried to…

161
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,964
ignore my past,

162
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,717
but I think I did a good thing

163
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,553
by getting this over with.

164
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:56,017
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>
<i>it's the journey that makes us who we are.</i>

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>Not the final destination.</i>

166
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,745
I was going to wait
for Si-won to tell you this.

167
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,789
- Mm.
- But…

168
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,378
If…

169
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,091
I have a daughter,
is that a problem for you?

170
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,641
A daughter? I didn't know about that.

171
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,898
I don't mind it.

172
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,525
It's not a problem.

173
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm not that kind of person.

174
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,529
I respect people.

175
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,907
Life is so unpredictable.

176
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,451
Don't cry, Luanny.

177
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,411
These things happen, it's life.

178
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,997
Isn't that right, Luanny?

179
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,998
Don't cry!

180
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,127
Let go of those… bad thoughts. It's okay.

181
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,338
I don't mind that.

182
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,423
I'm not that kind of person.

183
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,841
It's okay, don't cry.

184
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,720
I didn't know you had been
holding all that inside you.

185
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,846
Don't cry.

186
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,807
You'll mess up that pretty face of yours.

187
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,518
I'm not that kind of person.

188
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,312
I have a tissue here somewhere.

189
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,606
Life is like this.

190
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,194
Everyone has their own struggles.
This could happen to anyone.

191
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,572
Don't cry about it.

192
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,701
We want a good life for our children.

193
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,620
But parents shouldn't worry
so much about that.

194
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:45,084
You just have to be a nice person and
have a good relationship with me, Luanny.

195
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,587
Not because we are in-laws now,

196
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,215
but to support each other
as a mother and as a daughter.

197
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,801
Helping each other whenever we need it.

198
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,013
Being present, giving love and affection.

199
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,764
You know? Being together.

200
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,349
That's the way I see things.

201
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,394
I don't care if you have money or not.
It's okay.

202
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,106
- Thank you, Mom.
- This is life. That's all. I don't mind.

203
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,482
Not at all.

204
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
I was a little scared.

205
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,157
Because I know
our cultures are very different.

206
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,743
Very opposite, but…

207
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,831
I was feeling awful
because I was hiding something.

208
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,125
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

209
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,252
It's okay.

210
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,712
Just be responsible.

211
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,965
Take good care of your daughter…
of each other.

212
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,260
Help each other through difficult times.

213
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,305
The main goal is to have a good life.

214
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,850
Having a good, happy life. Isn't it?
Everything is fine.

215
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,687
The mood feels good.

216
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,357
We're getting along.

217
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,984
Mom gave me this, look.

218
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,819
So, Mom.

219
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,655
What's your first impression?

220
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,031
She's so pretty!

221
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,159
- Really? Sure about that?
- You have to be nice to her.

222
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,082
- Anyway, Mom.
- Mm?

223
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,045
There are some things I didn't tell you.

224
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,923
I know. She's just told me.

225
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,758
- So you know?
- Yes.

226
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,760
It's okay. I don't mind it.

227
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,013
- It'll be good for you.
- I'm a… little bit scared.

228
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,394
Now there's a lovely child in our lives.
I'm really glad.

229
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,773
Loving your kids
shouldn't make you embarrassed.

230
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,275
Children are a blessing. Don't you think?

231
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,570
You should be confident
and proud of your life.

232
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,572
- Luanny…
- Do your best.

233
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,492
Luanny, you…

234
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,703
Uh…

235
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,289
To be honest, I already had a feeling that

236
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,751
when you met my mom, she would understand.

237
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,380
I had a feeling that this would happen.

238
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,507
When you told her.

239
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm happy everything's settled.

240
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
Thank you for accepting me, Mom.

241
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,728
I promise I'll take care of him
and knock some sense into his head.

242
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,275
And we'll come here to Korea
many times to visit you.

243
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,737
And I'll bring you
many things from Brazil.

244
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,155
I promise.

245
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,866
I'm not saying thank you.

246
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,580
All I want is for you to get along well
from now on.

247
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,415
- Understand?
- We will.

248
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,084
And love each other.

249
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,335
Shall we?

250
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,088
Let's…

251
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,382
give Mom a hug.

252
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,304
Let's go.

253
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,182
Careful.

254

<i>In fairytales, the princess</i>

256

<i>My prince is not very… charming,</i>

257
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,487

258
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,156
<i>But I still want to fight</i>

259
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,700
Do you have

260
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,368
to start living your life?

261
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,245
So you're just wasting words, right?

262
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>Even if it's only a happily-for-now.</i>

263
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,463

265
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,382
- Morena?
- I'm too tall.

266
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,467
You look so beautiful.

267
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,844
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

268
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,804

- Yeah.

286

00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,568
Okay! Good.

288
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,737
I want to cry.

289
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,197
I want to cry now.

290
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,534
No, don't cry!

291
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,912
- Don't cry.
- I'm very happy. We made really nice… Yes.

It's so… crazy that I'm on

298
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,965
So today was our…

299
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,093
first date, I think.

300
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,970

- Mwah!

Excuse me, do I know you?

307
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,290
No, sorry, someone's waiting.

308
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,834
Hello!

309
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,627
- Hello!
- Hello, hello!

310
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,671
How are you? Are you cold?

311
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,423
I mean, it's fine. It's a bit windy,

312
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,050
- but it's a beautiful weather.
- Yeah.

313
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,761
- So, this is Namsan.
- Okay!

314
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,429
- Have you been here?
- No, never.

315
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:40,142
Okay! You see there, you see all the…
the… What do you call them? Locks?

316
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,769
- The locks.
- You heard about the locks?

317
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,855
Yes, I've heard about it.
It's a thing in Brazil, actually.

318
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,732
- It is?
- Everybody knows about it. Yes.

319
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,276
- How about the one here?
- How many hearts have you put there?

320
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,905
If you see all the red, that's mine.

321
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,114
All the red. That's mine.

322
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,824
Is it possible to get a locker here?

323
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,785
- You can buy one…
- But only for couples, right?

324
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,828
- Yeah. So we gotta… We gotta think.
- Oh…

325
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,997
Hmm… Hmm…

326
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,417
Maybe if you act well,
then I'll be like, "Okay, okay, Mari."

327
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,503
I'm just kidding.

328
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,213
- Okay.
- You want to go see the locks here?

329
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,715
Let's go, let's take a walk. Yeah.

330
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,259
Oh-- You-- Oh, your muscles.

331
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,136

332
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,721
Of course, everything.

You know, I had only seen this in shows,
in K-dramas.

353
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,737
- And coming here has been a dream.
- Ah.

354
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,406
It's a very famous place
for romantic dates.

355
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,533
Oh, that's amazing!

356
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,369
Well, then, it's very nice
to come here with you.

357
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,582
And have you brought
anyone else here before?

358
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,875
No, never.

359
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,418
My first time here, and it's with you.

360
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,589
You're a really special person, Katy.

361
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,467
So, being here now
is really special to me.

362
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,510
I consider it an honor.

363
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
Have you ever been to Namsan Tower?

364
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:34,233
Yeah, I've been to Namsan Tower before,
and I put a lock there with my friends.

365
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,194
But I've never done that with a boyfriend.

366
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,529
Mm. You can go with me next time.

367
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,948
Yeah, let's go.

368
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,660
It'll be really romantic
to put our little lock on Namsan Tower.

369
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,581
Okay, let's get going?

370
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,166
Let's go, yeah, we can go.

371
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,808
<i>Legend says that</i>
<i>if you lock a padlock on Namsan Tower</i>

372
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,726
<i>and throw away the key,</i>

373
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
<i>your love lasts forever.</i>

374
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,773
<i>Or at least until the next K-drama starts.</i>

375
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,733
<i>But one thing is certain.</i>

376
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,861
<i>If there hasn't been a kiss,</i>
<i>it means it's not over yet.</i>

377
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,863
Oh, look at this huge one.

378
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,700
- Whoa, this is huge one.
- This is… medieval!

379
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,120
This is like… this is love.
This is true love.

380
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,416
Did you brought… Did you brought us one?

381
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,167
- Us?
- Yeah-Yeah.

382
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,044
- For our friendship!
- Oh yeah.

383
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,384
- Look at this field.
- Look at this view!

384
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,177
Oh my God!

385
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,429
Welcome to Seoul.

386
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,806
- Oh!
- Now we finally see the whole view.

387
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:52,185
Where the… Where the sun hits
is your kingdom.

388
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,482
Yeah. Oh, it's so pretty. Like, uh…
For me, I haven't come here in so long.

389
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,359
- Really?
- Yeah, it's great.

390
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,694
Danny, I need to talk to you.

391
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,820
What?

392
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,281
Because, um…

393
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,992
I'm gonna be leaving, um, soon…

394
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,911
- Mm-hmm.
- In-In a few days, right?

395
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,376
We had a lot of great moments
the last few days.

396
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,254
- Of course.
- And…

397
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:25,761
you told me few things
that I think I won't forget.

398
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,306
- But--
- Everything we did in Korea…

399
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,476
What-What…
It flew by really fast, to be honest.

400
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,852
- Mm.
- I think.

401
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,437
I wish there was more time.

402
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,612
Sorry about my bad Korean, but…

403
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,823
What do you want from me?

404
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,785
What do you want?

405
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,244
What do I want?

406
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,246
Yeah. What should I do
with all this information?

407
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,582
Where'd you learn that?
Where'd you learn that?

408
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,293
- Uh, I know a little bit of Korean.
- You do?

409
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,211
- Yeah.
- Okay.

410
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,463
- I mean, I guess today--
- Yeah… You mean--

411
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,466
Yeah, today's the day,
I mean, that we have to talk.

412
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,176
Like…

413
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,561
Like-Like I said before. Like…

414
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:21,983
I wouldn't have brought you
on so many dates, I would say,

415
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,610
if I didn't have feelings.

416
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,113
Of course, because why would I, you know?

417
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,198
It takes time and energy.

418
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:35,288
Have you ever really thought about distant
relationships and the downside of it?

419
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,125
Always.

420
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,626
Now…

421
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,294
I like taking risks,

422
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,631
and I already had the distance
relationship. You know about it.

423
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,926
And it's hard. I know.

424
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,303
Should-Should-Should we let this go?

425
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,300
Wow!

426
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,388
<i>- Saúde!</i>
<i>- Saúde!</i>

427
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,727
Mm!

428
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,605
- It's good?
- That's delicious!

429
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,231
This is really good!

430
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,527
Mmm.

431
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,988
- Like it?
- Really good. Mm-hmm.

432
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,740
Mm.

433
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:54,910
Mmm.

434
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,745
I…

435
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,371
Uh…

436
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,332
You know, I…

437
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,918
like women who have dreams.

438
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,629
Women who are…

439
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,174
serious about their dreams,

440
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,512
who fight for them, set goals,
and go after them. I like that.

441
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,264
Oh, so you just described me.

442
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,936
The ideal guy for me…

443
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,147
is… It's not just about looks.

444
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,776
It's also someone who is
going after their dreams,

445
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,695
who wants to do something with his life.

446
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,156
And who is fun.

447
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,161
So, talking to you, I can see
that you tick all those boxes too.

448
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,288
So we've found our perfect match.

449
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,127
Oh yeah, my heart beats faster,

450
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,089
especially when you smile.

451
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:57,180
To be honest, I'm not the kind of person
who expresses their feelings, Katy.

452
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,391
But after I met you,

453
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,644
you… made me open myself up.

454
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,813
You have this power, Katy.

455
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,982
Well, then you should
look deeper into my eyes

456
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,775
to feel more butterflies in your stomach.

457
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,240
Of course, I'd like to have
more physical contact with you.

458
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,952
Of course I would.
But I want to be gentle with you.

459
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
I want to respect you.

460
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,958
This is what I do in my relationships.

461
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,917
This…

462
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,212
is why I've been keeping my distance.

463
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,425
I hope you understand that.

464
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,302
And I promise I'll keep trying.

465
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,056
Did I sound boring with all…

466
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,683
all that talk?

467
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,478
Thanks for understanding me, Katy.

468
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,647
Yeah.

469
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,572
<i>Now I know I don't have to dive</i>
<i>headfirst into a story</i>

470
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,407
<i>in order to be the star of it.</i>

471
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,598
So this view is, like,
the downside of Seoul, I guess.

472
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,974
Yeah.

473
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,229
Thank you for introducing me
to this amazing city.

474
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:34,027
Also, thank you so much
for being so patience… patient and kind.

475
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,236
And…

476
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,782
Thank you for like…

477
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,452
having me over.

478
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:48,500
I really feel like we really connected
to each other in the last few days, and…

479
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,003
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

480
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,296
Yeah. I mean…

481
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,055
Thank you. I mean…

482
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,142
Thank you for spending
your precious time here in South Korea.

483
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,231
Maybe we can do some of this next time.

484
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,858
- Right?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,152
Can we…

486
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,946
Hm?

487
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,459
I like it.

488
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,758
Danny.

489
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,969
Yes. Mari.

490
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,930
I really wanna do something right now.

491
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,866
I really wanted to do that.

492
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,500
I feel like a kid right now
that just did something wrong.

493
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,922
<i>In K-dramas, the kiss is</i>
<i>the perfect ending to the story.</i>

494
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:24,262
<i>But for me, it's just the culmination</i>
<i>of a story that was felt,</i>

495
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,139
<i>but not yet written.</i>

496
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,114
- We'll see each other again.
- You promise that?

497
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,366
- It's a pinky promise?
- Yeah.

498
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,869
- Are we really gonna see each other again?
- Yep.

499
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,872
I don't know to do this stuff.
I'm just like…

500
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,042
- moving my thumb right now…
- Yeah, but my, um…

501
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,562
But thank you so much.

502
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,070
<i>Our trip may be coming to an end, but</i>

503
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,697
<i>everything we experienced here…</i>

504
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,866
<i>Ah, this will definitely</i>
<i>go down in history.</i>

505
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,992
It's very well lit.

506
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,745
Look at this vibe,
look at this view, guys.

507
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,664
The moon.

508
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,749
It's smiling at us today.

509
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,051
Hi!

510
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,136
Luanny.

511
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,055
Camila!

512
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,268
music continues]

513
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,899
Remember?
The first time I gave you flower.

514
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,951
Guys, what about there?

515
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,996
Wow, everyone!

516
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,998
Whoa!

517
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,421
Let's all stand up.

518
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:27,176
So I invited all girls
to be our bridesmaids.

519
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,513
Yeah, so let's make cheers.

520
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,681
- It's good?
- Good!

521
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:36,311
Cheers!

522
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,959
It's good that you came
and you got to meet my friends.

523
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,045
All of them are very beautiful,

524
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,046
but Katy is…

525
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,548
the most beautiful.

526
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm always the prettiest.

527
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,803
I have to tell you something.

528
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
I went to meet my mother-in-law.

529
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,682
And then? Did you?

530
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,185
And then…

531
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,354
She said she has a new granddaughter now.

532
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,689
- Oh my God!
- What?

533
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,107
- How beautiful!
- You're kidding!

534
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,943
And that she's very happy.

535
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,737
Amazing!

536
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:35,036
And she said I didn't need to be afraid,
because having a child is not a problem.

537
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,497
- That's great! Halleluiah!
- That a child is a blessing.

538
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,082
And that she still loves me.

539
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,504
That's good news. That's-That's… Wow!

540
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,672
My God, Danny!

541
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,423
Now, look!

542
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,718
No, no.

543
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,887
Now you buy one for her.

544
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,846
Yes!

545
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,056
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah!

546
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,432
Can we get married now?

547
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,850
Give me my ring.

548
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,353
Yeah she wants now.

549
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,357
We are so happy for you, babe.

550
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,692
I'm so happy too!

551
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,237
Guys, I also have something to tell.

552
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,072
- Mm!
- We went to Namsan Tower.

553
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,282
- Oh!
- For the first time.

554
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:18,121
Yeah, it's like a postal card of Korea.
So amazing, so beautiful, right?

555
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:23,793
And it's so romantic, the ambiance there,
and it was amazing, right?

556
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,919
Yes.

557
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,587
Do you kiss her? You kissed her?

558
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,507
- The first kiss then?
- Oh…

559
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,508
Y-yes!

560
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,470
Danny! Danny! Danny!

561
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,349
Danny! Danny! Danny!

562
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,059
Kiss again.

563
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,644
No, no.

564
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,438
- I want to see that.
- Let's dance!

565
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,815
Great idea.

566
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,947
Do it like this.

567
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,627
Are you okay?

568
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,007
You made a wish when you came…

569
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,884
A wish?

570
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,219
- Yeah.
- In Cheonggyecheon.

571
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,638
- Hmm?
- You tossed a coin, right?

572
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,188
In Cheonggyecheon, I wished
for my friends to have a good time here.

573
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,941
- Spend the time here?
- Mm?

574
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,277
I wished for the girls…

575
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,571
A good time here,

576
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,408
and we go back to Brazil.

577
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,123
I feel like crying.

578
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,416
Oh, so sad.

579
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,545
Weren't you crying just now?

580
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,089
I cried a lot.

581
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,299
I don't usually cry.

582
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,806
When you're in Brazil,

583
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,933
DM me.

584
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,435
- What?
- DM. Insta DM.

585
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,649
Oh…

586
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:25,331
What if you meet someone
cooler than me? No?

587
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
So sad.

588
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,341
You met a lot of people.

589
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:41,597
Who are probably pretty similar.
And you're a good person.

590
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,349
- Me?
- Yeah.

591
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,517
I'm crazy.

592
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,811
- Oh no!
- I'm a little crazy.

593
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,979
Oh, a little?

594
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,605
Uh-huh.

595
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,610
When you go back to Brazil,
you'll remember your country, right?

596
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,573
Will you remember me?

597
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,366
- You?
- Yeah.

598
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,789
I'm glad you came here, Camila,
and that I got to meet you.

599
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,010
Have a safe trip back.
And let's keep in touch.

600
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,847
Bye. Yeah.

601
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,141
- Oh, this Braz-Brazil.
- Brazil way?

602
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,350
- Yeah.
- Okay.

603
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,562
Bye.

604
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,946
<i>I came here to put an end</i>
<i>to a long chapter of my life.</i>

605
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:44,452
<i>To start over,</i>
<i>some stories need to come to an end.</i>

606
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,623
<i>And a new chapter doesn't always</i>
<i>have room for someone new.</i>

607
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,393
Bring me that sparkly drink!
Twinkle, twinkle, babe!

608
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,416
The worst part of the trip…

609
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,793
Is leaving, right?

610
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,253
…is when it's over.

611
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,630
It went by so fast, right?

612
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,048
But it was so intense.

613
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,716
It was. What we experienced here--

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,387
Oh my God, my little duck.
A happy family reunited.

615
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,848
- What does it mean? I never understood.
- I'm afraid of breaking it.

616
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,352
It's a symbol because
ducks never separate from each other.

617
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,856
So, Su-woong and I will never split up.

618
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,945
<i>We came to Korea to find out</i>
<i>if K-dramas exist in real life.</i>

619
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,865
<i>I'm sure that they do.</i>

620
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,870
<i>I prefer to tell my story another way.</i>

621
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,917
<i>For me, it's a mix of different things.</i>

622
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
I'm going to miss that too.

623
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,671
Waking up, Morena,

624
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,632
and you being there at the counter
already waiting for me with coffee.

625
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,591
Oh, okay.

626
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,386
- So we can gossip about life.
- Wow, this is so heavy.

627
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,762
Damn, the suitcase is heavy.

628
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,264
It wasn't like that, huh?

629
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,975
- What's in there? It wasn't like that.
- Let me put the bag here.

630
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,351
Hey, Luanny!

631
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,395
Let's go. The car is here.

632
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,105
Let's go, Lu.

633
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,815
I'm not going with you guys.

634
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,108
What?

635
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,820
Si-won is picking me up. I'm going
to spend more time here in Korea.

636
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,074
- Why?
- Are you serious?

637
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,911
After I met his mom, I wanted to learn
more about his family and about him.

638
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,456
I think I'll stay a little longer.

639
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,124
Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you.

640
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,167
Give me a hug!

641
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,377
Group hug. Everyone together!

642
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,885
Guys, let's go, or we'll miss the car.

643
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,055
Yeah, we'll miss
the car, the flight, everything.

644
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,767
- You better text us, okay?
- Yeah, send us a message. Bye, Lu.

645
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,312
- Send us a text. God bless.
- Thank you for this experience.

646
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,153
<i>With or without a K-drama,</i>
<i>I believe in love.</i>

647
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,410
THREE MONTHS LATER

648
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,708
BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL
