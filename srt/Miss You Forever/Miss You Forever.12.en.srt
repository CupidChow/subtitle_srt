00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,440
[Episode 12]

4
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,510
This one and the one Bai Rui had

5
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,910
were made in the same place.

6
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,310
There's blood on the box.

7
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,720
It's too spooky here.

8
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,860
Maybe we should leave.

9
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,000
There are so many people with the living's positive energy,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,880
which ghosts fear.

11
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,900
If you leave us, ghosts will target you first.

12
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,910
The blood on Master Yuan Ji

13
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,640
is someone else's.

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,630
The bloodstains

15
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,289
were in a spatter pattern,

16
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,440
indicating the victim was injured face-on.

17
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,229
However, there's no sign

18
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,539
of dragging the body nearby,

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,710
suggesting the victim is still alive.

20
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,420
Besides,

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
the blood has turned brownish-red,

22
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,110
so Master Yuan Ji has been dead for more than a day.

23
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,190
He died before that person got injured

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,800
or he died when attacking that person.

25
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,050
By the way,

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,190
yesterday, the receptionist

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,830
saw some guests talking to Master Yuan Ji

28
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,440
with a Southwest accent.

29
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,230
Qingji Silver.

30
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,410
Southwest.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Pingzhou.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Hanging corpses.

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,160
Not for money.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,370
Fake suicides.

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,160
Sagebrush

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,220
on the Snow.

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,160
Xi'er.

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,430
What's wrong?

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,610
I don't know if leaving Liu Yu'an

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,860
alone in the capital

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,020
is a good idea.

42
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,829
This trip will be dangerous.

43
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,829
I think he'll be safe in the capital.

44
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,160
I'll go check on him.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
You must be tired

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,390
as we rushed here from afar.

47
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,000
Now,

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,930
only your grilled fish

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,530
can calm me down.

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,470
Master

51
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,710
gave it to me before we parted.

52
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,110
It has been with me for many years.

53
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,329
I'll give it to you.

54
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,880
He joked that

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,130
when he passed away,

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,920
it might be more valuable.

57
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,320
I just realized that

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,450
we are truly separated

59
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,930
by the boundary of life and death.

60
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,100
Honey,

61
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,140
you seem to like showing your weakness in front of me.

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,860
Fine.

63
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,600
It's not funny.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,050
I'm not good at comforting others,

65
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,680
but if you wish,

66
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,810
I'll stay by your side.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,930
More than ten years ago,

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
there was a child

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,110
who survived the bloodshed.

70
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,130
It's him

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,260
who brought the child back to Dazhao.

72
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,250
He gave the child an identity

73
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,310
and a place to stay.

74
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,130
He taught the child to read

75
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,990
and told him right from wrong.

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,850
They were teacher and student,

77
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,670
but they were more like brothers.

78
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,270
I thought

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I was finally going to have a family.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,600
But now,

81
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm rootless again.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,790
Li Mengjue.

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,170
I have no one to rely on anymore.

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,730
In front of me,

85
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,600
you can be vulnerable.

86
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,420
Whenever

87
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,460
and wherever,

88
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,930
I'll listen to

89
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,840
your every word with patience.

90
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,150
Look.

91
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,880
He's carrying too much burden.

92
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,440
But now he has her.

93
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,760
The grilled fish is almost ready.

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,490
We have to wait a little longer.

95
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,840
Tell me.

96
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,720
Where did Xi'er

97
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,840
learn her medical skills from?

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Do you suspect Xi'er?

99
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,440
Master's death

100
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,240
is Sagebrush on the Snow's killing style.

101
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,830
But I didn't see Sagebrush on the Snow at the scene.

102
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,730
Jing Yan saw Master

103
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,860
holding something in his hand.

104
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,570
Did you see it later?

105
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,600
Lu Xi'er was the only one

106
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,470
who had touched the body.

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,810
You men are all the same.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,320
You say you don't suspect her,

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,580
but you think of a woman as evil as a demon.

110
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,800
Have you seen this?

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
What is this?

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
This incense powder

113
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,830
was scattered

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,320
along the road on our journey.

115
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,030
Its fragrance

116
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,670
is not noticeable,

117
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,240
but it's not impossible for others

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,450
to trace us by following it.

119
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,710
Have you been to Pingzhou?

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,040
No.

121
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
Why are you here?

122
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
Why not?

123
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,920
Can't I come?

124
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,940
Find a man named Du Shaoqing in Pingzhou.

125
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,030
I will write a letter to Leader myself.

126
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,830
I want you

127
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,830
to kill him.

128
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,580
I don't like you commanding me.

129
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,950
This is

130
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,650
interesting.

131
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,600
This is really a good show.

132
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,290
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

133
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,760
Kill me?

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,920
I think you should worry about yourself first.

135
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,760
You're the one who scattered the incense powder.

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
I can explain.

137
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,970
I don't want to listen.

138
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,730
You two really make a great couple.

139
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,350
Is this all that Flower Tower is capable of?

140
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,470
Even a nobody

141
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,850
can bluster here.

142
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Anyway,

143
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,790
this is a matter between us as a couple.

144
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,170
It's none of your business.

145
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,790
Mr. Xie,

146
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
don't you want to know

147
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,610
how much Miss Li has been hiding from you?

148
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,860
This is between us as a couple.

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,040
We will handle it ourselves.

150
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,960
Couple. Couple. Couple.

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,230
Mr. Xie,

152
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
you seem to be getting too involved.

153
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,300
Flower Tower does know a lot.

154
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,020
Who exactly are you?

155
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,060
Someone who's here to tell you the truth.

156
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
Master's clothes.

157
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,060
Come with me.

158
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,000
Trust me.

159
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,030
What's your relationship with Du Shaoqing?

160
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,160
What do you have to do

161
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,940
with my master's death?

162
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,720
It really wasn't me.

163
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,590
Trust me.

164
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,660
Li Mengjue.

165
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,380
it's best if I never

166
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,550
find out what you're hiding.

167
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll explain to him when we get to Pingzhou tomorrow.
