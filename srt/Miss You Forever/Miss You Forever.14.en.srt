[Episode 14]

4
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,710
What's wrong?

5
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,070
Nothing.

6
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,789
Mr. Jing,

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,100
are you scared?

8
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,510
Anyway, you found Xi'er.

9
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,640
Don't worry.

10
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,150
What's wrong?

11
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,500
According to Jing Yan,

12
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,860
Xi'er passed out in the alley alone.

13
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,210
Why did that procuress go to great lengths

14
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,070
to take Xi'er away?

15
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,420
Everything today

16
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,140
is so strange.

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,759
What else?

18
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,970
According to the procuress,

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,860
Yin Sanniang is an unlicensed prostitute.

20
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,390
The fish market is filthy and foul-smelling.

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
Ordinary women can't avoid it more.

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,590
Moreover, her husband and child died.

23
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,180
As an unlicensed prostitute

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,350
in such a place,

25
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,870
how many patrons can she possibly have?

26
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,920
Today, that maid

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,710
led us to the Flower Tower

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,220
and that procuress stalled for time.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,430
Besides kidnapping Xi'er,

30
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,770
there must be another reason.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,220
In the vast city of Pingzhou,

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,540
they target us

33
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,220
and it's related to Sagebrush on the Snow.

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,890
Either we have a spy among us

35
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,660
or someone's spying on us.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,070
I understand what you mean.

37
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,040
About Yin Sanniang,

38
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,670
let's investigate it tomorrow.

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,510
OK.

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,510
Pingzhou is so big.

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,820
asking around one by one

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,540
if anyone knows Yin Sanniang

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,580
will take forever.

44
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,710
I'll get you some food.

45
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,060
Please.

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,570
It's you.

47
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,510
How did you end up like this?

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,510
What about the money I gave you before?

49
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,579
It was dark and windy

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,500
in the daytime.

51
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,690
I was walking alone in the dangerous bamboo forest.

52
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,430
Suddenly,

53
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,990
I heard cries.

54
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,020
I rushed forward to help.

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,660
And then,

56
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,580
I encountered a bandit.

57
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,600
We fought hard.

58
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,440
I find it hard to believe.

59
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,089
I got robbed.

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,200
I was robbed shortly after leaving the city.

61
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,670
Come on.

62
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,830
It's okay now.

63
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,030
It's not what you think.

64
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,690
Xi'er.

65
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,460
Xi'er!

66
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,420
Xi'er!

67
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,180
Xi'er!

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,430
You guys eat.

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,630
So, now

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,530
you can't find out where Yin Sanniang is

71
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,860
and have no other ideas.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,230
I have to say

73
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,160
you guys

74
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,830
need me a lot.

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,180
To deliver the bride to the Divine Man, a sorceress needs to be there.

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,420
You don't know where Yin Sanniang is.

77
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,170
The sorceress must know.

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,990
Do you know where the sorceress is?

79
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,830
To be honest,

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,780
I'm now the legitimate heir of the Beggar Sect.

81
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,840
Of course I know.

82
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,170
But

83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,670
you can go if you want.

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm not going.

85
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,550
You can't go either.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,790
Stop pretending to be mysterious.

87
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,300
It hurts.

88
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,830
That sorceress

89
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,510
is a little weird.

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,350
It's so dirty.

91
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,110
Killers again.

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,670
This body

93
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,460
won't be easy to be buried.

94
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,520
Any information about Yin Sanniang?

95
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,120
I don't want this.

96
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,820
I want this.

97
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,390
Now we know

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,830
where Yin Sanniang lives.

99
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,230
We'll go there tomorrow.

100
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,130
Sorry for making you go through this.

101
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,040
Were you jealous

102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,980
in the coffin shop just now?

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,790
No.

104
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,260
That day in the bamboo forest...

105
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,110
I...

106
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,470
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,110
It's your own fault for being so talkative.

108
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,320
Don't blame me.

109
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,210
What's that smell?

110
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,080
It stinks.

111
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,160
Just a bluff.

112
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,660
This painting is wrong.

113
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,430
The left lapel should be on the top.
