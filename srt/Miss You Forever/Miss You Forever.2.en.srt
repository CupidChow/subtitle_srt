[Episode 2]

4
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,550
Have another drink with me.

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,289
[Flower Tower]

6
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,560
Let go of me.

7
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,910
Loafing skirt-chaser.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Get off me!

9
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,510
Do you know who my brother is?

10
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,080
Careful, or I'll have him come for you.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Just you wait.

12
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,630
Thank you, Miss.

13
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,270
Stop.

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,080
Stop!

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,160
Pay up.

16
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,580
Ten taels.

17
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,090
We are both women.

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,700
Why are you making things difficult for another woman?

19
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,370
Should I have risked my life to save you just because I'm a woman?

20
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,510
Pay up.

21
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,910
Okay.

22
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,080
It's late.

23
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,630
Honey, why are you still up?

24
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,000
Honey, do you have

25
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,450
any injuries on your body?

26
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,930
Why don't I go in and take a look?

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
W-W-What is this?

28
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,280
I dropped my hairpin.

29
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,290
Let me get it.

30
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,870
Here.

31
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,150
How can I trouble you, Honey?

32
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,530
Well...

33
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,900
You're welcome.

34
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,760
Honey, why are there

35
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,360
so many wounds on your arms?

36
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,950
When I was a child, I was with my relatives in the capital

37
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,760
but they abducted me and sold me.

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
I refused to obey them.

39
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,110
Honey, don't cry.

40
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,110
I can't stand women crying.

41
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that family

42
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,510
from the capital?

43
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,190
They are from the east of the city.

44
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,920
The east?

45
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,409
The Liu Residence?

46
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Honey.

47
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,730
My head suddenly hurts.

48
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,310
I don't want to think back about it anymore.

49
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,910
I want to rest.

50
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,330
Why am I back here?

51
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,000
Why did I have this dream again?

52
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,580
Sagebrush on the Snow has been hiding for many years.

53
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,040
Why did they appear today?

54
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
But the same method of death

55
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,560
doesn't make it the work of Sagebrush on the Snow.

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,090
After all, we caught the wrong person before.

57
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,310
Am I right, Mr. Xie?

58
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,170
You've got a lot of nerve now.

59
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,240
You're talking back to me?

60
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,530
I know...

61
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,700
I was wrong.

62
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,270
Please forgive me.

63
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,640
What is it?

64
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,280
My lord.

65
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,280
It has something to do with the people sneaking around in the forest.

66
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,600
[Sagebrush on the Snow is the key to the Sea Chart]

67
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,010
That's information that we worked so hard to get!

68
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,450
I was thinking,

69
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,590
with your personality,

70
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,350
how did you assume

71
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,270
the position of Young Minister of the Supreme Court?

72
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,780
Now that I think about it, there've been very few people who have the right qualities and skills.

73
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,110
You are indeed a genius.

74
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,350
Cut the nonsense.

75
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,550
You're just pretending and you're making me anxious.

76
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,140
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you.

77
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,500
Boring.

78
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,160
The news just now has nothing to do with Sagebrush on the Snow.

79
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,260
It's fake?

80
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,800
Keep an eye on the Liu Residence for me.

81
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,260
When the time comes, we'll settle the score.

82
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,670
What do you mean?
