I didn't expect Pingzhou

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,310
to be so remote.

7
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,040
The war ten years ago

8
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,720
led to the closure of the market.

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,130
People avoided this area due to superstitions.

10
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,250
But it's still

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,860
strangely desolate.

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,590
Let's go take a look.

13
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,560
It stinks.

14
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,400
Something is fishy.

15
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,530
Be careful.

16
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,789

23
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,090

Two Pingzhou cities.

30
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,430
There are two Pingzhou cities.

31
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,590
One is deserted,

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360

Who is she?

42
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
In my opinion,

43
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,270
women should stay at home

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,550
and practice music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

45
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,950
Look at your wife here,

46
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,570
helping retrieve bodies.

47
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,630
It's not good for her reputation.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
She's helping people.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,670
How come in this day and age,

50
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,470
even saving lives can be shameful?

51
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,590
If she were a man,

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,620
you'd be singing her praises.

53
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,950
But because she's a woman...

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,350
For most people,

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,360

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,770

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,910
She made herself strong

59

63

Sagebrush on the Snow

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,490
appeared in my Young Miss's room.

you may not know,

but Pingzhou

83
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,550
has been plagued by strange occurrences since ten years ago.

84
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,160
We frequently heard the hooting of owls.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,690
People who went out at night

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,760
could even hear the sounds of carts and horses in the mountains.

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,600
But when we sent people

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,290
to investigate in broad daylight,

89
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,890
we found nothing.

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,800
Yes.

91
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,580
Also, the old city often reeked of decay.

92
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,340
So, residents moved to the outskirts,

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,880
establishing another Pingzhou city.

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
Did the government do nothing?

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,270
Sir, in Pingzhou,

96
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,370
the Divine Man is more trusted than the government.

97
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,270
Even the relocation of the city five years ago

98
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,730
was the order of the Divine Man.

99
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,600
The Divine Man?

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,760

102
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,040
In short,

103
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,910
the Divine Man saved Pingzhou

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,430
and protected us.

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,110
According to what you said,

Sagebrush on the Snow

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
should be a virtuous person.

But why is he continuously

109

110
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,440
Since we've received divine blessings,

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,240
we should pay reverence and offerings.
