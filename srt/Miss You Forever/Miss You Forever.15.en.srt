00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,490
[Episode 15]

4
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,790
Only the dead put the right lapel on the top.

5
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,269
Seven layers of candles.

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,289
Divine banners of five colors.

7
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,750
Prolong life.

8
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,720
Revive the soul.

9
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,770
Yin Sanniang isn't a believer in Buddhas, is she?

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,000
She lives in poverty,

11
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,400
yet she possesses such exquisite Buddhist beads,

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,880
with each bead glistening.

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
She must often play with them.

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,039
Jing Yan.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,039
I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,350
Let's go back first.

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,920
Why did you lie for me,

18
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,520
telling them I collapsed in the alley that day?

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,460
You knew

20
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,390
I left the Flower Tower on my own.

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,829
I hate you.

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,700
That's Beiman's language.

23
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,590
What did you see?

24
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,750
You won't hurt us,

25
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,790
right?

26
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,630
No.

27
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,550
Never.

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,940
That's enough.

29
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,350
You explained.

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
To you and you only,

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,160
I'll always keep my word.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,760
I believe you'll do the same.

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,210
I believe in you.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
I read something special

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,390
in your eyes.

36
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,250
Did she come to you?

37
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,680
Did he?

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,610
But I believe

39
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,110
Jing Yan and Xi'er

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,110
will never hurt us.

41
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,190
Sir, buy a pouch.

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Buy it for your wife.

43
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,370
It's the best way to express lovesickness.

44
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,880
According to what you said,

45
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,280
you've lost the thread of Yin Sanniang's story.

46
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
In my opinion,

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,430
rumors about Sagebrush on the Snow

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,839
are just nonsense.

49
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,339
For one,

50
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,960
His Majesty asked me to come to Pingzhou

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,720
to investigate Sagebrush on the Snow.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,490
And also,

53
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,890
I have to uncover the truth

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
for my and Miss Li's family.

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,370
No one asked you to come to Pingzhou.

56
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,930
Forget what I said.

57
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,950
Forget it.

58
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,640
I have an idea.

59
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,360
Since our enemies are hidden in the dark,

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
we can lure them out.

61
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,400
I have to find out

62
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,920
who they are.

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Xi'er.

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,590
Pretend to be the bride?

65
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,140
No.

66
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,280
At worst,

67
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,240
we can go to that sorceress again tomorrow.

68
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,050
Honey,

69
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,640
are you sure you can do it again?

70
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,870
Then...

71
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,320
Honey,

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,380
do you have any good ideas?

73
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,920
Honey,

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,050
are you satisfied?

75
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,990
Not bad.

76
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,570
Feels like something's missing.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,680
I've prepared everything that needs to be prepared.

78
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,990
I need a maid.

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,230
Will it work?

80
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,170
Why not?

81
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,150
Sweetie.

82
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,100
One maid is enough.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,270
What?

84
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,110
Are you worried about me?

85
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm afraid you'll die a terrible death.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,300
Both of you are dressed in red.

87
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,240
One is disguised as a man, and the other, as a woman.

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
Are you going to get married?

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,810
It will be dawn soon.

90
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,400
The sorceress has been waiting for a long time.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,980
Let's set off early.

92
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,180
Xi'er, you'd better stay here.

93
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,320
Xi'er is always under my wife's full protection.

94
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,730
I wonder when

95
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,650
I can get treated like this.

96
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,480
Come with me.

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,380
For me?

98
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,520
Did you buy it for me?

99
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,630
I found it on the street.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,430
Looks roughly made.

101
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,050
So, you can have it.

102
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,690
Then I don't want it.

103
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,880
I was joking.

104
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,360
I know you're a money-grubber.

105
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,470
So, I bought you something you like.

106
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,680
Li Mengjue.

107
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,960
Do you really

108
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,230
not know my feelings toward you?

109
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,800
That day,

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,920
why did you ask me

111
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,150
to lure them away from Yin Sanniang's house?

112
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,080
You just need to do what I ask you to.

113
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
I also need your help

114
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,360
to conceal my identity.

115
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Ridiculous.

116
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,220
Are you bargaining with me?

117
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,300
You're still a bit naive.

118
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
It might be better

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
to just kill you.

120
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,860
Your death

121
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,150
can ignite the hatred of my people.

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,940
It'll be the most powerful weapon

123
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,430
to attack Dazhao.

124
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,470
You can kill me

125
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,070
and you can use me.

126
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,360
You know the pros and cons.

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
So,

128
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,520
do you want to make this deal or not?

129
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,440
It's up to you.
