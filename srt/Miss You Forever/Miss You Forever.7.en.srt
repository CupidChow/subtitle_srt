00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,520
[Episode 7]

4
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,390
It's him.

5
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,860
And it'll only be him.

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,180
If we can't share weal and woe,

7
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,660
nor can we forget each other,

8
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,700
then let's not wish for a life spent together,

9
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,260
but just seize the day instead.

10
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,020
I'll...

11
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,430
take my leave.

12
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,160
Go on my behalf.

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,890
Go home.

14
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,860
Little Dumb.

15
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,270
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,160
Did I scare you?

17
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,940
If you're mad at me,

18
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
you can beat me or scold me.

19
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,680
Did I do something wrong?

20
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,080
Honey, where are you going?

21
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,560
I have to believe in fate now.

22
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,550
I didn't expect to meet you

23
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,290
while I was just wandering.

24
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,070
Why don't you

25
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,210
put away the sword first?

26
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,590
When did you find me out?

27
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,890
Long ago.

28
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,270
I'm so scared.

29
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,000
I…

30
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,900
Honey.

31
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,880
I know

32
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,000
you faked to faint that day.

33
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,180
I dare not lie to you.

34
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,600
No? I'm afraid you lied to me

35
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
more than once.

36
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,050
Your identity is fake.

37
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,970
Bai Rui didn't lend you money.

38
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,790
And it is also not true that the Liu family bullied you.

39
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,520
All your gentleness and weakness were also fake.

40
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,070
What is true about you?

41
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,260
I'm afraid you're just the same.

42
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,220
What you did was just to test me.

43
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,450
Have you recovered from your injury, Honey?

44
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,230
Who on earth are you?

45
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,310
Bai Wugou from the Grim Reapers.

46
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,400
So the rumored demon

47
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,640
only knows these dirty tricks.

48
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,770
I learned from you.

49
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,310
Of course I'm not bad at it.

50
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,070
Kill them!

51
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,430
Go!

52
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,420
I don't need your help.

53
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,340
If we don't fight together,

54
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,620
I'm afraid we'll die here today.

55
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,070
Go after them!

56
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
A bunch of losers!

57
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,620
They can never find out what happened in Pingzhou!

58
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,350
Go after them!

59
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,070
Yes.

60
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,950
You're awake.

61
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
You won't kill me?

62
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,670
My wound…

63
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,370
Did you dress it for me?

64
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
We're a couple.

65
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,970
It's okay to see each other's body.

66
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,000
Why are we here?

67
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,510
Jing Yan brought us back.

68
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,830
He and Xi'er went out to rent a carriage.

69
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,760
Is your wound okay?

70
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,710
You blocked an arrow for me.

71
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,250
It was worth it.

72
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,040
You were looking for the Sea Chart?

73
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
What's your relationship with Bai Rui?

74
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,410
Nothing.

75
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,210
What's your relationship with the Grim Reapers?

76
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,210
The Grim Reapers?

77
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,160
I thought Leader asked you to kill me.

78
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,780
I didn't expect that you were also the target.

79
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,669
Then, I blocked the ill luck for you.

80
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,710
You owe me one.

81
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,740
I've already paid you back.

82
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,000
You're so petty.

83
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,610
You're such a miser.

84
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:43,980
You're cunning!

85
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,340
You're unreasonable!

86
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,150
Mengjue,

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,060
what did you drink?

88
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,470
Why?

89
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,450
There's one thing

90
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
I've never told anyone.

91
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,890
I have sworn on the memorial tablet of the Heavenly Lord

92
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,790
that I would only live for my clan my whole life.

93
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,400
So, I joined the Grim Reapers and looked for the Sea Chart.

94
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,350
I was used to

95
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,710
living in hiding.

96
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,440
But your appearance

97
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,170
was unexpected to me.

98
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,520
I wanted to…

99
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,030
I wanted to keep the secret forever,

100
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,110
but...

101
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,550
but every time I saw you,

102
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,640
these words seemed so heavy

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
that they were about to rush out of my mouth.

104
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,270
Xie Jingshu,

105
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,580
I'm afraid I don't have any time left.

106
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,750
I...

107
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,130
I...

108
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,180
I like you.

109
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,210
I...

110
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,530
like you.
