00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
[Episode 9]

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,570
Where are you going?

5
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,160
When was the last time you saw Bai Rui?

6
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,709
October 16th, at the Liu Residence.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,550
Really?

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,940
If you don't believe me, come with me

9
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,800
and ask my brother face-to-face.

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,789
On what basis?

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,560
On the basis that I'm the younger brother that my brother cares about the most.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,789
Good.

13
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,400
However,

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,580
we need to go somewhere first.

15
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,430
Go faster.

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,850
This place is...

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,720
It is said that

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,520
Bai Rui had a lover named Fang Zhibo in the capital.

19
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,190
"It is said"?

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
It's all nonsense.

21
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,320
Shut up.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,960
You can doubt if you're a man,

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,950
but you can't doubt my news from the Supreme Court.

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,750
It's chicken blood, just like that in Bai Rui's room.

25
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,680
Someone is here.

26
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,770
Stay here.

27
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,920
See?

28
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,180
There are assassins outside.

29
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,980
Bai Rui is dead.

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,390
Good.

31
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,580
That woman was instigated Liu Zhaoming

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,620
to steal our military information and sell it to Beiman.

33
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,020
She even tried to kill me.

34
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,880
Now that she's dead,

35
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,600
it's a blessing to the world, isn't it?

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,790
Who set up the altar outside?

37
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,030
That bitch.

38
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,040
No way.

39
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,910
If you really hate her,

40
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,079
why would you keep the altar she set up?

41
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,540
Fresh fruit.

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,800
And the mourning.

43
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,750
You're indeed infatuated.

44
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,360
Here.

45
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,640
Together?

46
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,790
I’d love to.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
Xi'er, it's dangerous here.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,850
Take him to a safe place.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Little Dumb, take care of yourself.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,160
I...

51
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,950
Miss.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,860
Let's talk it over.

53
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,550
Untie me.

54
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,079
There's a silver ingot on the cabinet.

55
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,079
Just think of it as the remuneration for letting me go.

56
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,950
Not bad.

57
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,750
The acupoint Brain Window is...

58
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:19,750
Stop!

59
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,480
I was wondering who it was.

60
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,830
I sent so many people, but I still can't invite you.

61
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,720
Brother!

62
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,350
Stop! If you go any further,

63
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,470
you'll die.

64
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,070
It is more comfortable here.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
Use this.

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,159
It's sharper.

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,180
He'll die in one slash.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,540
"The younger brother that he cares about the most"?

69
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,540
I will seek credit for you,

70
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,940
and it will atone for your reputation as a playboy.

71
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,680
Do you think

72
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,540
Bai Rui's death

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,990
had something with me?

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,430
Did it not?

75
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,150
Yes.

76
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,960
However,

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,130
killing someone from Beiman is nothing.

78
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,540
Even if His Majesty knows,

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
he won't blame me.

80
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,100
Someone from Beiman?

81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,840
Yes.

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,159
Bai Rui is one.

83
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Fang Zhibo

84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,760
is also one.

85
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,740
They traded information for me voluntarily.

86
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,920
Lord Liu, why are you so kind

87
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,430
to tell us such secret information?

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,320
Because there are only two options in front of you.

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Die or work for me.

90
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,640
Nonsense!

91
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,660
Let's go together.

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,520
Bring her up.

93
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,030
Go.

94
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,100
-Little Dumb.
-Xi'er.

95
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,180
Exchange her with Fang Zhibo.

96
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,710
Don't worry. He won't hurt Xi'er.

97
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,430
Liu Zhaoming is an official.

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,660
How can Xi'er be safe in his hands?

99
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,310
If you fight against him now,

100
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Lu Xi'er will surely die.

101
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,120
You know that.

102
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,650
My birth mother died young.

103
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,240
She wasn't the favored one.

104
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,120
Without you,

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,190
I would have starved to death in the countryside.

106
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,310
It was you who overrode all objections

107
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,770
and took me to the capital.

108
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,690
You took the punishment for me and protected me.

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,750
But why did you do this?

110
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,270
You bought Bai Rui

111
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,430
and let her steal information from Fang Zhibo.

112
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,160
Then, you gave it to those people from Beiman

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
who killed our clan members.

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,190
Am I right?

115
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,110
I did this alone.

116
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,560
It has nothing to do with you.

117
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,810
My Lord,

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
the evidence is here.

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
This time, Liu Zhaoming made a mistake

120
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,360
and caused trouble for himself.

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,170
Now that we're eager to correct our mistakes,

122
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm willing to plead guilty on behalf of my brother.

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,970
My only wish is to spare my brother's life.

124
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,070
This is why you sneaked around the Office of Transmission.

125
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,030
You wanted to turn yourself in for Liu Zhaoming?

126
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Not only that, I'm afraid Liu Zhaoming

127
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,190
deliberately let Liu Yu'an find this letter of yours.

128
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,050
Deliberately?

129
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,110
He wanted Liu Yu'an to report himself

130
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,570
so that he could be spared.

131
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,180
I swear my brother will stop his wrongdoing.

132
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,360
You...

133
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,200
We are adults.

134
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,010
Let's talk about adult stuff.

135
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,840
Indeed,

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,430
you guys are smart.

137
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,520
No matter how hard it is, it's useless.

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,230
This matter per se

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,470
is a dead end.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,950
Tell me, where is Fang Zhibo?

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,240
Fang Zhibo committed suicide.

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,669
My mother is from Beiman.

143
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,390
But I grew up in Dazhao and served in the Guardsmen Command.

144
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,190
I've long thought of myself as a subject of Dazhao.

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,370
I knew why Bai Rui had approached me

146
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,290
and I knew she was a descendant of Beiban.

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,150
But I just liked her.

148
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,020
It was decided by my heart.

149
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,330
I couldn't help liking her.

150
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,000
But Bai Rui's death

151
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,690
was caused by you indirectly.

152
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,160
You said you are a subject of Dazhao.

153
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
You collected information about Dazhao and gave it to Bai Rui

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,180
to divert the disaster to the east,

155
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,180
which caused Bai Rui to be killed.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,460
You said you loved her,

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,330
but you didn't protect her.

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,200
She's become a pawn with which you make yourself appear innocent.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
I never thought of making myself appear innocent.

160
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,690
Once I die,

161
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,740
the Beiman will believe in Liu Zhaoming

162
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,860
and help him leave.

163
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,830
By then, he will be a blade

164
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,660
that Dazhao stabs into Beiman.

165
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,680
Fang Zhibo.

166
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,390
You…

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,770
You were right about one thing.

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
I failed…

169
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,670
to protect her.

170
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,820
Fortunately,

171
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,410
he knew to put the big picture first.

172
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,720
The big picture?

173
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,310
Fang Zhibo is an important official in Dazhao.

174
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,370
He has many pieces of information.

175
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,270
He's just my proof of allegiance.

176
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,760
If Fang Zhibo were still alive,

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,700
how would Beiman trust me?

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
He was your man.

179
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,800
Bai Rui was just a cover.

180
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,070
If he could,

181
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,400
Fang Zhibo would never let Bai Rui die.

182
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,590
For some people, for their loved ones,

183
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,020
even if they were forced to kill someone,

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,710
he would only stab himself.

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,900
Whether they're the people of Dazhao or Beiman,

186
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,870
on such turbulent days,

187
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,920
they are all pitiful people.

188
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,680
But is this kind of sacrifice fair?
