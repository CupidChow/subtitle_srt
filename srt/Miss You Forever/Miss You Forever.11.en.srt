[Episode 11]

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm willing to do my best.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Please allow me to investigate with you

6
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,030
to clear my father's name.

7
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,250
Get up.

8
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,870
Get up.

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
We have the same bitter experience.

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,890
Besides,

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,380
you are already my lawfully wedded wife.

12
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,530
How would I say no?

[Censorate]

14
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,490
Brother.

15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,160
It's so miserable.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,590
Brother!

17
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,530
Do it!

18
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,789
Brother!

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,650
Don't push!

20
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,780
Liu Zhaoming, do you plead guilty?

21
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,610
It's lamentable that

22
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,430
with problems accumulated over generations,

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,030
the country is declining.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,690
I, Liu Zhaoming,

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,210
admit I'm guilty of treason

26
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,230
by colluding with the enemy.

27
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,280
I admit the crime I've done.

28
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,450
But I did it alone.

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,010
It has nothing to do with others.

30
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,090
Brother!

31
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,130
You ungrateful rascal.

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,120
How dare you collude with others to kill me?

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,890
You almost ruined my plan.

34
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,680
I never regarded you as my true brother.

35
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,280
Brother, wait for me!

36
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,360
Wait for me.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
I'll go find someone now.

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,080
Brother!

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
What should I do?

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Brother!

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,000
Who can save my brother?

42
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,690
Brother!

43
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,050
Get up.

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,250
Please...

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,090
Please save my brother.

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,620
Do you think your brother

47
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,550
would want to see you like this?

48
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,280
Why do you think

49
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,910
he used you as a hostage?

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,140
Liu Zhaoming is drawing a line between you two

51
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,810
to protect you.

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,550
And what about you?

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,780
Mr. Jing of the Supreme Court is here.

54
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,060
Mr. Jing, everyone praises you

55
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,890
for being as pure as jade.

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,580
But here we are, entangled in this world.

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,490
After I die,

58
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,070
the Liu family will be disgraced.

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,370
Liu Zhaoming!

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,500
Everyone will avoid him like the plague.

61
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,440
I don't expect you

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,380
to take extra care of Liu Yu'an.

63
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,260
You can make him your servant.

64
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,780
Step back.

65
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,530
But please spare his life.

66
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,770
Brother!

67
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,300
Let's go.

68
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Brother!

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,650
Brother!

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,159
Brother!

71
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,610
When Jing Yan comes back,

72
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,350
we'll set off for Pingzhou.

73
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,280
Sister.

74
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,580
Are we going to keep what happened to Liu Zhaoming

75
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,900
from Mr. Liu?

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,210
If he knows, we'll feel resentful.

77
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,130
Resentment breeds rebellion.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,330
Rather than letting him throw straws against the wind,

79
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,650
keeping him carefree

80
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,560
is not necessarily a bad thing.

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,820
I wonder if Liu Zhaoming can carry out his plan well.

82
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,100
People from Beiman are not fools.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,360
What he told Fang Zhibo

84
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,750
and us

85
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,540
is not necessarily true.

86
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,050
I brought him here from the Censorate.

87
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,490
Liu Zhaoming will be executed tomorrow.

88
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,680
People from Beiman will definitely try to rescue him.

89
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,400
This way,

90
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,170
he can continue

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720
to carry out his plans.

92
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,720
Once he leaves, it'll be years.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,940
I wonder

94
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,370
if he can return to Dazhao in the future.

95
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,000
He's so loyal to Dazhao

96
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,170
that he risked his life to infiltrate into Beiman.

97
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,830
In the end, he'll only bear disgrace

98
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,150
in Dazhao for the rest of his life.

99
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,300
Then...

100
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,760
He...

101
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,370
He will follow us from now on.

102
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,090
Your Highness, something happened to Master Yuan Ji.

103
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,810
Master gave me a new life.

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,159
I don't believe

105
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
he died like that.

106
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,950
Xi'er.

107
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,929
What can you tell?

108
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,730
It's strange.

109
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,850
What did you notice?

110
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,980
What did you notice?

111
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,350
If he was hanged,

112
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,970
the rope would cross around his neck.

113
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,430
There might be scratches on his fingernails.

114
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,490
If he hung himself,

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,400
the rope would leave a mark like the Chinese character "eight" behind his head

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
while the rope doesn't cross.

117
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
No external injuries and no signs of struggle.

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,880
It's more like

119
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,030
his body was hung

120
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,680
after a natural death.

121
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,290
Let's look for clues.

122
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,850
There's no sign of forced entry,

123
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
but the room is messy.

124
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,090
They must have been looking for something.

125
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,750
Did you see anything missing?

126
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,890
This happened

127
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
as soon as I left the capital.

128
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,580
Don't you find it suspicious?

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,210
But your appointment letter

130
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,140
was given by His Majesty in person.

131
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,010
We are the only ones

132
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,020
who know you are going to Pingzhou.

133
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,700
You...

134
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,450
Why are you looking at me?

135
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,700
Give it to me.

136
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,090
It's just a silver ingot. You have to take it away?

137
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,850
Silver?

138
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,900
This and the one Bai Rui had

139
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,500
are made in the same place.

140
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,890
There's blood on the box.
