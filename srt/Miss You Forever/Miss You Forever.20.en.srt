[Miss You Forever]

3
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,290
[Episode 20]

4
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,860
It turns out that from the beginning to the end,

5
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,190
you've been one of them.

6
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,810
It was you

7
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,350
who set up this well-designed trap.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,780
And I

9
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,780
was just a chesspiece to you.

10
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
Why me?

11
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,039
[Complete the show till the end.]

12
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,440
I've said that I cherish and love

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,730
this chess game.

14
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,550
Back then, Dazhao was defeated in the battle.

15
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,050
Only by devising a plan

16
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,590
to arouse all the people's aspirations

17
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,600
can we get rid of the plight.

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,750
We are just a fake couple after all.

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,979
We were wearing masks when we first met.

20
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,110
I had thought that the false love between us

21
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,570
could be ignored totally.

22
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,430
But when our masks were removed,

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,550
everything became different.

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,230
It turns out that from the beginning to the end,

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,900
helping the Lihuo Sect to take the royal power

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,370
has been an excuse.

27
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,800
You guys are the ones

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,810
who want to benefit from the chaos

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,370
and enjoy the fruits acquired by others.

30
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,980
It was you

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,829
who pretended to be dead regardless of the cost,

32
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,490
framed Sagebrush on the Snow,

33
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,750
suspected Lu Xi'er,

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,220
and lured us to Pingzhou,

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,870
causing internal disputes between us.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,579
No.

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,860
I don't care about the so-called

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,530
Sagebrush on the Snow.

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,670
Then what do you want?

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,060
A reason.

41
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,990
A reason to dispatch troops.

42
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,430
Now Beiman is in a weak state.

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,910
The Saintess had better die in Dazhao.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,310
Is there a better time than this?

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
So,

46
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,620
you asked assassins to take action again and again.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,020
After the Saintess dies,

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,180
the two armies will have a justified reason

49
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,860
to kill people.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,380
You're so cruel.

51
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,360
Killing an innocent person

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,300
can bring peace to the world.

53
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,760
You talked about bringing peace to the world.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,820
Then let me ask you.

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,500
What is the world?

56
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,320
Those people whom you're going to kill

57
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,930
constitute the world.

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,880
We used to be strangers to each other after all.

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,130
This is the best for

60
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,980
both him and me.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,310
So,

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,920
you still remember your mission.

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,300
I've told you all the details

64
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,550
of his whereabouts.

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,110
I also want to know

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,970
the whereabouts of Sagebrush on the Snow.

67
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,920
Do you have to stir up the storm?

68
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,120
Not me.

69
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Second Prince.

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,780
What? I don't look like that?

71
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,890
Or...

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,100
I can only be Mr. Yunshan?

73
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,230
[Rebellion]

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,430
How is it?

75
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,630
This calligraphy looks vivid like a flying bird,

76
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,170
and graceful like clouds.

77
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,220
Read it out.

78
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,390
It's not that you don't dare to do it.

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,680
You just don't want to do it.

80
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
For this word,

81
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,110
you've already done it.

82
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,060
I thought all the members of the Grim Reapers were desperadoes

83
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
and wouldn't have any love affairs.

84
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,950
I

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,230
won't see him again.

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,610
You two

87
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,990
will never meet again indeed.

88
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,430
Where on earth did you guys go?

89
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,890
Why was there an assassin?

90
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,610
It was all my fault.

91
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,030
I was late when I came.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,300
He's resting now.

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,210
Even till now, I still don't dare to recall it.

94
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,420
For the so-called obsession in my mind,

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,990
I set up a trap,

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,930
and persisted in my own opinions stubbornly.

97
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,860
In the end,

98
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,560
I suffered a thorough defeat.

99
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,210
Xie Jingshu.

100
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,990
I still lost in the end.

101
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,530
Don't cry.

102
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,150
Don't talk about it openly.

103
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,950
Someone might eavesdrop on us.

104
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,670
Dear, please continue to act in this show with me.

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,740
Xie Jingshu was just a small lesson for you.

106
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,740
It was due to the face that

107
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,910
you didn't do your best.

108
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,659
You're such a cold-hearted man.

109
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,490
You're just a civilian from an uncivilized place.

110
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,150
It won't be a pity if you die.

111
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,020
This is fate.

112
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,540
I'd rather die on the battlefild

113
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,740
than accept fate.

114
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,770
Aren't you afraid of death?

115
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,020
Yes, I am.

116
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Why would I not be afraid of death?

117
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,750
As long as you tell me

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,390
where the Saintess is...

119
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,730
It won't be a pity if I die alone.

120
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Seeing you fail to achieve your goal in the end,

121
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,650
I feel so happy.

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,030
The second eldest prince planned the assassination.

123
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,490
Why don't you go to see His Majesty directly?

124
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,799
What a man with wild ambitions.

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,470
If you want to collude with the vassal states,

126
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,530
aren't you afraid that he'll tell His Majesty about it?

127
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,190
He doesn't dare to do it.

128
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,000
It's also impossible that he would do it.

129
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,200
Stop!

130
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,630
It's too late.

131
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Give it to him now.

132
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,830
If he's tired of being Marquis Dingbei,

133
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,880
I don't mind depriving him of this title.

134
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,430
Known as the son of Marquis Dingbei,

135
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,470
actually, he is just a dog raised by my father.

136
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,650
His Majesty wanted to set up a flag for Beihuang,

137
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,300
and Dazhao needed

138
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,500
a young Beihuang general who could encourage the people,

139
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,600
so I gave him this chance.

140
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,270
I gave this chance to Xie Jingshu, who had no real power.

141
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,950
In this round,

142
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,980
just go to hell with him.

143
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,730
Go inside.

144
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,820
Thank you.

145
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,460
Thank you for helping me at my most difficult time.

146
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,660
Thank you.

147
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Thank you for understanding my difficulties.

148
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,950
Thank you.

149
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Xie Jingshu.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,660
Do you know I feel so lucky that

151
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,450
God has let us meet each other?

152
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,170
I go on living

153
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,920
for the sake of you.

154
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,890
Only with you

155
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,090
can I have the meaning of life.

156
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
How did you know that it was just a temporary expedient

157
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,830
for me to go back to Du Shaoqing?

158
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,390
When you returned to the capital that day,

159
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,870
I thought of the fragrance powder on the way to Pingzhou.

160
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,900
Therefore, I could guess part of the reason why

161
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,070
you went to see Mr. Yunshan.

162
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,000
But Du Shaoqing and Mr. Yunshan were trying to provoke you.

163
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,030
You still felt angry in the end.

164
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,620
Yes.

165
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,530
I knew they were trying to provoke me,

166
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,520
but I couldn't help being suspicious.

167
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,100
That's human nature.

168
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,900
However, if others hit me or scold me,

169
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,340
I can bear it.

170
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,720
Only you, Li Mengjue,

171
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,330
hurt my heart

172
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
and made me unable to recover again.

173
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,860
Xie Jingshu.

174
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,550
You're a descendant of the royal family

175
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,850
and a marquis that rules many people.

176
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,270
How would I be the only one by your side?

177
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,390
It's enough to have you only.

178
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,390
I thought I could protect you,

179
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,320
but you were still put into prison because of me.

180
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,200
Now that you and I are trapped here,

181
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,590
I'm worried that I won't have a chance to tell you.

182
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,700
Li Mengjue.

183
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Remember.

184
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,230
My...

185
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,150
My love for you

186
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,150
will last forever.

187
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
