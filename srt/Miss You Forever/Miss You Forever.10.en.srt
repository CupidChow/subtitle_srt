00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,620
[Episode 10]

4
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,590
It has been five years since then.

5
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,910
If we succeed today,

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
we can wash away that shame.

7
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,310
Let her go!

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,370
Little Dumb.

9
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,190
Xi'er, are you alright?

10
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,050
Honey, what are you doing?

11
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,070
Recent events indicate that

12
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,550
you're a high-level government official.

13
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,080
I've checked the stable of the Xie Residence.

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
There are special horses bred there.

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm sure they are raised as Dazhao's standards of military horses.

16
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,930
You're a military officer who's been stationed outside for years.

17
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,759
So what if I am?

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
So what if I'm not?

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,510
I've told you if you dare deceive me,

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I will kill you without hesitation.

21
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,729
I believe you.

22
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm Xie Jingshu, a military governor under Dingbei Marquis.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,980
I wonder how you

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,470
will react when you meet Dingbei Marquis.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,960
In five days, there will be a celebration at Dingbei Marquis's Residence.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
I invite you to go with me.

27
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,920
Master.

28
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,730
Good tea needs to be savored with a calm mind.

29
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,940
The road to success is strewn with setbacks.

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,450
What do you mean by this?

31
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,090
Master.

32
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,850
I've been lying low in the capital

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
as you suggest.

34
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,430
But now, Sagebrush on the Snow has reappeared.

35
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,010
I've been waiting for five years.

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,510
Master,

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,590
I must find out the truth.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
How many eyes

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,760
are watching you now,

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,960
both in court and out?

41
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,910
You are the son of the former Dingbei Marquis.

42
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,630
Since the rebellion incident,

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,030
the people of both Beiman

44
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,430
and Dazhao have lost trust in you.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,740
By taking such risks,

46
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,110
you'll attract their attention.

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,840
Then these years of hiding

48
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,710
will be in vain.

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,120
I know.

50
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,780
Your intention in doing this

51
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,750
is to become an official.

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,350
You've hidden yourself from the world

53
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,800
and never attended court meetings,

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,460
let alone seeing His Majesty.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
But I heard from Jing Yan that

56
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,660
you've taken out your old official robe and had it repaired.

57
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,480
Your intention is clear.

58
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,590
You're anticipating His Majesty's intention, right?

59
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm not as clever as you.

60
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,750
But I think

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,570
only when we are surrounded by dangers

62
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,680
can we cross the Rubicon.

63
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,880
Well said.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,750
Liu Zhaoming's betrayal to Beiman

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,230
will surely stir up public resentment.

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,230
His Majesty will take action.

67
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,310
You've already anticipated

68
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,310
that he will reinstate you.

69
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,890
It's killing three birds with one stone.

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
Not only can His Majesty quell public grievances,

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,920
but he can also reuse your father's Dingbei Army.

72
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,840
And you can investigate what you want

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,470
under the pretext of the emperor's intentions.

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,510
Master, it's not good to speculate.

75
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,560
Although you have the title of Dingbei Marquis,

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,820
you have no real power.

77
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,070
You trust His Majesty so firmly?

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,030
The so-called duty of a subject

79
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,400
lies in loyalty, trust, and sincerity.

80
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
His Majesty just wants to use me to intimidate Beiman.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
He won't take it personally.

82
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,370
I'll take my leave.

83
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,370
You shouldn't have sent people without my permission.

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,650
[Dingbei Marquis's Residence]

85
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,880
How is it?

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,310
Not bad.

87
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,030
Madam, please remove your weapons.

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,690
Your leader, Dingbei Marquis,

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,840
is quite afraid of death.

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,580
Are you here to attend the banquet

91
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,910
or to slaughter?

92
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,670
I learned it from you.

93
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,030
You are so vindictive.

94
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,960
Aren't you?

95
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,490
I think we shouldn't go together.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,190
Why?

97
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,560
You're too small.

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,310
You...

99
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,090
I mean the picture you see.

100
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,750
You can't see the big picture.

101
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,550
These are...

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,510
Marquis really knows what I want.

103
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,190
Is this your idea?

104
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,280
What do you think?

105
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,020
We are here

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,470
as a couple.

107
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,420
If you want to have a wedding night,

108
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,510
how can you not drink with me?

109
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,190
You're abnormally nice.

110
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,560
-It's like the weasel paying respect to the hen without the best of intentions.
-Three, two, one.

111
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,230
If you want to play tricks again,

112
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,700
it won't be as easy as drugging...

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
Has anyone ever told you

114
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,860
that acting with you is really tiring?

115
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,420
Your drug was as thick as paste.

116
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,350
If I didn't notice it,

117
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,220
I would have died from your drug in the bridal chamber,

118
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,350
leaving you a widow?

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,640
When did you find out?

120
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,630
What?

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,039
I'm Dingbei Marquis.

122
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,090
Don't underestimate women's observation.

123
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,539
So,

124
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,090
your invitation is a trap.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
If inviting my wife to my residence counts,

126
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,630
then it is.

127
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,870
Did I ever tell you

128
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,450
that if you deceive me,

129
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,180
I'll kill you?

130
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,220
Looking at him now, he's quite handsome.

131
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,670
Do you really believe

132
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,800
Sagebrush on the Snow has reappeared?

133
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,460
I'd rather believe

134
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,870
it's true.

135
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,280
Rumor has it that the former Dingbei Marquis

136
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,430
colluded with Sagebrush on the Snow

137
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,000
and leaked military information.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,590
But in the end, the Dingbei Army died due to a shortage of supplies.

139
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,500
However, the Qingji Silver Bai Rui gave me

140
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,770
was made in Pingzhou.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,220
In recent years, the government hasn't made Qingji Silver again.

142
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,980
After thinking about it,

143
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,160
I think Bai Rui's Qingji Silver

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,690
is part of the ones that the Dingbei Army lost.

145
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Pingzhou?

146
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,110
What's wrong?

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,480
Last night, His Majesty summoned me to the palace at night

148
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,070
and appointed me as the Northwest Inspector

149
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,160
to Sagebrush on the Snow.

150
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,850
It's all related to Pingzhou.

151
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm afraid

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,240
someone is behind all this

153
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,840
to lure us to Pingzhou.

154
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,800
In the eighth year of Zhaoyuan,

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,110
the three counties in Beihuang suffered war.

156
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,480
The rumor that Dingbei Marquis colluded with Beiman spread.

157
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
To pacify the people,

158
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,750
His Majesty sent people from the capital to Pingzhou

159
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,210
to build a memorial for the dead in Beihuang.

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,430
My father, Li Shidu, was appointed as supervisor.

161
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,130
But all the workers

162
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,470
disappeared when they arrived in Pingzhou.

163
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,380
So, people started to believe

164
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,360
that Sagebrush on the Snow led the ghost soldiers

165
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
to make them disappear.

166
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,230
The Imperial Board of Astronomy

167
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,110
claimed this disaster was due to injustice governance.

168
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,310
His Majesty was angry

169
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,800
and in order to quell the rumor,

170
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,080
my father was made a scapegoat.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,930
The whole Li family were executed.

172
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm the only survivor.

173
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,190
I'm willing to do my best.

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
Please allow me to investigate with you

175
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,880
to clear my father's name.
