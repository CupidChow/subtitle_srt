[Episode 5]

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,160
What's wrong?

5
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,240
I...

6
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,590
I miss my father.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,790
Father...

8
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,810
Last night, it was my father's death anniversary.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,860
Well...

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,600
I lost my mother when I was young.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,830
I grew up with my father.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,360
What stories should I keep making up?

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,000
I got it.

14
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,150
Luckily, I have Xi'er's sachet.

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,500
This belonged to my father.

16
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,680
Now,

17
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,570
I can only miss him by looking at it.

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,620
He transgresses and gets fresh with me.

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,009
Why doesn't she let me comfort her?

20
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,410
I really don't understand what's going on.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,789
H-Honey, don't cry.

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,770
I hate to see women cry.

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,039
I will...

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
take my leave.

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,540
Did I say

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,420
anything inappropriate?

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,730
It's appropriate.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,030
That's great.

29
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,770
In my opinion, Honey, you should

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,090
have hugged her.

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,829
That way, even if you didn't say anything,

32
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,440
you could comfort her.

33
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,960
Honey,

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,820
you should learn how to get along with women.

35
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,460
Go. Bring my clothes here.

36
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,470
What for?

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,930
I'm going to Flower Tower.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,550
Sister, why are you in such a hurry?

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,980
Do you remember that bar of silver ingot?

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,530
Bai Rui came to me to ask for it.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,590
I waited for her that day,

42
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,190
but she didn't come to get it.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
Do you think...

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,030
Something might have happened.

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,140
We have to go there.

46
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,880
Weren't you in a hurry just now?

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,160
Why aren't you now?

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,930
What's wrong?

49
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,290
Let's go.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,160
What's wrong?

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,640
They came to catch adultery in the act! Run!

52
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,590
Hurry!

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,590
Reckless.

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Stop!

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,120
This is it.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,550
No, this...

57
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,950
My brother said

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,310
it's best to correct your mistake.

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,240
Apologize to me.

60
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,720
Forget it. You come in, too.

61
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,450
Apologize to me now.

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,940
Do you know who my brother is?

63
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,140
How dare you bully me?

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,250
What do you want?

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,040
I will make you feel

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,630
you're on cloud nine tonight.

67
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,520
We don't have time. Let's get through this first.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,830
Come on.

69
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,970
Let me tell you.

70
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,280
Look. Is the bed big today?

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,040
Yes.

72
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,550
That's right.

73
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,940
You haven't come to me for so long.

74
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
I'm here now, beauty.

75
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,390
Don't be angry.

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,640
I will make you

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,770
walk on air tonight.

78
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,600
-Go, baby.
-You're too bad.

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,230
Let me tell you.

80
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,350
Then let's see.

81
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,570
I'm famous for the fast speed of taking off my clothes.

82
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,760
You take your clothes off, too. Don't just sit there.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,510
Come on.

84
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,270
Honey,

85
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm coming.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,290
Disgusting!

87
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,590
Take your clothes off.

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
You're so bad.

89
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,110
Be gentle.

90
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,640
Childish. So annoying.

91
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,230
Help! Help!

92
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,540
Who are you?

93
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,510
How dare you trespass on private property?

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,760
Help! Help!

95
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,850
Honey, why are you here?

96
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,760
Honey, why are you here?

97
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,890
Why are there two more people?

98
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,550
Oh no.

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,760
We are seen anyway.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
What a mess.

101
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,550
You brat.

102
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,070
I...

103
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,770
Honey, you don't know.

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,930
This is a famous doctor.

105
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Yes.

106
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,210
I am a doctor.

107
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,390
You don't know,

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,480
but this is my way of practicing medicine.

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,550
My way.

110
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
Young Master, remember this.

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,880
Three doses a day. I promise your illness will be cured.

112
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Remember to send the money to my clinic.

113
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,070
I'm leaving.

114
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,100
Honey, why are you here?

115
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,630
Is it that you didn't trust me

116
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,050
and thus followed me all the way here?

117
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,540
It's…

118
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Before, the creditors came to dun for the debt, and I was sick of the harassment.

119
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,480
Luckily, Miss Bai Rui lent me 50 taels of silver.

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,390
I'm here to pay back the money.

121
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,760
I...

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,000
What are you doing?

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Shut up. Don't speak.

124
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,170
Honey, if you need money in the future,

125
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,290
just ask the butler for it.

126
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,770
Since you are here,

127
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,070
I'll

128
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,670
return the money

129
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,420
to Miss Bai Rui with you.

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay.

131
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,970
Little Dumb.

132
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,420
I haven't seen you at the mansion before.

133
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,160
You're Miss Li's sister, right?

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,870
Yes.

135
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,730
We were afraid you would misunderstand.

136
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,170
But in the end, you saw it anyway.

137
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,120
We made a fool of ourselves in trying to be smart.

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,720
By the way,

139
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,600
this is for you.

140
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,360
I remember you,

141
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,250
Little Dumb.

142
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,810
Let's go.

143
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,870
Okay.

144
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,230
-Honey!
-Sister! -Honey!

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Honey!

146
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,070
Honey!

147
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,240
I'm so scared.

148
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,510
I...

149
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,890
Honey!

150
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,830
Report to the police!

151
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,140
Sister, you were faking it?

152
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,450
They showed up too suddenly today.

153
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,100
If we stay one more day in Flower Tower,

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,350
we will be suspected.

155
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,790
Did you find anything wrong today?

156
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,040
I just think the room is too sumptuous.

157
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,510
I heard Bai Rui was once a famous courtesan in Jiangzhou,

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
but the furnishings, clothes,

159
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,880
and 50 taels of silver she carried

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,670
were still too showy.

161
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,100
Don't you think Xie Jingshu acted weird?

162
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,170
Mr. Xie was famous in the capital five years ago.

163
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,960
He's a wealthy man

164
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,990
with many properties in the area,

165
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,430
but his background is simple and innocent.

166
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,970
As for Jingyan,

167
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,020
there was nothing unusual, either.

168
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,580
Xie Jingshu and Jingyan

169
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,590
were too calm today.

170
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,980
Don't you think it's strange?

171
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,840
She looked like she committed suicide.

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,370
Her death looked horrible.

173
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,590
There were no visible injuries

174
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,120
or any trace of anyone else.

175
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,570
Don't you think

176
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,120
it looks so much like Sagebrush on the Snow's modus operandi?

177
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,600
I know what to do with Sagebrush on the Snow.

178
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,790
You don't need to worry about it.

179
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,760
Shall I go to the Supreme Court to get some information?

180
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,520
I said

181
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,390
it had nothing to do with you.

182
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,710
Don't you understand?

183
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,670
You don't want me to interfere.

184
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,270
As long as it comes to Sagebrush on the Snow,

185
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,870
you won't let me do anything.

186
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,350
Xie Jingshu, I treat you as my brother.

187
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,030
What do you take me for?

188
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,230
You've been to Flower Tower, right?

189
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,230
You went to find the Sea Chart, right?
