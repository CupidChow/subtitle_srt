[Episode 22]

4
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,230
Little Dumb.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,670
I was going to look for you.

6
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,039
Someone sent me a letter

7
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,390
and told me that something wrong happened to my sister and the others.

8
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,390
It's Mr. Yunshan.

9
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,090
Mr. Yunshan wants to kill you.

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,380
This place is at the border between the two countries.

11
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,670
It isn't within the territory of Dazhao.

12
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,930
That was why he used the letter to persuade you to return to Dazhao.

13
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,460
As long as you die in Dazhao,

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Beiman will definitely start a war.

15
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,810
Then Dazhao will fulfill Mr. Yunshan's wishes

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,560
by dispatching the troops.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,700
By that time, the war hawks

18
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,120
in these two countries will benefit from the war.

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,970
Go back to Beiman now,.

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,590
Saintess.

21
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,509
You are so brave.

22
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,160
Why are you still alive?

23
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,570
Where is the Saintess?

24
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,670
Life is full of uncertainties in this world.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,170
It was all thanks to your trusted subordinate.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,660
There is a big grudge between Mr. Yunshan and me.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,870
He killed my parents and slaughtered the members of my clan.

28
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,950
If you can go out and kill Mr. Yunshan,

29
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,190
I'm willing to be your follower.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Alright.

31
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,200
But it's too late now.

32
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,590
All my trusted followers

33
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,050
are now at the border between the two countries.

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,840
Soon,

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,130
the soldiers of my Dazhao

36
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,720
will destroy Beiman.

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,520
Heaven is going to entrust me with great responsibilities.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,780
Even though the villain tried to stop me,

39
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,660
I won't let him succeed.

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,460
-Stop! -Stop!

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,530
Whoever stands in my way

42
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,770
will be killed!

43
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,840
I don't think that it's worth cheering

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,900
if we exchange a weak woman for peace.

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,450
Nor do I think that it's reasonable

46
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,800
to gain victory by sacrificing

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
the life of a woman.

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,740
Although the country is big, being warlike will destroy the country.

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
After I got hurt that day,

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,410
I already reported it to His Majesty.

51
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,440
Your trusted followers

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,470

You lost totally.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,920
I lost.

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
From the beginning to the end,

57
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,089
as a couple, both of you

58
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,340
have been performing a good show.

59
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,860
I'll go by myself!

60
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,000
You look as if you were a gentleman.

61
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,980
You look handsome.

62
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,040
You look handsome.

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,360
By the way, what do you think now?

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,250
When I married her that day,

65
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,160
the wedding was quite simple and wasn't decent enough.

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,220
Today, I want to...

67
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,360
Dear, what are you doing here?

68
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,860
How do you know it's me?

69
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,190
Do you know that

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,120
the bride can't meet her groom before the wedding?

71
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,630
I know that,

72
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,160
so I...

73
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,400
Without seeing my beloved one for just a day,

74
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,090
it feels as if three autumns have passed.

75
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,150
If you break the rules,

76
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,830
you will be punished.

77
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,770
I'll be punished?

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,790
Why don't you

Just go.

86
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,720
Bow to your parents.

87
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,110
The couple should bow to each other now.

[Half a year later]

89
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,669
There is something wrong with you.

90
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,120
No.

91
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,200
There is really something wrong with you.

92
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,270
You're thinking about Lu Xi'er, aren't you?

93
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,350
Although I don't quite like her...

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,650
What did you say?

95
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,150
I miss her, too.

96

Do you think

98
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
it will snow in Beiman today?

99
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,320
Even though there are thousands of blossoming trees,

100
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
just like fireworks,

I'm sorry.

103

I'm not used to it yet.

104
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,050
It doesn't matter.

105
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,950
Being liberated from distress for a short time

106
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,690
is better than remaining silent

107
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,290
and being sad for a long time.

108
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,820
How do you know

109

112
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,100
It's my passport. Why is it...

113
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,460
You want to go to Beiman alone to look for Xi'er.

114
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,200
You want to stop me?

115
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
A lifetime for humans is quite short,

116
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,280
just like the plants which can't live past autumn.

117

Everyone has his own destiny which he needs to fight against.

Everyone has his own destiny which he needs to fight against.

If Xi'er

122
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
is someone you can't forget,

123
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,480
I can't forget her, either.

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,050
What's wrong with that?

125
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,010
I just suddenly feel that

126
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,640
you've become more eloquent recently.

127
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
You've gone a bit too far.

128
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,270
Even after I come much closer to you,

129
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,070
you'll still like me, won't you?

130
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,580
The days I spent with you in the capital

131
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,010
were my happiest days.
