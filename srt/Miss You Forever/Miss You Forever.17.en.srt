[Episode 17]

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,300
Borrowing someone else's body to come back to life.

5
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
It's human blood.

6
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,680
I've let you go many times,

7
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,780
but you insisted on courting death.

8
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,509
So, you were the one

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,270
who lured us out of the city these days?

10
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,509
You shouldn't have disturbed Mr. Xue.

11
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,450
You are the one who's been playing tricks

12
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,090
and killing the innocent.

13
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,190
It's their blessing

14
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,030
to be able to help Mr. Xue come back to life.

15
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,120
No!

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,950
I've waited for ten years.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,430
It's all your fault!

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Xi'er.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,190
Go!

20
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,020
Go!

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,770
Give my Mr. Xue back to me!

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
I didn't expect

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,240
that I would be defeated by you guys today.

24
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,900
I've been enduring hardships in the Grim Reapers for ten years.

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,730
I even cast myself on Fang Zhibo

26
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,180
to fulfill their great cause

27
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,740
so that Mr. Xue could come back to life.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,100
It's you!

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,390
You ruined everything!

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,540
Mr. Xue, at Pingzhou, ten years ago.

31
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,590
Are you talking about

32
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,690
Xue Liangchen?

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,530
How do you know him?

34
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,360
He was the rebel in Pingzhou.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,620
How can I not know them?

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
Nonsense!

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,600
Mr. Xue was

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,510
the most upright man

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,430
I knew him when we were still nobodies.

40
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,230
I had decided to die.

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,730
It was Mr. Xue who saved me from the mire.

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,650
Mr. Xue and I loved each other,

43
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,230
and we were meant to be.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
Ten years ago,

46
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,550
when Beiman attacked Dazhao,

47
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,740
Pingzhou could fall anytime.

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,170
The rebels led by Xue Liangchen

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,340
saw the situation couldn't be reversed,

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,790
so they conspired with Beiban and disclosed military information to them.

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,360
Then, he abandoned his family

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,190
and died at the hands of the Beiman people.

53
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,520
Wasn't Xue Liangchen in love with Bai Rui?

54
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,170
How would he end up like that?

55
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,970
She just deceived herself.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,460
In this world, there are many levels.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,329
The higher you climb up,

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,140
the cheaper human lives will be.

59
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,350
Some people show ingratitude for favors just for profit,

60
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,050
while some people end their romantic relationship

61
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,800
just to protect their own lives.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,110
When did you find out?

63
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,880
I guess

64
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,950
you must be Yin Sanniang.

65
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,040
Nonsense!

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,880
You're still denying it.

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,010
There are two things

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
you can't deny.

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,250
First,

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,550
your clothes.

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,290
Second,

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,160
the smell.

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,200
In your old residence,

74
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,350
we saw the same robe which was folded to the left

75
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,790
on the portrait.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,399
We thought

77
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,650
it was just a trick to scare people

78
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,690
because only the dead wear robes folded to the left.

79
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,040
But now that I think about it,

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,170
other than the dead,

81
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,790
mourners

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,159
also wear such clothes.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
That's all your evidence?

84
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,290
Of course, it's not enough.

85
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,450
Speaking of which,

86
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,100
it's all thanks to Mr. Liu.

87
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,200
That day, we found the robe

88
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,330
was dirty on the inside and outside.

89
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,190
There were straps on both sides.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,070
Though the sorceress in the coffin shop

91
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,350
wore a Tasuki,

92
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,690
she was a clean woman.

93
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,700
But the sorceress who escorted the bride today

94
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,010
had a dirty collar

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,450
and was in foul odor.

96
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,820
You pretended to be the sorceress.

97
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,150
You shift between different identities,

98
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,790
so you need different clothes to present yourself.

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,560
Therefore,

100
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,670
you wore the robe in two different ways.

101
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,040
You have a strap on each side.

102
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,070
In this way,

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,160
one robe

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,390
can be folded to the left or right.

105
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,500
You lived in the fish market as Yin Sanniang.

106
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,030
But decades ago,

107
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,600
you lost your husband and son.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
At that time,

109
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,670
Su Jiusi, who was doing tea-horse trade,

110
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,410
appeared.

111
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,580
He tricked you into believing the magic of returning one's soul.

112
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,420
Then, you joined hands

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,090
to spread the rumors about Sagebrush on the Snow.

114
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,830
You went back and forth between the two cities regularly.

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,350
Taking advantage of people's fear

116
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,530
of Sagebrush on the Snow,

117
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,860
you did what you wanted.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,780
You tricked and killed women to cultivate elixirs.

119
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,570
Women were light.

120
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,950
The sound of the bell

121
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,400
was to hide the heaviness of the steps.

122
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,400
As for

123
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,180
the sound of the demonic laughter,

124
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,530
it was ventriloquism.

125
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,950
Every time when there was a strange noise on our way,

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,700
your lips were slightly open.

127
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,820
It's common for a ventriloquist.

128
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,690
Those are just sophistries.

129
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,770
What evidence do you have?

130
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you remember the room at Flower Tower?

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,500
The fragrance of rouge inside

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,920
was extremely strong.

133
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,640
What's wrong with

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,130
a prostitute to have the fragrance of rouge?

135
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,440
When we just arrived in the Old Town,

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,930
and when we were on our way of escorting the bridal sedan,

137
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,040
the closer we were to the Old Town,

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,270
the smell of death and decay was more pungent.

139
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,440
The maid who tricked us

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,740
to Flower Tower said

141
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,760
the smell started to appear

142
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
since the beginning of the relocation

143
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,810
ten years ago.

144
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,570
If one stands, tens of thousands of women stand.

145
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,820
You lost your soul,

146
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,200
and you want countless people to lose their lives.

147
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,390
How cruel.

148
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,610
You told them, didn't you?

149
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,350
How about

150
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,050
you go and ask your good sister?

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,520
You...

152
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,950
Stop sowing discord between us.

153
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,100
Everything in the mortal world is illusional.

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,110
The least reliable

155
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,140
is the promise in love.

156
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Mr. Xue won't come back.

157
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,710
There's no point for me to go on living

158
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
in this world.

159
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,560
Borrowing someone else's body to come back to life

160
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,420
is impossible in the first place.

161
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,840
It's just her own wishful thinking

162
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,560
as an infatuated woman.

163
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,350
Let's go back

164
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,470
and see if there are

165
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,670
more clues about Sagebrush on the Snow.

166
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,540
There's a secret door here.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,630
Then,

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,550
there should be other traps.

169
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,100
[Military Seal]

170
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,980
They're the boxes that Tu Lesu transported.

171
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,960
They're the same as those in Fang Zhibo's house.

172
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
They are all military supplies.

173
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,920
Pingzhou.

174
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,330
Qingji Silver.

175
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
These are

176
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,370
the provisions that were supposed to aid Pingzhou back then.

177
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,710
These

178
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,720
are the names of the officers and soldiers

179
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,860
who died on the battlefield back then.

180
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,000
The Dingbei Army

181
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,150
was stranded in Shituo City.

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,220
The people in the southwest were massacred.

183
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,110
Here is a letter.

184
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,330
The Dingbei Army was defeated today.

185
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,180
The imperial decree is to build a memorial

186
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,440
at the gate of Pingzhou

187
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,250
to fulfill the people's wish.

188
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,050
However, Beiman was very displeased.

189
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,150
They thought they were humiliated.

190
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,010
Du Shaoqing knew so well about it

191
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,840
that he was afraid the war would break out again.

192
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,080
So, he resigned and changed his name to Yuan Ji.

193
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,550
He spread rumors about ghosts and gods in the city.

194
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,150
However, the Beiman people were still angry.

195
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,440
The emperor ordered me to die,

196
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,500
so I have to die.

197
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,030
Thus, the memorial collapsed, and I was detained.

198
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,480
Nothing will be the same as before.

199
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,030
Li Shidu.

200
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,790
On Tianmen Street,

201
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,950
the memorial collapsed.

202
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,050
The most important thing

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,660
is to remove the gemstone ball on top of it first.

204
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,470
The job would be finished easily

205
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,270
with one rope.

206
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
There's no need for the two counties

207
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,570
to recruit laborers.

208
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,000
Yuan Ji is Du Shaoqing.

209
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,560
He knows everything.
