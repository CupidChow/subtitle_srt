[Miss You Forever]

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,570
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,390
Why are you looking at me like that?

5
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,789
Liu Yu'an.

6
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,220
If you can leave the capital

7
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,260
and go anywhere you want,

8
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,789
where do you want to go?

9
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,789
Jiangzhou. That was the countryside where I lived when I was a kid.

10
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:40,850
Alright.

11
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,430
I'll take you back there tomorrow.

12
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,570
Are you trying to drive me away?

13
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,530
It's just that the capital

14
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,410
is not safe.

15
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,180
Mr. Xie is in prison now.

16
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,759
Miss Li has been arrested.

17
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,130
I'll be the next one, won't I?

18
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,210
Why don't we become sworn brothers?

19
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,380
God is my witness,

20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,699
and I swear to this land that

21
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,980
from this day onwards, Jing Yan and I will be sworn brothers.

22
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,110
If there is a future,

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,930
I'll fulfill the promise I've made to your elder brother,

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,130
and stay by your side.

25
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,180
If there is no future,

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,700
I hope that you will be carefree

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,390
and live a free life.

28
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,260
Jing Yan.

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,650
From now on,

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,420
I will use my power

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,900
to protect you guys.

32
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,340
God is my witness,

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,900
and I swear to this land that

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,300
from this day onwards, Liu Yu'an and I will be sworn brothers.

35
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,650
Lord Jing Yan, sorry for my rudeness.

36
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,780
Please come with us.

37
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,930
Tell me. Where did you take my friends?

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,010
I wanted to let you off,

39
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,060
but you came here yourself to face the risk of being killed.

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,010
Cut the crap.

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,780
Today, for the sake of my family and friends,

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,890
I will kill you!

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,230
There won't be any obstacles in front of me anymore.

44
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,700
As a chesspiece, you've become

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,370
meaningless to me.

46
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,160
I made a plan for every step

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,680
and devised a scheme for everything.

48
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,530
I was inside the game,

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,420
but I didn't know the actual situation.

50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,350
I think I have trusted you wrongly.

51
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,900
You claimed that you wanted to take revenge for Dazhao.

52
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,760
But from the beginning to the end,

53
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,460
you've been a rebel.

54
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,620
Guards!

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,530
Take Liu Yu'an

56
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,060
to his friends.

57
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,940
What do you mean?

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,680
I've got both the arrest warrant and the official documents.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,340
In the case related to the Vice Minister of the Supreme Court,

60
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,100
Liu Zhaoming is suspected of treason.

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,960
We haven't found out about the truth of the case yet.

62
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,230
How can we release you?

63
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,390
Without His Majesty's decree,

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,480
I have to be in prison just because of what you said?

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,610
I'm an official of the imperial court.

66
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,820
His Majesty is not feeling well.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,060
He has gone far away from the capital.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,190
Now in the capital,

69
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,170
I...

70
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,500
have the final say.

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,160
By the way,

72
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,220
I forgot to tell you that

73
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,730
I have a gift for you.

74
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,970
I think you'll like it very much.

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,100
Bring him here.

76
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,790
You...

77
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,740
Take him inside.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,950
-Go inside.
-Liu Yu'an!

79
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,100
Liu Yu'an!

80
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,620
What did you do to him?

81
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,970
I've always been a generous man.

82
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,690
-Liu Yu'an.
-I've never been stingy in terms of spending my own money,

83
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,970
and I love giving gifts to others.

84
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,620
When I was thinking anxiously

85
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,820
about what gift I should give you,

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,850
this annoying rat came out of nowhere

87
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,630
and talked about

88
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,360
taking revenge.

89
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,430
Do you like this gift?

90
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,500
Liu Yu'an.

91
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,740
Liu Yu'an!

92
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,870
Wake up.

93
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,920
We've found the whereabouts of the Saintess.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,450
She hasn't left Dazhao yet.

95
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,030
Then just make them

96
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,380
keep their mouths shut.

97
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,900
Yes.

98
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,810
Tomorrow,

99
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,220
it'll be the time of his death.

100
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
I know you're acting in this show with me

101
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,380
in order to make Mr. Yunshan relax his vigilance.

102
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,790
But you're in prison now.

103
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,430
How can you be sure of that?

104
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,820
He can be sure of that?

105
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,710
How can a prisoner

106
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,940
be sure of something?

107
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,780
Just like the Nettle Grass lying in ambush,

108
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,540
some people never care about the background,

109
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,260
but they only long for a good prospect.

110
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,380
Why are you here?

111
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm afraid you can't even save yourself now,

112
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,270
and you're going to die in prison with Miss Li, right?

113
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,510
By the way, Mr. Xie,

114
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,370
don't forget to drink the poisonous wine.

115
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,990
[Return to the capital at once. Otherwise, Li Mengjue will be killed.]

116
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,180
Sister.

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,880
Your Highness, the Saintess is still alive.

118
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,440
But she has been captured alive.

119
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,860
Now His Majesty has no time to deal with state affairs.

120
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,610
How's our military deployment of spies in Beiman?

121
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,450
Everything has been arranged well.

122
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,050
Okay.
