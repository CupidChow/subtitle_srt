[Episode 16]

4
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,660
What kind of fragrance powder did you use?

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,010
Your collar is dirty.

6
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,610
My Lady,

7
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,330
we'd better stop here.

8
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
Go on walking.

9
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,550
Your lady can go alone.

10
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,330
Why do you have to go with her?

11
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,090
I need to protect my lady.

12
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,250
Why risk your life?

13
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,780
You're being mystifying deliberately!

14
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,670
Why did you lure me out of the city?

15
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,960
I didn't find what you were looking for.

16
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,090
What's in those boxes?

17
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,480
Have you heard of the saying "Save your life by not asking a lot"?

18
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,100
I won't interfere in your business,

19
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,820
but...

20
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,090
don't forget what you promised me.

21
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,130
Of course I won't.

22
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,340
You're just an abandoned pawn.

23
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,710
You have no right to bargain with me here.

24
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,600
You've drawn someone who shouldn't be here.

25
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,970
You know what to do.

26
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,030
Kill him.

27
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,800
What?

28
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,690
Do you even forget who you are

29
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,480
after faking to be innocent for so long?

30
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,100
Kill him.

31
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,230
No, no, no.

32
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,530
No, no, no.

33
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,300
Please.

34
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,790
What do you want?

35
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,470
Go and have a look.

36
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,280
Yes.

37
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,470
Pretend to be dead to save your life.

38
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,130
Honey.

39
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,820
You...

40
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,240
How dare you!

41
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,270
Good trick.

42
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,190
You even had an accomplice trying to draw me away.

43
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,090
What?

44
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,480
You like this girl?

45
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,770
I...

46
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,250
I... I'm just a wandering Taoist priest.

47
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,390
I came here by mistake.

48
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,060
Please let me go.

49
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,520
What a Taoist priest!

50
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,680
The Gold Tally.

51
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,170
Those who wear it

52
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
are in charge of the market of tea and horses.

53
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,840
Say it!

54
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,410
What's your relationship with Sagebrush on the Snow?

55
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,170
I just pretended to be Sagebrush on the Snow.

56
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,160
Really.

57
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,240
I really don't know what Sagebrush on the Snow is.

58
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,440
What's your relationship

59
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,570
with those girls?

60
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,690
I'm just a businessman.

61
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,700
Someone paid me

62
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,230
to find some girls for them.

63
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,610
I just wanted the money and the women.

64
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,030
Why would I kill them?

65
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,420
What a beast!

66
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,340
Let's get changed first.

67
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,180
I feel so uncomfortable.

68
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,590
Finally, I feel better.

69
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,700
What should we do with him?

70
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,270
Xi'er.

71
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,030
Xi'er.

72
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,760
You...

73
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,330
I'm fine.

74
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,100
You...

75
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,930
Forget it.

76
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,780
Let's talk about it later.

77
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,440
No!

78
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,410
Before we came here,

79
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,020
did you see anyone else?

80
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,809
Jing Yan.

81
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,250
Close the door.

82
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,140
We cannot let

83
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,290
Sagebrush on the Snow go.

84
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,840
One, two, three.

85
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,030
Seven.

86
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,840
Eight.

87
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,000
There's a secret room.
