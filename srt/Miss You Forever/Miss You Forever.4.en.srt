00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,210
You killers

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,020
all enjoy breaking into people's homes

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,550
through windows?

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,220
Cut the crap.

9
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,680
Where are they?

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,520
I sell information.

11
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,470
Of course, you're not the only customer

12
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,440
who come to me.

13
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,480
Since you're here,

14
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,270
you should follow the rules here.

15
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,530
Rules?

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,050
I'm here to buy information about Sagebrush on the Snow.

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,090
Have some tea while it's still hot.

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Who else knows?

19
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,190
A man and a woman.

20
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,600
Maybe you know them.

21
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,800
The scout of Grim Reapers,

22
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,460
Bai Rui.

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,270
Since you want this chart,

24
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,870
why don't you take a look now?

25
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,650
[Sea Chart]

26
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,720
I don't need to.

27
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,800
Because this Sea Chart

28
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,140
is fake.

29
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,070
Since you have weapons on you,

30
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,960
you are considered an enemy.

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
If you don't care about your life,

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,910
we can fight.

33
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,370
Who are you?

34
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,910
You have the Chart.

35
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,840
A man and a woman. You tried to steal the Chart, right?

36
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,079
No.

37
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,490
We got company.

38
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,760
I know.

39
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,590
Come on.

40
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,950
Grim Reapers.

41
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,180
Interesting.

42
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,600
Didn't we cooperate well just now?

43
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,760
What? Now we are enemies again?

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,330
Who's out there during curfew?

45
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,390
-Wait and see.
-Wait and see.

46
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,960
You didn't find the Sea Chart

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,490
and were injured by a woman.

48
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,940
That hussy!

49
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,470
It hurts. It hurts.

50
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,440
There may be some roofie on the blade.

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
It's not very poisonous.

52
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,920
But you need to be careful

53
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,060
since the wound is near to the vital part.

54
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,950
The vital part?

55
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Ignoble!

56
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,220
Did you see her face?

57
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,880
No.

58
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,000
This woman is unreasonable and rude.

59
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,380
If I meet her again,

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,650
I definitely won't let her off.

61
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,840
How strange.

62
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,600
It's the first time

63
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,760
that you've held a grudge against a woman.

64
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,470
I didn't see his face.

65
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,220
That man wore a black robe and a black mask.

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,670
His weapon is an iron fan.

67
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,790
And he used poison!

68
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,980
Before I could even swing my sword,

69
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,820
he had used many tricks.

70
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
Sister, this talisman is for you.

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,040
This...

72
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,550
My father gave this to me

73
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
the year I met you.

74
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,050
So, it definitely can bring you luck.

75
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,720
So, the Sea Chart was drawn by Sagebrush on the Snow.

76
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,650
If you have the Chart, you can trace Sagebrush on the Snow.

77
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,220
It hurts. It hurts.

78
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,400
But... The woman you fought aside,

79
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,640
Bai Rui is a courtesan.

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,850
Why does she want the Chart?

81
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,670
That confuses me as well.

82
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,880
You said Bai Rui had come to see you.

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,670
But Grim Reapers gave you

84
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,300
the mission to find the Chart.

85
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,020
Why bother assigning someone else?

86
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,220
There is no precedent

87
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,870
that different people are on the same mission.

88
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,860
Moreover, even though she is disguised as a courtesan,

89
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,480
her identity is too ostentatious.

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Although Grim Reapers assign missions through codes

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,760
instead of documents,

92
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,390
people who have the right codes aren't necessarily from  Grim Reapers.

93
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,040
Tomorrow,

94
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,420
we need to go to Flower Tower again.

95
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,220
Flower Tower?

96
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,840
Wait, the woman who hurt you is still there.

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,420
Won't I be sending myself to my death?

98
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
No, no, no.

99
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,780
You'd better find someone else.

100
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,890
Unless you give me the fan.

101
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,930
Alright.

102
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,250
Alright, alright, alright.

103
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,900
Tomorrow, at dusk.

104
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,380
Oh my, I don't want to go.

105
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,480
To dramatic.

106
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,030
Are you really leaving?

107
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,790
It's almost dawn.

108
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,740
Are you going home like this?

109
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,170
If you plan to go back like this

110
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,190
and my sister-in-law knows you're injured,

111
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,690
I'm afraid we can't hide the secrets

112
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
between you and me.

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,510
Sister-in-law?

114
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,060
Let me show you something.

115
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,260
This is official silver.

116
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,950
Not only official silver,

117
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,140
but also Qingji Silver, used to pay for military supplies.

118
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,490
Sister, did you steal...

119
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,650
Bai Rui gave it to me.

120
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,710
I guess...

121
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,740
What?

122
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,170
Someone is here.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,750
Miss Li, come with me quickly.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,960
Young Master had a relapse again.

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,640
Since I'm still here,

126
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,710
I have to

127
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,840
keep pretending.

128
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,170
Sister, be careful not to get caught.

129
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't worry.

130
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,840
Where is he? Has the doctor come?

131
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,440
Miss Li, you are so worried about Young Master.

132
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,700
True love shines in times of trouble.

133
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,910
Fate is giving us

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,370
these hardships to test our love.

135
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,740
Honey.

136
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,960
Why aren't you awake?

137
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,890
How long do I have to serve you here?

138
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,510
Honey.

139
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,250
Pillow.

140
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,310
Okay.

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Honey, you don't have to do this.

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
I've been weak since childhood.

143
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,230
I'll be fine after some rest.

144
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,080
Honey, can you tell me what disease you have?

145
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,760
It would put my mind at ease.

146
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,230
I have some understanding of medicine.

147
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,760
Maybe I can help.

148
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,370
What should I do?

149
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,840
Are you alright, Honey?

150
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,650
This...

151
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,020
Emotional depression

152
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,950
will damage one's liver.

153
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,150
Damage one's liver.

154
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,390
If the liver can't work normally...

155
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,900
If the liver can't work normally...

156
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,070
The result will be...

157
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,270
The result will be...

158
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,010
Impotency.

159
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Impotency?

160
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,120
Honey, your illness is too severe.

161
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm not that good at medicine.

162
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
I may not be of much help.

163
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,770
I won't ask further.

164
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,470
Wait.

165
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,150
Oh no!
