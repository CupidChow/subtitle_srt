[Episode 8]

4
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,590
I...

5
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,830
I...

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,560
I like you.

7
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,620
I like you.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,590
A long time ago,

9
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,680
so long that you don't even remember,

10
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,830
I already liked you.

11
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,480
I've been loving you

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,840
every moment.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,360
May I know your name?

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,190
I…

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,360
I don't have a name.

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,759
Are you...

17
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,830
from the Dingbei Army?

18
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,320
Yes, I used to be.

19
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,310
I heard

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,880
there aren't many people left in the Dingbei Army.

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes.

22
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,229
Life is hard.

23
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,890
Sometimes,

24
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,390
living

25
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,750
means hope.

26
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,280
Where are you going?

27
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't come over.

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,070
Stranger, we don't know each other's names.

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
And we don't need to know.

30
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,790
We can be bosom friends for this one day.

31
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,520
The world is so big.

32
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,660
Let fate decide whether we meet again.

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,680
Live on.

34
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,030
You and I

35
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,940
will meet again.

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Li Mengjue.

37
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,980
Li Mengjue!

38
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,090
Did we come at the wrong time?

39
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't worry. She's fine.

40
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,750
I was scared to death.

41
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,950
I thought I picked the wrong herb

42
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,810
and got my sister-in-law killed.

43
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,160
This medicine is just to let her sleep more

44
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,820
so that she can be detoxified.

45
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,230
Sister-in-law, so you're a master from the Grim Reapers.

46
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,200
Respect.

47
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Then I guess your sister…

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
How about her?

49
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,950
Every time I saw Miss Lu, she kept silent.

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,750
I almost thought she was a mute.

51
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,790
Jing Yan.

52
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,630
How's the investigation going?

53
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,760
Well...

54
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,640
No need. She can listen.

55
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,580
I trust her.

56
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,310
She's just a little thief.

57
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,040
Even if she hears about it, she won't cause much trouble.

58
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,890
It's strange.

59
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,050
Bai Rui was known as the top courtesan in Jiangzhou.

60
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,940
But I sent a letter to my colleagues in Jiangzhou to ask about her.

61
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,870
They said there was no such person.

62
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,110
I saw Bai Rui offend against the curfew

63
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,770
and being chased by Liu Yu'an.

64
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,580
When?

65
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,330
October 14th.

66
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,290
I saved Bai Rui

67
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,140
and took 50 taels of silver from her.

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
She asked me to return it to her,

69
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,330
so I waited for her, but she didn't turn up.

70
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,700
The silver was weird, too.

71
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,960
It's Qingji Silver for military supply.

72
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,670
What...

73
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,310
It was on October 16th.

74
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,680
In such a short period,

75
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,800
it must have something to do with the Liu Residence.

76
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,390
Then why do you think Bai Rui committed suicide?

77
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,100
The Sea Chart?

78
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,410
Did the Grim Reapers kill her after the mission was finished?

79
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,260
No.

80
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,790
Bai Rui is the Leader's trusted aide.

81
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,700
That day outside the Flower Tower,

82
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,450
Mr. Xie and I encountered the assassins from the Grim Reapers.

83
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,540
So, I guess because I failed to give the map to the Grim Reapers,

84
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,140
they

85
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
handed the task over to Bai Rui.

86
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,180
How do you know

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,140
that the Grim Reapers didn't order two people to do the same task?

88
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,010
I just know.

89
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,830
Now that you know my identity,

90
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,030
why don't you kill me?

91
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,090
I'm not into killing people.

92
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,420
-Moreover…
-Moreover,

93
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,700
our Mr. Xie has already expressed his feelings to Miss Li.

94
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,100
You're really strange.

95
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,570
You pretended to be lovey-dovey

96
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,230
in front of others yesterday.

97
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,760
Today, you stood eyeball to eyeball.

98
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,909
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

99
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,010
So, now, we should…

100
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,470
Go to the Liu Residence and kidnap someone. Won't that solve it?

101
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,380
So, who should go?

102
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,680
-You, of course.
-You, of course.

103
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,060
Go.

104
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:34,650
Hurry up.

105
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,309
What do you want?

106
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,730
Tell me, what happened to Bai Rui?

107
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,700
I think it must be your Liu family who did it.

108
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,550
Nonsense!

109
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,370
Bai Rui's death has nothing to do with the Liu family.

110
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,730
If you continue to frame us,

111
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,050
I'll tell my brother.

112
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,260
My brother is a third-rank commander.

113
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,730
"I'll tell my brother."

114
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm so scared.

115
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,700
Have your brother told you

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,560
that one day I'd get you like this?

117
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,180
Where did you catch him?

118
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,810
Near the Office of Transmission in Nanzhi Street.

119
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,860
Is the Transmission Commissioner from his clan?

120
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,390
So you were going to pull some strings.

121
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,020
You look like a playboy.

122
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,820
I didn't expect that you actually had a brain.

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,910
The Transmission Commissioner Liu Yun

124
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,770
is always impartial and upright.

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
He's not as stupid as you.

126
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,410
If you want money, ask my brother.

127
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,530
Or if you want a life for a life, go to him, too.

128
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,930
It's none of my business.

129
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,580
Fine.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,100
When I saw you guys at Flower Tower last time,

131
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,420
I felt you were odd.

132
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,230
Now, you are

133
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,110
scheming against our Liu family.

134
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,350
Where are you going?

135
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,220
When was the last time you saw Bai Rui?
