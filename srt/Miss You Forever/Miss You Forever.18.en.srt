[Episode 18]

4
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,270
Sister.

5
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,450
What?

6
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,820
Stop!

7
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,789
She's a good person.

8
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,280
She's a good person.

9
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,070
Pretend to be dead to save your life.

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,490
Put down the sword.

11
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,360
Xi'er,

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
don't you have anything to say to us?

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,509
Xi'er,

14
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,970
don't you believe us?

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,730
Leave your hometown

17
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,710
and go to Dazhao

18
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,800
to fulfill

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,720
your destiny.

20
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,300
Jing.

21
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,560
Xi'er,

22
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,900
don't forget

23
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,410
your mission.

24
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,310
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,390
Did you

26
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
put the Sagebrush on the Snow

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,390
in Bai Rui's

28
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,990
and Master Yuan Ji's rooms?

29
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,030
Yes.

30
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,930
Why?

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,970
I'm afraid you'll find out.

32
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,510
Are you…

33
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,210
Sagebrush on the Snow.

34
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,730
I am Jiao Landuo,

35
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,850
the Saintess of Lihuo Sect in Beiman.

36
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,580
Since I was little,

37
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,430
I started to learn medicine and poison

38
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,200
so that one day when there's a chance,

39
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,820
I could enter Dazhao.

40
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,950
So, Sagebrush on the Snow

41
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,409
has never been one person.

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
It's the fate of the saintess of every generation.

43
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,790
I could have lived under the sun

44
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,050
and enjoyed the love of my family.

45
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,880
But the war pushed me to the edge of darkness.

46
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,350
I became a sword plunged deep into Dazhao.

47
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,520
I became an abandoned paw in name and fact.

48
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,270
So I had to wander far away from my hometown.

49
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,600
Sister.

50
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,670
You saved me.

51
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,980
You told me

52
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,880
if Heaven is unfair,

53
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,970
we have to fight for our own future.

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,080
I haven't killed anyone since then.

55
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,850
But someone was killing people

56
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,850
in the name of Sagebrush on the Snow.

57
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,240
Their purpose was to lure me out.

58
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,070
Only after I arrived in Pingzhou did I find out

59
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,330
that my uncle Tu Lesu

60
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,590
had come to Dazhao

61
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,590
and colluded with people.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,250
Who did he collude with?

63
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,380
Du Shaoqing.

64
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,490
He promised to help my uncle get the throne back.

65
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,330
I know

66
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,680
as long as I am alive,

67
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,080
the hatred between the tribes of Beiman and Dazhao

68
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,340
will never disappear.

69
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,140
I know

70
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,150
it's time.

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm going to fulfill my unfinished mission.

72
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,480
We have different paths

73
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,390
and different goals.

74
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,710
But I love you so much.

75
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,180
I have more feelings than what I have shown,

76
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,480
and I don't want our relationship to end here.

77
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,890
Xi'er,

78
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,130
stay.

79
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,360
From now on, we'll be your family.

80
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,000
At this point,

81
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,700
looking forward and backward,

82
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,230
I don't have a home anymore.

83
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,770
Let's

84
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,310
stop here.

85
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,960
It's getting cold.

86
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,470
Wrap up warm. Don't get sick.

87
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,220
You told me

88
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,900
that the Sagebrush on the Snow

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
grows on the shady side of the hills.

90
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,360
It's beautiful but poisonous.

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,530
People will die after a taste of it.

92
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,010
But in our Central Plain,

93
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,790
there is another saying.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The root of the Sagebrush on the Snow

95
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,570
can cure all kinds of pain.

96
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,470
You are not poisonous

97
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
in my heart.

98
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,290
Remember,

99
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,790
every place

100
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,900
the sun shines on

101
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,290
is your hometown.

102
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,820
All these years,

103
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,700
I've been looking for the murderer who killed my Master.

104
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,090
I looked for the Sagebrush on the Snow

105
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,590
for my dead father.

106
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,610
All these years,

107
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,090
I've been waiting for a chance.

108
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,890
I've been living like a walking corpse.

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,110
But when I met you,

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,220
I finally realized that they'd died,

111
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,970
so what if I found out the truth?

112
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,630
I can accept

113
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,590
there's no Sea Chart in this world.

114
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,530
I can also accept

115
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,190
my efforts for the past ten years are all in vain.

116
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,710
But this result

117
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,790
doesn't deserve

118
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,990
my determination to do it even if I knew it was impossible.

119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,980
But I'm willing

120
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,850
to use this thought

121
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,160
as the reason

122
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,520
to live on

123
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,440
and to get through the bleak winters.

124
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,710
Li Mengjue.

125
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,340
My heart is true.

126
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,200
Because of our feelings,

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,210
I lost the Sea Chart,

128
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
exposed my identity,

129
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
broke the rules,

130
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,880
and drew deadly disasters to myself.

131
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,680
I almost let my persistence of ten years go in vain.

132
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,320
Xie Jingshu.

133
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,420
If both of us are dead,

134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
no one can prove my innocence.

135
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,940
Li Mengjue.

136
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,980
If you want to leave me

137
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,980
and go to danger alone,

138
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,260
I will help you.

139
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,030
You don't have to hurt me so much.

140
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,450
You said

141
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,960
that we'd be

142
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,060
husband and wife for 100 days only.

143
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,460
Now, time is up.

144
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,880
We…

145
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,930
should say goodbye.

146
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,480
You only lost your wife.

147
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,410
I also lost Xi'er.

148
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,710
Do you really need to mope like that?

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,930
What did you say?

150
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Drink some water.
