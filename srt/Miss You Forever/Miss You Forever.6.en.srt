00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,610
[Episode 6]

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,150
The key to the Sea Chart:

5
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,360
Sagebrush on the Snow.

6
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,410
It is related to the sneaky people in the forest.

7
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,010
You said the information was fake.

8
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,090
Actually, you didn't know

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,710
that I'd seen it long ago.

10
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,120
You said someone was monitoring you,

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,230
so you married a random woman

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,200
to prove that you were indeed a playboy.

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,720
But that is for the record.

14
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,080
I, Jingyan,

15
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
don't believe it.

16
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,950
I don't believe you, Marquis Dingbei, couldn't see it today.

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,640
She said she was only a weak girl,

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,240
but don't you think she acted too calmly today?

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,000
Stop it.

20
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,520
I believe she has nothing to do with this.

21
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,170
The Sea Chart.

22
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,310
Bai Rui.

23
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,530
Sagebrush on the Snow…

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,700
Honey, have you slept?

25
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,990
Honey, I'm coming in.

26
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,120
What are you looking at, Honey?

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Looking…

28
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,640
Looking…

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,760
Looking…

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,680
Looking at the residual snow out the window,

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,210
I feel it's hard for it to get over the spring.

32
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,760
It's just the residue from the past winter.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,340
Therefore, I can't help but pity myself:

34
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,580
I'm afraid I won't be able to live long enough

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,140
to repay you, Honey.

36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,980
Why don't you wear more clothes?

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
Honey,

38
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,090
do you suspect my sister and I?

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,750
No.

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Honey,

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,650
do you believe me or not?

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll believe

43
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,440
everything you told me.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
Why do you trust me so much?

45
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,090
Because...

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,660
Because...

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,180
Because...

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,490
Tomorrow, it's Minor Snow.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,050
It's the Lantern Festival.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,550
We were all frightened just now.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,850
Why don't we go watch the lanterns together tomorrow

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
so that we can relax a bit?

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,420
A Rolling Lantern?

54
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,750
What's wrong?

55
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,890
They don't have this kind of lantern in the capital.

56
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,690
Did you make it yourself, Honey?

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,040
Is it the style of the lantern in your hometown?

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,530
It burns forever

59
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,950
and rolls forward.

60
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,820
That's precisely it.

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,080
It is said that

62
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,330
your wish is most likely to be granted

63
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,730
if you make a wish when the first snow falls.

64
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,570
Here.

65
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,070
Let's go.

66
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:02,900
I...

67
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,940
Honey, what do you want to say?

68
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,840
Actually...

69
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,400
Actually, that day,

70
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,510
you mentioned your father,

71
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,120
and your bad memories were brought up.

72
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,580
He thought I was mad at him?

73
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
If I offended you,

74
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,730
please forgive me.

75
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,390
Honey, you're a straightforward and upright man.

76
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,590
Why would I blame you?

77
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,150
Rumor has it that River Lanterns

78
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,390
are the most effective things to grant your wish.

79
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,920
If you have anything to say,

80
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,159
just tell it.

81
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,950
Your father will hear it.

82
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,010
Honey, what wish did you make?

83
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,570
Do you believe

84
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,220
that there would be someone in the world

85
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,880
willing to give up everything

86
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,760
just for a snowstorm that hasn't been seen for years?

87
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,180
Honey, what are you talking about?

88
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,370
I think of an old friend of mine.

89
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,669
A young lady?

90
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,760
I wonder what happened between you

91
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,840
and that young lady later?

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
We've parted

93
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,770
and never seen each other again.

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Have you confessed your love to her?

95
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,950
No.

96
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,680
Sharing weal and woe

97
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,380
is being together.

98
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,210
However, parting from each other

99
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,790
can also be together in some way.

100
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,350
I don't know how she felt.

101
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,640
In this world,

102
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,770
being a woman

103
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,790
is a gamble,

104
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,700
let alone women's happiness.

105
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,420
If you didn't tell her,

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,140
how could she have guessed it?

107
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,910
What if it were you?

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Have you ever had a crush on a man?

109
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,760
I think if I get my hopes up,

110
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,400
in the end,

111
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,100
it's inevitable to be disappointed.

112
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
In this world,

113
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
there are many bosom friends

114
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
like Bo Ya and Ziqi,

115
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,390
but how many of them end well?

116
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,960
It's more so when it comes to romantic love.

117
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,420
For me,

118
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,720
it's even more out of reach

119
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,750
or transitory.

120
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,230
In this world,

121
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,960
few things never change,

122
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,140
like the sun or the moon.

123
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,440
Young people will become old without realizing the passage of time.

124
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,920
The common interests will be worn out.

125
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,880
Even lovers

126
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,580
can turn into strangers in a blink of an eye.

127
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,230
A secret wish to grow old with your lover

128
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,520
is most likely a thought of a child.

129
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,370
But most importantly,

130
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,030
when you see the person you love,

131
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,310
you'll know it's her,

132
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,820
and it can only be her.

133
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,430
It's him,

134
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,020
and it can only be him.
