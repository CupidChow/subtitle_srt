[Episode 19]

4
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,770
My wallet!

5
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,270
What's going on?

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,250
What's going on?

7
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,780
Are you blind?

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
You did it on purpose.

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,160
If I hadn't done it on purpose,

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,640
you wouldn't have come out.

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,540
They're from the capital.

12
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,180
We didn't expose our identities during this trip.

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,350
But why were we tracked here?

14
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,570
Since someone doesn't want us to go back,

15
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,810
who has the intention to kill us?

16
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,550
Are you suspecting someone?

17
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,470
I don't know.

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,770
You thought of someone.

19
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,850
But you don't want to believe it.

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,680
Believeing it or disbelieving it

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,730
is decided by just one thought.

22
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,680
Everything keeps changing.

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,440
In this world,

24
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,270
the number of things which I can keep is decreasing.

25
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,640
But the number of things which I can't keep

26
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,310
is increasing as time goes by.

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,350
If you don't try to keep it,

28
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,790
how do you know you can't keep it?

29
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,840
Well...

30
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,079
Don't leave anymore.

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,750
They are waiting impatiently.

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,030
Let's go find them now.

33
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,220
It's aching because I kicked you, right?

34
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,540
It doesn't matter.

35
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,150
Later, I'll help you to walk.

36
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,880
Yesterday,

37
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,000
what I said was a bit too harsh.

38
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Why did you leave me alone again?

39
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,880
Sister-in-law.

40
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's go at once.

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,420
I've booked two rooms outside the city.

42
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,040
Let's go there.

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,579
Then you two can go on talking with each other about your inner thoughts.

44
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,390
Two rooms?

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,220
Yes.

46
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,600
You two will share one room.

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,230
He and I will share the other room.

48
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,920
What else?

49
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,650
Let's go at once.

50
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,670
The residual chill in spring

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,250
penetrated my short dream.

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Raindrops fell on the plantain leaves under the roof.

53
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,200
As for those who have left,

54
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,790
have they ever thought about returning home?

55
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,110
Are you thinking about Xi'er?

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,610
I think

57
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,310
she's the same as you,

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,850
and she's also missing you.

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Me, too.

60
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,880
But I'm right beside you.

61
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,560
That day by the lakeside,

62
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I was impulsive.

63
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,510
I should have understood you more.

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
I hope you can remember

65
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,210
what I told you.

66
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,150
To some extent, we've finished the task

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
of being a couple for a hundred days.

68
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,080
Have you ever

69
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,659
regretted meeting me?

70
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,450
Never.

71
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,080
You don't have to make vicious remarks deliberately just in order to protect me.

72
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,409
I'm not afraid of facing

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,330
difficulties with you.

74
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,050
But I'm afraid of that.

75
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,580
I can't afford to lose.

76
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,040
Xie Jingshu.

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
I only have you.

78
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,940
Li Mengjue.

79
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm here.

80
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,550
The person who has got lost

81
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,610
is like a homeless dog.

82
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,150
Even though there is injustice for him,

83
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,480
and he has all kinds of grievances,

84
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,140
he has to look forward

85
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,250
and go on living.

86
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,550
Things are different now.

87
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,650
Only with you can I have a home.

88
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,820
You can rely on me.

89
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,230
Let's go on living our life together.

90
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,990
Then we can live a more decent life somehow.

91
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,830
But I have to go first.

92
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,230
Please

93
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,380
trust me.

94
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,470
[Grave of My Late Master Yuan Ji, Established by Xie Jingshu]

95
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,490
I'm still alive.

96
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,350
But you're not surprised at all.

97
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,350
Master, you brought me up after all.

98
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Seeing that you are safe,

99
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,090
I just feel relieved.

100
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,180
When did you guess it?

101
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,970
Xi'er once said that

102
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
you exchanged information with the people from Beiman through the chess club.

103
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,220
You love chess the most.

104
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,490
But the room was quite messy that day,

105
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,670
and the chessboard was the only area that looked tidy.

106
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,360
I think

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,080
you created the chaos yourself.

108
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,640
One wrong move

109
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,540
led to defeat in the entire chess game.

110
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,580
You lost.

111
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,040
Serve the tea.

112
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,080
It turns out that from the beginning to the end,

113
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
you've been one of them.
