[Miss You Forever]

3
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,560
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,510
Keep an eye on the Liu Residence for me.

5
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,840
I have a debt to collect.

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,370
What do you mean?

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,080
Sister.

8
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,700
Are you targeted?

9
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,670
I almost gave myself away yesterday.

10
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,190
He examined me on some details.

11
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,789
I told him that I used to work for the Liu family.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,890
Do you want me to poke around in the Liu Residence?

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,400
I can't be of much use otherwise.

14
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,310
But I can take care of this.

15
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,310
OK.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
I'll deal with other things.

17
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,400
Once I left the Xie Residence, he was onto me.

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,360
Who is he?

19
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,780
Who is she?

20
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,880
Why have I never seen her at the Xie Residence?

21
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,430
I have to find a way to get rid of him

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,060
so that I can check out the Liu Residence.

23
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,330
Sachets. Sachets.

24
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,870
Come on. Pick one.

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,330
Miss, do you want a sachet?

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Sir, do you want a sachet?

27
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,520
Sir, buy one.

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,630
Sachets.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,050
Sachets.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
Stop right there!

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,750
Stop!

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,210
Among countless households and streets,

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,880
you ran into me, Jingyan, a big hero.

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,470
Consider yourselves unlucky.

35
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,470
I'll count to three, and you still have a chance to run.

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,630
One.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
Two.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,910
Three.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Take him away.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,190
I'm Jingyan.

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,240
I'll be back soon.

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,400
Idiot.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,940
Not even a word of thanks.

44
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,620
Is she mute?

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,900
Torrential rain, heavy winds, and rolling waves.

46
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,470
Fresh fish and vegetables return with the spring.

47
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Too much scented powder.

48
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,310
Sorry for that.

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,710
I didn't expect you to be a member of Grim Reapers.

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,740
We met a few days ago.

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
It's nine o'clock.

52
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,610
You are no match for me.

53
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,440
Why don't we have a talk instead?

54
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,640
Minister Du

55
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,150
founded Grim Reapers

56
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,630
and hired countless

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,510
scouts and killers.

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,780
But among them, only two are his confidants.

59
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,350
One is you,

60
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,520
and the other

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,159
is me.

62
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,159
I know you and Mr. Xie

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,110
are a real couple.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
I also know

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,900
you're looking for the Sea Chart.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
So, that's your leverage

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,110
over me.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,880
What do you want?

69
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,990
The money pouch you took that day. Give it back.

70
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,760
Someone's fainted!

71
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,990
I'll wait for you at the deserted temple on the outskirts.

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,650
In recent cases,

73
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,190
without exception,

74
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,870
the culprits have left behind Sagebrush on the Snow at the scene.

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you think

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,030
these were done by Sagebrush on the Snow,

77
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,270
the killer from Beiman who has disappeared for years?

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,040
I've been following these cases.

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
But they are not related.

80
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,950
Also, some of the victims are from Beiman.

81
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,860
But in Beiman, there's an iron law

82
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,480
that prohibits people there from hurting each other.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,110
I knew you'd heard the rumors.

84
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,750
Rumor has it that Sagebrush on the Snow appeared again,

85
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,080
whose identity is hidden in the Sea Chart.

86
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,540
It seems that

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
you believe this?

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,060
I have to.

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,500
My father was framed,

90
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,300
being accused of rebellion.

91
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
The only thing we know

92
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,480
is that when he committed suicide in prison,

93
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,740
he held Sagebrush on the Snow in his hand.

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,020
I've been studying some scriptures.

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,320
I learned that desires stem from greed.

96
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,110
Compared to finding out the truth,

97
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,270
I'd rather you be safe.

98
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
You've been lying low in the capital for ten years,

99
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,950
suffering through great hardship.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,880
Now for some rumors,

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,610
you exposed yourself recklessly.

102
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,610
It's not worth it.

103
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,430
I cherish this game.

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,490
But in order to win,

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
I have to use it as a sword.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
I lost

107
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,120
this game.

108
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,100
I made a risky move.

109
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,070
I know

110
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,180
what you said is right.

111
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,880
However, obsessions and attachments

112
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,230
disable me to follow the path of the Buddha.

113
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,040
Life is short and bitter.

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,350
It's precisely because of this bitterness and brevity

115
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,950
that I will be single-minded

116
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,130
and rush toward my goal.

117
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,600
Xi'er.

118
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,080
I told you not to interfere.

119
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,809
Sister, you plan to investigate this chart yourself, right?

120
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
You've never thought about giving it to Grim Reapers.

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,910
Sister.

122
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,020
You know the consequence of betraying Grim Reapers.

123
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,280
Arrest warrants and countless killers.

124
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,200
I know.

125
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,070
But I won't get you implicated.

126
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,400
Sister.

127
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,600
You don't want to implicate me.

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,230
I know you're doing this for me.

129
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,030
You're wrong.

130
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,070
I won't be nice to anyone.

131
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,270
Keeping you out of this is not my major purpose.

132
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,440
Life is but

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,300
a fleeting moment.

134
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,670
Each person has their own destiny to confront.

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,520
Do you remember

136
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,610
what I said when I saved you?

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,700
If the world treats you unfairly,

138
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,720
then you should fight for your future.

139
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,400
I remember.

140
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,450
No matter what happens to you,

141
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,000
I will always be by your side.

142
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,050
Flat white bottom.

143
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,610
Evenly distributed patterns.

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,630
Shoe shaped.

145
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,240
Very high-quality silver.

146
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,710
[50 taels of Qingji Silver]

147
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
Qingji Silver.
