1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,319
Kele, what's wrong?

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,359
Wash it!

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,359
Okay.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,799
Do you want to wash it by machine
or dry-clean?

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,719
Hand wash.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,319
Okay.

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,159
Why did you touch my teddy bear?

8
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,959
Didn't you ask me...

9
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:41,959
What?

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,080
Shut up and get out.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,639
Kele.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,200
Did you meet anything

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,319
unpleasant today?

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,279
You can tell me.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,720
You knew it.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,479
You annoyed me.

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,880
You touched my teddy bear.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
How could I be happy?

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,720
Get out of here now.

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,599
If you don't,

21
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:03,560
I...

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,400
You see that?

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,919
I'd punch you to death!

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,040
Kele.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
If this can make you happy,

26
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,599
go ahead and punch me.

27
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:26,120
Weren't you reckless just now?

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,519
Won't my hand be painful

29
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,720
if I punch you?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,519
Your hand won't be painful.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,319
You'd care about me.

32
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,559
Cheesy.

33
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,919
You're the best.

=Episode 5=

36
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,839
Mr. Xu, I have something to report.

37
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,559
Throw the flowers away.

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,479
Isn't it blooming?

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
It bloomed in advance.

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,199
Do you know what it means?

41
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,360
It wants to bloom.

42
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,000
It wants to die.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,479
Change them to artificial flowers.

44
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,520
Non-living things

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,720
are more reassuring than living things.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,520
I'll get it done right away.

47
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,919
Hold on.

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
You haven't reported to me.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
There are bad news and worse news.

50
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,720
Which one would you
like to listen to first?

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,039
The worse news.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,080
Due to frequent server detection,

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,679
players are dissatisfied.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
So we have to stop

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,800
catching the movement of G4
for the moment.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,279
Carry out shutdown and
capacity expansion.

57
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,160
Why is it worse news?

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
IT department said it needs to
take two weeks.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,839
Two weeks.

60
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,160
I've told IT department

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,960
to cut it to one week.

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,960
If they can't do that,

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
all of them have to resign.

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,399
It was handled well.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,119
What should I tell Y4?

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
It's up to you.

67
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,080
As long as they're thankful for me.

68
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,320
Okay, I'll tell them

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
you give them one week of break.

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,800
All right.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,199
What's the bad news?

72
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,919
The bad news is

73
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,240
someone

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
supports Guan Qianya.

75
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,360
Who?

76
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,399
Guess it.

77
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,000
Lei Na.

78
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,559
I think you might misunderstand.

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,959
We're not close enough that

80
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,640
we can flirt with each other.

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,160
I know.

82
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't misunderstand me.

83
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,679
"Guess it" is the ID

84
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,160
of the supporter.

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,519
There are always rumors

86
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,760
on the internet.

87
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,640
You don't have to report everything.

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,519
Okay.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,519
Guan Qianya, apologize!

90
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,600
Guan Qianya, apologize!

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Guan Qianya, apologize!

92
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,359
Guan Qianya, apologize!

93
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
Bad woman Guan Qianya.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,839
Don't worry, Ms. Guan.

95
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,119
I've asked all our employees

96
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,679
to strike back on the internet.

97
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm not worried at all.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,279
There are many supporters online.

99
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
They are our employees.

100
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,000
(Netizens' comments)
Did you notice

101
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,359
the most active one

102
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,480
called "guess it"?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,839
That's me.

104
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,959
What should we do next?

105
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,480
We can't depend on ourselves.

106
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Next,

107
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,000
use the power of public media

108
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
to change this bad situation.

109
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,799
Well.

110
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,799
I think my ex-wife's best friend is
quite fit for it.

111
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,679
She's the top reporter of Follow News.

112
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,239
And we're pretty close to each other.

113
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,600
I can ask her to have an
exclusive interview with you.

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
If I'm not mistaken,

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,959
your ex-wife

116
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,959
is a loyal fan of Love Boys.

117
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,839
She is.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
But her best friend isn't.

119
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,200
I still remember

120
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,320
after I've divorced

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,559
with my ex-wife,

122
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,160
I told her how

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,200
Love Boys made me depressed and sad.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,279
She knew it all.

125
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,040
What are you waiting for?

126
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,000
Ask her out.

127
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,839
This isn't appropriate

128
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,079
to ask her out.

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,640
She's my ex-wife's best friend,
after all.

130
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
I've never thought of that.

131
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,799
I mean, the exclusive interview.

132
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:28,959
Right away.

133
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,959
Su Lie, I won't go easy on you today.

134
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,000
Go easy on me?

135
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm the one who should say that.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Come on then.

137
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Let's play this.

138
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,799
Okay.

139
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,880
Lu Xiao, open the door.

140
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,559
I took the teddy bear here.

141
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,119
Yesterday, you shouldn't...

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,040
Xu Nian.

143
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,959
What's wrong?

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Didn't you realize?

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
The matter now is very serious.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,679
I know.

147
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,000
Lu Xiao is still mad.

148
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,880
No.

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,959
That's not important.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,679
He's always like that.

151
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,600
What's more important

152
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,679
and serious than that is

153
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:53,040
Jiang Kele may not come back again.

154
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
She's pretty scary.

155
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,320
But if she doesn't come here,

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,040
we won't have good food.

157
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,600
Right.

158
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't worry.

159
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,600
Jiang Kele will come back.

160
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,760
We need her for the job.

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,359
You're right.

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,799
Lu Xiao made Jiang Kele mad.

163
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,320
It has nothing to do with us.

164
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,799
But only Xu Nian helped her.

165
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,399
Would she hold grudges against us?

166
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,799
You're right, too.

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,239
Jiang Kele is such a simple girl.

168
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,480
She won't hold grudges.

169
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,480
She'll come back once
she calms down.

170
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,679
I hope so.

171
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
(Facial Cleanser)
Go.

172
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't go.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Go.

174
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,080
Why are you still here?

175
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,880
You should've left at this time.

176
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,719
The salary of the part-time job is high.

177
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,039
You should've worked hard.

178
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm not going.

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I want to resign.

180
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Why?

181
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,159
Because I'm not happy with the job.

182
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,440
Let me tell you last night...

183
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,599
Stop. I know it all.

184
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,599
A great man once said that

185
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,919
if you're not happy with your job,

186
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
don't work then.

187
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,520
Don't make yourself suffer.

188
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,320
As you've decided to resign,

189
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
as your best friend,

190
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,679
I'll support you unconditionally.

191
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,599
Qiqi. Oh, dear.

192
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,039
I thought

193
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,400
we'll get far apart

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,960
after I got another job.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
I didn't expect you'd still
care about me.

196
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,760
All right, cut it.

197
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,840
If you're touched,

198
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,799
how about you introduce the job to me?

199
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,719
Don't make our life difficult.

200
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,799
How much is it actually?

201
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,200
Five times of our salary.

202
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,039
Oh my god, five times!

203
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,799
Three thousand, four thousand,
five thousand.

204
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,880
How about this?

205
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,320
If you really

206
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,840
want to get the job,

207
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,799
I can introduce it to you.

208
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,359
But the salary

209
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,239
can only be twice as ours now.

210
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,520
Twice?

211
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,960
Jiang Kele!

212
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,719
It's been a few days. You became clever.

213
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,159
How smart.

214
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,919
Pass the job I gave to you to others?

215
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,559
No wonder I feel strange today.

216
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,200
My eyelid keeps on twitching.

217
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
It made me want to meet you.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
It turns out that

219
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,359
I'm fated to expose you.

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,239
Granny.

221
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,719
We're all profiteers.

222
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
We don't have to expose each other.

223
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
Granny.

224
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,440
This lipstick is
the most popular one now.

225
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,440
It's a limited edition.

226
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
Only our store has it.

227
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,679
It's for you.

228
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,359
Thank you.

229
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,119
May I introduce myself?

230
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
Please go ahead.

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,479
You don't have to know my name

232
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,280
and my resume.

233
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,559
You just have to know that

234
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,320
Jiang Kele gets five times
of the salary for this job.

235
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,559
But I will do it for three times.

236
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Your self-introduction

237
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,000
lets me get to know you again.

238
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,520
I want to announce two things now.

239
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,599
First,

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm not going to resign.

241
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,599
I want to go back to work.

242
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,039
Second,

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,599
I don't want to befriend you anymore.

244
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,599
Please give me two dozen.

245
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay.

246
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,159
I can give you this.

247
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,919
All right, we can start now.

248
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
As a responsible public figure...

249
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,919
As a person with a sense of
social responsibility,

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,559
awaken women blinded by the illusion

251
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,280
and promote the healthy
development of society

252
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,840
are part of my job.

253
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,479
Although I was

254
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,919
attacked and scolded by netizens,

255
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,039
I don't care.

256
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:35,960
Because I know that

257
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,320
there are no others

258
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,479
who would speak out if I don't do so.

259
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,359
Ms. Guan.

260
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,719
Since you realized

261
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,039
the danger of Love Boys,

262
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
why did you say it

263
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
only when

264
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,039
the company's performance fell?

265
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,080
It's hard not to guess that

266
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,640
your motive is for your own benefit.

267
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
It's true.

268
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
The department store is depressed.

269
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,239
The apparel market declines.

270
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,000
The marriage market is bleak.

271
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,440
If I didn't do this job,

272
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,080
I'd be like others looking on.

273
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,640
If you don't experience it,

274
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
you won't know the pain.

275
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,960
I felt the pain,

276
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,239
so I shouted.

277
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,640
But no one knows

278
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,799
if he or she will be the next
who suffers from it.

279
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,479
Trending of Love Boys

280
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,200
will bring great harm to reality.

281
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,599
Isn't it just a game?

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,799
Won't it exaggerate?

283
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,479
For you who don't play games,

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
it's just a game.

285
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,760
For those who are addicted to the game,

286
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,359
it's the whole world to them.

287
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,320
My friend

288
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,320
used to be confident and optimistic.

289
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
She was looking forward to the future.

290
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,760
But after she played Love Boys...

291
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,159
I really hope that

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,039
she won't be deluded by Y4 anymore

293
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,960
and becomes confident,

294
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,520
adorable and lively as she used to be.

295
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Ms. Guan.

296
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,520
As a top reporter,

297
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,400
I've seen too many people
telling sad stories like that

298
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,559
to get sympathy.

299
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,919
Ms. Guan, did you ever play Love Boys?

300
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,359
To get to know our rival,

301
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,599
I've played it once.

302
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,520
To be honest, it's all trash.

303
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,039
So Ms. Guan,

304
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,239
your company was defeated by trash?

305
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,400
Yes.

306
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:23,960
Didn't your best friend

307
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,280
get divorced because of trash as well?

308
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,320
Ms. Guan, I knew it all.

309
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,599
Don't be mad.

310
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,080
She likes to pick on others.

311
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,760
But it wasn't aimed at you.

312
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,400
Did she act harshly when
you two talked

313
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,479
for the whole night?

314
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,479
When she talked with me,

315
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
she's pretty gentle.

316
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,119
Maybe she's

317
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,159
serious at work.

318
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,679
So you should trust me more.

319
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,799
Because of me,

320
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,840
she won't write anything negative.

321
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,320
I won't trust you anymore.

322
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,479
I'll figure it out myself.

323
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,200
What else could you think of?

324
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
If there's still another way,

325
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,159
would a top reporter interview you?

326
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,799
You and your ex-wife's best friend

327
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,000
get lost.

328
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:17,273
(Yao Inc.)

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,159
As long as I finished cleaning
before 4 o'clock,

330
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,479
I won't be seeing them.

331
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,159
Just be like usual.

332
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,679
Keep it up, Jiang Kele.

333
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,440
What are you doing?

334
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
We're having English afternoon tea
for four.

335
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,760
Now it's English afternoon tea
for three.

336
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,840
Why are you all here at this time?

337
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,440
Mr. Xu appreciated our hard work

338
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,119
and gave us one week break.

339
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,599
What are you holding?

340
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,599
Is it something delicious?

341
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,479
I brought you egg waffles.

342
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,359
Egg waffles

343
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,000
are the perfect match for afternoon tea.

344
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,799
Now it's English afternoon tea
for four.

345
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,239
Should we ask Lu Xiao to come
and eat as well?

346
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,239
No! He doesn't deserve to eat
my egg waffles.

347
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,559
If he's hungry,

348
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,359
go back to his room
and eat his teddy bear.

349
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,919
Don't worry.

350
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,919
Lu Xiao won't eat his teddy bear.

351
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,919
It means a lot to him.

352
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,479
It doesn't mean a lot to him.

353
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,119
The person who gave it to him
means a lot to him.

354
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,960
So he doesn't let others touch it.

355
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,840
No matter how important it is,

356
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,479
did he have to be that mad?

357
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,599
He even wanted to beat me.

358
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
That's how he's like.

359
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,719
We used to dance together.

360
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,200
I stepped on his foot accidentally.

361
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,559
He said he wanted to beat me to death.

362
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,919
Look at me now.

363
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm still alive.

364
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,479
Did your wound recover yet?

365
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,599
Don't mention it.

366
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,359
It's still painful.

367
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,760
He punched you?

368
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,159
The blow was too fast.

369
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,200
I couldn't dodge.

370
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,239
I met Lu Xiao once while sleepwalking.

371
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,080
He threw me over his shoulder.

372
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,039
It was too fast.

373
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,559
I was awakened right away.

374
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,640
Does he usually act so to you too?

375
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,760
He won't act so to me.

376
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,520
I can still compete with him.

377
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,760
Because Xu Nian is the leader.

378
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,799
Lu Xian only bullies the weak.

379
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,640
We've been living in constant fear

380
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,039
of him for over ten years.

381
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,799
After hearing all these,

382
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,919
I feel much better.

383
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,159
But don't worry.

384
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,559
I won't forgive him.

385
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
It's fine.

386
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,760
As long as you bring us good food.

387
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
Not a problem.

388
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,760
I'll bring you good food every day.

389
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,359
From now on,

390
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,280
four of us are victims league.

391
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,960
Cheers!

392

I won't clean your room anymore.

394
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,760
Just stay in your dirty room.

395
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,599
I'm back.

396
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,839
My sunshine is back.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,959
I need some positive energy
from you, quick.

398
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,680
Stop it.

399
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,920
Your sunshine is out of battery soon.

400
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,479
What I can do now is

401
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,119
not to deliver negative energy.

402
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,439
What's wrong with you?

403
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,599
I met some troubles at work.

404
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,280
Your cosmetic shop has
a few people only.

405
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,599
What troubles do you have?

406
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,439
No matter how many people,

407
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,680
either two or five,

408
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,119
there'll be wheeling and dealing.

409
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,839
Wheeling and dealing?

410
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,680
You should ask me that.

411
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,839
I'm good at wheeling and dealing.

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,400
No.

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,680
I mean, handle rivalry
inside the company.

414

Go ahead and tell me. I'm listening.

Nothing, actually.

416
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,640
Well, my colleague

417
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,520
has a dirty toy.

418
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,599
I saw it, so I washed it.

419
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,800
He didn't thank me

420
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
but scolded me and even
wanted to beat me.

421
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,520
I have one question for you.

422
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,760
Did he ask you to wash it?

423
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:19,800
No.

424
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,079
That's why!

425
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,800
He didn't ask you to wash it.

426
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,719
After you washed it,

427
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,880
you wanted him to thank you.

428
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,640
Weren't you making trouble?

429
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,359
So I did wrong.

430
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,280
No!

431
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,119
Women never do wrong.

432
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,160

00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,359
As your best friend,

434
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,719
I'm always by your side.

435
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,520
Just say it.

436
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,280
Should we scold, punch or ruin him?

437
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,560
Cut it out.

438
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,359
I scolded him.

439
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,199
I took revenge.

440
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,880
Great.

441
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,119
As women,

442
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,439
we should protect ourselves.

443
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,839
Since you took revenge,

444
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,479
forget about it.

445
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,400
Got it.

446
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,680
Women should be mean or generous

447
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,359
at the right time.

448
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,160

It's fine.

452
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I won't understand too if you tell me.

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,359
If I said something wrong,
you'd scold me.

454
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,239
Don't say again. Let's drink.

can be taken till the end of the month.

the dosage by yourself.

it's life-threatening.

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Guan Qianya, come out!

518
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,959
Ms. Guan.

519
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,880
Did you see that?

520
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,319
Is that spectacular?

521
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,040
(Crush On Love)
I saw that.

522
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,599
Quickly chase the people we hired away.

523
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,640
How embarrassing.

524
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,040
I can't.

525
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,479
They're not hired. They're all real.

526
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,520
What?

527
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,199
Look.

528
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,640
After my ex-wife's best friend
published the article,

529
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,079
many people support you now.

530
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,880
Guan Qianya, we love you!

531
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,760
Support Guan Qianya!

532
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,160
Support Guan Qianya!

533
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,680
Guan Qianya is the best!

534
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:16,439
Love ya, Guan Qianya.

535
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,359
We love you, Guan Qianya.

536
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,640
Who's that?

537
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,319
Come in.

538
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,719
You told me to come in.

539
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,119
Get out.

540
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,640
I've come in.

541
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,439
Don't chase me away.

542
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,400
You're reading?

543
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,160
Look what I brought.

544
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,000
Milk tea.

545
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
You must've never tried it before.

546
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,000
Listen, I've forgiven you.

547
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,479
If you drink this milk tea,

548
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,119
then let's wipe out the past.

549
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,719
No.

550
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,160
Give it a try! It tastes good.

551
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,079
No.

552
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,119
Really.

553
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,119
Lu Xiao, if you don't want to drink,

554
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,800
can you give it to us?

555
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,920
As long as you move her out,

556
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,160
the milk tea is yours.

557
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,400
If you dare to drag me,

558
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,280
I won't bring good food

559
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
to you again.

560
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,920
Well, Lu Xiao.

561
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,040
It's a matter between you two.
We shouldn't get involved.

562
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,280
You two settle it.

563
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,160
Goodbye.

564
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Enjoy your milk tea.

565
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,119
There are no others here.

566
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,040
Just tell me.

567
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,680
What should I do for you to forgive me?

568
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,760
Get out.

569
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't want to go out!

570
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,119
Unless you make yourself clear.

571
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,959
Gentlemen won't beat others.

572
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,839
I...

573
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh no.

574
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,199
All right, there's a matter of Qi Chuan.

575
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,239
Has he died?

576
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,400
No.

577
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,439
Didn't I say that

578
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,319
I don't want to

579
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,400
hear about him unless he is dead?

580
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,439
Okay, I won't say then.

581
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,959
You almost said it.

582
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,640
Just say it.

583
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,760
Qi Chuan also reposted the article

584
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,319
and asked all the fans

585
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,199
to support Guan Qianya.

586
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,959
Qi Chuan has lost popularity.

587
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,359
That's why he likes to show himself.

588
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,160
To be honest, it's all trash.

589
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,359
So Ms. Guan,

590
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,400
your company was defeated by trash?

591
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,079
Ms. Guan, did you ever play Love Boys?

592
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,359
To get to know our rival,
I've played once.

593
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,439
To be honest, it's all trash.

594
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,520
Mr. Xu, are you okay?

595
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,719
I'm all right.

596
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
But Guan Qianya is in trouble.

597
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,040
Good afternoon all.

598
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,239
The next song is the latest song

599
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,760
by Master Songwriter, Qi Chuan.

600
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,239
This song continues to explore

601
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,800
the inner world of a cool girl.

602
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,680
It's a song followed by the hit song

603
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,239
seven years ago called
see-through bangs.

604
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,199
Thank you for giving me inspiration.

605
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,599
Qi Chuan is the most talented person.

606
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,760
Guan Qianya, come out!

607
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,520
Guan Qianya, apologize!

608
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,160
Guan Qianya, come out!

609
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,760
Guan Qianya, apologize!

610
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,520
Guan Qianya, come out!

611
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,479
So annoying.

612
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,800
Why are there so many people
waiting for me?

613
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,920
I think they're waiting for Guan Qianya.

614
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,800
Let's go.

615
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,199
He's really Qi Chuan.

616
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,040
I loved his songs when I was
in high school.

617
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,479
He's so handsome in that style.

618
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh goodness, he's looking at me.

619
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,959
I think he's looking at me.

620
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:43,880
His new song

621
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,400
is produced for a girl like me.

622
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,040
Hello, Mr. Qi Chuan.

623
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,640
Hello.

624
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
This is Ms. Guan.

625
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,920
Mr. Qi Chuan.

626
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,359
I really admire you a lot.

627
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
Your songs are so nice.

628
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,199
You're good-looking too.

629
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:03,920
Mr. Cui.

630
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,479
Please close the door.

631
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,439
I opened it deliberately.

632
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Let our employees see that

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,839
Mr. Qi Chuan is willing to work with us,

634
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,640
so as to gain their confidence.

635
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,560
Ms. Guan.

636
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,160
Don't feel embarrassed.

637
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,280
Everyone knows that your company

638
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,079
is going to be bankrupt.

639
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,560
I don't feel embarrassed.

640
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,560
I just want to help you,

641
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,599
a once famous artist to regain dignity.

642
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,439
Your buttons are messed up.

643
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,760
Ms. Guan has sharp eyes.

644
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,000
Bravo.

645
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,599
I'll close the door.

646
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,079
Stop looking. Back to work!

647
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,520
Go back quickly!

648
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,319
They closed the door.
They're going to discuss work.

649
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,280
If Ms. Guan and Qi Chuan can cooperate,

650
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,680
our company will gain hope.

651
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,479
Then I don't have to resign.

652
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,400
Qi Chuan is a savior.

653
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,479
Savior?

654
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
He's just an artist who
used to be famous.

655
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,160
Y4 are the most famous now.

656
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,439
Wake up please.

657
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,280
How impolite.

658
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,839
My manager told me that

659
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,719
your commerce department has long
contacted me, right?

660
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,040
For endorsement.

661
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,119
Right.

662
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,079
But that was

663
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,640
like last year or the past two years.

664
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,520
Did you think that I'm not
famous anymore?

665
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you know how popular
my latest song is?

666
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,280
Come on. Play it for them.

667
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,959
No, you've always been famous.

668
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,439
But as you know,

669
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,079
our company went bankrupt.

670
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,239
My endorsement fee.

671
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,400
You can pay for sure.

672
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,560
I know my company.

673
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,920
I think we can't pay you.

674
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,520
What if I say

675
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,959
I just need one yuan.

676
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,239
I'm not cooperating with you for money.

677
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,640
Our company

678
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
won't be able to give you shares.

679
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
I don't want shares either.

680
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Qi Chuan.

681
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm very curious and confused.

682
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,680
You don't want money

683
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,280
and shares.

684
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,359
What do you want exactly?

685
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,319
I want you to

686
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,599
beat Xu Guanghan together with me.

687
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,839
Mr. Xu, what's the matter?

688
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,439
Do you know who I trust the most

689
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,640
among you all?

690
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,400
Me?

691
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,479
What a narcissist.

692
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,160
But you're right.

693
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,599
You're intelligent.

694
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,239
I've never worried about you.

695
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,599
You also help me to take care of them.

696
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,760
You taught me well.

697
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:49,959
Luckily you knew it.

698
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,599
In this world,

699
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,000
you won't exist without me.

700
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,520
Yes, I bear it in mind.

701
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,880
Now I have a very important mission

702
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,839
for you.

703
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,680
You won't let me down, right?

704
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:07,959
What's it?

705
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,400
Bear in mind.

706
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,920
Remember everything I'm going

707
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,359
to tell you.

708
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,560
And never say it to anyone.

709
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,160
Okay.
