1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,120
Lei Na.

2
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,479
Let's go.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,440
Okay.

4
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,159
Let's go.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,799
Go.

6
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,159
Slow down.

7
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:03,520
Be careful.

8
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,040
Mr. Xu left.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,879
He's gone.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,160
That was amazing.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,680
Come on.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Lu Xiao!

13
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,480
Yes!

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,239
Drop the act.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,639
I knew you were nervous.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,720
He could have found me.

17
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,680
You're insane.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,480
You had two chances to report me

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,519
since yesterday.

20
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,120
You even carried me and
wrapped me in a carpet.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,160
You are only cold on the outside.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,919
But deep down, you care about me.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,959
Say whatever you want.

24
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:35,879
Kele.

25
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,919
I think Lu Xiao likes carrying you.

26
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:47,080
I finally have a place in Bay House!

27
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,880
We'll talk outside.

28
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,440
=Love Crossed=

29
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,580
=Episode 7=

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,119
We got the wrong entrance!

31
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,520
Catch her!

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,880
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,520
Stop!

34
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,320
Stop right there!
There is nowhere to run!

35
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,720
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,919
Stop!

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,720
Back off!

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,839
Let go of me!

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,279
Put me down!

40
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,279
Who are you?

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,679
I'm the janitor.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,520
How did you get in here?

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
I got in with this access card.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,279
Where did you get that?

45
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,039
An old lady gave it to me.

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
She's your previous janitor.

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
She wears a jacket
and rides a motorcycle.

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,040
She broke her leg recently.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
So she gave me the job.

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,720
She even takes a cut from it.

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,079
I helped pay her medical bill upfront.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,760
I even worked for her

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,040
without getting a single cent for days.

54
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,519
What did you say?

55
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,640
I'll say it again.

56
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,720
An old lady

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,480
broke her leg.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,359
She transferred her job to me.

59
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,119
I helped pay her medical bill upfront.

60
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,160
I worked in her stead for days

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
without getting paid a single cent.

62
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:00,959
Aunty.

63
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:04,839
You're a rich old lady.

64
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,279
Why are you still
staying in this old house?

65
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,720
Is it too old and shabby for you?

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,799
You've been living here
since you were a kid.

67
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,359
Unlike you,

68
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm attached to this place.

69
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm very sentimental.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm not moving away.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,959
If you were as sentimental

72
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,519
as you said,

73
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,799
why did you owe that young lady
your medical fee

74
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,160
and take a cut from her salary?

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
That silly girl.

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,760
So you found out.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,760
If you knew,

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,519
why did you send her to Bay House?

79
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,079
She is not silly.

80
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,119
She exposed you

81
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,320
as soon as I caught her.

82
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,559
She found out about G4.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,519
She even became their friend.

84
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,799
It's good when young people get along.

85
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,799
They are our greatest secret.

86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,040
That is why I assigned you,

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,239
the aunt I trusted the most

88
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,679
to be their housekeeper.

89
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Spare me your fancy words.
I am just a janitor.

90
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,760
Saying I'm a housekeeper is far-fetched.

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,519
Aren't you worried

92
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,880
our effort would go down the drain

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,679
if the public finds out?

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Hold on.

95
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,720
It's your project, not mine.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,760
I am merely a janitor.

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,600
I've told you.

98
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,959
Those four kids

99
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,000
deserve to have

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,239
their own lives.

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
You shouldn't keep them locked up

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,119
in your basement.

103
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,559
You made me a promise

104
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,000
that you would let them go
when the contract ended.

105
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,079
Did you fulfill your promise?

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
We extended the contract.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,440
I still need them

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,959
for my final stage.

109
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:33,880
Aunty.

110
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Are you sure you didn't just send a spy

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
by my side?

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,799
A spy?

113
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,640
That's the job

114
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,880
of some secret agents.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,839
I am merely a janitor.

116
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,799
What use is she to me?

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,480
You sent her there to
sabotage my project.

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,959
If I wanted to do so,

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,320
I would have done so long ago.

120
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,839
We wouldn't be sitting here

121
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,200
talking like a caring family.

122
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,239
Actually,

123
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,519
I've been observing her
before putting her to work.

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Do you know?

125
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,720
She is a die-hard fan of Love Boys'.

126
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,079
You always believe in the data.

127
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,279
Go ahead and check.

128
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:16,040
The frequency
she goes online, her playtime

129
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,519
and her interaction with Lu Xiao.

130
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,440
There is no way she would betray you.

131
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,799
I don't trust anyone.

132
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,920
You're the only person I trust.

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
I appreciate that.

134
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,440
But think about it.

135
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,839
If she wanted to sue you,

136
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,359
she could have done it.

137
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,559
She wouldn't have waited so long
for you to find out.

138
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,399
Forget it.

139
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:59,000
Were you really in an accident?

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,640
Why don't you give it a try?

141
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,040
Fine.

142
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,559
I'm glad you're all right.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
My goodness.

144
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm standing in Xu Guanghan's office,

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,399
the father of Love Boys!

146
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm living in a real fantasy!

147
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't celebrate too soon.

148
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,239
You might never leave this office.

149
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Do you want me to live here?

150
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,599
I'd be glad to live here!

151
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,239
I can enjoy the company
of these scale models!

152
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,440
But actually,

153
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,159
Lu Xiao is all I need.

154
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,640
Mr. Xu.

155
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

156
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,359
Very well.

157
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,919
You may leave now.

158
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,359
Didn't you say I could live here?

159
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,440
First of all,

160
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,880
I have never said that

161
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,719
you could live here.

162
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,559
Secondly,

163
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,440
leave.

164
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,000
And thirdly,

165
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,919
can I have a little souvenir?

166
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,440
Not a chance.

167
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,479
Stop right there.

168
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,640
What?

169
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,320
You agreed I could keep this!

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
Your working hour will be

171
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,760
from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,080
Leave when your work is done.

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Do not stay even a minute longer.

174
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Do not interact with G4.

175
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,479
Do not talk to them.

176
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,760
Do not bring them any snacks
from the outside.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,280
If I ever found out,

178
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,239
you would be doomed.

179
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,679
Doomed?

180
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,159
I should already be doomed anyway.

181
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,559
But I'm still alive and well.

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,679
Perhaps I should pull off
something bigger.

183
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,239
See you next time.

184
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,520
Get out.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,119
Yes!

186
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,150
(Endorsement Contract)

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,719
Qi Chuan turned down

188
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,479
the invitations of other social media.

189
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,479
Only Crush On Love
has the exclusive slot.

190
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,440
I bet Ms. Guan paid a handsome sum

191
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
as your sponsor.

192
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,400
First of all,

193
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,479
it's not that Qi Chuan accepted
the invitation of Crush On Love.

194
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,799
He proposed a partnership.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,320
Any conversation regarding
endorsement fee

196
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,799
should be considered a personal matter.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,039
Or perhaps

198
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,919
Qi Chuan can answer your question.

199
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,919
I don't mind making it public.

200
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,400
I basically ask for nothing
for the endorsement.

201
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,200
In a partnership with Ms. Guan,

202
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,919
money is not my priority.

203
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
If it's not the money,

204
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,239
what could be even more important?

205
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,599
Our priority is to beat
our common enemy.

206
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,799
The enemy of my enemy

207
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,679
is my friend.

208
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,119
By enemy, do you mean

209
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,080
the CEO of Yao Inc., Mr. Xu Guanghan?

210
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,719
Indeed.

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,239
This is not the first time

212
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,159
I've declared war on the Love Boys.

213
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,119
Let's not point out the obvious.

214
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,479
Joining hands with an independent woman

215
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,559
of great leadership

216
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,200
is my honor.

217
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,479
As an idol for the younger generation,

218
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,239
I feel obligated

219
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:51,960
to protect and preserve the well-being
of our young generation.

220
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,640
(The Master Songwriter Qi Chuan)

221
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,599
(has joined hands with President
Guan Qianya of Crush On Love.)

222
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,119
See?

223
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,239
What do you find disgusting

224
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,520
about this picture?

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,359
Guan Qianya edited the video
to make her legs slimmer and longer?

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
Qi Chuan edited his figure?

227
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,320
No!

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,960
It's the word "Songwriter".

229
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,559
Every song he's written

230
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,239
was the work of some hired songwriters.

231
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:36,320
Yet he is shameless enough
to crown himself the Master Songwriter.

232
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,359
That shameless jerk!

233
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,000
Indeed.

234
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,760
Even I wrote a song for him.

235
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,000
I was quite impressed
with your song "Fringe".

236
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,119
Why did you cut your fringe anyway?

237
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,320
I wanted to look more mature.

238
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,840
Back to the topic.

239
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,080
You practically gave him
the success he has today.

240
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,280
But that ingrate sued you.

241
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,080
Let's not dwell on the past.

242
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
It's not like his career is taking off.

243
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,880
He is now partnering with
a marriage agency.

244
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,559
He is basically not getting paid

245
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,559
for this endorsement deal.

246
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,440
He's getting back at you.

247
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,320
Getting back at me?
As if he's capable of that.

248
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,760
I bet he's trying to get on my nerve.

249
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,080
The woman you hate the most

250
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
is teaming up with the man
you despise the most.

251
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,799
Shouldn't we retaliate?

252
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,559
We'll observe for now.

253
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,479
Hello, good afternoon.

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,880
What's wrong with you?

255
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,080
You could have clear your debt

256
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,719
instead of buying this junk.

257
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,799
What's wrong with you?

258
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,359
Don't you dare touch my beloved Lu Xiao!

259
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,840
I'll be right back.

260
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
As for the money,

261
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,479
I'll pay you next month after my payday.

262
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,320
Not to mention

263
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,880
you already have enough money

264
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,000
to hire Qi Chuan.

265
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm not paying him a single coin.

266
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
How did you do that?

267
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm charismatic.

268
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,880
When a woman is
successful in her career,

269
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,000
the man will be attracted by her charm.

270
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Qi Chuan is your man now?

271
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,440
What's wrong with you?

272
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,440
Something's wrong with you.

273
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,359
Fine!

274
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,080
But honestly,

275
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,559
Qi Chuan has written
numerous remarkable songs,

276
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,679
but after interacting
with him for some time,

277
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,280
I realized

278
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
he barely has any real talent.

279
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,000
Who cares if he has real talents?

280
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,599
What really matters is that
he treats you well.

281
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,359
Just like my dear Lu Xiao.

282
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,359
Are you still in love with this jabroni?

283
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:51,919
Right?

284
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,400
Shut up. You're the jabroni.

285
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,359
He is my dearest Lu Xiao.

286
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
Lu Xiao.

287
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,239
Tell me.

288
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,840
Who picked up the call this morning?

289
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,400
A colleague from the cosmetic shop.

290
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,479
I thought your colleague are all girls.

291
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,039
Is your boss a woman too?

292
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,119
He is new there.

293
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,880
Whoever it's,

294
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,799
I am telling you,

295
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,280
do not become addicted to this.

296
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,719
We only talked for few words today.

297
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,799
But it was clear to me

298
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,159
that the person

299
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,400
was not very bright.

300
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't worry.

301
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,359
I will never fall for any other man.

302
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,559
You're so dashing.

303
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,679
Imagine yourself

304
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,960
lying in a dark house

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,840
on a soft and comfortable bed.

306
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:05,239
Your emotions are concentrated
on your face.

307
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,679
It's relaxed and calm.

308
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,039
Every muscle...

309
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,599
Are you still awake?

310
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,559
No!

311
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,760
Then why would you answer?

312
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:44,960
What is it?

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't fall asleep.

314
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,520
I'll be right back.

315
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,680
Imagine yourself lying in a dark room.

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,599
You're lying on a comfortable bed.

317
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,880
Your emotions are concentrated
on your face.

318
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,160
It's calm and relaxed.

319
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:21,599
Every muscle slowly relaxes.

320
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,439
From your shoulder
to your arms and your body.

321
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,160
All of them are sinking in.

322
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:39,319
Your legs and thighs,

323
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,760
your ankles and toes

324
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,000
are all sinking in.

325
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,800
It's like you were
sinking into the floor.

326
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,239
Sink in...

327
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
Kele.

328
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,959
Jiang Kele!

329
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,950
(The player's online, enter the game?)

330
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
What did you call me at this late hour?

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,280
A different style.

332
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,719
You came out wearing casual clothing.

333
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,119
Are you a family man now?

334
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,199
You know I'm a virtual character.

335
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,199
Stop teasing me.

336
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,760
What do you need from me?

337
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,400
Hypnotize me.

338
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,479
I already showed you the method.

339
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,719
Practice on your own.

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,760
Hold on.

341
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,920
You can't leave unless I log out.

342
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,800
Good point.

343
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,079
I'll sit down. Practice on your own.

344
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,680
I only asked for your help

345
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
because I couldn't do it.

346
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
I have important work tomorrow.

347
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Hypnotize me.

348
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,640
It worked out the last time

349
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
because you didn't realize

350
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,760
it was hypnosis.

351
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,479
Not only are you aware of it now,

352
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,520
you even show hostility.

353
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,160
I don't know if that would work.

354
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
Enough talking.

355
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,040
Get to work now.

356
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,040
I should close my hands, right?

357
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,760
We've tried this five times.

358
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,880
There was no effect at all.

359
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,239
What do I do now?

360
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,040
Tell me the real reason
why you can't fall asleep.

361
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,439
Xiaoya.

362
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,000
Xiaoya?

363
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,280
Have you finished your homework?

364
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
Do you feel tired?

365
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,079
Not at all.

366
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,439
You don't have to be here all the time.

367
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,719
Go home and rest well after
you finish your homework.

368
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,119
You still attend class tomorrow.

369
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,959
Dad, rest well.

370
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,800
I've been suffering from
insomnia for over ten years.

371
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,079
Do you have a way
to help me fall asleep?

372
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,119
Your father died

373
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,359
because of you.

374
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,800
What did you say?

375
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,680
Had you not

376
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,599
stayed by his bedside,

377
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,359
others would have checked on him,

378
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,520
then he wouldn't have died.

379
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,239
Whether you admit it or not,

380
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,640
this is your fault.

381
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,959
You are angry

382
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,040
because I unraveled the deepest fear

383
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,400
in your heart.

384
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,160
It's been years.

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,079
That scene

386
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,959
has been replayed over and over again

387
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,599
in your heart.

388
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,199
(But you never admit your mistake.)

389
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,479
(You never face your fear.)

390
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,760
(I guess you've never shed a tear)

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,560
(since his passing.)

392
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,800
That's because if you cried,

393
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,760
you would be the cause
of your father's death.

394
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,119
It's all right. Let it out.

395
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,400
Throughout our life,

396
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,640
we'll have many regrets.

397
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,000
But if you keep those regrets

398
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,199
deep in your heart

399
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,920
and dwell on them,

400
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,880
it won't do you any good.

401
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
I believe

402
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,920
if your father could see you right now,

403
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
he would hope that

404
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,839
you would let go of those burdens

405
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,040
and live a happy life.

406
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Qi Chuan.

407
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,839
We'll film this for our first take,

408
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,760
then we proceed with this.

409
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,560
Okay?

410
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,880
It was too dark, I need a closer look.

411
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,959
All right. Give it your best.

412
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,599
Mr. Qi Chuan.

413
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,319
Mr. Cui.

414
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,920
Welcome your arrival.

415
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,680
I listened to your latest album.

416
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,199
Such remarkable work!

417
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,560
Have some coffee to lift your spirit.

418
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,319
This must be your manager.

419
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
Your see-through bang...

420
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,760
I remember now!

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Did you write songs

422
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,959
based on those around you?

423
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,000
You are so gifted!

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,079
I think your next album

425
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,959
should have Ms. Guan in it for sure.

426
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,119
That depends on

427
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,599
whether she could
give me any inspiration.

428
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,719
Ms. Guan?

429
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,239
Ms. Guan!

430
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,800
Boss.

431
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,000
Speaking of the devil.

432
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,000
The set is already very dark.

433
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,280
Can you see anything
with those sunglasses?

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,439
It's part of my outfit today.

435
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Your outfit?

436
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,880
My sunglasses.

437
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,400
I knew something was missing today.

438
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,719
It's much better now.

439
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,239
Ms. Guan.

440
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,760
You look smart with this outfit.

441
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,920
It's stunning.

442
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,319
Perhaps you should wear this for
your meeting with Mr. Zhang.

443
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,479
I arranged a dinner plan for you.

444
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,839
Mr. Zhang? The one who is divesting?

445
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,760
I thought it was strange too.

446
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,119
He invited you to have
dinner at his house.

447
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,079
Why would I go to the house

448
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,520
of a single old man?

449
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,239
Don't be so harsh.

450
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,760
He's not single.

451
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,439
He lost his wife.

452
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,439
I think

453
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,479
there is nothing to lose here.

454
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,520
If things go well,

455
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,319
we might even get another investor.

456
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,839
But if it's otherwise,

457
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,119
we might receive some bridewealth.

458
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,640
If I got the bridewealth,

459
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,680
you would be getting a funeral.

460
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,760
If I say I love you...

461
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,319
If I say I love you,

462
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:05,199
would you listen to me?

463
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,719
Cut! Who is that?

464
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,160
Sorry, it was too dark in here.

465
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,079
It's all right.

466
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,359
Director, this is our boss.

467
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,359
She is here to inspect our progress.

468
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:23,000
Mr. Qi Chuan, continue your filming.

469
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
I told you it was too dark in here!

470
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Stop wandering around!

471
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,760
Again!

472
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,199
It feels great not wearing a helmet.

473
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,680
I can breathe better.

474
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,319
Someone is here.

475
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,239
Stop!

476
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,040
Halt! Who are you?

477
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,439
This is private property.

478
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,800
No outsider allowed.

479
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm not an outsider. I work here.

480
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,520
Excuse me, but we don't know you.

481
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,479
Of course you do!

482
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,560
We met every day!

483
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,199
You subdued me to the floor yesterday!

484
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,719
I'm here without my helmet!

485
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,199
It was you yesterday?

486
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,079
Listen, I managed to lose some weight!

487
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
How are you?

488
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,199
It's useless to lose weight with your bad eyes.

489
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,199
Your face was all covered up.

490
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,560
You don't have
an attractive figure either.

491
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,520
There's no way
we could have recognized you.

492
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,719
Fine, I'm not very attractive.

493
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,520
Can I enter now?

494
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,560
Halt!

495
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,640
You still can't go in there.

496
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,719
Mr. Xu gave us a hard lesson yesterday.

497
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:36,160
He ordered us to tighten the security.

498
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,239
We must confirm your identity

499
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,640
with our superior.

500
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,760
Call Mr. Xu now.

501
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,560
No.

502
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,479
We don't have

503
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,119
the authority to call Mr. Xu directly.

504
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,199
I could ask Lei Na instead.

505
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,160
What is your name?

506
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,040
Jiang Kele.

507
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,800
Your position?

508
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
Chief Janitor.

509
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,760
Not too shabby.

510
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,680
Hello? Ms. Lei Na?

511
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I am Xiaotao.

512
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,839
There is a girl named Jiang Kele
at the entrance.

513
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,800
She claimed to be
the Chief Janitor of Bay House.

514
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,280
Should we let her in?

515
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,439
All right. Understood.

516
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,719
Welcome to the big family of Yao Inc.!

517
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,400
Don't bother.

518
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,800
You don't make me feel like

519
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I'm one of the family.

520
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:42,040
Do you know why I asked you
to run a half-marathon?

521
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,239
It's our punishment.

522
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,560
Do you know why I punish you?

523
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,280
-Yes.
-We don't know.

524
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,000
I have no idea.

525
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,400
You don't know?

526
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,479
What was inside the carpet?

527
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,800
It's not an object.

528
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,040
It was a girl.

529
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,239
Do you know why now?

530
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,199
Yes.

531
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,319
I wanted to report it.

532
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,719
But I was too scared.

533
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,479
It was Luo Ke.

534
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,160
Luo Ke insisted on having the snacks
she brought in.

535
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,959
Xu Nian agreed she could stay.

536
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,760
I couldn't do anything about it.

537
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,920
Just admit it.

538
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
You ate all the snacks she brought.

539
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,239
Xu Nian, why did you agree
to let her stay?

540
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,680
She said Grandma Fushun was hurt.

541
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,839
She was here to replace her for days.

542
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,280
I thought it was a sound reason.

543
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,560
So I agreed to let her stay.

544
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,560
A sound reason?

545
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:33,359
If it's so reasonable,
then keep running!

546
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What about Lu Xiao?

547
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,040
He never agreed to let her stay.

548
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,199
You still have the strength to argue!
Run faster!

549
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,439
Why did you help them lie?

550
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,079
You won't tell me?

551
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,839
More! A full marathon for you!

552
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Just you wait.

553
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,400
Someday

554
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,239
I'm going to thwart all of these!

555
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,479
What?

556
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,680
Why are you staring at me?

557
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,239
Don't you dare!

558
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,040
Stop staring.

559
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,800
I finally got the evidence.

560
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,319
Jiang Kele is gone for good.

561
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,359
No one will ever bring us snacks again!

562
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,199
Do you only care about snacks?

563
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,719
I almost died on the treadmill.

564
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
Forget that,

565
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,359
my appetite has been unlocked.

566
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,319
As long as I have my mouth,

567
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,359
I'll use it for delicious food.

568
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
We should abide by the rules.

569
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,400
Don't make Mr. Xu upset again.

570
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,439
Let's go. Get some rest.

571
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,280
Why are you still here?

572
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,239
You...

573
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,079
Kiss me.
