1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,000
Wait.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,599
Are both of you firing me?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,679
The last time I was praised by my boss

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,000
was when I was fired.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,600
That's right.

6
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:11,560
Your work at Bay House ends now.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,119
Are you sure you are firing me?

8
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,039
Yes.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,439
Fine.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,680
A sudden termination

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,040
requires you to pay me
three months' worth of salary.

12
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,520
We will pay you six months' worth.

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,680
But you need to keep a secret

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,719
about everything you see here.

15
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,840
No problem.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,959
If you give me 12 months' worth,

17
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,040
I'll be extra secretive about it.

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,159
Jiang Kele!

19
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,000
Mr. Xu.

20
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,759
Do you need her to be extra secretive?

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,439
Jiang Kele.
Be content with what you have.

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,479
We will not spend money like this.

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,759
Fine.

24
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,159
Can I still come here

25
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,439
to visit the four of them?

26
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,759
We have

27
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,880
become close friends after all.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,759
We'll talk about it later.

29
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,360
Aren't you saying goodbye to them?

30
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,680
We'll talk about it later.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,440
This love triangle just ends like this.

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,120
When do you want it to end then?

33
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,490
=Love Crossed=

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,630
=Episode 25=

35
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,240
Hello. Is this your car?

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,199
You can't park here.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,399
Sorry. It's not mine.

38
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,559
There's an illegally parked car in front
of Xiang Hua Qiao Subway Station.

39
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,479
The driver is not here.
Requesting for a tow truck.

40
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,279
Su Lie! Why are your eyes swollen?

41
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,399
I drank too much water yesterday.

42
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,399
Then, I didn't have enough sleep.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,039
So, they are swollen.

44
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,360
Luo Ke!

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,360
Why are you wearing a black mask?

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,639
Because I ran out of white masks.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,679
Luo Ke.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
Isn't it disrespectful

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,839
to talk to Mr. Xu with a mask?

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,479
I can only remove it after 20 minutes.

51
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,600
Do you want to do it yourself

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,039
or do you want me to remove it for you?

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,679
Who did you fight with?

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Su Lie hit me.

55
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,839
He is so mean. He hit my face.

56
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,039
He wanted to apologize,

57
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,199
but I didn't accept.

58
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,119
That's why he cried.

59
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,119
Why were you fighting?

60
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,600
Because...

61
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,679
Because...

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,119
Mr. Xu. It's my fault.

63
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,720
I didn't take good care of them.

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,320
They argued when they were playing games

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
and ended up fighting each other.

66
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,279
You two were fighting,

67
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,600
but Su Lie wasn't injured at all.

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
I'll tell you the truth.

69
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,000
Both of them were playing games

70
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,399
and disturbed me in my sleep.

71
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,880
I beat Luo Ke up.

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes. That's right.

73
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,079
Forget it.

74
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,920
I don't want to know

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
who hit whom.

76
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:35,920
You have to cherish

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,640
the days of fighting together like this.

78
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,959
There won't be days like this again.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm here to tell all of you

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,799
the data collection has been complete.

81
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,600
Congratulations.

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
All of you will no longer
have to stay at Bay House anymore.

83
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,000
I've arranged four
individual accommodations for you.

84
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,760
One house for each of you.

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,679
You won't be seeing each other again.

86
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,519
Go back and pack your bags.

87
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,600
We will be moving today.

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Xu Nian. Come with me.

89
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,600
I've made my decision.

90
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,399
I'll stand together with you.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,799
Very good.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,399
You didn't choose to betray me

93
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,440
like your mother.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,760
You've made the correct and only choice.

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,679
What do I need to do next?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
I don't need you to do anything.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll arrange for you
to leave the country.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,079
You'll get a new identity

99
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,440
and live a new life.

100
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,839
When it's time,

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
you will come back
to Yao Inc.,

102
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,440
and take over from me.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
What about the three of them?

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,359
Son.

105
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,959
Don't be anxious.

106
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,600
When you've really taken over
the job from me,

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,640
you can choose

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,600
how to deal with them.

109
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,359
But before that,

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,760
in order to keep our secret,

111
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
I will confine them.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
There isn't a better choice?

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,519
This is already the best result.

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,399
(From Kele)
(How is it?)

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
(Xu Nian was summoned by Xu Guanghan.)

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,799
(I'm waiting for him. What about you?)

117
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,079
(I'm at the subway station.)

118
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,959
(I'm on my way to pick you up.)

119
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,399
(Qianya, it's terrible.
Your car is gone.)

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
(I know.)

121
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,679
(I just received a message
about disobeying the law.)

122
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,079
(The car has been towed away.)

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
(Find Mr. Cui)

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,880
(to prepare another car.
Wait for my message.)

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,640
Let's go.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,119
What did Xu Guanghan say to you?

127
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,720
We are out of time. Let's go.

128
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,279
Mr. Xu.

129
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,799
Look at this.

130
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,959
We were fooled.

131
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,279
They must have sneaked out before.

132
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,519
But how did they get out?

133
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,880
Hello.

134
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,920
Boss.

135
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,040
The last time I followed Guan Qianya,

136
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,959
she disappeared around
Xiang Hua Qiao Subway Station.

137
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,880
I found another
multi-purpose vehicle nearby.

138
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,040
I made an investigation just now.

139
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,320
This car is registered
under Guan Qianya's company.

140
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
Get some people to investigate it.

141
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,799
Got it.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,399
Go to Xiang Hua Qiao Subway Station.

143
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Okay.

144
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:56,880
Hurry up.

145
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Let's go!

146
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,679
Hurry up!

147
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,600
Where are we going?

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,640
Didn't Mr. Xu ask us to wait here?

149
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,160
Someone will pick us up later.

150
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
Xu Guanghan is lying to you.

151
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,959
He said we're moving

152
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,480
but we will actually
be confined separately.

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
It will be too late

154
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
if you don't leave now.

155
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,600
It's fine if I don't leave.

156
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,000
It's no big deal.

157
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,480
I don't want to leave anyway.

158
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,440
If you don't leave,

159
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,640
you'll be stuck here for life.

160
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,320
Why won't you listen?

161
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,239
Whatever.

162
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,320
You're not leaving?

163
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Are you leaving?

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
We'll leave.

165
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,239
Kele, where are we meeting them?

166
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,559
Xiang Hua Qiao Subway Station.

167
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,520
Xiang Hua Qiao Subway...

168
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,400
Come with me.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,239
Hurry up!

170
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,827
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

171
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,520
Boss.

172
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
Did you find anything?

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Not yet.

174
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,679
Boss.

175
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,679
I found a door in the tunnel.

176
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,440
Boss, it might be dangerous.

177
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,880
Let me lead the way.

178
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,320
Come back!

179
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,320
Why are you acting tough?

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,479
Have you seen too many movies?

181
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,559
How dangerous can a subway station be?

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,679
It must be a passage

183
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,359
they use to sneak out usually.

184
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll go.

185
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,440
Get someone to guard outside.

186
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,640
I don't want to go out.

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,559
There are too many women out there.
It's too scary.

188
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,479
Go.

189
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,679
Why did you force us to leave, Lu Xiao?

190
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,640
Stop talking.

191
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,479
Walk quickly.

192
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,599
Xu Nian, you disappoint me.

193
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,679
Mr. Xu.

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,599
I'm just making the right choice.

195
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,440
You betray your father

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
because of this woman?

197
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,119
Does a cold man like you
who seeks nothing but profits

198
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:38,960
fit to be my father?

199
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
So you have
been lying to me in the past.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm not lying to you.

201
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,719
I'm just trying to buy some time.

202
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,679
Xu Guanghan. You only have two choices.

203
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,719
Turn yourself in

204
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,159
or we'll report you.

205
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,719
You are still giving me two choices?

206
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,479
Let me tell you.

207
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,960
You only get one choice from me.

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
That is to die!

209
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,679
I don't want to die.

210
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,320
Mr. Xu.

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,479
We didn't want to come out.

212
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,599
They forced us to do so.

213
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,520
We will go back now.

214
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,280
Come back!

215
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,440
When you chose to leave
through this passage,

216
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,559
there's already no return for you.

217
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,119
Lu Xiao, what's wrong?

218
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,039
I remember you begged me
to let you go in the past.

219
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,679
What about now?

220
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,039
You are still not going to change?

221
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,440
Weren't you lying to us as well?

222
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,440
Did you rescue or buy Su Lie?

223
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Did you steal or pick up Luo Ke?

224
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,479
This is none of your business.

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,520
I only know

226
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,679
I adopted you

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
when you had nowhere to go.

228
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,960
Yet this is how you repay me?

229
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,159
It's been so many years.

230
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,760
We've done enough to repay you.

231
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,520
The contract has expired.

232
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,960
We have to leave today.

233
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,119
None of you can leave.

234
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,239
Be careful.

235
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm fine.

236
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
- Go!
- Let go!

237
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,039
Let's go!

238
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,000
Let go!

239
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,760
You think you can stop me?

240
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,760
Go!

241
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:24,799
Sorry.

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Endure it for a while.

243
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,559
Trying to escape?

244
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,119
Son.

245
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,960
You broke my heart.

246
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,239
You are the person I trusted most.

247
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Do you know?

248
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,520
I trusted you not because you are my son

249
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,479
but because I like you the most.

250
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,559
However, you've made a foolish choice.

251
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,400
But you are an adult.

252
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,280
I respect your choice

253
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,479
but you have to pay the price for it.

254
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,919
I know you are not afraid.

255
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,679
But I need to tell you.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,919
You've hurt everyone instead.

257
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,400
I didn't plan to hurt all of you.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,559
I was just trying to get a place

259
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,719
for you to live a worry-free life.

260
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,440
But all of you forced me!

261
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
Trying to escape?

262
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
Guan Qianya.

263
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
I thought you're just

264
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,679
a silly woman
who is addicted to the game.

265
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,799
I didn't expect you
to give me a surprise in the end.

266
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,960
The last hope for women
is going to be destroyed.

267
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,320
The last warrior for humans
will be sacrificed!

268
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,760
Fortunately,

269
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,400
Xu Nian will be with you.

270
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,119
Why are you looking at me in shock?

271
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,239
I used to think

272
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,000
the female lead
of this story is Jiang Kele.

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,320
This is a love triangle.

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,599
I didn't expect the story
to be so campy.

275
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,559
Your opponent is your son's lover.

276
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,880
I've asked you to stop
following this story.

277
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,840
It will never be a good ending.

278
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,479
That's not right.

279
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,880
Without Jiang Kele,

280
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
how can we just let it end?

281
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,060
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

282
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,799
Why haven't they come out yet?

283
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,960
Let me send them a message.

284
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,880
That's right.

285
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,073
(To Qianya)

286
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,440
(Qianya. We are here.)

287
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
(When are you coming out?)

288
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,599
(From Qianya)
(Kele, come in first.)

289
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,679
(We have a situation here.)

290
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,599
(We have to discuss
what we should do next.)

291
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,679
Hurry up, Kele!

292
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,640
I didn't expect you
to be the smartest person.

293
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,239
Isn't it unexpected?
You're quite stupid.

294
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,840
You will never have a chance

295
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,359
to say something crazy like this.

296
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,400
Excuse me.

297
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,039
Allow me to interrupt you.

298
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm just sending her here.

299
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,440
She's here.

300
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,760
I'll be leaving.

301
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,520
Wait.

302
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,719
Take the elevator.

303
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,239
There's an elevator?

304
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,559
Thank you.

305
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:41,960
Cui...

306
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,839
Mr. Cui! Mr. Cui!

307
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,119
Be careful.

308
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,199
How is it?

309
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,439
Xu Guanghan is so cunning.

310
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,040
He attacked me from behind in our first meeting.

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,959
How long have we passed out?

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,599
I don't' know.

313
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,640
Xu Guanghan took the clock away.

314
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,920
Let's split up to find the exit.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,599
I'll look at the elevator.

316
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,239
Su Lie, we'll go to the kitchen.

317
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,400
How's your neck?

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Is your hand all right?

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,920
It's fine.

320
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,160
How are you?

321
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,160
I'm doing fine.

322
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,119
The secret passage has been blocked.

323
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,319
Blocked?

324
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,839
There is no food in the fridge.

325
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,800
What?

326
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,199
The elevator can't be used.

327
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,800
He lied to me and told me to use it!

328
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,439
Xu Guanghan is trying to trap us here.

329
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,479
Why didn't I think of it?

330
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,119
We can call someone to help us!

331
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,280
Our phones have been confiscated.
We can't contact anyone.

332
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,319
Can you find yours?

333
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,640
It's really gone.

334
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,439
It's all your fault.

335
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,839
You had to force us to leave.

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,439
If we had listened to Mr. Xu,

337
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:19,959
we might

338
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,560
have already been at a safe place.

339
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,560
Isn't it nice

340
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,319
to live comfortably?

341
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,719
What do you mean it's our fault?

342
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,239
We haven't even blamed you two yet.

343
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,359
If it weren't for you
who went out of the bar,

344
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,880
we are already free out there.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,479
That is the freedom you want.

346
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,920
Not us.

347
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,319
We just want to stay here.

348
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,040
If you want to chase your love,

349
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
go on your own!

350
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,239
Why did you get us involved?

351
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,319
Both of you are still
going to listen to Xu Guanghan?

352
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,520
Don't you get it?

353
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,359
That big house

354
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,319
might just be a grave.

355
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,239
What's wrong with a grave?

356
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,920
We are also waiting for our death here.

357
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,040
I thought of a place.

358
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,160
We can give it a try.

359
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,119
Follow me.

360
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,839
Hurry up!

361
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,119
Be careful.

362
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,359
Careful.

363
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,640
Take this.

364
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,719
Wait for me.

365
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,079
Okay.

366
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,760
I'll see what's up there.

367
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
- Be careful.
- Careful.

368
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,839
You have to be careful!

369
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,359
Careful.

370
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,599
It's been so long.

371
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,280
Why hasn't Lu Xiao come back yet?

372
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,479
Did he find the exit

373
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,000
and abandon us here?

374
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,079
If he wanted to abandon you,

375
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,359
he would've done so long ago.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,319
If both of you are so heartless,

377
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,520
you can stay here

378
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,199
when Lu Xiao is back.

379
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,040
You want us to leave

380
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,239
but also want us to stay.

381
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,199
Why do you like to order us so much?

382
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,479
I don't care. Su Lie, let's go!

383
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,439
I'd advise you not to leave.

384
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,280
If Lu Xiao is on his way back,

385
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
both of you have to back off.

386
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,959
We'll just trample over him.

387
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:54,959
Both of you...

388
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,160
Stop it, both of you!

389
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,719
I found the exit!

390
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,079
I'll go first.

391
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,359
I'm going to have a look.

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,760
Over here.

393
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
What is this place?

394
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,959
The view is great.

395
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,800
Yes.

396
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,319
It's better
if we had found this exit earlier.

397
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,239
So that we won't be

398
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,719
captured in the passage.

399
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,079
Don't lower our guard.

400
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,119
There might be
Xu Guanghan's men around.

401
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
We shouldn't stay here for long.
Let's leave immediately.

402
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,560
Come with me.

403
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
Let's take a picture here.

404
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,880
But we don't have our phones.

405
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,880
Let's go.

406
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,920
Stop right there!
Don't let anyone get away!

407
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,920
Let's split up.

408
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,520
We meet at Qianya's house.
Don't be too bellicose.

409
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,560
- Okay.
- Where is her house?

410
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,359
Protect me! I know where her house is.

411
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,280
Let's go!

412
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,400
Let's go.

413
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:00,959
Okay.

414
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,119
Stop!

415
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,599
Go first. I'll distract them.

416
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
No. We fight together.

417
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,160
Let's go.

418
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,079
Let's go.

419
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,479
Why are there people
chasing after us every time we come out?

420
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,800
Luckily, it's not a woman this time.

421
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm not afraid. I'm getting brave too.

422
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,680
Why are you two running so fast?

423
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,400
We have been training
for more than ten years at Bay House.

424
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,239
If it wasn't for you,

425
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,160
we've already escaped.

426
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,119
Do you know where's Guan Qianya's...

427
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,520
Mr. Cui!

428
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,599
Run!

429
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,359
Stop!

430
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,839
Stop!

431
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:55,920
Luo Ke!

432
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,319
Run, Mr. Cui!

433
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,040
Where are you going?

434
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,359
Go!

435
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,880
Keep running.

436
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,800
Aren't you good at that?

437
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,800
Run.

438
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,640
Let's see where else you can go.

439
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,880
Mr. Xu, you are finally here.

440
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Be careful.

441
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,199
You're alone?

442
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,920
Yes.

443
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,359
Are you sure
you can fight all three of us?

444
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't think so.

445
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,199
Then, move!

446
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,400
This is my job. I can't.

447
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
You are right.

448
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,479
Beat him up!

449
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,160
Beat him! Kick him!

450
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,640
Step on him! Kick his stomach!

451
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,560
Beat him up!

452
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,040
Let's go.

453
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,719
Come on.

454
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,040
Bro, you're amazing.

455
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,479
I can see that you did your best.

456
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,800
Wait for me!

457
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,079
If you're...

458
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
If you're tired, you can take a break.

459
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,400
Lei Na!

460
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,119
Why did you come here in a bikini?

461
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,640
A lie only works once.

462
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,400
It won't work on me the second time.

463
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Lu Xiao.

464
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,719
It's the third time.

465
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,079
I'll give you two choices.

466
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,400
One, be electrocuted to death.

467
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,760
Two,

468
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,800
jump down on your own
and fall to your death.

469
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
Or, do you want to get electrocuted
and fall down to your death?

470
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,160
I'll choose the third choice.

471
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
Lu Xiao!

472
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:07,400
Lu Xiao.

473
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,959
Lu Xiao, how are you?

474
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,439
Don't scare me, Lu Xiao.

475
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,479
Lu Xiao.

476
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,119
Are you all right?

477
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,199
Kele, I'm fine.

478
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,040
Kele!

479
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,079
Let me hold him.

480
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,359
Be careful.

481
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,319
The car is here. Hurry up.

482
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,359
Get on.

483
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,439
- Come.
- Hurry up!

484
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,439
Get on.

485
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,280
Hurry up!

486
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,239
Faster!

487
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,000
Hurry up! Chase them!

488
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,479
Boss!

489
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,479
Lu Xiao.

490
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,760
I'm sorry.

491
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,800
It's my fault for running so slowly

492
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,560
so you got hurt.

493
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,479
You've been sleeping for so long.

494
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,439
Can you wake up to look at me?

495
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,959
Didn't you say you never sleep in?

496
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:04,920
Lu Xiao.

497
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,359
Don't bother hiding.

498
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,680
This is a private ward.

499
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,000
No one will see you here.

500
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,920
Granny?

501
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,560
What do you want?

502
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,040
It's all right. He is one of us.

503
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,640
Doctor, how is he now?

504
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
Why hasn't he woken up?

505
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,839
Is he ever going to wake up?

506
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:06,020
♪I'm sorry I admit♪
