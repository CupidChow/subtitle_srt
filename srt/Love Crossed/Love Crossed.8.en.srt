1
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,639
Why are you still here?

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,520
You...

3
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:22,879
Kiss me.

4
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:25,680
How dare you kiss me?

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,879
What?

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,200
Kele is still here.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,119
I asked whether you kissed me or not.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,119
You played dumb.

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,560
I almost fell for it.

10
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,759
I told you the truth.

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:37,959
You got the wrong person.

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,400
They kissed?

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,000
When?

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,479
Fine. I might have got the wrong person.

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,400
But this hat is the evidence.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,799
I have the proof. Admit it.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,040
I warned you.

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,439
Don't touch my stuff.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,000
You kissed me?

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,119
Kissed?

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,680
That's why Lu Xiao didn't turn Kele in.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,240
He even carried her around.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,840
Is Lu Xiao in love with Kele?

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,160
Get out of here.

25
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,400
No.

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,519
You chased me out

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,319
when you couldn't argue.

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
But I stayed every time.

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,199
I have permission from Mr. Xu.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,440
You don't get to decide.

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,480
You want to stay?

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,480
Fine, I'll go then.

33
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,800
Hold on!

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,360
Don't run away if you're a man!

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,599
I want you to make it clear.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Fine. You refuse to tell me.

37
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,080
Then I'll find out myself.

38
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,559
Lu Xiao!

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,919
Lu Xiao!

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,000
Lu Xiao!

41
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,630
=Love Crossed=

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,230
=Episode 8=

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Xu Guanghan is so mean.

44
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,399
He wouldn't let you eat,

45
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,520
then he asked you to run a marathon.

46
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,240
He is abusing you.

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,360
He punished us

48
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,800
because we let you stay.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,279
But I don't regret my decision.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,800
Make sure you bring
double snacks for me.

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,160
Lu Xiao is unconscious.

52
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,479
Stop thinking about food.

53
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,919
Should I ask Lei Na for help?

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,679
Never mind.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,639
He's a little low on blood sugar.

56
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,679
He'll be fine soon.

57
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,440
What was the medicine

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,279
you gave Lu Xiao?

59
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,880
It's not medicine. It's fruit candy.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
We want some too.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,039
We ran the marathon too.

62
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,800
We need to replenish some sugar.

63
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,479
You're not Lu Xiao. Neither are you!

64
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Why is he still unconscious?

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,919
Have another candy.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,520
Oh no! My head is spinning.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,240
I can't take it anymore.
I am passing out!

68
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,320
Fine, stop acting.

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
You can have the candy.

70
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,519
You should have one too.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,640
Forget it.

72
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,959
The fasting hour is almost over.
I'll pass.

73
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,519
Very well. Lu Xiao can have the rest.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Ms. Guan, dinner is ready.

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Thank you for the present.

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,959
I should thank you.

77
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,079
You invited me over for dinner.

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
You even prepared the dinner personally.

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,440
I must look after my daughter at home.

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
It's inconvenient to eat outside.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,559
I hope you wouldn't mind.

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,799
It's some home-cooked dishes.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Try it out.

84
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,399
(You're trying very hard)

85
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,920
(to look like a family man.)

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
You divested so decisively,

87
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,959
and didn't hesitate at all.

88
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,119
But now you invited me to dinner

89
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,119
and pretend as nothing had happened.

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,359
It's inadequate to change your mind

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
so suddenly.

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,399
You are now a symbol of

93
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,760
an independent female leader.

94
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,359
The tone of your speech
shows much confidence.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,440
Isn't that your reason

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,799
to reinvest in us?

97
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
That's one possibility.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,079
I'm an investor.

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,760
There are other factors
to take into account.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
As a businessman,

101
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,600
profit is my priority.

102
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,920
I divested

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,640
because your company's performance
was declining.

104
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,040
I decided to reinvest

105
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,040
because your company is showing
promising potential.

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,079
Fine, business aside,

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,559
I only want to know

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,320
your opinion on Love Boys.

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,559
As the Vice President,

110
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,519
do you agree with my stand?

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,079
I think Love Boys has

112
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,640
some merits to it.

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,760
Everything exists for a reason.

114
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,959
I believe you've heard this saying.

115
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,760
The soup is ready.
We'll discuss this over dinner.

116
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,359
Tongtong, dinner is ready.

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Come get your dinner.

118
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,480
Are you Guan Qianya?

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
Hello.

120
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I hate you!

121
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm not having dinner with you around.

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,000
Tongtong?

123
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,359
Tongtong!

124
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,239
My apology, Ms. Guan.

125
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,559
My daughter is Love Boy's fan.

126
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,079
It's not the Love Boys!

127
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,519
It's Xu Nian! Only Xu Nian.

128
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,519
Fine, it's Xu Nian.

129
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,839
This girl is a little rude.

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,839
But I would rather see her

131
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
be rude than silent.

132
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
After the accident,

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
she lost her mother.

134
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,279
Her legs became crippled.

135
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,440
After that,

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,440
she shut herself out from the world.

137
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,160
I was busy with my business.

138
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,559
I didn't have time to look after her.

139
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,040
She refused to go to school.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,760
So she didn't have any friends

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,600
or people to talk to.

142
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,559
And then she started to play

143
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
the game Love Boys.

144
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,200
She's been playing this game

145
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,480
for about a year.

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
She became much more cheerful.

147
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,239
She even had some mood swings.

148
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
I think that's a good sign.

149
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,640
She's a teenager.

150
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,200
So she should act like one.

151
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,160
They fasted for 12 hours,

152
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,279
and ran a full marathon.

153
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,440
But Lu Xiao still refused to explain

154
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
why he helped hide Jiang Kele.

155
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,760
What else could it be?

156
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,440
He's terrified after
being punished.

157
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,880
The contract makes it clear.

158
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,519
Before your mission is complete,

159
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,000
you're not allowed to leave Bay House!

160
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Yet you sneaked out.

161
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,679
Bro, what happened?

162
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,320
How should I know?

163
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,799
Check the power source.

164
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,479
Sure.

165
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,479
Hey! Stop right there!

166
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,159
Stop!

167
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,799
Inform Mr. Xu now! Catch him!

168
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,440
Stop!

169
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,760
Stop running!

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,679
Inform Mr. Xu now! Catch him!

171
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,640
Stop!

172
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,440
So?

173
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,679
Do you find the outside world fun?

174
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,719
No.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,400
Did you think

176
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,119
I would be merciful to you,

177
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,760
that I wouldn't punish you?

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

179
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,479
I won't do it again.

180
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,479
There is no reason

181
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,479
for anyone to be forgiven

182
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,880
simply because it's the first time!

183
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,440
If the outside world is fun,

184
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,679
I have something even better for you.

185
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,719
Well?

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,719
As I recall, you are afraid of water.

187
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,919
Mr. Xu!

188
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,640
I won't do it again!

189
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,159
You have my word!

190
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,320
If you ever run away again,

191
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,000
you'll never leave the water.

192
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,719
Project Y is at its final stage.

193
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,039
We can't afford to make any mistakes.

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,520
Just like this tower.

195
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,760
Your analogy is very on point.

196
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,919
A single loose brick

197
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,960
can bring down the whole tower.

198
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,039
You're a fast learner.

199
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm a little dizzy.

200
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,159
Kele! Kele!

201
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,599
What's wrong, Kele?

202
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,479
Kele, wake up! Kele!

203
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,960
Kele! Kele!

204
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,559
How can you be so dense?

205
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,599
Can't you tell I'm low on blood sugar?

206
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,840
I'm fainting. I need some candies.

207
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,679
Come, let me help you up.

208
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,760
Close your eyes.

209
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,719
Three, two, one.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,799
What kind of candy would you like?

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,039
I don't mind,

212
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,599
as long as you feed me.

213
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,880
Another one.

214
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,919
I haven't swallowed it!

215
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,000
Fine. I've had enough.
Such a buzzkill.

216
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,200
You're so childish.

217
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,640
This isn't it.

218
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,679
Kele.

219
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,080
Are you not in a good mood today?

220
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,280
I...

221
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,280
It's not that.

222
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,840
I met someone recently.

223
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,000
He shares a lot of resemblance with you.

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,679
But you're nothing alike either.

225
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,520
He's a real person.

226
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,440
Are you leaving me?

227
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,679
No way.

228
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,359
I would never abandon

229
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,880
my beloved Lu Xiao.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,719
Kele.

231
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,080
I know you don't want me to be upset.

232
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
But it's all right.

233
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,159
As long as you're happy,

234
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,719
I can stay by your side

235
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,799
as anyone.

236
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,719
Your happiness

237
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,479
is what matters the most in this world.

238
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,679
The night view from your room
is beautiful.

239
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,719
Of course.

240
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,640
I have spent over 20 years

241
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,039
to inherit it.

242
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,960
You seem to be in a good mood.

243
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,280
You don't need me anymore.

244
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,320
I have a question for you.

245
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,520
As a virtual character,

246
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,599
what is your purpose of existence?

247
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,159
That's a profound question.

248
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,559
You can't answer me?

249
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,520
Right.

250
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Your codes

251
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,039
should prevent you from answering
this kind of question.

252
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,440
Inside a computer,

253
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,080
my existence might be meaningless.

254
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,359
But now,

255
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,239
I'm admiring the night view
in your room,

256
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm talking to you,

257
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,400
I even cured your insomnia.

258
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,799
Are all of these

259
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,400
not meaningful?

260
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,599
Do not dwell on
the purpose in existence.

261
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
I like a saying.

262
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,679
"I'll eat when I get hungry."

263
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,919
"I'll get some rest when I'm tired."

264
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,119
"When I have a plan in mind,

265
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,640
I take a leap of faith."

266
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,239
So...

267
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,280
If you ever miss me,

268
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
come see me.

269
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:19,159
The virtual Xu Nian has its purpose.

270
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,159
What about me?

271
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,070
(Existence And Void)

272
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,390
(Y4,
the terminator of mankind's future.)

273
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,020
(The terminator of mankind's future.)

274
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,320
(I wrote these.)

275
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,079
Over the past three years,

276
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,520
(We must stand up for Guan Qianya!)
They used the system born from

277
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
the calculations and codes of Big Data

278
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,959
and the characters
created by that system

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
to blind your eyes and souls!

280
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,439
Yes!

281
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,839
We support Guan Qianya!

282
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,359
We support Guan Qianya!

283
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,719
We must stand up for Guan Qianya!

284
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:26,239
Guan Qianya is fearless!

285
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,839
(Block 6 Unit 1)
Guan Qianya will teach them a lesson!

286
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,079
Support Guan Qianya!

287
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,760
Support Guan Qianya!

288
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,680
Ms. Guan!

289
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,199
Support Guan Qianya!

290
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,920
Support Guan Qianya!

291
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
Come on, make some room.

292
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,479
Stand aside!

293
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:39,959
Support Guan Qianya!

294
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,239
Make way!

295
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:41,680
Support Guan Qianya!

296
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,199
Support Guan Qianya!

297
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:43,760
Ms. Guan.

298
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,719
I prepared a small ceremony for you.

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,680
(Love Boys)
Support Guan Qianya!

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,160
Support Guan Qianya!

301
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,800
We must stand up for Guan Qianya!

302
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,800
Tear it down!

303
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,000
Ms. Guan, it's just a poster.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Tear it.

305
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,239
People are watching you.

306
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,520
Tear it apart!

307
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Support Guan Qianya!

308
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
Support Guan Qianya!

309
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
This is great!

310
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,777
(Lotion, Cream, Essence)

311
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,920
Don't bother hiding yourself.

312
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,959
This is a small place.

313
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,079
There's nowhere to hide.

314
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,160
Granny!

315
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,280
Your nails look fabulous.

316
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,719
When did you come here?

317
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,079
Your acting won't work on me.

318
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,760
Stop playing the fool just because

319
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,239
you look like one.

320
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,359
I did it out of kindness

321
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,680
to help a poor young lady

322
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,839
make a fortune in life.

323
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,000
But in the end,

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,760
she said I was a profiteer!

325
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,359
Granny, hear me out.

326
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,880
Stay away from me. I'm not your granny.

327
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,760
Granny, sorry!

328
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,079
I panicked,

329
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,199
so I told them about you.

330
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,640
I know calling you a profiteer is mean,

331
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,239
but I was telling the truth.

332
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
No. I am securing a stream of revenue
with legal means.

333
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,959
Do not compare me with an ignorant

334
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,280
like yourself.

335
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,079
Tell me.

336
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,079
I heard that you were
getting along very well

337
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,199
with the four boys.

338
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,479
How did you manage to do it?

339
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Well...

340
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Well?

341
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,079
We...

342
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,280
What do we have here?

343
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,680
Look at the money in here.

344
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,199
This should be enough for a payday.

345
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,800
How should I spend the money?

346
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,640
Granny!

347
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,640
We got along,

348
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,239
literally.

349
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,680
The moment

350
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,319
I met them,

351
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,760
they shoulder-threw me to the ground.

352
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,920
They even chased me out.

353
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Then they hid me inside a carpet.

354
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,400
Granny.

355
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,119
Are you here to find justice for me?

356
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,359
I won't pity you.

357
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,400
Tell me.

358
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,719
When you saw Lu Xiao,
the man you love so much,

359
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,760
appeared right in front of you
as a real person,

360
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,199
were you happy to see him?

361
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,680
How did you feel?

362
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,959
If he were anything like the virtual
Lu Xiao and be nice to me,

363
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,680
I would be overjoyed.

364
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,959
When you found out the boys

365
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,000
were locked up in there,

366
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,199
what did that make you feel?

367
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,280
I felt

368
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,280
jealous of them.

369
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,239
I could only dream

370
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,760
of having their life.

371
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,760
I regret ever finding

372
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,400
a lazy girl like you to replace me.

373
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,280
No, there's more.

374
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,359
They never had any decent food.

375
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,319
That wasn't right.

376
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
Granny, you are here.

377
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,119
Qiqi!

378
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,319
How is your leg?

379
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,719
You should sit down.

380
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,640
I'll get you a chair.

381
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Sure.

382
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
Never mind, she and...

383
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,520
Granny, she...

384
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,000
I will show up
and work in that house tomorrow.

385
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
You have my word.

386
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,560
I'll hold you to it.

387
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,199
Granny! Are you leaving already?

388
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,560
It's all right. Get back to work.

389
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,560
Ms. Guan! Ms. Guan!

390
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,719
Look!

391
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,439
With Qi Chuan's promotion,

392
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,359
you're one of the top searches again!

393
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,400
Your bundle partnership with Qi Chuan

394
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,640
is a huge success.

395
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,400
It only cost one yuan!
It was a no-brainer!

396
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,359
How much would it cost to
remove me from the top searches?

397
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,800
What do you mean?

398
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,560
Nothing.

399
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,359
There's one more thing.

400
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,680
The Showbiz Star

401
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,479
has invited you to a debate.

402
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,839
The whole thing will be live-streamed.

403
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you know who the main guests are?

404
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,839
Your opponent, Xu Guanghan, and you!

405
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,119
We have public opinion to our advantage.

406
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,880
Why would Xu Guanghan even attend?

407
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
But he already accepted the invitation.

408
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,959
He even went as far as to say

409
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:37,839
that no one in this world

410
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,400
has the guts to face him

411
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
in a real debate.

412
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,760
I don't want to participate.

413
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,199
Why?

414
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,520
We should use this momentum

415
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,680
to land the finishing blow.

416
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,800
Mr. Cui.

417
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,199
Do you remember

418
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:52,199
why we set out for this war?

419
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,000
Because of Love Boys,

420
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,599
our performance was declining.

421
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,359
We had to retaliate.

422
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,839
But as of now,

423
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,439
our performance is improving.

424
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,400
We have achieved our goal.

425
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,680
There is no need

426
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,079
to waste more time and effort on this.

427
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
But Ms. Guan...

428
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:08,920
We...

429
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,800
Mr. Cui.

430
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,560
Do you know what this is?

431
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,239
A flower.

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,359
It's Stargazer lily.

433
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,959
It symbolizes victory and glory.

434
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,680
We've got what we wanted.

435
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,439
Anything unrelated to victory

436
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,079
should be set aside.

437
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:27,680
Very well.

438
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
Get rid of the trash.

439
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

440
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:49,191
(Yao Inc.)

441
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm here again.

442
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,599
I'm the one who saved Lu Xiao.

443
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,800
He should show me more passion.

444
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,959
He can't hide the hat

445
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,760
and pretend nothing had happened.

446
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,640
Men are childish.

447
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,359
During this hour every day,

448
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,839
I wonder if Jiang Kele would show up.

449
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,520
However,

450
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,520
the person who wants to see her the most

451
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,800
isn't me.

452
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:57,680
Lu Xiao.

453
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
When did you kiss her?

454
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,839
Was is terrifying

455
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,520
to kiss a girl?

456
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,680
You'll never know

457
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
how it's like to kiss a girl.

458
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,839
But you can have a taste of my punch.

459
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,560
I...

460
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm getting changed.

461
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,719
Let's go.

462
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Mr. Xu.

463
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,800
What? Why do you look so nervous?

464
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,000
That silly girl Jiang Kele

465
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,199
isn't as silly as we think.

466
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,239
What do you mean?

467
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,599
She is Guan Qianya's close friend.

468
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,079
How did you find out?

469
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,439
Lisa told me this.

470
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
They are close like sisters.

471
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,479
They even live under the same roof.

472
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,719
Jiang Kele isn't here.

473
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,359
This is such a letdown.

474
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,239
Are you expecting her

475
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,079
or the food she brings?

476
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,800
I can't be sure.

477
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,479
Is she inside Lu Xiao's room again?

478
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,359
Why do you care?

479
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,839
Mind your own business from now on.

480
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,000
Surprise!

481
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,680
It's over 4 p.m.

482
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,680
You should leave.

483
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,839
I'll leave after I test it.

484
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,199
What test?

485
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,239
What do you want?

486
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,439
Jiang Kele! What are you doing?

487
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,880
Leave this place now!

488
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:35,359
Leave!

489
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:35,680
Go!

490
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
Why are you arresting me?

491
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:36,839
Go!

492
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,160
Go!

493
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,760
It's you!

494
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,800
Why did you arrest me this time?

495
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,119
This is ridiculous.

496
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,359
Jiang Kele.

497
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,640
Do you not realize how serious this is?

498
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
What's wrong?

499
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm getting punished
for working overtime?

500
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,199
Do you know what this is?

501
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,000
Are you giving me an injection?

502
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,319
A cosmetic injection?

503
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,199
There is 0.5 gram of Kardi chloride.

504
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,199
It took the scientist 20 years
to develop one gram of it.

505
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
A tiny drop of this

506
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,719
is enough to end your life
without a trace.

507
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,280
Unless you tell us the truth...

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,880
It's dripping!

509
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,800
I'll get another one.

510
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,280
What is your relation with Guan Qianya.

511
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,239
I've known her since I was little.

512
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,920
We were classmates in
elementary and middle schools.

513
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,760
In college...

514
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,959
I didn't go to college.

515
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,560
But we are still close friends.

516
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,680
We live together.

517
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,599
Do you know who she is to me?

518

Did you tell her

520
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,880
anything from your work?

521
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,599
No.

about Bay House?

I didn't tell her!

525
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,520
