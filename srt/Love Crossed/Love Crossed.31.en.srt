00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Hello, kids.

2
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,440
Granny?

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,159
By the time you see this,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
I may no longer be by your side.

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,680
But

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,319
I'll probably be really happy,

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:28,159
because

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,200
if you can see this,

9
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,479
it means that

10
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,400
all of you
have gotten out of Bay House safely.

11
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,720
I believe

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,040
you still couldn't stop Xu Guanghan,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,000
because he's too intelligent.

14
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,040
Indeed, it's not that easy

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,319
if you want to succeed.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,200
But don't be discouraged.

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,880
Because I am

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,200
far more cunning than he is.

19
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,560
Don't worry.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,919
I've prepared

21
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,400
one final trump card for you.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
This thing is good enough

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,880
to prove

24
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,599
all of Xu Guanghan's
criminal behaviours.

25
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,519
I hope you'll soon be able
to get your hands on it.

26
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,760
All the best.

27
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,680
Love you all.

28
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,279
We love you too.

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,839
But what's that evidence?

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,800
She didn't tell us.

31
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,360
Could she have forgotten that part?

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,800
I know it.

33
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,959
The evidence is love.

34
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,160
As long as there's love,

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,639
we can defeat anything.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
It's impossible.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,639
She wouldn't joke about it
at such a critical time.

38
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,319
That's right.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Let's look for it.

40
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,720
It should be in here.

41
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,790
=Love Crossed=

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,930
=Episode 31=

43
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,279
Why there are all numbers?

44
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,440
Could these numbers

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,479
be the evidence?

46
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,479
8171.

47
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,199
I think it may be something's passcode.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,520
But what do the first two series
of numbers mean?

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
Let me take a look.

50
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,440
I know it.

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,080
These are coordinates.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,520
My dad is a sailor.

53
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,759
Every time I call him

54
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,720
and ask him where he is,

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,119
he'll send me the coordinates.

56
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,679
That way,

57
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,160
I can locate him on the map.

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
The above one is the longitude,

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
and the middle one is the latitude.

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,839
So all we have to do

61
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,639
is to search it online.

62
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,930
(Future Library)

63
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,679
That's it. The Future Library.

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,360
The Future Library?

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,327
(Future Library)

66
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,880
Well, what about

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,399
8171?

68
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
There are many lockers in the library.

69
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,360
Could it be the passcode for the locker?

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,039
It may also be the number
of a certain kind of book.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,399
Why don't we set out to look for it now?

72
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,160
No.

73
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,479
It's late now.

74
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,559
It will be dark

75
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,600
by the time we get to the library.

76
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,520
How about this?

77
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,639
We're all tired already.

78
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,759
Let's crash here tonight.

79
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,679
We'll go there tomorrow.

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Ms. Guan,
I've checked the house earlier.

81
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,839
There are four rooms.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,479
Let's allocate the rooms.

83
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll be with Kele.

84
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,360
Okay.

85
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,679
I'll be with Su Lie.

86
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, I'll share the room with Xu Nian.

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,479
Well, I'll sleep alone.

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,479
Awesome.

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,480
Come on.

90
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,279
Let's go inside.

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
This will be your new home.

92
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,279
Your bedroom is all cleaned up.

93
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,480
Want to take a look?

94
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,160
Feeling hungry?

95
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,959
I'll make you something to eat.
What would you like?

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Aunt, can I ask you a question?

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Of course.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,880
What is it?

99
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,359
Why did my parents

100
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,920
betray me?

101
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,720
Where did you learn the word "betray"?

102
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,399
They left me.

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
That's betrayal.

104
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,079
The adult world

105
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,359
is very complicated.

106
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,320
They have their own reasons.

107
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,920
These are all excuses.

108
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,000
Perhaps, they didn't want
to betray you.

109
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,399
They just betrayed each other.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,320
Aunt, will you betray me?

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,239
I'll always be with you.

112
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Mr. Xu, don't worry.

113
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,480
She is tough.

114
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,079
With my treatment,

115
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,600
she'll wake up soon.

116
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,760
You wanted to have things your way.

117
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,440
I'm sure you're well aware

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
what your ending will be.

119
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,160
Pull in the reins now.

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,799
It's not too late.

121
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:56,959
Aunt.

122
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,040
I haven't fulfilled my dream.

123
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,000
Stay out of it.

124
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,440
If she wakes up,

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,000
do you have a way
to wipe out her memory?

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,679
Not at the moment.

127
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,399
Keep her asleep then.

128
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,679
Stop pretending.

129
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,559
Qianya, can't sleep again?

130
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,880
You? Can't sleep as well?

131
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,279
No.

132
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,399
I have something to say to you.

133
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,440
You want to talk

134
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,520
about the thing that

135
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,039
you went to see Xu Guanghan in the game?

136
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,359
You have already apologised to me.

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
But still, I want to say it in person.

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Although it was in the game,

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I made the choice

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
out of my own will.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,719
I don't want to
be led astray by Lei Na again

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,640
to do things that will hurt you
in the name of love.

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,119
If we weren't in the game,

144
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
I would have lost you already.

145
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,400
Qianya, I promise you.

146
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,479
No matter what methods Xu Guanghan

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
and Lei Na use,

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,479
I will stand firmly

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,559
by your side.

150
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,840
I was wrong too.

151
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,239
Although we were in the game,

152
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,679
I shouldn't have tried
to put up a tough front

153
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,479
to hide my weakness and helplessness.

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,359
Since we love each other,

155
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,679
we should have faith and be honest.

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,239
Only then can we overcome
all the difficulties together.

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,599
Mr. Xu.

174
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,280
You came early today.

175
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Did you get me something?

176
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,320
Yes, we managed to find their car.

177
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Car?

178
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,400
Where are they?

179
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,960
They escaped, didn't they?

180
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,440
Why are you here then?

181
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,919
Go and find them.

182
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,239
We've searched every place.

183
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,919
We've searched Guan Qianya's house
and office,

184
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,760
as well as Fushun
and Cui Hengzhi's house.

185
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,919
But there's no sight of them.

186
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,200
It's like they have vanished.

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
Those seven people are well and alive.

188
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,559
How would they possibly vanish?

189
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,080
They must be in hiding now

190
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,359
knowing that we're hot on their trails.

191
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,359
It's a huge city.
How are we going to find them?

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
Since my aunt

193
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,479
got them out of Bay House,

194
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,479
she must have known

195
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,840
that they'd have nowhere else to go.

196
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,760
She must have found them a hiding place.

197
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,400
Call Lei Na.

198
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,799
Ask her to sort out my aunt's data
and bring it to me.

199
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:43,960
Okay.

200
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,200
Why are you up so early?

201
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,840
The sunshine on the face
in the morning

202
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,320
actually feels so good.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
That's not all.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,159
There's also the chirping of birds.

205
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,960
It feels much better
than in the Bay House.

206
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,440
It's even better

207
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,280
than the five-star hotel in the game.

208
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
It smells so good.

209
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,159
There's food.

210
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,799
Let's go.

211
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,200
Here, Kele.

212
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,479
That's a lot.

213
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
Eat up. It's for you.

214
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,239
Come on, guys.

215
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,039
You didn't ask us along
with so much good food.

216
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,559
Let's eat.

217
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,960
Jiang Kele.

218
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,440
The breakfast you made is so good.

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
I didn't prepare this.

220
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
It was Mr. Cui.

221
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,679
Second best.

222
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,520
Su Lie said

223
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,359
the breakfast you made is second best.

224
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, may I ask

225
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,640
who's the best?

226
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,919
Jiang Kele.

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,679
You dare to speak
in front of the girls now?

228
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,760
What's done is done. Don't be afraid.

229
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,159
Su Lie.

230
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,599
Try saying another word.

231
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,239
Say something.

232
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,159
Cut him some slack.

233
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,919
He needs time to adapt himself.

234
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,159
This is bad.

235
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,559
Grandma Fushun got hurt.

236
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,719
I just saw the news of Yao Inc.

237
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,960
that their janitor

238
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,359
was attacked by four impostors

239
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,679
(Y4 Impostors Involved in Assault)
and is still in a coma.

240
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,679
This... Xu Guanghan is too much.

241
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,479
He wouldn't even spare his own aunt.

242
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,200
Look, we have to rescue Grandma Fushun.

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Wait.

244
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
This doesn't look like the hospital.

245
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
Where are they hiding her?

246
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,760
Let me see.

247
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,320
This should be Xu Guanghan's house.

248
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,719
I've been there in the game.

249
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
How about this?

250
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,679
Help us get into his house,

251
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,080
and we'll rescue Grandma Fushun.

252
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,159
No, we can't go together.

253
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,919
We've got too many people here.

254
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,520
If the plan fails, we'll all be caught.

255
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,679
What do we do then?

256
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,840
How about this? You go to the library

257
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,919
with Lu Xiao to look for the evidence.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll come to rescue Grandma Fushun.

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,880
I'll go with you.

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,080
We can look out for each other.

261
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,320
I'll prepare
some communication equipments

262
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,359
and some self-defence tools.

263
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
If we run into
the security guards again,

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,599
we can't fight with our bare hands.

265
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
But how are you going to pay for it?

266
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,679
Grandma Fushun left some cash
in the house.

267
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,400
Who should we go with?

268
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,320
You two can stay.

269
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,919
Stay alert.

270
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,039
Accroding to the movement data
and the positioning system,

271
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,479
Fushun's activities in the past years

272
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,799
are all here.

273
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,799
The places that she visited the most
are Bay House

274
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
and the surrounding area of Yao Inc.,

275
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,400
followed by her house.

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,280
Besides these places,

277
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,400
there's one more place.

278
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,000
This place is in a suburb.

279
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,359
It's neither a property
under Fushun's name,

280
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,039
nor it has anything to do with Yao Inc.,

281
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,520
but the data shows

282
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,679
that she visited this area a lot.

283
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,799
Inform Zhang Yang.

284
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,919
Yes.

285
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,180
(Dongpo Interchange)

286
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,380
(Moon Bay Station, Entrance 6)

287
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,359
Xu Guanghan's men are monitoring
the people coming in and out.

288
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,520
If we go on like this,

289
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,679
they'll discover us.

290
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,079
Let's think of another way.

291
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,319
This is it.

292
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,400
It's such a big library.

293
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,239
It's going

294
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,640
to take us all day.

295
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
Let's check the lockers first

296
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,119
and see if we can find the numbers.

297
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,160
Okay. Let's go.

298
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,199
Which floor are you going to?

299
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,680
The 15th floor.

300
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,000
You may go.

301
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,439
Hold on.

302
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,599
Why don't I help you?

303
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,760
Do your work.

304
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,280
Thank you.

305
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,839
Hi, may I know where the lockers are?

306
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,479
The lockers are in the left area
of the right.

307
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,400
Thank you.

308
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,319
Thank you.

309
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
Who is it?

310
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,119
Delivery.

311
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,800
Leave it at the door.

312
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,959
I need your signature.

313
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,719
What delivery is this?

314
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,000
The wheelchair that Mr. Xu ordered.

315
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,760
Why would Mr. Xu order this?

316
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:55,959
They tricked us.

317
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,119
Let's go.

318
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,160
Come on.

319
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,119
Search this place!

320
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,719
Okay!

321
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,160
Let's go.

322
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,760
Hurry.

323
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,520
Check over there.

324
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,119
Here. This way.

325
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,479
Why does it feel so boring?

326
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,359
That's right.

327
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,319
Back in the Bay House,

328
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,359
we were singing and dancing.

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,319
And now?

330
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,359
I miss my game console.

331
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,599
Since Grandma Fushun

332
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,959
left so much money to us,

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,439
let's buy a game console.

334
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,319
Let's go.

335
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,280
Come on.

336
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,180
(Fifth Element)

337
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,280
Come with me!

338
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,719
Xu Guanghan's men are here!

339
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,199
Let's go.

340
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,280
Over there! After them! Hurry!

341
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,079
They're over there!

342
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,880
After them!

343
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,959
Ms. Guan, they found us!

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,839
You go first.

345
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,079
Be careful.

346
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,160
Mr. Cui.

347
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,760
Don't come over!

348
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,119
Go now.

349
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,239
Be safe.

350
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,599
It all starts with the number 8.

351
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,359
There's hope.

352
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,439
Okay, let's find it.

353
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,319
819...

354
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,199
No, we can't find 8171.

355
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,119
No?

356
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,040
It's all right.

357
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,479
There are more lockers upstairs.
Let's keep looking.

358
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,280
Okay.

359
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
So? Can you find it?

360
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
There's no 8171.

361
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
So it's not a locker.

362
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,319
Let's try looking for the book.

363
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,199
This way.

364
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:13,880
Slow down.

365
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,000
Those two.

366
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Slow down.

367
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,119
Mr. Cui, how are you?

368
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,079
Did you hurt your leg?

369
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,280
- Easy.
- Be careful.

370
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,839
It's fine. Don't bother about me.

371
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,839
Where's Xu Nian?

372
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,359
He's helping to draw those men away.

373
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,640
Should we go and find him?

374
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,479
If we go, we're walking
right into their trap.

375
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,839
Right.

376
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,560
I thought you went
to find Grandma Fushun.

377
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,400
Did you find her?

378
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,599
It was a trap of Xu Guanghan.

379
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
Xu Nian and I almost got caught.

380
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,760
What do we do now?

381
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,680
Kele and Lu Xiao
are probably at the library now.

382
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,239
I think Xu Nian will meet up with them.

383
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,199
What are we waiting for?

384
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,520
Let's go to the library now.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,479
Mr. Cui.

386
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:47,040
Be careful.

387
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,000
Your leg is injured.

388
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,959
It's inconvenient to move around.

389
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,680
Look, find a safe place

390
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
and hide there.

391
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
I'll meet up with them.

392
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,280
Here.

393
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,160
Easy.

394
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,760
I've saved the contact numbers
in the phones.

395
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Take it.

396
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
When you get to a safe place,

397
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
remember to keep in touch with me.

398
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,920
Don't go separated.

399
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,959
You hear me?

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

401
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,199
Go. Hurry.

402
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:10,920
Okay.

403
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,560
Be safe.

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,040
Be careful, Ms. Guan.

405
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,680
Okay.

406
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,640
Be careful.

407
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,359
8171.

408
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,680
Found it!

409
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,500
(Secret)

410
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,319
8171.

411
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
Just like Xu Nian said,

412
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,160
the evidence is in a book.

413
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,079
"Secret."

414
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,599
Just the title of the book

415
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,800
tells me there's evidence in it.

416
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,719
It's just an ordinary book.

417
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,079
There's no evidence in it.

418
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,400
Perhaps,
it's in the content of the book.

419
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,640
Let's bring it back and read it.

420
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Can we?

421
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,160
We could borrow it from the librarians.

422
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,119
Come on. Hurry.

423
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,520
Boss.

424
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:48,959
What's wrong?

425
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,319
Where are they?

426
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:49,880
Go now.

427
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,280
We lost them.

428
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
What should I say?

429
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,640
There are so many of you,
and you can't get a single person.

430
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,280
How am I going to answer to Mr. Xu?

431
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,199
Why are you still standing there?

432
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,640
Go and search over there.

433
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,719
Let's go.

434
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,119
Let's go.

435
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,560
Over there!

436
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,040
Run!

437
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,479
Can't you see?

438
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,319
After them!

439
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,119
Hurry!

440
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,119
Over there!

441
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,719
Hurry!

442
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
There's only one copy of the book

443
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,040
with the corresponding number
you told me.

444
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,839
But a guy and a lady just borrowed it.

445
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,839
Thank you.

446
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,660
(Mr. Cui)

447
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:31,760
Hello?

448
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,439
Ms. Guan, don't worry.

449
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,880
I have found a place for them.

450
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,680
Okay, how's your leg?

451
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,439
It's no big deal.

452
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,520
It has been taken care of.

453
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,599
How are you?

454
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,599
Did you find Kele and Lu Xiao?

455
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,520
They've found the evidence

456
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,439
and gone back.

457
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,359
They're back?

458
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,920
Won't Xu Guanghan's men find them?

459
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
No.

460
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,079
It has caused an uproar
at the log cabin.

461
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,239
Xu Guanghan's men
will keep watching the place.

462
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,800
When Lu Xiao and Kele get there,

463
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
they won't walk back in.

464
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,959
If they realize that the log cabin
was exposed

465
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,920
and that we have escaped,

466
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,760
they'll get out of there
and meet up with us.

467
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,680
I'll wait for them at the library.

468
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,599
All right then.

469
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,040
Be safe.

470
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,359
Keep in touch.

471
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
Mr. Cui, how is it?

472
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,400
Xinyi.

473
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Let me introduce. This is Li Xinyi.

474
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Don't be afraid.

475
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,280
She's my ex-wife.

476
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,119
Luo Ke.

477
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,920
Su Lie.

478
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,239
Why would you
be with these two impostors?

479
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,719
They are not impostors.

480
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,760
Xinyi, take a seat.

481
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,920
I'll tell you everything.

482
00:26:58,959 --> 00:26:59,319
Over there!

483
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,040
Hurry!

484
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,359
Hurry!

485
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,880
Stop!

486
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
(Fenghe Road)

487
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,700
(Fifth Element)

488
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,640
Mr. Xu.

489
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,319
So my aunt has been making preparations
for so many years.

490
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,760
Even Jiang Kele was placed
in Bay House by her.

491
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,260
(Crush On Love, Xinle Orphanage, Dean,
Best friend, Jiang Kele)

492
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,800
Do you have coins?

493
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,040
No.

494
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Do you have coins?

495
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,640
No.

496
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Look for it!

497
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,439
Go and look for it!

498
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,319
Does anyone have coins?

499
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,479
Hurry!

500
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,079
Mr. Xu.

501
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,079
Only a ten-cent coin.

502
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,280
Kele, my dear.

503
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,079
