1
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:04,800
Qianya.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,239
Qianya!

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,479
Qianya, why did you ignore me just now?

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,040
You're back?

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,079
What are you hiding?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Nothing.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Give it to me.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,719
A love letter?

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,479
What's it? There's even a map.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,319
Turn left.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,959
Go straight.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Turn right.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,560
You're not going to meet Xu Nian,
are you?

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,880
Of course not.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,479
How could I meet Xu Nian?

16
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,119
I'm just going to go for a ride
to unwind.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,319
Even to the subway station?

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,799
Don't lie to me!

19
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,599
I know how you feel now.

20
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,159
You are wondering

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
if the Xu Nian you met in the game

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,400
is the one you met in real world?

23
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,360
Let me tell you right now.

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,119
He's not!

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,599
Lu Xiao isn't.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
It doesn't mean that Xu Nian isn't too.

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,080
Guan Qianya! Be sober.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
You're more addicted to the game
than me.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,319
I'm not addicted to the game.

30
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,160
He cured my insomnia.

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,800
I just want to make sure

32
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:16,919
if that person is him.

33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,279
But it's dangerous there.

34
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:19,591
I know.

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,040
But now,

36
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:22,239
I'm scolded by everyone.

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,519
The company went bankrupt.

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,160
It made me emotionally crippled.
You know, right?

39
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,440
I know.

40
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,080
But I don't want you to get hurt.

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,919
All right then,
I won't persuade you again.

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,839
In that case,

43
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,400
leave it to me then.

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,160
My sunshine is back again.

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,839
Your sunshine is exhausted today.

46
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:50,480
What I want to do now is...

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,400
Since we're out now,

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,839
why not?

49
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,879
Let's go to the bar and drink.

50
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,199
If you make me happy today,

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,639
I'm sure you're going to meet him

52
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,919
safe and sound.

53
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,199
Let's go.

54
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,055
=Love Crossed=

55
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,118
=Episode 12=

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,039
I feel terrible.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,559
I won't drink anymore.

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
It's three o'clock.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,639
I want to sleep.

60
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,919
Sleep for a while.

61
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,160
Jiang Kele didn't do the cleaning again.

62
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,720
Who's that?

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,279
Why did you come back so early today?

64
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,279
Oh no.

65
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,320
It's four o'clock already.
I have to do the cleaning.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
Wait a second.

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
I got this.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,440
Here you go.

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,520
Are you pregnant?

70
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,080
That’s how things go in the drama.

71
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,399
Get lost.

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
Are you ill?

73
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,720
Do you need to see Lei Na?

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,839
No need.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just a hangover.

76
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,119
(Nausea? Hangover?)

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,720
What's a hangover?

78
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,440
A hangover means

79
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
you're not yet sober from drinking

80
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,519
on the next day.

81
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,944
(Nausea? Hangover?)

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,519
Feeling terrible?

83
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,000
Why would you drink if
you'd feel terrible?

84
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,920
You've never drunk before, right?

85
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,160
You need to drink

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,920
many shots to feel drunk.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
However,

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,079
you'll feel carefree

89
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,440
for every shot you drink.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,600
You'll be bold

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,119
and on cloud nine.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
No wonder I always see this
in the drama.

93
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,720
Families, couples and friends

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
love to drink.

95
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,920
They drink more and more.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,959
Honey water can cure a hangover.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,519
Jiang Kele.

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Can you bring some drinks next time?

99
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,679
Let us feel the same too.

100
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,640
All right, I'll bring them tomorrow.

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,920
Let's drink together.

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,519
Oh no, don't mention it.

103
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,959
It makes me want to throw up
by mentioning it.

104
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm going to get some water.

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,200
We can drink too.

106
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,239
Who prepared this honey water?

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,399
Lu Xiao?

108
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,160
You'll be bold

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,959
and on cloud nine.

110
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:05,119
Honey water can cure a hangover.

111
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,839
Would she see this if I put it here?

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,079
What if others drink this?

113
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,799
By doing so, she might be able to drink.

114
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,559
No wonder he wandered here and there.

115
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,559
He was making honey water for me.

116
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,559
My goodness.

117
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,799
Was he afraid that

118
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,520
I can't get sober
so he prepared this much?

119
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm so happy.

120
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
My Lu Xiao

121
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,200
is getting more and more perfect.

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
I only care about myself

123
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,599
and forgot what Qianya told me.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,440
In real life,

125
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,599
if a girl asks a man out for a drink,

126
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
the man would drink some

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
even if he couldn't drink.

128
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,719
Indeed,

129
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
you're just a virtual character.

130
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,280
Forget it.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,359
How ridiculous I am.

132
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,320
Why would I expect something

133
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,880
from a virtual character?

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,840
Xu Nian, I'm going to clean the room.

135
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Why did she close the door
when cleaning the room

136
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,080
and even lock it?

137
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,599
I pretended to clean the room.

138
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,520
I have something to say.

139
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,799
Why would you lock the door then?

140
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,799
We can't let them know.

141
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
It's a secret between you and me.

142
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,760
Did you remember that

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,320
I asked you about your ideal type?

144
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,200
My best friend

145
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,760
happens to be your ideal type.

146
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,679
She's hygienic and gentle.
She enjoys life and has good taste.

147
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,039
Just that she has short hair.

148
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,200
But don't worry.

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,799
She can keep her hair long for you.

150
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,280
Do you want to meet her?

151
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,799
I said that randomly.

152
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,239
So far, I've only met

153
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,599
two girls, you and Lei Na.

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't mention about ideal type.

155
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,719
You said it randomly.

156
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,280
But I told my best friend already.

157
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,320
I told her that

158
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
I met a knowledgeable,

159
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
gentle and handsome man

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,479
at my workplace.

161
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,919
And she's interested in you.

162
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,400
We drank till this morning.

163
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,559
Only then I agreed.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,039
Best friend?

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,239
Do you have a best friend?

166
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,834
(26th October, Sunday)

167
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,919
Jiang Kele, how many best friends
do you have?

168
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,960
Only one.

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
I'd be exhausted

170
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,640
if I have more best friends like her.

171
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,840
How? Couldn't you lend me a hand?

172
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
I would like to help.

173
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,880
But as you know,

174
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,039
we can't go out.

175
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,440
It's fine. Just leave it to me.

176
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,359
I promise you won't get caught.

177
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,640
What you need to do is

178
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,359
to go to meet her

179
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,719
for ten minutes at most.

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
When?

181
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,799
At ten o'clock tonight.

182
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,973
(31st October, Friday)

183
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,799
They fell asleep. Let's go.

184
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,159
Good evening.

185
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
Su Lie always sleepwalks.

186
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

187
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,080
Lu Xiao.

188
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,119
Didn't you say that
they all fell asleep?

189
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,359
How would I know

190
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,280
they'd stay awake tonight?

191
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,479
Let's wait then.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
No way.

193
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,599
My best friend has been waiting.

194
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,007
(Please don't follow
the dangerous activities.)

195
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,520
(Qianya, we met some problems here.)

196
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,520
(If we don't)

197
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,799
(show up at 10:20,)

198
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,080
(the meeting tonight is canceled.)

199
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,479
I think Lu Xiao

200
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,159
won't return to his room in this while.

201
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,239
I'll make him go back to his room.

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Take this.

203
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,679
After I draw his attention,

204
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
put it into the piggy.

205
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,440
There's a painting on the
right side of the wall.

206
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,359
Push it and go straight.

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,520
You'll see my best friend.

208
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,479
Don't fall over.

209
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,280
It's been late. Why haven't you left?

210
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,679
It has nothing to do with you.

211
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
Why did you act mysteriously
with Xu Nian today?

212
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,320
What were you two doing?

213
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,640
Did it have something to do with you?

214
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
What? Are you jealous?

215
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,559
I didn't expect you'd be jealous.

216
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,760
Xu Nian and I

217
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
are just friends.

218
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,159
Just friends?

219
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,039
Don't close the door
while cleaning then.

220
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,320
You're so jealous.

221
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,719
Okay.

222
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,760
Let's watch the show together

223
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,880
so that you won't be jealous again.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,799
Let me switch the channel.

225
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,159
How about this?

226
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Chinese historical drama.

227
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,119
It's not interesting.

228
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,359
"When We Were Young."

229
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,679
It's very interesting.

230
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,039
It's too boring.

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,280
Boring? Go to sleep then.

232
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,640
It's fine.

233
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,320
I can't fall asleep.

234
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,200
Let's watch it for a while.

235
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,320
You don't have to since you dislike it.

236
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,080
I'll read the book.

237
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,320
You continue and watch.

238
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,799
Whose teddy bear is it?

239
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,159
It's a little dirty. I have to wash it.

240
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,400
Put it back!

241
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,840
No.

242
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,599
Put it back!

243
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,239
I don't want to.

244
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,799
Jiang Kele, Jiang Kele!

245
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,559
Chase after me.

246
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,320
Put it back now.

247
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll give it to you if you can get me.

248
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
Give me back my teddy bear.

249
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,239
I don't want to.

250
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,599
You're so slow.

251
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,400
Give me back my teddy bear, Jiang Kele!

252
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
Don't chase after me.

253
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,520
Give it back. Stop there!

254
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,479
Stop there!

255
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,000
No.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,640
Give it back!

257
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,880
I don't want to. What would you do?

258
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,719
Don't chase after me!

259
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,520
Stop there! Are you mad?

260
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,199
Lu Xiao, don't come any closer.

261

Listen.

262

If you come closer, I'll dive in.

confused now?

But it was not after I thought about it.

317
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,359
It was so unreal that

the virtual character in the game

Oh no, it's getting worse.

331
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,160

dating an actual person is different

00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,680
from dating a virtual character.

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
In the game,

343
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,520
you can say whatever you like.

344
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,800
You can do whatever you like.

345
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,359
But it's different in real life.

346
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,599
For instance, Lu Xiao and I.

347
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
In real life,

348
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
I have many things to ask him.

349
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,959
I want to ask why he

350
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,680
sneaked out and came back again.

351
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:09,719
But in real life,

352
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,839
he's so bad-tempered.

353
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
How could I ask him?

354
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,839
Just drink.

355
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,719
Just drink.

356
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,400
Cheers.

357
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,839
Making him drunk will do.

358
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,599
Such a wonderful day.

359
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,959
Good morning.

360
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,079
Who are you?

361
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,920
Aunty.

362
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,479
Why didn't you knock on the door first?

363
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,359
It's a surprise.

364
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,880
No, it's a shock.

365
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,839
You know

366
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,160
my sleeping habit.

367
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,079
Oh, your shoes.

368
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,359
My goodness.

369
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,119
Aunty, you're trespassing.

370
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,800
Oh no. Are you going to sue me?

371
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,160
I can do that.

372
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,800
Are you for real?

373
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,719
Let's settle our old scores.

374
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,719
You lived at my place

375
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,719
for 15 years, plus eight months,
eight days and eight hours.

376
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,599
How do we settle this?

377
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,599
Aunty, I...

378
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,760
Please put your shoes down first.

379
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,400
Let's settle this later, okay?

380
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh no. Oh dear.

381
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,479
I need to change the bed again.

382
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,479
Aunty.

383
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,839
Don't touch it!

384
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
Why?

385
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,680
Isn't it for me?

386
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,280
No.

387
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,760
These all

388
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,400
are for me.

389
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,040
You can't finish all.

390
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,719
If I can't finish all,

391
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,839
I can give them to the staff

392
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,640
in my neighborhoods

393
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,920
and all the drivers.

394
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,160
I have a lot of money.

395
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Then what can I eat?

396
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,160
Whatever.

397
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,920
You're a grown-up.

398
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,119
You're an adult.

399
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Don't rely on people older than you.

400
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,439
All right then.

401
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,599
I'll eat in the office.

402
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,760
Do you want to eat?

403
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,199
You can have it.

404
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,040
But

405
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,239
only after I finish eating.

406
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,359
Just like what happened in the past.

407
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,560
When you went to school as a little kid,

408
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,760
breakfast was left a lot.

409
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,319
I had to finish them.

410
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:35,719
It's right.

411
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,439
Aunty.

412
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,119
Can you put your leg down?

413
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,119
Both legs.

414
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,239
Do you know

415
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,479
how we can tell when someone
is getting older?

416
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,239
I know.

417
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,280
When a person often feels nostalgic.

418
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,280
But I'm not old.

419
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,760
I pretend to feel nostalgic.

420
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,959
I want to remind you constantly

421
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,000
how nice I was to you.

422
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,319
Of course I know.

423
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,920
If it wasn't for you who adopted me
from the welfare home,

424
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,479
I wouldn't be what I am today.

425
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,280
I'd like to ask you

426
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
about the plan.

427
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
When will it be completed?

428
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,400
I don't want

429
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,959
the contract to be delayed again.

430
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,359
It's annoying.

431
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,640
You failed to fulfill any of

432
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,880
the promises you made.

433
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,199
Don't worry.

434
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,239
The glimmers of hope will be at sight.

435
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:05,760
Come in.

436
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,160
Ms. Guan, what's the matter?

437
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,319
(Crush On Love)
Mr. Cui, what's wrong?

438
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,119
Let go of me.

439
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,880
As ordered by Ms. Guan,

440
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:17,839
you'll be executed for

441
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,479
betraying the company.

442
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,520
Let go of me!

443
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm innocent, Ms. Guan.

444
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,479
How dare you say so?

445
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,439
You colluded with Yao Inc.

446
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,079
to set Ms. Guan up.

447
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,359
She was addicted to the game
and lost her mind.

448
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,479
She did a sexy dance

449
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,800
and was insulted by numerous netizens
during the live streaming.

450
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,239
All right, cut it.

451
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,760
Lisa, tell me frankly.

452
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,520
Did you tell them that

453
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,680
I played the game?

454
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,359
I really didn't do that, Ms. Guan.

455
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,599
I only knew you were playing the game
via the live streaming.

456
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,119
I was surprised.

457
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,839
I didn't know you can dance so sexily.

458
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,520
You talk too much.

459
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Ms. Guan can really dance sexily.

460
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,680
Cui Hengzhi.

461
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,000
It's not the main point.

462
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,640
The point is

463
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,439
someone saw you meet with
staff from Yao Inc.

464
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,280
Who saw that?

465
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,199
The security guard, Wu.

466
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,520
He saw it when he stalked you.

467
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,359
He admires me.

468
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,719
He can't be with me,
so he wrongly accused me.

469
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,959
He saw you

470
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,760
together with Xu Guanghan's lover.

471
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,000
What?

472
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,640
That's his secretary, Lei Na.

473
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,119
It's really you, Lisa.

474
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,199
Ms. Guan, I'm sorry.

475
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,719
I'm too eager for

476
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,319
the lifetime membership
of Lavender club.

477
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,719
So I changed your lens secretly.

478
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,920
But I really didn't tell them

479
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,199
that you were playing the game.

480
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Do you think you will be spared

481
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,079
by admitting only one offense?

482
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,239
It was not me.

483
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,040
Ms. Guan kept her secret well.

484
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,000
All the staff didn't know that she's
playing the game.

485
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:46,920
I think

486
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,400
maybe she exposed herself

487
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,719
when buying the device.

488
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,359
I bought the device.

489
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,479
It was you who exposed then.

490
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,119
Ms. Guan, please execute Mr. Cui
as well.

491
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
You accused me!

492
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
All right.

493
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,040
Don't mention it.

494
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,839
I just wanted you to be scared.

495
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
All right, you can leave now.

496
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Thank you Ms. Guan for sparing me.

497
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,640
I was really shocked.

498
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,479
It's like when

499
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,560
I saw you dance.

500
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,239
Get out.

501
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,199
Okay.

502
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,920
Ms. Guan, you don't doubt Lisa anymore?

503
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,359
Forget it.

504
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,959
Didn't you get it?

505
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,359
I was set up from the very first

506
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,640
of this incident.

507
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,599
What do you mean?

508
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
You told me to

509
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,920
buy the device at first...

510
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,479
I mean, it all started from

511
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,680
from the moment when my lens

512
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
got changed.

I thought you doubted me.

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
How should we treat Lisa?

Fire her.

All right, I got this.

517
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:49,959
Hold on.

00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,880
Tell your ex-wife's best friend

519

520

I want to expose a big secret
about Xu Guanghan.

521
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,239
Ask her to prepare herself.

It seems that you're ready

523
