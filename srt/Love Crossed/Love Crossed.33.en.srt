1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,360
Stop hiding. Come out.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,279
Here's your ride.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:14,880
Where do we go next?

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,040
Let's meet up with them

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,280
at the library.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,639
Let's go.

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello, Luo Ke.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,840
We have found Xu Nian.

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:29,799
What?

10
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,040
At the hospital?

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,240
=Love Crossed=

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,380
=Episode 33=

13
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,239
Here you are.

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,239
Ms. Guan.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
How's Mr. Cui?

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,599
He has a fever due to wound infection.

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,519
Luo Ke and I rushed him
to the hospital.

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,959
The doctor said
he needed to be hospitalized.

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,680
You're awake. How do you feel?

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,760
Ms. Guan.

21
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,519
You two are reunited.

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,879
What a relief.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,519
How about Kele and Lu Xiao?

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,839
Did you manage to reach them?

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Not yet.

26
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,720
It's been so long
since we last heard from them.

27
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,919
Will they be in danger?

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,080
No, we have to look for them.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,959
Don't move.

30
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,559
Mr. Cui, you need to get some rest.

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,199
You can't go running around with us.

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,080
No, Ms. Guan.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,919
I get it.

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,479
You've done so many things.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,600
I shouldn't have

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,039
gotten you involved in this.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
I feel bad enough already.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,039
They'll be more worried

39
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,360
if you drag yourself along.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,839
Ms. Guan, don't worry.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,199
I'll look after him.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Thank you.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
We're going to meet them now.

44
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,039
Be safe.

45
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,880
Rest well.

46
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's go.

47
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,399
Come on.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Stop acting tough.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,199
You make me worried.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,000
It's Qiqi.

51
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,160
Let's hide in that room.

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,813
(Lu Xiao, Leading Colorist)

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Kele, why are you here?

54
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,320
Qiqi.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,039
Do you know
you didn't lock the door last night?

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,279
I've waited here all night,

57
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,559
and I've been keeping watch.

58
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,880
Good thing I'm here.

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,399
If the boss found out about it,

60
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,759
you'd have been fired.

61
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,160
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,279
I did lock the door.

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
If you did, how do you explain me
being here?

64
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,399
You're right.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,240
Did I forget to lock it

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,479
after the guys helped me close the gate?

67
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,800
Well, thank you, Kele.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
Don't mention it.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,800
Didn't your relatives come
and pay you a visit?

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,880
Why would you come and find me?

71
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,960
My relatives left.
So I dropped by to see you.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,119
I miss you.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
All right. I'll go and get changed.

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,839
Qiqi.

75
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,160
What is it?

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,559
I have something important

77
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,520
to share with you.

78
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:14,520
What is it?

79
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,639
I've leveled up in the game.

80
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,000
I've gotten a super membership card.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Look.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,359
There's no need
to wear glasses anymore.

83
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,079
It's bad for the eyes.

84
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,559
Friends can share
the virtual character directly.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
For real?

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,079
A friend of mine worked

87
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,399
at Love Boys.

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,959
He shared an internal link with me.

89
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,040
It's not available to most people.

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
Would you like to try?

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,359
Come out!

92
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,839
So this is Lu Xiao?

93
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,359
Why does he look so reluctant?

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,119
He might seem cold,
but he's actually very nice.

95
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,320
Don't judge

96
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
by how he looks now.

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,839
His service is pretty good.

98
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,799
Qiqi.

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,679
Would you like a massage from him?

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,959
Is it a good idea for me
to give her a massage?

101
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,519
It hurts.

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,160
What feature is this?

103
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,839
It hurts? That's how it should be.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,359
That means he doesn't suit you.

105
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,640
I'll chase him away.

106
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Don't leave just yet.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,279
You came to show off, right?

108
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,839
You're leaving when you failed?

109
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,959
How embarrassing if the word gets out.

110
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,279
It's fine. I don't mind.

111
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm your best friend.

112
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,279
How can I let you be humiliated?

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I am wondering

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,040
if there are any other features
that are more interesting.

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,880
What do you want?

116
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,480
This abs and the touch...

117
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,399
Qiqi, that's enough.

118
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,839
You have tested it,

119
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,399
and I'm done showing off.

120
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,799
I should get going.

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
Stand right there.

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
I have one last wish.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Can you satisfy me?

124
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,200
There's more?

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,399
Didn't you unlock the new feature?

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,160
Can he kiss?

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Next week is my birthday.

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,519
Do me a favor.

129
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,079
Let Lu Xiao kiss me.

130
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,959
Take it as my birthday gift.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,279
Sure.

132
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,000
Sure?

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,440
Kiss?

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Sure.

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,559
Close your eyes.

136
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,239
Okay.

137
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,239
Almost there.

138
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,959
Here I come.

139
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,000
Hurry. What's the delay?

140
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,920
Jiang Kele.

141
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,720
Slow down. Don't get choked.

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Thank you.

143
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,760
Sorry, I'm too hungry.

144
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,959
You kept me company all night long.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,760
You must be hungry too.

146
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,679
Why don't you have some?

147
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,239
It's fine. You can have it.

148
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,359
I'll see if your friends are here.

149
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,559
You don't even know my friends.

150
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
How are you going to do that?

151
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,359
Your friends didn't show up at all.

152
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,760
Did something happen to them?

153
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,720
Why don't you give them a call?

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My friends don't have phones.

155
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,079
No phones?

156
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,640
Your friends...

157
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,279
I thought everyone has a phone.

158
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,679
How can they not have phones?

159
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
Besides, even if
they didn't have phones,

160
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,200
they could have called you

161
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,320
from anywhere.

162
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,239
How could they just keep you waiting?

163
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,399
What's wrong with them?

164
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,519
Sorry.

165
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,279
Did I ask too much?

166
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,599
No.

167
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,559
It's just that things are a little
complicated.

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,479
I don't know how to explain it.

169
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
If you trust me,

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,799
you can tell me.

171
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,679
Do you really want to know?

172
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:54,559
It's a long story.

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,520
Besides, if you know about it,

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,679
it might put you in danger.

175
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not afraid

176
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,080
if it can actually help you.

177
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,559
Aren't we friends?

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,440
Lanlan, my friends are here.
I have to go.

179
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
I'll talk to you again.

180
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,239
Lanlan, thank you for staying with me
all night.

181
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,000
It's no big deal. Keep in touch.

182
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,599
Kele, Lu Xiao.

183
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:51,559
Qi Chuan? Why would you be here?

184
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,559
You know me?

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
In a nutshell,

186
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Guan Qianya and I
are working together again.

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
Xu Guanghan is his enemy too.

188
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:23,799
Hello?

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,479
Hello, besides Su Lie,

190
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,599
everyone else is here.

191
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,799
I'll send the picture to you.

192
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Okay.

193
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,359
All of us
have been through a lot today.

194
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,559
Good thing everyone is safe.

195
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,479
Did you find the evidence?

196
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,359
We found a set of books in the library.

197
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,080
Kele and I went through them all night

198
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,359
but we found nothing.

199
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,039
Let me see.

200
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,559
I might find something.

201
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,679
Are you sure
you didn't get the wrong ones?

202
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,280
This is the only set

203
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,719
with the corresponding number

204
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,679
given by Grandma Fushun.

205
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,719
What about the numbers?
Did you get the right numbers?

206
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,119
It's 8171. No mistake.

207
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,799
Is it possible that the numbers

208
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,359
don't correspond to the books?

209
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,679
We've searched the lockers.

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
But we didn't find
any corresponding number.

211
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,239
Is there anything else

212
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,919
in this library

213
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,320
that can match the number?

214
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,919
Don't we have quite some nerves

215
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,280
to be talking here?

216
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,559
Let's discuss it elsewhere.

217
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,320
We have nowhere else to go.

218
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,080
I'll take you to a place,
Chuan Residence.

219
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
What place is that?

220
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
It's his house.

221
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,359
When I first met you,

222
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,039
I knew you're a smart girl.

223
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,159
Do you know

224
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,239
who said that to me last time?

225
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Xu Guanghan.

226
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,479
I don't want to be like him.

227
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,239
Let's waste no time. Let's go.

228
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,039
What do you think?

229
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,080
Come on.

230
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,159
Your house is so luxurious.

231
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,320
I wish I can look around the place.

232
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,799
That can wait.

233
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,840
We should have a discussion first.

234
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,119
A discussion?

235
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
We do have to discuss
on how to find the evidence.

236
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
No.

237
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,640
Discuss why our whereabouts was exposed.

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Someone's following us.

239
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,080
If I hadn't driven
the anti-paparazzi minivan,

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,200
Xu Guanghan would have caught us

241
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,719
and put us in the game.

242
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,000
The fact that we were followed

243
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,119
proved only one thing.

244
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,679
There's a spy among us.

245
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,479
We escaped together

246
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,919
and had a near-death experience.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
How could a spy be among us?

248
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,559
But think about it.

249
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,440
If there wasn't a spy,

250
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
why would they know our exact location?

251
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,200
Qianya.

252
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,960
We have the same enemy, Xu Guanghan.

253
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,400
So it couldn't be you.

254
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,799
As for you...

255
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,599
Don't look at me.

256
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,039
I can go down together with Xu Guanghan

257
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,400
to prove my innocence.

258
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,320
Don't bother.

259
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
You are not capable enough
to be a spy.

260
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
Didn't you just say that I am smart?

261
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,359
You're smart, but not intelligent.

262
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,960
So it can't be you.

263
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,679
As for the four of you,

264
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
I don't quite trust you.

265
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,000
We don't need your trust.

266
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,679
Of all people,

267
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,960
you're the most suspicious one.

268
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,679
That's great.

269
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,159
Since we suspect one another,

270
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,919
we're all after the same thing then.

271
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,239
Dare to bet?

272
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,159
Let's find out who the spy is.

273
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:43,119
And how do we do that?

274
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,880
Let's start with the phones.

275
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,880
Take out your phones.

276
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,599
Well, everyone's phone

277
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,359
is here.

278
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,280
Who do we start from?

279
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,960
Let's start

280
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,599
with whoever suggested this.

281
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,159
Sure.

282
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,960
But I've been using this phone
for many years.

283
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,479
If you want to check it item by item,

284
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,039
be prepared to pull an all-nighter.

285
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,320
There's no need for that.

286
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,359
Just start from the moment
we met yesterday.

287
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,440
What's wrong? Are you scared now?

288
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,559
Yes, I'm afraid you'll set me up.

289
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,039
I suggest let this person

290
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,840
who isn't capable of being a spy

291
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,000
to be the notary.

292
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
No objection, right?

293
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,960
Thank you.

294
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:36,239
I won't let all of you down.

295
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,159
The first text is from his manager.

296
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,520
Qi Chuan.

297
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:48,400
I've managed to reach Xu Guanghan.

298
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,960
I didn't expect it to be you.

299
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,080
No, keep playing it.

300
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
He'd like to give you the authority
for one song.

301
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,039
"Nobody wants to stay at home
on the weekend

302
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,400
and eat popcorn while watching the TV"

303
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,719
He still wants to be paid
10 times the price.

304
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,159
Is he out of his mind or what?

305
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,359
I told you I am innocent.

306
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,559
The second text is from
his private doctor.

307
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,599
Qi Chuan, in regards to Y4 data,

308
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,919
I've collected them as you requested.

309
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,039
No, this is...

310
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,599
It's not what you think. Let go of me.

311
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,119
I don't recommend

312
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,919
you do a plastic surgery
based on Y4 facial features.

313
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,880
You can go with the face-lifting,

314
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,239
wrinkle-reducing, whitening,
and light therapy treatments,

315
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,919
and see how it goes
before you make a decision.

316
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,479
Sorry about that.

317
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,880
It's a little embarrassing.

318
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,640
But it proves my innocence.

319
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,200
Next.

320
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,359
I'll go next.

321
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,840
I haven't activated my phone.

322
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,000
So there's nothing yet.

323
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,919
Same as Kele.

324
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Mine too.

325
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,719
Move on to the next person.

326
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,000
It's my turn.

327
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,919
The only person I talked to
last night was Guan Qianya.

328
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,200
Look.

329
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,440
Indeed.

330
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,719
So there's one person left.

331
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,800
I've waited for you at the library
all night.

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,079
How could you suspect me?

333
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,520
Su Lie, the more you say,
the worse it gets.

334
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,640
Just show us.

335
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,880
Will you and your friends
be coming to the library again?

336
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
Who's Lanlan?

337
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,479
Someone I just met.

338
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,079
She studies Information Science.

339
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,079
She's going to study abroad

340
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,439
while doing an internship
in the library.

341
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,439
She kept me company

342
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,640
all night long in the library.

343
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,160
Information Science?

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,079
Is she a female spy?

345
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,040
No.

346
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
The Information Science

347
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,119
isn't what you thought it is.

348
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,959
The name of her profession

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,680
is Library Information
Resource Management.

350
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,040
It doesn't matter.

351
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,280
Look.

352
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,079
A stranger

353
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,760
kept him company
all night long for no reason.

354
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,239
Don't you find it weird?

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
When you put it that way,
it does feel weird too.

356
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,760
But she seems to

357
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,040
have helped me
overcome my fear of women.

358
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,599
Look, I can talk to you now.

359
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,880
That's not the point.

360
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,160
Think.

361
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,400
What did you say to her?

362
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll see if your friends are here.

363
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,359
You don't even know my friends.

364
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,599
How are you going to do that?

365
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,359
Your friends didn't show up at all.

366
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,719
Did something happen to them?

367
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,000
Why don't you give them a call?

368
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
My friends don't have phones.

369
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,760
No phones?

370
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,640
Your friends...

371
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,160
I thought everyone has a phone.

372
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
How can they not have phones?

373
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,439
Besides,
even if they didn't have phones,

374
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
they could have called you

375
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,839
from anywhere.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,839
How could they just

377
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,040
keep you waiting?

378
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,959
What's wrong with them?

379
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,599
Sorry.

380
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,359
Did I ask too much?

381
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,040
Could she be the spy?

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Calm down. Tell me what your plan is.

383
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't have any plans.

384
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,760
When I see her,

385
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
I'll confront her right away.

386
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,680
Chill. Calm down first.

387
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,199
I'm afraid
you'd have blown your cover

388
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,199
before you could get her.

389
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,640
It's almost noon now.

390
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:22,680
How about this?

391
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,079
Ask her out for lunch.

392
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,400
We'll take over after that.

393
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,560
Right.

394
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
Don't get nervous, all right?

395
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,560
Just talk and act normal.

396
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,760
Don't raise her suspicion.

397
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,119
Okay.

398
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,160
I texted you earlier.

399
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Why didn't you reply?

400
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,239
I was on my way here.
So I haven't read it.

401
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,640
Did you come with your friends?

402
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,199
No, I came alone.

403
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,800
I see.

404
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,400
Why are you here then?

405
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,640
I came to see you.

406
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
See me?

407
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,560
Why?

408
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,359
I want to take you out for lunch.

409
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,920
You treated me the other day.

410
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,079
I would like to return the favor.

411
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,160
But I already had lunch.

412
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,400
How about a drink?

413
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,199
Okay.

414
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,959
There is a coffee shop upstairs.

415
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,439
Let's go there for a drink later.

416
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,520
There's a better place nearby.

417
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,479
Let's go there instead.

418
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
But I'm working now.

419
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,479
I'll try to take a day-off.

420
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,079
Wait here for me, okay?

421
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,520
Okay.

422
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,820
(Seven main types of information
resource management standards.)

423
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,500
(Data creation stage,
Data preservation stage.)

424
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Do you know what I've been up
to all morning?

425
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,479
I know. Catching the spy.

426
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,599
That's one of them.

427
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,239
I'm also observing Xu Nian.

428
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,959
What for?

429
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,160
I'm observing him to see
if he's anything like Xu Guanghan.

430
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,560
I've done it before.

431
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,959
They are nothing alike.

432
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,079
I was just joking.

433
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,000
Xu Nian has quite some tricks
up his sleeve, isn't it?

434
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,319
There were fireworks,
singing and dancing.

435
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,479
I've been observing him all morning.

436
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,400
Why has he only said
five sentences to you?

437
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,640
Besides, those weren't directed at you.

438
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,599
Why do you like such a boring guy?

439
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
That's nothing.

440
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,959
You haven't seen Xu Nian philosophizing.

441
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,119
It can't be helped though.
He strikes Qianya's fancy.

442
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,760
Actually, I don't get it

443
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,800
at first.

444
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,119
But after I learned
of Xu Nian's identity,

445
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,000
I finally got it.

446
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,280
Their relationship is one

447
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,760
where they are both in the same league.

448
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,640
Got it?

449
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,680
You two can really get along well.

450
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I should have introduced you two sooner.

451
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,760
It's not too late now.

452
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,280
All right. Knock it off.

453
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,920
It's been so long.
Why isn't Su Lie out yet?

454
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,599
Oh, no.

455
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,959
Is it possible

456
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,160
that girl turned him?

457
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,079
Turned him?

458
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,680
That's better be the case.

459
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,040
We can cut the suspect loose then.

460
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560
But what worries me

461
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,119
is that the girl stalled him

462
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,719
and took off herself.

463
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,640
Have you completed your task?

464
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,599
It was completed in a breeze.

465
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,199
I asked Lanlan out for a drink.

466
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,079
She said yes.

467
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,160
Why are you alone,
reading a book then?

468
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,560
This isn't a book.

469
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,359
This is her revision notes.

470
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,640
Where is she?

471
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,400
She said she'd ask for the day off

472
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,400
and told me to wait here.

473
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,640
She has such nice handwriting.

474
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
Stay here and keep reading it then.

475
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,040
Hi, I managed to stall Su Liang.

476
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,040
Don't worry. I'm fine.

477
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,640
What are you doing?

478
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,599
Give me back my phone!

479
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
What are you doing?

480
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,479
Lanlan.

481
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,439
Su Liang!

482
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Su Liang.

483
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Don't get the wrong idea.

484
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,280
What are you guys doing?

485
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,599
Mr. Zhang!

486
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,479
Calm down.

487
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,079
We just want to ask you something.

488
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,880
Guan Qianya?

489
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,319
Qi Chuan?

490
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,280
So you're with Su Liang?

491
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,280
Look around you. Quit playing dumb.

492
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,280
Didn't you already know he's Su Lie?

493
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,719
So Xu Guanghan sent you here right?

494
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,359
No one sent me.

495
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,800
Who were you talking to on the phone?

496
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,479
Let's see.

497
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,500
(Hanhan)

498
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,160
Who's Hanhan?

499
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,280
It's Xu Guanghan, right?

500
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,800
That's my best friend.

501
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,800
Xu Guanghan is her best friend?

502
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,079
Shut up.

503
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,959
I'll call him now.

504
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,920
Hello, Lanlan?

505
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,119
I've been waiting for you in the library
all day. Where are you?

506
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,079
Didn't we agree to
persuade that impostor

507
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,119
to stop trying to pass of as Su Lie?

508
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,239
Where are you now? Hello?

509
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,439
So I wasn't sent by Xu Guanghan.

510
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm just a player of Love Boys.

511
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,959
I saw in the news two days ago

512
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,880
that there were impostors.

513
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,040
But I didn't expect

514
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,000
I would run into the fake Su Lie.

515
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,160
But after our recent interaction,

516
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,680
I don't think he's a bad guy.

517
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,880
He must have been led astray.

518
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,560
So I was discussing with my best friend

519
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,760
to talk him round
and guide him on the right path.

520
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,800
But I never thought

521
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,439
you're the ones pulling the strings.

522
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,119
A celebrity and a business owner.

523
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,119
I'm loaded.

524
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,959
Why would I need to do this?

525
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:23,239
So Lanlan thought I am an impostor.

526
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,560
If not?

527
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,680
Do you want her to think of you
as the real Su Lie

528
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,880
and trick something out of you?

529
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,040
I thought
she would consider me a friend.

530
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,160
I thought you were afraid of girls.

531
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,800
And you want to befriend her now?

532
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,599
You like her?

533
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,439
Kele.

534
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,119
So she's been cleared of suspicion.

535
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,160
Suspicion is easily established,

536
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,520
but it's hard to be cleared.

537
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,800
What if

538
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,119
she's an experienced spy

539
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,479
and has already figured out
how to get away?

540
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,079
What if she knows martial arts?

541
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,560
The chat history
between her and her best friend

542
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,479
is exactly the same as she said.

543
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,800
There's nothing suspicious in her phone.

544
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,800
She's indeed a professional spy

545
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,199
to leave no traces behind.

546
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,319
Do you have other ways

547
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,280
to prove that she works for Xu Guanghan?

548
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,359
Let me think about it.

549
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,319
No.

550
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,560
I have an idea.

551
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,680
What is it?

552
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,800
Do you have Xu Guanghan's number?

553
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,160
I do.

554
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,400
Call him.

555
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,520
Hello?

556
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,239
This is Lanlan.

557
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,079
Lanlan? Who's Lanlan?

558
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,439
How many Lanlan do you know?

559
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,359
Of course, I'm the one
you've been waiting for.

560
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,400
Crazy.

561
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,680
Did we misunderstand her?

562
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,640
Lanlan, I'm sorry.

563
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,760
We've made a mistake.
I hope you don't mind.

564
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,560
It's fine. What matters
is we've gotten things straight.

565
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,560
But here's a piece of advice for you.

566
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,920
Stop scamming people.

567
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,640
Lanlan.

568
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,959
Actually, I'm not an impostor. I'm...

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Shut up.

570
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,199
Let's just pretend this never happened.

571
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,199
Don't tell anyone about this. Okay?

572
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,640
Okay. After this incident,

573
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
I won't stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

574
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,439
Young lady, don't be afraid.

575
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,400
Here's something to make it up to you.

576
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,359
This is the VVIP ticket

577
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,719
(Rather Dance than Being in Love)
for my concert.

578
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,839
The price has gone sky-high.
It's hard to get.

579
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,560
If you don't have time,

580
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
you can give it to your friend.

581
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,800
Lanlan.

582
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,359
Can I still text you next time?

583
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,959
Don't contact her again.

584
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,839
You'll only hurt her.

585
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
It's just not meant to be.

586
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,800
It's been so long.
Why aren't they back yet?

587
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,239
Did something happen?

588
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,760
Qi Chuan is a smart guy.

589
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,239
He'll be fine.

590
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,920
He's quite a smart guy.

591
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,959
He's only been with us for a day,

592
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,079
and he's already trying

593
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,439
to turn us against each other.

594
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,839
Not to mention, Qianya and Kele

595
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,280
are on his side now.

596
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,520
If this goes on,

597
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,920
