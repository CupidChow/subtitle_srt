1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,680
Did I wake you up?

2
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,239
Don't move.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,000
Finish the chicken soup on the bed.
Here.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,959
I made it this morning.

5
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,559
I am so envious of you.

6
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,240
You get to have a warm bowl of
chicken soup when you wake up.

7
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,520
That's something

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,799
I dreamt of since young.

9
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,919
I have always wanted to be fed
when I wake up.

10
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,119
No need to work whatsoever.

11
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,040
Try it.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,479
It smells wonderful.

13
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,000
You did this to everyone too?

14
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,959
No, just you.

15
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:01,560
I think we should share it
with others.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,119
Sure.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,319
How generous of you.

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,279
Let's do it.

19
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,420

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,410
=Episode 18=

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,440
Chicken soup!

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,880
Jiang Kele made this for us.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,000
We have been training hard lately.
Let's recharge ourselves.

24
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,880
Everyone's here.

25
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,559
What are you guys doing?

26
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,479
We are pouring Lu Xiao
a bowl of chicken soup.

27
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,600
Luo Ke asked us
to drink the chicken soup.

28
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,080
Please don't be mad, Lu Xiao.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,080
We're drinking the leftover...

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
Lu Xiao hasn't even had a sip.

31
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,119
No... Not on my face, please.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,479
What's wrong with you?
Let's enjoy it together.

33
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,479
But...

34
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,520
Jiang Kele specially made this for you.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,360
We don't have the right
to drink it.

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,479
It's fine. When I say you can drink it,
I mean it.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,919
You can hit me, you know.

38
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,600
When you act like this, it's scary.

39
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,360
No need to be afraid.

40
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,000
Lu Xiao has changed.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,600
The childish,

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,919
evil Lu Xiao

43
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,800
is now gone.

44
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,839
-Now he's
-Here, Su Lie.

45
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,199
gentle, kind,

46
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,759
and as handsome as ever.

47
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:48,759
Are you serious?

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,679
Yes.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,800
See for yourself.

50
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,919
When I do this

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,360
or this,

52
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,960
he won't be mad at all.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,320
So, do you want to give it a try?

54
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,639
Um...

55
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,720
Lu Xiao belongs to you.

56
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,240
We can't touch him.

57
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,520
They are too afraid.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,839
Check for yourself, Xu Nian.

59
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,320
See? I told you it's true.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,720
Enough about me.
Let's enjoy the chicken soup.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Or else it'll get cold.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Try it.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,399
I'm so touched now.

64
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,440
Not sure if it's due to
this delicious chicken soup

65
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,200
or due to Lu Xiao's changes.

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Drink more then. Don't stop.

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,119
Ms. Guan!

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
Come in.

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,399
I am furious.

70
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,600
What's the matter?

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,279
Look!

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640

I don't know.

I heard it too.

118
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,799

I'm off to rehearsal.

132
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,000
Wait.

133
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,040
I can't take such an important gift,
Lu Xiao.

134
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:18,959
Not that.

135
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,279
Can you please give this teddy bear

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,279
to my mom?

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,760
I have rehearsal today

138
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,399
so I might not be able to visit her.

139
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Sure. Leave it to me.

140
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,480
See you then.

141
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,480
Bye!

142
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:02,640
Aunty, you left so suddenly!

143
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,559
I was in the toilet.

144
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,359
Why did you sneak in here yourself?

145
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,919
She already passed away.

146
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,919
Can't you be more patient with me?

147
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,520
The patient is not here anymore.

148
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,119
But she's in the emergency room.

149
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,840
Emergency room?

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Where is it?

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,280
Why are you here, granny?

152
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,400
How's Aunt Youya?

153
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,760
The situation is quite grim.

154
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,460
(Surgery)

155
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,039
Granny,

156
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
I asked you once

157
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
whether Aunt Youya was Lu Xiao's mom.

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,239
You didn't answer me. Why?

159
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,919
Why should I tell you?

160
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,799
If I tell you she's not his mom,

161
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,760
you'd ask who she actually is.

162
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,359
Just questions after questions.

163
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,239
You should find the answer yourself.

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,359
Lu Xiao gave you this teddy bear,
didn't he?

165
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,440
I guess you have the answer now.

166
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,159
By the way, granny,

167
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
did you dig the tunnel?

168
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:25,440
It's a secret passage.

169
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,320
Fine, whatever it's called.

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
The secret passage,

171
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,200
did you dig it yourself?

172
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,239
Tomorrow...

173
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,320
"Tomorrow is like the box
of chocolate."

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,400
"You have to taste it
to know its flavor."

175
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,799
Tomorrow, come to my place.

176
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,679
Really?

177
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,640
You'll tell me
if I come to visit you tomorrow?

178
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,200
Any patient's relatives here?

179
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,359
Me.

180
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,159
What's the situation?

181
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Don't worry.

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,840
Her condition has been stabilized.

183
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,799
She will be transferred to ICU
for further observation.

184
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,280
Thank you.

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,200
Thank you.

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,359
You woke up, Aunty?

187
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,960
How are you feeling now?

188
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,679
Any discomfort? Dizziness?

189
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Are you hungry?

190
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,080
Do you want to eat something?

191
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,679
Why do you have so many questions?

192
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
Sorry.

193
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,640
By the way, Lu Xiao...

194
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
I mean Zhenyu asked me
to give you this.

195
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,599
Zhenyu, he's not here.

196
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,239
He's busy with work.

197
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:00,119
He asked me
to bring you the teddy bear

198
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
so that you'll feel
his presence by your side.

199
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
Worry not.

200
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,000
Once he's free, he'll visit you.

201
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,280
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,039
Can you give one thing to him for me?

203
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,479
Okay.

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,880
It's inside the drawer.

205
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,479
A pocket watch?

206
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,039
Give it to Zhenyu.

207
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
He'll understand.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,880
Will do. Leave it to me.

209
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,359
Thank you.

210
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,679
Lei Na.

211
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,679
Lei Na.

212
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,799
Lei Na.

213
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,440
Mr. Xu was very worried

214
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,640
when Lu Xiao fell sick several days ago.

215
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Besides, you guys
have been training hard lately

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,119
so your immunity system
has surely deteriorated.

217
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,239
To prevent the disease from spreading,

218
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,039
you will need to
disinfect the entire house.

219
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Noted.

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Your clothes

221
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,559
will be sterilized too.

222
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,880
But why?

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,599
We can just buy new ones.

224
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:03,060
(Crush On Love)

225
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,599
In that case, let's go back to our room

226
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,359
and take out the clothes
for the sterilization process.

227
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,679
No need for that.

228
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
You guys have worked very hard.

229
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,559
Watch some TV or rest.

230
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
I'll handle it for you.

231
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,060
(Crush On Love)

232
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,400
Xu Nian.

233
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,159
Where does this sweater come from?

234
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,760
Why does it have the logo of
Crush on Love?

235
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,640
I have never seen this sweater before.
It's new.

236
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,719
Come clean now.
Where does it come from?

237
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,000
So you want to remain silent?

238
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,200
Fine, I'll report to Mr. Xu now.

239
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,320
Xu Nian!

240
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,719
You cheeky bastard!

241
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,039
Why did you steal my sweater?

242
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,880
This belongs to you?

243
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,719
Yes, Lei Na.
Don't let him off the hook!

244
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,599
My best friend gave this sweater to me.

245
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
I washed it once in Bay House

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,719
and somehow it disappeared.

247
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,679
So it's in your closet.

248
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,840
I've been looking for it.

249
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,400
Who knows

250
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,039
the polite and shy Xu Nian

251
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,359
is actually someone like this.

252
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,239
Lei Na!

253
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,440
I can't stay here anymore.

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,039
From the security guards to Xu Nian,

255
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,599
everyone is after my beauty.

256
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,159
No, we're the exception.

257
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,200
Don't drag us in.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
So this sweater is yours.

259
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,359
Yes.

260
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Put it on then.

261
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,840
Look! It fits.

262
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,200
Why does it look so baggy?

263
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,400
You're old-fashioned, Lei Na.

264
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,919
This is oversize.
It's the current trend now.

265
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,599
Why did you steal her sweater then,
Xu Nian?

266
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,799
Perhaps I took it by mistake
when I was collecting the laundry.

267
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,599
Isn't this odd, Mr. Xu?

268
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,559
Jiang Kele is the only girl in the room.

269
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,000
Is this the so-called love triangle?

270
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,960
I thought about it too.

271
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,440
But based on my observation,

272
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,760
Jiang Kele and Xu Nian

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,960
don't interact often with each other.

274
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,520
Took it by mistake, huh?

275
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,400
Be extra careful then.

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,080
We don't need
unnecessary misunderstanding here.

277
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,000
Now that everything is clear,

278
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,159
we should let bygone be bygone.

279
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,000
Rest well.

280
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Jiang Kele.

281
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,599
Please forget about this.

282
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,599
It was just a mistake.

283
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,359
If Lei Na weren't here,

284
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,719
you'd be done for.

285
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,680
Open your eyes

286
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,239
when you collect the laundry
next time, okay?

287
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,319
Sure.

288
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,760
So it's a love triangle.

289
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,400
We thought Lu Xiao

290
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,959
was the one to cause
Xu Nian's emotional data

291
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,119
to fluctuate.

292
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,079
But in fact, it's Jiang Kele

293
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,479
who destabilized the emotion
of these two guys.

294
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:41,800
This Jiang Kele

295
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,560
looks small but is capable of
so many things.

296
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I can't wait

297
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,199
to see what will happen next.

298
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,959
Mr. Xu, do you think Jiang Kele

299
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,319
will pick the fiery Lu Xiao

300
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,959
or the gentle Xu Nian?

301
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,079
Will both guys fight

302
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,079
for her?

303
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,640
I can't wait to hear

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,439
any new development from the Bay House.

305
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,199
Don't get too excited.

306
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,920
I shall remind you that

307
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,280
the data we have now is almost perfect.

308
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,160
Once we reach that stage,

309
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,239
everything will be over.

310
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,800
Don't treat this like a TV series.

311
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,640
You know very well that

312
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,319
there won't be a happy ending.

313
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,800
So in the end, they have to separate.

314
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,119
What a tear-jerking love triangle.

315
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:52,920
Kele.

316
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,239
What's with the sweater incident today?

317
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,319
It's not yours, is it?

318
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,359
You're smart.

319
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,800
You came to realize something
even Lei Na

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,920
failed to.

321
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
So who does it belong to?

322
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,800
It belongs to my best friend.

323
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,199
Why is your best friend's sweater

324
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,800
in Xu Nian's closet?

325
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,479
Okay, I'll tell you one big secret.

326
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,199
Whenever Xu Nian

327
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,359
sneaked out,

328
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,479
he went to see my best friend.

329
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,800
I paired them up.

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,359
So that's what he meant by

331
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:21,959
"important matter".

332
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,319
They are now in the honeymoon phase.

333
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,319
They want to hang out together
all the time.

334
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,199
Look, Xu Nian just left.

335
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,439
By the way,

336
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,199
I gave the teddy bear to your mom today.

337
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,359
How is she?

338
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,959
She's not that well.

339
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
When I was there,
she was in the emergency room.

340
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,319
I waited till
her condition was stabilized,

341
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,119
then I gave her the teddy bear
before going back.

342
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,359
Also,

343
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,079
she asked me to give you this.

344
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,119
Lu Xiao,

345
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,920
were they your parents?

346
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,280
The dog beside them was so cute.

347
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,839
I remember you mentioned it once.

348
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,040
What was its name?

349
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't remember.

350
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,280
It's already dead

351
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,719
before I can even remember anything.

352
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,079
It's okay, Lu Xiao.

353
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,880
We'll raise a dog together
in the future.

354
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,040
Sorry, I'm late.

355
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,520
What happened?

356
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,640
You forgot your sweater.

357
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
Lei Na did a spot check today

358
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,119
and she found out.

359
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,239
And then?

360
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,760
Jiang Kele came
to diffuse the situation.

361
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,160
She said that I stole her clothes.

362
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,479
Only she could come up
with such an idea.

363
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,079
Thank god she didn't notice the phone.

364
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,520
Or else I'll be punished again.

365
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,839
Punished?

366
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,319
What kind of punishment?

367
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,319
Corporal punishment?

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
Worse than that.

369
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,040
Lu Xiao sneaked out once.

370
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,280
Mr. Xu tied him up
and left him in the swimming pool.

371
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,760
Lu Xiao is afraid of water, you see.

372
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,760
They enjoy handing out punishment

373
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
based on our phobia.

374
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,160
Have you been punished before?

375
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,680
I follow the rules.

376
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,560
Can you tell me

377
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,400
how you got into the Bay House?

378
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,359
I was abandoned when I was born.

379
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,119
Mr. Xu adopted me.

380
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,359
Adopted?

381
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,359
Mr. Xu adopted me

382
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,640
and gave me the training
to nurture my talents.

383
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,520
From different languages,
different cultures,

384
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,719
liberal arts,

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,040
to music, literature, creative arts,

386
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,280
and even culinary skills.

387
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,239
Mr. Xu is very strict,

388
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,400
so I'm used to it by now.

389
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,920
I have to get full marks for everything,
do everything properly,

390
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,520
or else he won't be satisfied.

391
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,160
When I grew older,

392
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,920
he asked me to sign a contract.

393
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,839
He'd provide me food and accommodation

394
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,680
but in exchange, I'll have to provide

395
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,880
data for his game.

396
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,319
There's also one more rule.

397
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Never leave the Bay House.

398
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,760
Like forever?

399
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,880
Not necessarily.

400
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,520
The contract says that I can leave
once I become an adult.

401
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,719
But you're an adult now.

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,239
Mr. Xu told me later that

403
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,400
his game still required some data,

404
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,880
so we renewed the contract.

405
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,880
And you agreed to it?

406
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,160
You never felt that it's odd

407
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,640
and wanted to leave?

408
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,239
Never.

409
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,599
I've never thought about leaving.

410
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:17,000
But ever since I met you,

411
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,719
I felt very attracted

412
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,239
to the outside world.

413
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,400
Xu Nian.

414
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,359
Has it ever occurred to you that

415
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,319
the contract is illegal

416
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,479
and Xu Guanghan has been lying to you?

417
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,439
Think about it.

418
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,920
If it's just to collect
your emotional data,

419
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
why does he have to

420
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
isolate all of you?

421
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,119
I thought about that too recently,

422
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,319
but I couldn't find the answer.

423
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,640
The success of Xu Guanghan

424
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,119
and the critical acclaims

425
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,119
of Love Boys

426
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,000
among all AR games

427
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,760
are all thanks to the four of you.

428
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,959
It's only with your emotional data
and motion capture that

429
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,560
Y4 feels like a real soul

430
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
who can resonate with every user.

431
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,520
Yet Xu Guanghan told everyone that

432
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,920
it's all AR technology.

433
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,839
Do you know what this means?

434
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,239
It means he is lying to everyone.

435
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,520
He's lying to the four of you.

436
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,160
With that in mind,

437
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,199
why would he expose all of you?

438
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,199
You guys are his trump cards,
and his Achilles' heel.

439
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,359
That's why he has to hide you,

440
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,920
imprison all of you
in the Bay House forever.

441
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,359
Imprison?

442
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,439
He'll imprison all of you

443
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,439
for his own gains.

444
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,239
So

445
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,839
you plan to reveal to the public

446
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,079
the information you withhold

447
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,280
to drag down Mr. Xu?

448
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes.

449
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,520
I already have

450
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
the photo evidence that proves
all four of you exist.

451
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,359
If I release it,

452
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,880
Xu Guanghan won't be able
to maintain his deception.

453
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Why haven't you done that then?

454
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,760
Because of you.

455
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,599
Xu Guanghan is cold-blooded.

456
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,079
I'm worried that once I do that,

457
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,680
he'll come to harm you.

458
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,640
That's why I'm hesitant to do it.

459
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:08,599
Therefore,
you showed me the outside world

460
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,520
so that I can make my own decision.

461
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,520
Whatever your decision is,

462
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,719
I will respect it.

463
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:43,280
Sorry, can you give me more time?

464
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,439
I have to think it over.

465
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,060
(Xu Nian)

466
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,920
Busy?

467
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,239
You again.

468
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,680
Why? Can't I visit you?

469
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,599
What brought you here?

470
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,920
I lost my motorbike.

471
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,959
I don't have the money

472
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,439
to lend you so that
you’ll get another one now.

473
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,680
No.

474
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,479
You asked me why I ran here

475
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,000
and I said I lost my motorbike.

476
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,719
Hence, I "ran" to here.

477
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,719
So what brought you here?

478
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,800
I want to confess my love to Lu Xiao

479
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,560
and I'd like to ask you how to do it.

480
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,319
You know,
like what you did with Xu Nian.

481
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,520
Sorry to disappoint you then.

482
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,319
I can't give you any tips.

483
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,400
Why?

484
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,520
Because I've never confessed to him.

485
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,319
But you guys are together!

486
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,040
It was a mutual feeling.
We feel it.

487
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,520
No need for confession whatsoever.

488
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
If you don't confess, how do you guys
know each other's feelings?

489
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,680
I said "I miss you".

490
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,880
He said "I got a feeling for you".

491
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,319
Isn't that confession?

492
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,040
See?

493
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,439
Told you I can't give you any tips.

494
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,560
Fine then. I won't confess.

495
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,119
I'll stay with him like that.

496
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,959
He's already my boyfriend anyway.

497
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:55,040
Wake up, Jiang Kele.

498
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,439
Your "boyfriend", Lu Xiao,

499
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,839
who dotes on you everyday
is a virtual character.

500
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,680
As for the real one,
even if you worship him everyday,

501
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,640
and idolize him

502
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,880
like a die-hard fan,

503
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,199
he still doesn't care about you.

504
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,520
I disagree.
The real Lu Xiao has changed.

505
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,119
I pinched his face the other day
and he was smiling at me.

506
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,439
So you called him your boyfriend.
Does he know that?

507
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
That's why I'm here. I'm lost.

508
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,719
I want to ask you

509
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,040
if I should confess to him.

510
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,599
I'm all for confession.

511
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,839
But you should know that,

512
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,599
even though his personality can change,

513
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,680
it won't be so drastic that

514
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,880
he'd confess to you himself.

515
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,839
If you want to be together with him,

516
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,680
you have to be proactive.

517
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
I know that.

518
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,079
Oh well.
Seems like I can't get any tips here.

519
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,760
I can't help you in that regard

520
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,719
but I have a question for you.

521
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,079
Say your confession is a success,

522
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,920
how do you plan
to maintain the relationship?

523
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,520
Are you going to

524
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,839
stay in the Bay House like you do now

525
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:52,640
or are you going to ask him
to move out

526
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,839
and stay at our place?

527
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,959
That can do!

528
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,000
And then,

529
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,599
Xu Nian and you will take a room.

530
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,160
Lu Xiao and I will take another.

531
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,160
The four of us will eat
and have fun every day.

532
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,760
It's like a dream coming true.

533
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,280
I'll ask Lu Xiao now.

534
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,400
Come in.

535
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,520
Ms. Guan.

536
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,599
Hi, Ms. Jiang.

537
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,359
I'll come back later then.

538
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,000
It's fine. She's not an outsider.

539
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,319
It's just a small thing.

540
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,000
This is the staff salary for this month.

541
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,000
Can you sign here?

542
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,520
Just a reminder.

543
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,160
The money

544
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
comes from the collateral loans
after you pledged your car and house.

545
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
If we can't repay in three months,

546
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,160
they will all be gone.

547
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,439
I'll take my leave now.

548
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Qianya.

549
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,119
You pledged your house?

550
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,560
What about us four then?

551
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,839
Don't worry.

552
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,719
I will always have a place for you.

553
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,239
And the boyfriends?

554
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,760
No need to think about that.
Go confess to him.

555
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:04,839
No.

556
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,719
I still have something to do
before the confession.

557
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,719
What thing?

558
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,719
Secret.

559
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,880
Oh my god!

560
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Granny.

561
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,800
You live in such a luxurious place!

562
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,800
Very extravagant.

563
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,760
Is that so?

564
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
It's the smallest

565
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
among all the houses I have.

566
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,199
Granny,

567
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,239
do you have an empty house
lying around then?

568
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,359
Too late. I sold them all.

569
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,000
Granny, do you want

570
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,880
to feel like you're in a big family?

571
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,560
How about this?

572
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,880
When my dad returns,

573
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,280
I'll ask him to move here.

574
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,439
I'll ask him to call you mom

575
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,640
and you will have a free son.

576
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,400
The three of us

577
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
will live like a normal,

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,359
ordinary family.

579
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,839
You will do our laundry and cook for us.

580
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,160
Then we'll be very picky

581
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,880
to let you experience the joy
of having a normal life.

582
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,640
Granny,

583
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
can you peel the tangerine for me?

584
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,640
Do you really think

585
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:50,319
I'm a gullible and vulnerable woman?

586
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,040
Fine then.

587
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,319
Enough for small talks.

588
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,199
So, where did the secret passage
come from?

589
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,400
Guess it.

590
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,719
Let me think...

591
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,079
The construction workers dug it.

592
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,520
It's not a tomb.

593
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
Emergency exit

594
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,119
when a fire breaks out.

595
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
A fire exit

596
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,160
cannot be this secretive, can it?

597
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,800
You dug it yourself then.

598
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,119
Granny,

599
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
you dug this secret passage

600
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,280
in order to steal

601
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
from the Bay House?

602
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,000
That's illegal!

603
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
Young lady.

604
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,400
Look at how wealthy I am.

605
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Why would I go through such a hassle

606
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,160
to commit a petty crime like this?

607
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,599
Tell me then.

608
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,800
Why did you dig it?

609
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,239
