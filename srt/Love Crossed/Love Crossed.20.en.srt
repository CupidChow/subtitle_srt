1
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,799
Kele,

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,879
why did you bring me here?

3
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,399
Do you remember when I told you

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,799
that my mom passed away
when I was a little kid?

5
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:36,759
Back then,

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,880
I would cry every day,
trying to find her.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,880
My dad would take me
on these hot air balloon rides.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,919
He told me that my mom
had gone up to the skies.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,319
And this was the closest
we could get to her.

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:49,759
He also told me

11
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:52,360
that I should write down anything
I wanted to say to her

12
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:53,439
on a piece of paper,

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,360
fold it into a paper airplane
and send it off into the skies.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,479
It would definitely reach her.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,159
Lu Xiao.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,599
Do you want to give it a try?

17
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,160
If you have anything

18
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,559
you want to tell your mom,

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
you can write it down.

20
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:10,160
I'm sure she'll be able to read it.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,440
Won't you give it a try?

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,519
(Mother,)

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
(it's me, Zhenyu.)

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,599
(Your son who doesn't know any better.)

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,760
(All these years,)

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,360
(I've always been missing you.)

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,919
(But it was only when I found out
that you were ill,)

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
(that I summoned up
the courage to see you.)

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,480
(I have so many things)

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
(that I want to tell you.)

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,959
(Thank you.)

32
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,199
(Mom.)

33
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,600
(When everyone else abandoned me,)

34
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,119
(you took me in.)

35
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,600
(You gave me a home.)

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,199
(Thank you.)

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,960
(For believing in me)

38
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,759
(when everyone else doubted me.)

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
(For never blaming me.)

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
(Thank you.)

41
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,240
(When I left home out
of a moment of rage,)

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
(you looked for me
for all those years.)

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,479
(And you never gave up.)

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
(I was always receiving your love,)

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,639
(but I never told you
how much I loved you.)

46
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,839
(I love you,)

47
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,160
(Mom.)

48
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,960
(Mom,)

49
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,919
(did you hear me?)

50
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,990
=Love Crossed=

51
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,130
=Episode 20=

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,799
Come on.

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
(Entrance)

54
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,000
Granny.

55
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,640
Why are you here?

56
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,760
I rushed over here

57
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,279
because I was worried
you wouldn't be able to find Lu Xiao.

58
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,000
Not only was I able to find him,

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,519
but I also took him
on a hot air balloon ride.

60
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,519
Don't worry. He's all right now.

61
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,760
Sorry for worrying you,

62
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,239
Grandma Fushun.

63
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh, right.
Before your mother passed away,

64
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
she asked me to give this to you.

65
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,880
I forgot about it.

66
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
What is it?

67
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:06,119
This used to be a teddy bear.

68
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,079
But it was cremated
along with your mother.

69
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,160
Before she passed away,

70
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,600
she wanted me to tell you,

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,359
that the teddy bear in your heart

72
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,279
has gone up to the skies with her.

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,559
She hoped that you'd be able

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,600
to let go of the knots in your heart

75
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,559
and live your life happily from now on.

76
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,959
Together with this silly girl here.

77
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,760
Why would she call me a silly girl?

78
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,799
I added that last line myself.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
All right. I'll be going now.

80
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,559

Lu Xiao hasn't come out for two days.

97
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,320
The Shizuren noodles Jiang Kele

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
bought for us are so good.

99
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,440
If he doesn't come out again,

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll have his share too.

101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Haven't you already eaten
all of his meals for the past two days?

102
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,559
I ate them because he didn't want to.

103
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,200
It's not like I stole his food.

104
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,919
Why don't you go and check on him?

105
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,200
We haven't seen him at all for two days.

106
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
It's kind of concerning.

107
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,760
Jiang Kele said that Lu Xiao
needs peace and quietness.

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,919
I don't think I should go
and bother him.

109
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,400
You're just scared of him.

110
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,280
Finish your food first.

111
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,760
I'll go check on him later.

112
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,640
How are you?

113
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,520
If you still don't feel any better,

114
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,799
we can ask for a day off
for you tomorrow.

115
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,919
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

116
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,640
Well, now that Lu Xiao is all right,

117
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,479
could I take his slot,

118
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,599
for a day off?

119
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,080
I think I might be sick tomorrow.

120
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,520
Then I think you better give it to me.

121
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,080
I fainted two days ago.

122
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,239
When did you faint?

123
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,520
He was freaked out by Jiang Kele.

124
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,919
Jiang Kele put on a makeup
when she came to work that day.

125
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
She was so pretty.

126
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,239
Su Lie freaked out.

127
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm still on edge.

128
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,840
I get anxious thinking she might
come to work looking like that again.

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
I think I should take two days off.

130
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Don't worry. She won't do that anymore.

131
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,000
How would you know that?

132
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,599
How would you know
even when he doesn't know it?

133
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,039
She dressed up like that because
she wanted to confess to someone.

134
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,599
Confess?

135
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
What are you doing?

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,880
Just packing
something delicious for Lu Xiao.

137
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,359
From all the things I brought him,

138
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,840
I think he likes the cakes the best.

139
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,359
So I thought I'd bring him
something sweet

140
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,400
to cheer him up.

141
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,239
Kele is all grown up now.

142
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,919
She knows how to take care
of others now.

143
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,119
I shall be treated the same

144
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,320
when I'm feeling down next time.

145
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,799
No need to wait for that.

146
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,919
I'll make it for you

147
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,559
whenever you want.

148
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,400
Okay. I'll show my love for you too.

149
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll drive you there.

150
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,159
Really? Are you free today?

151
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,039
Yes.

152
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:41,799
That's great.

153
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,880
I won't have to worry about my cake
getting squished in the subway then.

154
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,400
Come on.

155
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,159
Okay.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes!

157
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,440
Why did you drive me here?

158
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,280
I forgot that the Bay House
had a main entrance.

159
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,119
Well, it doesn't matter.
I can go in from here too.

160
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm off then.

161
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:52,000
When did they install lights here?

162
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,239
What's going on?

163
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
Is there a party at the Bay House today?

164
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,000
Why didn't I know about it?

165
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,220
♪Stay with me♪

Kele, I want to tell you something.

181
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,760
Before I met you,

182
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,400
I had always locked myself up

183
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,840
in a dark room.

184
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,840
Keeping everybody else out.

185
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,799
But your kindness,

186
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,280
bravery, intelligence, and cuteness

187
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,679
opened a window for me.

188
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,959
You let the sunlight

189
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,040
get into my heart.

190
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,520
Then how would you explain

191
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,880
that for the past ten years or so,

192
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
Mr. Xu, Lei Na, and Grandma Fushun

193
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,319
have all been alive and well?

194
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,119
And me!

195
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,520
And the three of them too.

196
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
We see each other every day,

197
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,119
and they're all alive and well.

198
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,400
So the fact is

199
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,839
that you're not cursed.

200
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,359
It's all an accident. A coincidence.

201
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,199
It's not something

202
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,640
you have to blame yourself for
and stay away from us,

203
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
understand?

204
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Only dummies

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,760
would shoulder
the blame for everything

206
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,479
that happened to them
all by themselves.

207
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,920
Only dummies

208
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,479
would keep silent
even when they've been wronged

209
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,760
and mistaken.

210

don't keep everything

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
to yourself.

213
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,400

I'm right here.

255
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,400
Oh, so you've already
prepared your "apology".

256
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,880
What "apology"? For getting you drunk?

257
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,719
For your crime!

258
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,719
Crime? What did I do wrong?

259
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,239
You're my best friend.

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,079
Yet you colluded with those four guys.

261
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,319
You had me receive my love confession

262
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,400
like this! Without dressing up!

263
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Tell me. Are you not guilty?

264
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,839
What was that, huh?

265
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,719
What?

266
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,959
How dare you not tell me.

267
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,160
How dare you not tell me...

268
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,520
Stop! Stop!

269
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,319
Do you think I don't know you?

270
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,800
You think I'm guilty

271
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,119
because I didn't tell you about it.

272
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
But if I had told you about it,

273
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,760
you'd be going like,

274
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,839
"Guan Qianya! You ruined the surprise!"

275
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,439
"You spoiled it for me!"

276
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,560
What would I be then?

277
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,000
Guilty of maximum punishment!

278
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,760
So tell me. What was I supposed to do

279
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,680
as your best friend?

280
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,640
I had to carry this "accusation" with me

281
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,439
to make sure it was a surprise for you.

282
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,839
I am so happy!

283
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
Qianya, I'm so happy right now!

284
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,040
I have a boyfriend,

285
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,680
and I didn't lose my best friend!

286
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,479
Come!

287
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,079
Kele,

288
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,599
you didn't let me down at all.

289
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,239
You were on the wrong path for so long,

290
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,599
but you finally turned around

291
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,719
and started dating in real life.

292
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,520
It makes me think

293
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,239
that most women can still be saved.

294
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Qianya, tonight, we won't care
about those women.

295
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,719
It's all about ourselves tonight.

296
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,479
Here.

297
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,680
For my love.

298
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,119
Another toast!

299
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,239
A toast to that!

300
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,119
However, Kele,

301
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,160
I have to warn you.

302
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,719
Even though you've stopped
playing that game,

303
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,760
you were too indulged back then.

304
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,319
You must never

305
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,000
treat the real Lu Xiao the same way

306
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,040
you interacted with the virtual Lu Xiao

307
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,959
understand?

308
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,640
I understand.

309
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,359
You're trying to tell me

310
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,959
not to have too high expectations

311
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,280
for the Lu Xiao in real life.

312
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
Because he is completely different

313
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
from the virtual character.

314
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,119
He won't obey my every command

315
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,680
and he won't pamper me
as much as that character did,

316
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
right?

317
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,000
And they've been living

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,239
in the Bay House for so long.

319
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,800
They've never been in contact
with other women,

320
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
neither have they ever been in love.

321
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
Of course they wouldn't know
anything about romance.

322
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,680
Take today's confession for example.

323
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,359
It took forever and for all of us
to put our minds together

324
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,680
just to plan it.

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
So you might be disappointed

326
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,079
if you have expectations.

327
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,319
Don't worry.

328
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,400
I can tell the difference
between the virtual world and reality.

329
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,119
I'd already

330
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,719
broken up with the virtual "Lu Xiao"

331
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:09,760
before I wanted to
confess my love in real life.

332
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,839
Way to go, Jiang Kele.

333
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:14,640
You even made sure
to give a proper ending for your game.

334
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,079
It's a farewell as well.

335
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,599
I am saying goodbye

336
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,239
to that virtual world.

337
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,880
I'm going to have

338
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,400
a normal romance in real life.

339
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,000
All right.
I'll give you and Lu Xiao my blessing.

340
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,239
I hope that both of you will have
a good start and a good end as well.

341
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,479
Guan Qianya.

342
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,040
Is that the way
to give someone your blessing?

343
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,479
All right. I'll re-do it.

344
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,160
Listen to this.

345
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,439
A brand new TAILG motorbike.

346
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,119
I... This...

347
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,880
I was going to check
the hospital for it again!

348
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,359
Qianya, you're...

349
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,760
Here.

350
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,280
In that case,

351
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,800
I hope that you and Xu Nian
will grow old happily together.

352
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,599
Thank you, Qianya!

353
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,060
(The Colorist)
(Lu Xiao)

354
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,439
Qiqi, you're fired!

355
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,040
You scared me, Kele.

356
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,079
Oh, you.

357
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,000
Playing the game at work?

358
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,520
I didn't play any games.

359
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,719
I was just eating my snacks.

360
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Oh, you didn't?

361
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
Give it up. We're all veterans
when it comes to the game.

362
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,800
I could tell what you were doing
from first sight.

363
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, if that's the case,

364
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,479
then you should understand.

365
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,160
There aren't any customers here.

366
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,839
What else am I supposed to do?

367
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,479
I used to understand.

368
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,800
But now I don't.

369
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,959
I've leveled up.

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,199
Did you get a promotion?

371
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Mentally.

372
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm giving up

373
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,719
on virtual characters and games.

374
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,839
From today onward,

375
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,920
I'll be focusing

376
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,959
on a real, honest, and normal romance.

377
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,680
You're in love?

378
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,640
With who?

379
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:31,959
Well...

380
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,239
I can't tell you that right now.

381
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
But don't worry.

382
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
One day,

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,959
I'll let you meet him.

384
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,520
I hope you won't get startled then.

385
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,839
Startled?

386
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,959
How ugly is he?

387
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,760
He's not ugly. He's super handsome!

388
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,040
Now I'm curious.

389
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,959
How handsome does this guy have to be

390
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,800
to get you give up on Lu Xiao?

391
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,719
No, no, no. I never gave up on Lu Xiao.

392
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I only gave up on the game.

393
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,119
Qiqi, I advise you to do the same.

394
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,359
You should find someone in real life

395
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,359
and date them instead.

396
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,760
Don't play that game anymore.

397
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,199
As if it's that easy.

398
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,199
If everyone could find love
in real life,

399
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
why would they play the game?

400
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400
Just you wait.

401
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,839
I might introduce someone
to you someday.

402
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,520
Okay. I'll be waiting then.

403
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,400
Leave it to me.

404
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,420
(TAILG)

405
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,640
Hold... Hold it right there!

406
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,359
Who are you?

407
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,319
This is a private property.

408
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,040
You can't just come in here.

409
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,760
Bro, it's still me.

410
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,319
How can you not tell?

411
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,880
You're Jiang Kele!

412
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,359
I have to say,

413
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,359
you dressed up too nicely
the day before yesterday.

414
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,680
It completely wiped out

415
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
my image of you.

416
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,560
But today, you went back
to the look you used to have.

417
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,119
Along with your motorbike.

418
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,839
I didn't recognize you at all.

419
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,479
And you call yourselves security guards

420
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,640
with this eyesight?

421
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,239
It's no wonder people can sneak out
from here.

422
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,599
You mean...

423
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,560
You have a better job recommendation
for both of us?

424
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,280
We'll be happy for that!

425
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,959
Oh, dear.

426
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
We're not on the same page here either.

427
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,640
Have a nice day now, Kele.

428
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
Have fun at work!

429
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,239
See you.

430
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,160
What's going on?

431
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,319
Who did my job for me?

432
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,680
Is granny back?

433
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,319
Or did they hire a new janitor?

434
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,119
No way.

435
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,319
Am I about to lose my job
when I just got my romance?

436
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,479
It's quite clean too.

437
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,479
It's true.

438
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,560
When the heavens give you romance,

439
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,199
they take away your career.

440
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,079
Don't be panic, Jiang Kele.

441
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,920
Find that person

442
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,560
and battle with him.

443
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,920
I say, fellow...

444
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,719
Su Lie? Luo Ke?

445
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,280
Why are you guys cleaning the pool?
Get up here, quick.

446
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,839
We didn't just clean the pool.

447
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,359
We tidied the rooms,

448
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,479
we watered the flowers
and washed the clothes too.

449
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,800
What are you trying to do?
Take away my job?

450
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,239
Do you think I wanted to do this?

451
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,079
Lu Xiao made us do it.

452
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,560
He said from now on

453
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,439
we have to clean our own room

454
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,680
and wash our own clothes

455
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,280
and dishes.

456
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,239
Why do we have to do our own chores

457
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,959
just because they're dating now?

458
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:38,959
That's right.

459
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,439
Su Lie asked,

460
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,959
why do we have to do our own chores

461
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,359
just because you guys are dating now?

462
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,119
I heard you. I heard you.

463
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,920
Kele.

464
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,920
You won't have to do all these
from now on.

465
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,280
He's right. We've been living
in the Bay House for so long.

466
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,680
We should learn to rely on ourselves.

467
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't. I'll feel guilty

468
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,880
if I do nothing but rest all day.

469
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:58,959
You don't have to feel that way.

470
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,839
You've been working for so long.

471
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
You deserve a break.

472
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,920
Plus, we won't tell Xu Guanghan.

473
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,359
Lu Xiao, I know
you want to be nice to me.

474
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,280
But I am getting paid, after all.

475
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,800
You have to leave something
for me to do.

476
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,439
Isn't that right, boys?

477
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,479
Yes.

478
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,640
All right.

479
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,199
From now on,
you only need to clean my room.

480
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,160
No. What gives?

481
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,199
What gives?

482
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,000
Because she's my girlfriend.
