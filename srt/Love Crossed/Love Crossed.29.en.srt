1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,239
If what the investors said today

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,359
hurt you,

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,439
don't take it to heart.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,880
That's how they are.

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,319
You'll probably meet them only once
in a lifetime.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,200
You won't come across them anymore.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,799
They didn't get to me.

8
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,680
I just came out from Bay House.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,879
Meeting all these weird people

10
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,719
is quite interesting.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,000
Even funny, maybe.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,560
That's how the world is.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,159
There are all kinds of people.

14
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,319
Qianya.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,439
I thought of talking you round.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,639
We should do it step by step.

17
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:48,959
We'll surely find investors.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,360
Don't worry about me.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,319
I've seen all kinds of people.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,319
There was this guy, Mr. Zhang,

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,959
who invited me to his place

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,279
and prepared a meal for me.

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,599
On the face of it, he wanted to invest,

24
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,559
but he actually wanted me
out of the company.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,680
I didn't take it to heart.

26
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,839
Since we decided
to start our own business,

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,040
it is indeed a tough task.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,239
Didn't you say that

29
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,839
no matter how difficult things are,

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,040
just have drink

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,120
and things will be fine
when you wake up the next day, right?

32
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,639
Here.

33
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,760
No matter how tough it is,

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,720
I'll always stay by your side.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
Let's have another glass.

36
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,190
=Love Crossed=

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,330
=Episode 29=

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,780
(Unit 1, Building 6)

39
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,360
Lu Xiao, why are you sitting here?

40
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,839
I just got off work
and forgot to bring the key.

41
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,360
I have mine.

42
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,360
Kele.

43
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,119
Did you go to pick me up again?

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
You wish!

45
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,279
How can I possibly do that every day?

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I went to the market

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,639
to do some grocery shopping.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,759
By the way, how was work today?

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Did it go well?

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,519
Not bad.

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm starting to get used to it.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,559
It's just a little tiring.

53
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,320
It's all right.

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
If you're tired,

55
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,239
just get some good rest

56
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,119
and do nothing at all.

57
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,559
I'll make you some great food.

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,079
Also...

59
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,359
If you forget to bring your keys again,

60
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,679
just tell me.

61
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,119
It's so cold out here.

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,000
Let me carry it for you.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,559
Okay.

64
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,079
Since my first day of venture,

65
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,920
I have thought
about various endings.

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,519
Bankruptcy is one of them.

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,279
But the company went bankrupt

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,959
because of us.

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,279
Xu Nian, what are you talking about?

70
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,480
This is my choice.

71
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,799
I'll take responsibility
for my own choices.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,160
My company may have closed down,

73
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,799
and I've lost my assets.

74
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,200
But the four of you are free now.

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
As long as the four of you

76
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,920
live well in the real world,

77
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,320
there's no regret now.

78
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,959
Losing everything

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
might be a good start too.

80
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,920
(So Qianya has been
putting a tough front)

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,359
(so that I wouldn't worry.)

82
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,440
(Qianya, I'm sorry.)

83
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,760
(I'm such a fool.)

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,760
(I just realized the pain
that you carry in your heart.)

85
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,679
(I hope that someday)

86
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,359
(you can stop putting up a tough front
in front of me.)

87
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,959
Where did Xu Nian go?

88
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,320
I haven't seen you for a few days,
and you've changed a lot.

89
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,119
The outside world

90
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,880
is not as safe as Bay House,

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,679
because it will cause you pain.

92
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,959
Take the ultraviolet rays for instance.

93
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,399
You have a deep tan

94
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,839
only after a few days out here.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,679
I brought you a little gift.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's the base cream
that I've been using for years.

97
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,079
Remember to apply it
when you go out next time.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,079
I appreciate the favor.

99
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,640
But we should just get down to business.

100
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,959
Where is the investor
I asked you to find?

101
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,880
When can I meet him?

102
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,920
Chill. I'll let you meet him.

103
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,679
But it gives me mixed feelings now.

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,359
I didn't expect you

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,799
to come and see me

106
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,239
right after I texted you.

107
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,359
What's more surprising

108
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,160
is that we would one day

109
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,920
come together and talk business.

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,160
Does Guan Qianya know

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,799
that you came to see me?

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,079
Does Xu Guanghan know

113
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,519
that you came to see me?

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,519
Perhaps or perhaps not.

115
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,640
I know.

116
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,959
Xu Guanghan sent you here, right?

117
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,000
That's not important.

118
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,600
The thing is

119
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,119
if you can find investors

120
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,119
for your new project with Guan Qianya?

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,760
Mr. Xu asked me to pass a message.

122
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,000
Although you keep letting him down,

123
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,959
you're his son after all.

124
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,239
He doesn't want you to suffer out here,

125
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,960
nor does he want to watch you
falling into despair.

126
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,799
As a father,

127
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
he just wants to help you.

128
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
On one condition.

129
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,400
He wants you to go to him personally,

130
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,159
apologize to him
and admit your mistakes.

131
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,599
Do you think it's possible?

132
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,679
Why are you so stubborn?

133
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:51,919
Fine.

134
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,359
I have only one question for you.

135
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,359
Do you really love Guan Qianya?

136
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,400
Of course.

137
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,440
If you really love her,

138
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,559
how can you bear

139
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,919
to let her fall into despair

140
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,559
and be humiliated over and over again?

141
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,679
She bears all the pain and suffering,

142
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,039
while she forces a smile
in front of you.

143
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,719
Can't you let go of your pride

144
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,080
and apologize to your father

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,000
for her sake?

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
As long as you are willing to do it,

147
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,719
Mr. Xu will invest in Guan Qianya

148
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,159
under someone else's name.

149
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,960
Then Guan Qianya can
be out of the woods.

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
That way,

151
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
your life will be better.

152
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Also,

153
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,080
it would be kept
between the three of us.

154
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,599
Guan Qianya will never find out.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,200
You keep saying that you love her.

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,200
Are you not willing
to make a little sacrifice?

157
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,799
(Where have you been?)

158
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,640
(We have to pack our things today)

159
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,960
(and move to Grandma Fushun's house.)

160
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,640
Why are you here?

161
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,719
I heard you're broke.

162
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,359
So I dropped by to visit you.

163
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,919
You're not here to see me.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
You came to make fun of me.

165
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
That's exactly what I'm doing.

166
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,080
Ever since you lied to me,

167
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,840
I've been doing that.

168
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
You went from a female CEO,

169
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,520
a spiritual leader,

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,119
to where you are today.

171
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,880
You lost your house and your company.

172
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,200
You're now looking for investors,

173
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
but no one wants to invest in you.

174
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,119
Serves you right.

175
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,440
Qi Chuan, you're a washed-up singer.

176
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,799
You actually have so much time

177
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
to come here
and try to get under my nerves.

178
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm not here to do that.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,799
I sympathize with you.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,799
You went around in circles,
but you ended up with nothing.

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
Says who?

182
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,479
I got the four of them out.

183
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,080
They are free now.

184
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,159
That's what I want.

185
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
Guan Qianya.

186
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,200
Who are you fooling?

187
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,719
Are they really free now?

188
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,520
Su Lie and Luo Ke

189
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,080
are being photographed

190
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
like monkeys in the zoo.

191
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,039
That's their own choice.

192
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
It has nothing to do with me.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
Fine.

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,479
If so,

195
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,520
let's talk about something
that concerns you.

196
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,159
Your best friend's boyfriend, Lu Xiao.

197
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,840
How is he now?

198
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
He's doing great.

199
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,919
He can perfectly adapt
to the outside world.

200
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,840
He's now a celebrity instructor

201
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,039
in the dance studio.

202
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,719
A celebrity instructor?

203
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
He used his looks

204
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,559
to get himself a job.

205
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,799
But he has been fired.

206
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
Ask Jiang Kele if you don't believe me.

207
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,039
Let's talk about your beloved boyfriend,
Xu Nian.

208
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,599
If he hadn't left with you,

209
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,559
he would have been the CEO of Yao Inc.

210
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,119
Even if he wasn't the CEO,

211
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,119
he could be a star,

212
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,960
who is so superior
and lives a worry-free life.

213
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,479
But because of you,

214
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,960
a cunning woman,

215
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
who seduced and brainwashed him

216
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
into breaking off relations
with Xu Guanghan

217
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,119
and left him destitute.

218
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,200
Xu Nian doesn't need that kind of life.

219
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,000
Only a vain person like you

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,719
wants such a life.

221
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,000
Right.

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,719
How noble is he?

223
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,919
All he wants is to be with you.

224
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,640
To help you get investors,

225
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,239
he's now going down on his knees
begging Xu Guanghan.

226
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,719
What nonsense is this?

227
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
Is it nonsense?

228
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,000
Guan Qianya.

229
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,799
You're really something.

230
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,640
In order to please you,

231
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
a man is willing to be humiliated
as such.

232
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,960
What have you given him?

233
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,880
Shut up.

234
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,799
Well, I insist to say it.

235
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,799
Guan Qianya.

236
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,679
Anyone who's close to you
will be down on their luck.

237
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,000
You caused your dad's death

238
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,080
and Xu Nian will be the next.

239
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
What are you trying to do?

240
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,799
Get lost.

241
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,080
Hello?

242
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,080
May I know

243
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,039
if you need a part-timer?

244
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,919
I have great experience

245
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,479
and I'm willing to do anything.

246
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,400
Sure.

247
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,080
Call me if there's a vacancy.

248
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,359
I wonder how Lu Xiao is doing.

249
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,840
Jiang Kele.

250
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,640
I'm here to expose you!

251
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,479
Expose me?

252
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,320
What is it?

253
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,039
Didn't you say
Lu Xiao is your boyfriend?

254
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,719
Yes.

255
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,719
And that he's a piano teacher?

256
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,039
You're a liar.

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,159
The real Lu Xiao

258
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,799
is washing dishes on the street!

259
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,640
I took a picture. See for yourself.

260
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:19,840
Look.

261
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,880
That's not possible.

262
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,239
It can't be him.

263
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,119
Why not?

264
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,679
I recognized him right away.

265
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,280
Go see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

266
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,599
Right in that small alley.

267
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,039
Why are there still so many to go?

268
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,039
You're so slow!

269
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,880
Sorry, I'll speed up.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,039
Can you do it or not?

271
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,840
If not, just get lost!

272
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Yes, I can do it.

273
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,239
Do it fast!

274
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,239
Xu Nian, hold on.

275
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,559
Mr. Xu said

276
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,239
he's very pleased with your apology.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
He has arranged for the investors

278
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,440
to contact Guan Qianya.

279
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,919
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

280
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Guan Qianya is a lucky girl

281
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,119
to be loved by you.

282
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,239
I hope she'll cherish it.

283
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,039
And I hope you two
will be happy together.

284
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,760
Qianya, why are you here?

285
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,719
I could ask you the same.

286
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,039
Why were you at Xu Guanghan's house?

287
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,119
Let's talk at home.

288
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,280
Get things straight now.

289
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,080
Did you come to see Xu Guanghan?

290
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,080
Someone called me earlier

291
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,200
and told me he wanted to invest
in our project.

292
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,599
Did you beg your father for this?

293
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,239
Qianya, don't be mad.

294
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,520
I did go to see Xu Guanghan

295
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,000
to apologize to him.

296
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,599
But I have my reason for that.

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,479
I don't want you

298
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,320
to go around begging people.

299
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,280
I don't want you

300
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,440
to be humiliated over and over again.

301
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,320
Qianya.

302
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,599
I really don't want to see you

303
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,039
get hurt in any ways.

304
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,359
You know what, Xu Nian?

305
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,880
Whatever the reason is,

306
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,520
coming to see Xu Guanghan

307
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,320
has rendered

308
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,760
all our efforts futile.

309
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,199
It's fine if we couldn't beat him,

310
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,760
if my company went bankrupt,

311
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,400
or if my assets were gone.

312
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,199
I don't care
if I can't find any investors!

313
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,680
Even if we had no fixed residence
or lived in poverty,

314
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,599
I wouldn't think that we have lost,

315
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,719
because we didn't lose our dignity!

316
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,400
But the moment

317
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,199
you bowed down to Xu Guanghan,

318
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,000
we have utterly failed!

319
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,880
Qianya, I get what you're saying.

320
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,239
Dignity is important!

321
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,239
But what matters more than...

322
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,800
As compared to dignity,

323
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,359
I don't want to see you hurt.

324
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,719
I know.

325
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,119
You won't understand my action.

326
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,400
But please believe me.

327
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
This is my way of loving you.

328
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,040
I'd rather not have it then.

329
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,839
You've let me down, Xu Nian.

330
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,520
If I knew we would come to this,

331
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,719
and you would end up as such,

332
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,319
I'd rather not meet you

333
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,880
or be with you right from the start!

334
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:19,719
That's right.

335
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,439
If I hadn't met you

336
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,119
or be together with you,

337
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,479
how would I end up this way?

338
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,439
Qianya.

339
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,640
Because of you,

340
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,479
I get to taste the pain
and happiness of love.

341
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
You taught me how to love someone

342
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,199
and how to make sacrifices.

343
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,880
But now, you're telling me

344
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
that you'd rather not want any of this.

345
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,439
So what's the meaning
of all the humiliation

346
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,560
that I've endured?

347
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,319
The humiliation that you endured

348
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,719
means nothing to me.

349
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,760
But it means something to your father!

350
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,760
He's using this

351
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,160
to destroy our relationship

352
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,280
and bring you back to his side.

353
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,719
You came to him today
for investment matters.

354
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,920
You'll come to him again

355
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,800
for something else!

356
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Just like that,

357
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,719
bit by bit, and finally,

358
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,479
you'll be back to his side.

359
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,800
You'd feel like you had no choice

360
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,199
and that your sacrifices

361
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,280
were so noble

362
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,560
because deep down,

363
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,959
you did it all for me!

364
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,040
Do you get it?

365
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Qianya.

366
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,119
Don't touch me!

367
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,199
I don't want to see you ever again!

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,839
Xu Nian.

369
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,560
Xu Nian.

370
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,119
Xu Nian.

371
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,680
Kele.

372
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,599
Kele.

373
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,520
Jiang Kele!

374
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,719
Your best friend's boyfriend, Lu Xiao.

375
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,079
He used his looks to get himself a job.

376
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,079
But he has been fired.

377
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,040
Ask Jiang Kele if you don't believe me.

378
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,520
Let's talk about
your beloved boyfriend, Xu Nian.

379
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,199
If he hadn't left with you,

380
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,239
he would have been the CEO of Yao Inc.

381
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,599
Even if he wasn't the CEO,

382
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,599
he could be a star,

383
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,400
who is so superior
and lives a worry-free life.

384
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,439
But because of you,

385
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,880
a cunning woman,

386
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,800
who seduced and brainwashed him

387
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,239
into breaking off relations
with Xu Guanghan

388
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,000
and left him destitute.

389
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
We're in the game.

390
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,560
Xu Guanghan trapped us in the game

391
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,880
so that

392
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,680
we would die without realizing it.

393
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,040
But I couldn't wake them up.
What do I do?

394
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,160
Mr. Xu, what's wrong?

395
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,160
Why is it that the betrayal
in human nature

396
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,079
can never change?

397
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,160
Didn't you already know it

398
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
decades ago?

399
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,719
Knowing it doesn't mean
I can understand it.

400
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Understanding it
doesn't mean acceptance.

401
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,560
You don't have to understand

402
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,000
or accept it.

403
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,479
No matter what,

404
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,640
they couldn't reach the perfection
that you wanted.

405
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,199
The thought of them

406
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,959
quietly leaving this world

407
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,160
makes me feel a little sentimental.

408
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,040
Do you know

409
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,199
what it means to me?

410
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,319
Your compassion.

411
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
To me, being sentimental

412
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,319
means that I'm not perfect.

413
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,520
This is the only weakness
in my human nature.

414
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,880
I hope I can overcome it

415
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,640
after all this.

416
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,560
Let's hope that

417
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,719
they can take away your weaknesses

418
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,400
as they quietly leave the world.

419
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,040
That way, your painstaking effort
of creating this artificial world

420
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,479
for them wouldn't be in vain.

421
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,520
I hope they can spend
their final moments

422
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,839
to the fullest in this game.

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,719
No.

424
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,000
That world

425
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,520
has not only happiness

426
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,359
but pain too.

427
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,319
Do you know why?

428
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,439
Well, I get why there's happiness.

429
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,920
Because they'll be immersed in it.

430
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,359
As for pain, I get that too.

431
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,959
That's because they betrayed you.

432
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,280
So they have to suffer from
torture and pain.

433
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,079
But the only thing I don't understand

434
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,160
is why both?

435
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
Because pain and happiness

436
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,719
make the real world.

437
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,359
Sorry, we've tried our best.

438
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
My condolences.

439
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,599
Qianya.

440
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,439
It's all my fault.

442
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,199
I shouldn't have gone
to see Xu Guanghan.

443
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,400
Qianya.

444
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,439
Don't scare me, please.

445
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,479
I can't live without you, Qianya.

446
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,280
Qianya.

447
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,719
Qianya.

448
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,119
Can you forgive me?

449
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,640
Can you open your eyes and look at me?

450
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,839
Qianya.

451
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,839
I can't live without you, Qianya.

452
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,920
Qianya, wake up!

453
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:26,839
Xu Nian.

454
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,280
Qianya!

455
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,680
Xu Nian.

456
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,239
That's enough!

457
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,000
Xu Nian!

458
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,680
That's enough!

459
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,599
Can you stop acting this way?

460
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,520
Qianya is dead!

461
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,839
She's not coming back!

462
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,040
What do I do? I've tried everything.

463
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,000
Right.

464
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,359
Get back into the game.

465
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,520
Xu Nian.

466
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,079
Kele, calm down.

467
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't worry. I'm not dead.

468
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,880
But I have something important

469
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
to tell you.

470
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,880
We're now in the game.

471
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,479
The game?

472
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, we're in the game.

473
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,280
The world we are in now

474
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,880
is a game designed by Xu Guanghan.

475
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
But in reality,

476
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,839
we're still in the data collection room

477
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,000
at Bay House.

478
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,479
Our vital signs

479
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,880
are dropping bit by bit!

480
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,800
So we have to get out of here!

481
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,079
Do you understand what I'm saying?

482
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,280
Qianya, I know

483
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,119
you probably...

484
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,000
You don't get it!

485
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Xu Nian, do you get it?

486
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,959
Do you get it, Lu Xiao?

487
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,119
We're now...

488
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:13,640
Doctor!

489
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,560
We're in the game!

490
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll get the doctor.

491
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,640
Calm down.

492
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
No, we have to get out of here!

493
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,040
Calm down.

494
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,800
That's right.

495
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,479
You just woke up.
So you're a little emotional.

496
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,060
(Inpatient Department)

497
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,880
Qianya, you're awake.

498
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,439
The doctor was here this morning

499
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,000
and said

500
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,920
they would do a brain CT scan for you.

501
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,560
If it's all good,

502
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,280
the therapy will start tomorrow.

503
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Xu Nian.

504
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm hungry.

505
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,439
Buy me something to eat.

506
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,359
Okay.

507
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll go now.

508
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,000
I'll go with you.

509
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,400
How do you feel?

510
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
