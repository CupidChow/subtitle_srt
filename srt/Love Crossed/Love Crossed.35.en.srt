1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,759
Lanlan!

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,319
Lanlan, why did you block me?

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,520
Didn't Guan Qianya say

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,119
that we shouldn't be in touch?

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,439
So I blocked you.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,040
Why are you here?

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
We are in trouble,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
and we need your help.

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,600
Do you know Mr. Zhang,

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,920
the janitor from the library?

11
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,920
Yes, why?

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,200
Do you know how to reach him?

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,120
No.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,639
Could you help us to ask around then?

15
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:28,879
We really do need to see him.
It's urgent.

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,319
I don't care
if you guys are lying or not.

17
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,240
I don't want to be a part of this.

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,759
If you don't leave,

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,720
I'll ask for help.

20
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,439
No, don't do that.

21
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,159
I promise you. It's not a scam.

22
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,759
If you're not willing to help,

23
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,880
it's all right then.

24
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,680
I won't bother you ever again.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,720
I'll go now.

26
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:02,680
Lanlan.

27
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,639
Here's your notebook.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,480
You left it in the library.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,959
It's fine. I have a new one.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,840
=Love Crossed=

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,980
=Episode 35=

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,199
Sir.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,839
Aren't you the young man from before?

34
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,600
Why are you alone today?

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,919
Where are your friends?

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,199
Sir, can you give me something to eat?

37
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,919
But I have no money.

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,080
I can work for you.

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,039
I'll talk to you another day.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,039
Lanlan, thank you for
keeping me company all night.

41
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,440
I promise you. It's not a scam.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,039
If you're not willing to help,

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,279
it's all right then.

44
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,520
I won't bother you ever again.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,559
Hello?

46
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,320
Hi, I'm Lanlan.

47
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,240
Do you remember Mr. Zhang?

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,039
Yes.

49
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,199
That's right.

50
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,399
Could you give me
his contact information?

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,399
Okay, let me check
and send it to you later.

52
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,399
Thank you.

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
It failed, right?

54
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,679
Su Lie, don't be upset.

55
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,640
We know you've tried your best.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,519
This is a mess

57
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,760
we made.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,839
We can't blame Lanlan.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,959
Forget it.

60
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,839
Let's go to the library
and look for evidence ourselves.

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,519
It's a risk worth taking

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
for the sake of the evidence.

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,799
I should go alone.

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,959
If I get caught,

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,359
you can keep looking for evidence.

66
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,480
No, you shouldn't act alone.

67
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,760
Also, no one
should be taking any more risks.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There's no need to act alone

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,119
or to take any risks.

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,679
Lanlan has unblocked me

71
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,320
and sent me Mr. Zhang's contact number.

72
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,900
(Mr. Zhang's contact number)

73
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,720
Here's your drink.

74
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,720
Thank you.

75
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,119
Excuse me.

76
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,600
Excuse me.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
Coming.

78
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,600
Two more of this,

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
and two more drinks, please.

80
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,959
Okay. Sure.

81
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,239
Thank you.

82
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,559
You find that girl pretty?

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,359
Feeling shy, huh?

84
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,279
Don't you think
you forgot something?

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
She hasn't paid yet.

86
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,320
Go after her now.

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,920
Okay.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,279
It's 12.5 yuan.

89
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,119
Got it.

90
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,679
Hey, there!

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,359
Did you call me?

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,000
You forgot to pay.

93
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,320
I left in a hurry.

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,239
Did you bring your phone?
I'll scan your code.

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
It's 12.5 yuan.

97
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Well.

98
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,200
May I add you on WeChat?

99
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,320
Sure. Well.

100
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,279
I'll scan your code.

101
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
I'll get going then.

103
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,279
I'll drop by next time.

104
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,279
Bye.

105
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,480
Bye.

106
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,880
(By the way, I forgot to ask you.)

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,839
(What's your name?)

108
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
(I'm Wang Jiaqi.)

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,799
(You can call me Qiqi.)

110
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,800
(I'm Luo Ke.)

111
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,720
Take a good look now.

112
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,519
This is not Luo Ke.

113
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,359
Get up!

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
I can't beat up the virtual Luo Ke
in the game.

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,320
But I can beat you, an impostor!

116
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,880
I told you. I'm not an impostor.

117
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm the real Luo Ke.

118
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,119
He sure dives deeply into his character.

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,480
Fine. Since you love being Luo Ke,

120
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,640
you can take the beating
in his stead then.

121
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,559
Why do you want to beat Luo Ke?

122
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,000
Because he deserves it!

123
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,359
(Hi, I'm Luo Wenxuan.)

124
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,780
(The Colorist)

125
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,660
(Highlight Player)

126
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,000
They've contacted

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,839
Mr. Zhang from the library
to arrange a meeting

128
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,640
at the abandoned factory
to hand over the evidence.

129
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,519
The spy is doing great.

130
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,519
He always sends us the updates.

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,679
Zhang Yang has sent his men over.

132
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
Once they have eyes on the evidence,

133
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,519
he'll act together
with the spy

134
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,519
and wipe them out.

135
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,040
You can go to the concert
with peace of mind

136
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,239
and announce our plan

137
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,359
for the beginning of a new era.

138
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,400
Don't let our guard down.

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,239
Tell Zhang Yang to keep us in the loop.

140
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,440
This is the place

141
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,599
where Brother Zhang asked to meet us.

142
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,239
He should be inside.

143
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,039
Let's check it out.

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Brother Zhang!

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Brother Zhang!

146
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,159
Brother Zhang!

147
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,559
Why don't I see Brother Zhang?

148
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm right here.

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,880
I thought skilled experts always
make an appearance from above.

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,080
Sorry to keep you waiting.

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,960
It's fine. We just got here.

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Brother Zhang.

153
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,039
What's the evidence?

154
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,440
It's the information of
your life experience.

155
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,200
Did Xu Guanghan rescue me

156
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,719
after I was trafficked?

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,520
No.

158
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,359
It was Xu Guanghan
who ordered for your abduction.

159
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:21,960
How about Luo Ke?

160
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,559
As for Luo Ke,

161
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,000
Xu Guanghan took him away
from his parents.

162
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,280
Here are your parents'

163
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,559
home addresses and contact information,

164
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,719
your birth certificate, et cetera.

165
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,559
There is the information

166
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,840
collected by Fushun over the years.

167
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,359
Hold on tight to it.

168
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,039
Report Xu Guanghan to the police.

169
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,359
Let me see.

170
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,159
Oh no, Xu Guanghan's men are here.

171
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,840
Who leaked out the information?

172
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,119
There's another spy among us?

173
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,479
That's impossible.

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,239
Xu Nian.

175
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,559
Why isn't it possible?

176
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,280
All of you did everything possible
to look for the spy,

177
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,159
as if you were playing house.

178
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,400
You even wronged Luo Ke

179
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
and kicked him out.

180
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,080
It didn't strike any of you

181
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,320
that I was the spy.

182
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,359
Do you remember now?

183
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,200
Fa Hua Road 29.

184
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,320
Yes.

185
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,880
Fa Hua Road 29.

186
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
Brilliant.

187
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,799
"Infernal Affairs."

188
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,840
There's more.

189
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,760
All of you are screwed.

190
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,239
Xu Nian!

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,919
Be careful!

192
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,320
Get them.

193
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Get lost.

194
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,159
We've been through

195
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,559
a lot together.

196
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,559
If you wanted

197
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,080
to side with Xu Guanghan,

198
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,320
why did you escape with us?

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
To mess with you.

200
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,679
Don't you think it's funny?

201
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,559
Guan Qianya.

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,679
When we were watching the fireworks
that night,

203
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,719
you cried when you ran towards me.

204
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,960
Do you know how ridiculous you looked?

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,280
Whenever you looked at me confidently,

206
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,599
I would wonder

207
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,559
how would this stupid woman

208
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,119
possibly take down Xu Guanghan?

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,719
So that's what you really think.

210
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,239
You've never been in love with me.

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,479
You were just using me, huh?

212
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,159
Using?

213
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,719
What do you have
that's worth using, Guan Qianya?

214
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,840
I played around with you
just to kill time.

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
Give me the evidence.

216
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,039
What were you thinking?

217
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,640
How could I possibly give it to you?

218
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,440
Get out of my way
if you don't want to die.

219
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,000
You're not the Xu Nian I know.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,359
I'm not Xu Nian from the beginning.

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm Xu Jin.

222
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,559
Remember that. It's Xu Jin.

223
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,880
I won't let you go.

224
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,880
If there was never a Xu Nian

225
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
and only Xu Jin,

226
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,440
you could just run over me.

227
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,799
Fine. As you wish.

228
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,479
Kele!

229
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,119
Kele, are you all right?

230
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,119
I'm fine.

231
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,559
Let's get the evidence.

232
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,320
Okay.

233
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,679
What's going on?

234
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,400
He's not Xu Nian.

235
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,119
What's going on?

236
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,159
Why is he a robot?

237
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
Where did Xu Nian go?

238
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,119
(Guan Qianya.)

239
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,760
Do you think

240
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,359
I'm going to spare you?

241
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,599
Xu Nian!

242
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,559
When was Xu Nian taken?

243
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:16,919
Mr. Cui!

244
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,599
Don't come over!

245
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Go now.

246
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:20,960
Be careful.

247
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,239
Attack.

248
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Mr. Xu, I've tried every method.

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
But he just won't talk.

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,880
Even if he said anything,
it would all be a lie.

251
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,760
Just like how he fooled me.

252
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,719
What do we do?

253
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,760
I could have waited till the concert.

254
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
Looks like I have to activate it
in advance.

255
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,760
Mr. Xu, which one should we activate?

256
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,400
What do you think?

257
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,400
He looks just like Xu Nian.

258
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,719
I am Xu Nian.

259
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,680
Even his voice is the same.

260
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,000
I have a mission for you.

261
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,880
Look for Guan Qianya.

262
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,680
Find out the evidence
my aunt left behind

263
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,479
and bring it back.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Yes, Mr. Xu.

265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,880
Guan Qianya, as you can see,

266
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,319
Xu Nian is in my hands.

267
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
This is your last chance.

268
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,599
Give me the evidence.

269
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,920
Or Xu Nian will fall to death.

270
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,199
He's alone.

271
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,520
Let's do it together.

272
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,280
Okay, I'll exchange it with you.

273
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,599
Sure enough,
the power of love is too great.

274
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,920
You come alone.

275
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,119
Everyone else stays.

276
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,560
Or Xu Nian will fall to death.

277
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,560
He only allows me go up alone.

278
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,280
Zhang Yang.

279
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,079
The evidence is with me.

280
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,479
Let him go first.

281
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,880
Give me the evidence first.

282
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,239
You can let him go now.

283
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,640
Sure.

284
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Xu Nian!

285
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,359
Have you heard from Zhang Yang?

286
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,000
We have both the evidence
and the people.

287
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,959
It's been a while since I said this.

288
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,000
Perfect.

289
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,239
Well, tonight's concert

290
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,079
will be extraordinary.

291
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:53,359
Lei Na, why is it?

292
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,439
All these years

293
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,199
you have seen people betray me,

294
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,560
but you've always stayed by my side.

295
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,760
Why?

296
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,239
That's because...

297
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,560
Because you know

298
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,560
we're doing something great.

299
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,800
That's right.

300
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,680
The moment has finally come.

301
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,660
♪I'm sorry I admit♪

302
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,079
Qianya.

303
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,479
Get up.

304
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:36,420
♪Dreams and reality become entangled♪

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,140
♪I can't tell them apart♪

♪You and I have different memories♪

307
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,907
♪As if we're searching

308
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,880
Let's go and get Zhang Yang.

309
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:05,100
♪Piecing together
the secrets of the future♪

310
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,260
♪I'm falling hard♪

311
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,359
I once read a book.

312
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,439
The book is about

313
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,479
what the afterlife looks like.

314
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
Things go on as usual.

315
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,839
But they can no longer feel

316
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,479
the feeling of the wind
blowing in their faces.

317
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
There are still things

318
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,839
that many people in this world love.

319
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,599
The dew on the petals
in the early morning,

320
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,800
the warm sun in the afternoon,

321
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,760
the sound of cicadas in summer,

322
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,359
and the first snow in winter.

323
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,839
You should experience all that.

324
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,300
♪Draw a circle to encircle our memories♪

325
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,760
I want to see you.

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,319
I want to see you being happy.

327
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,959
I want to know everything about you.

328
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,599
The thought of you

329
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,280
makes me feel
that my existence is meaningful.

330
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,239
I might

331
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,280
have fallen in love with you.

332
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,400
This is the third year

333
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,760
of Y4 concerts.

334
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,839
(Y4, we'll support you always!)
And it's still a hit.

335
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,319
Tickets were sold out

336
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,040
within 10 seconds.

337
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,959
How is this year's concert

338
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,479
different from the past?

339
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,719
According to the news previously
revealed by Yao Inc.,

340
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,839
Xu Guanghan will announce

341
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,239
(Lu Xiao forever!)
something big at the concert.

I can tell from your screams

that I'm not welcome here.

354
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,319
