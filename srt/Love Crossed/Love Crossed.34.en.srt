1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,200
It's been so long.
Why aren't they back yet?

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,559
Did something happen?

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,039
Qi Chuan is a smart guy.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,519
He'll be fine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,399
He's quite a smart guy.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,159
He's only been with us for a day,

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,359
and he's already trying

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,600
to turn us against each other.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,120
Not to mention, Qianya and Kele

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,639
are on his side now.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,879
If this goes on,

12
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,440
who knows what will happen?

13
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,360
The more I think about it,
the more I think something is off.

14
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,479
Why should we look for the spy first

15
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,000
when we should be
looking for the evidence?

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,319
I mean if we find out

17
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:30,760
that Zhang Lanlan
was sent by Xu Guanghan,

18
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
then I have nothing to say.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,599
But if they did all that

20
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:34,560
and she's clean,

21
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,680
we would have lost a lot of time.

22
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,119
I don't have an opinion.

23
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,520
I'll go with what you guys say.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,640
=Love Crossed=

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,780
=Episode 34=

26
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,760
This day has tired me out.

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,040
Why is it just you guys?

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,160
What about Zhang Lanlan?

29
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,400
She wasn't a spy.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,959
We sent her home.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,959
Our priority right now
is to look for the evidence.

32
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,000
No.

33
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,639
We only ruled out Su Lie so far.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,959
We need to keep checking the others.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,239
If we don't find the spy,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
we risk having it stolen by the spy

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,080
even if we find the evidence.

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
You're in such a hurry
to find the evidence.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
Could it be that you're the spy?

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,160
You keep saying
that there is a spy among us.

41
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,440
But have you ever wondered

42
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,880
that if there's a spy among us,

43
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,199
then why hasn't Xu Guanghan
found us yet?

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,160
What Lu Xiao said makes sense.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,080
Until now, Xu Guanghan has yet to act.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,440
There is another possibility.

47
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,559
He knows

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,320
that there is an evidence

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
that could bring him to justice,

50
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,119
but he doesn't know where it is.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,479
That's why he needs us to find it.

52
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,720
And then, he'll catch us all together.

53
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,000
In that case,

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
let's stop looking for it.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We'll leave this at a standstill.

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,839
He is already over 50.

57
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,320
We'll see who outlasts who.

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
That's enough.

59
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,080
We should focus on
finding the spy first.

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
First, check the phones.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
Second, check the bodies.

62
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,839
Okay. We'll do as Qi Chuan said.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,919
Please cooperate.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,839
Qianya, we've been through
a lot together.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
Yet you won't believe us.

66
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,880
You'd rather trust
someone you just ran into.

67
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,039
We didn't just run into each other.

68
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,199
Before she met you guys,

69
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,080
she and I had long regarded
Xu Guanghan as our enemy.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
If she doesn't believe me,

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,160
then who should she trust?

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,199
The four of you, who were raised
by Xu Guanghan?

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,919
I understand.

74
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,000
Ultimately,

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,240
the three of you from the outside world

76
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,440
just don't trust

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,279
the four of us
who escaped from the Bay House.

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,919
But have you ever thought about this?

79
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,320
Why would we try so hard
to get out

80
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,639
if there's a spy among us?

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,279
Of course I did.

82
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,119
The spy might have regretted leaving.

83
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,240
After all, Xu Guanghan
raised all of you for many years.

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,360
One of you

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,199
happened to be his own son as well.

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,479
All right. Search me.

87
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,600
Search as much as you want.

88
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,520
Okay. I'll start then.

89
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,880
You want to play, huh?

90
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,759
All right. You guys have fun.

91
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,119
I'm not taking part in this.

92
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,800
Lu Xiao. Lu Xiao!

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,919
Don't get me involved. I'm the spy.

94
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,799
You guys refused the search.

95
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,040
Don't blame me if something happens.

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
I'll go and check on him.

97
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,519
He's in a bad mood right now.

98
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,760
Leave him be for a while.

99
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,359
You can talk to him tomorrow.

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,880
What's going on?
Why is everyone here?

101
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,359
The note is gone.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,440
One of the phones is gone too.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,799
Where's Lu Xiao?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,200
I wondered why he wouldn't
let us search him yesterday.

105
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
It turns out
he's scared of getting caught.

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,559
No way!

107
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,279
Lu Xiao can't be the spy!

108
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,359
He... He must have been mad
at you guys. That's why he left.

109
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I'll give him a call right now.

110
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,679
Sorry.

111
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,519
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

112
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,440
See. He is the spy.

113
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
No.

114
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,600
Besides, didn't you say

115
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,559
that if one of us was the spy,

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,160
that person would definitely leave

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,559
only after getting the evidence?

118
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,720
We haven't found the evidence yet.

119
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
Why would he leave?

120
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,839
This doesn't make sense!

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,640
It might be because
we were looking for the spy.

122
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,440
He couldn't hide any longer,
so he ran away.

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,399
He wants to find the evidence
before we do.

124
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,200
It's my fault.

125
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,160
I should have pushed
to search everyone last night.

126
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't figure it out.

127
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,640
Why would Lu Xiao betray us?

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,000
If you can't figure it out,
that means he isn't the spy!

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,519
If you can't figure it out,
then don't bother.

130
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,679
We'll bring him back

131
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,239
and beat it out of him.

132
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,679
We don't have to do that.

133
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,880
Just like what we did with Zhang Lanlan.

134
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,440
We'll be able to find out
once we see him

135
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,279
and ask him, right?

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
Jiang Kele.

137
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,160
Why are you still

138
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,679
trying to make excuses for him?

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
I don't care.

140
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,440
Even if Lu Xiao is the spy,

141
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,119
I'm sure he has his reasons.

142
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,440
Until now,

143
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,760
you're still helping Lu Xiao.

144
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
Why did anyone not do the same

145
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,559
when I was suspected?

146
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,880
Actually, I doubted it.

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,959
But I didn't dare to voice out.

148
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,959
Su Lie, we weren't worried
that you're the spy.

149
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,040
We were worried
that you had been tricked.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,160
860.

151
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,180
(Future Library, Librarian, No. 8156)

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,340
(Future Library, Janitor, No. 8171)

153
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,399
I've finally found you.

154
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,679
Who are you?

155
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,200
Grandma Fushun asked me
to come and meet you.

156
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,519
Only you?

157
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
There are too many of us.

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
They might notice us if all of us come.

159
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
So they sent me in their stead.

160
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,480
Is the evidence with you?

161
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,559
Come with me.

162
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,460
(Boss)

163
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
Boss.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
Lu Xiao has engaged a janitor.

165
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,159
My men are already in place.

166
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,880
When do we reel them in?

167
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,799
Once you acquire the evidence.

168
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,520
Understood.

169
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
How should I address you?

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
Just call me Zhang.

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,719
Brother Zhang,

172
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,719
what exactly is the evidence
Grandma Fushun asked you

173
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,719
to hold on for her?

174
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,960
You'll find out in a minute.

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,239
Okay.

176
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,280
That way.

177
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,119
Okay.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,239
Let's not go inside together.

179
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,200
There are too many of us.
It might alert Lu Xiao.

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Okay. I'll go in alone then.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
No.

182
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,440
Jiang Kele, we trust you.

183
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,200
But Lu Xiao is involved.

184
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,760
I'm worried
you won't come out after you get in.

185
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,799
I suggest

186
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,400
we split up in pairs.

187
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,640
I'll go in with Xu Nian.

188
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,239
Okay. I'll go with Kele.

189
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,799
But remember, everyone,

190
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,760
Lu Xiao

191
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,320
is no longer the Lu Xiao we know.

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
He is a spy.

193
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,239
He might pose a threat to us
at any time.

194
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,799
So when you see him,

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,840
don't hold back
and don't let your guard down.

196
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
Especially you.

197
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,200
All right. All right.

198
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm going in with you already.

199
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,559
What else do you have to worry about?

200
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
All right. Let's move.

201
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,359
Wait here.

202
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,440
Okay.

203
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,359
Keep this safe.

204
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,760
Open it only
when you're at a safe place.

205
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,200
Okay.

206
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,520
Reel it in.

207
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,119
Xu Guanghan's men.

208
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,559
Where are you going?

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,719
To distract them.

210
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
I'll go with you.

211
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,640
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

212
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,799
You take care of yourself.

213
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,880
Where is he?

214
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
Lu Xiao!

215
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,039
Wait for me!

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,599
I knew I couldn't rely on you.

217
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,239
Lu Xiao.

218
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,400
Why are you here?

219
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,400
Watch out!

220
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,239
Hurry!

221
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,799
Stop!

222
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:22,919
Hurry! Hurry!

223
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,760
Go.

224
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,799
Lu Xiao, what exactly is going on?

225
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,159
Please trust me.

226
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm not the spy.

227
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,039
I never doubted you.

228
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I did.

229
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,000
But I trust you now.

230
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,520
If you were the spy,

231
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,559
you wouldn't have saved me.

232
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,000
You came out on your own

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
to find the evidence, right?

234
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,640
I got the evidence.

235
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,000
We were searching
in the wrong direction.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,159
We got it wrong all this time.

237
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,599
The numbers
weren't referring to a locker

238
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,760
or a book.

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
It was a person.

240
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,359
Who?

241
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,799
The library's janitor, Brother Zhang.

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,119
Brother Zhang?

243
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:11,840
Don't move.

244
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,280
I'm calling my big brother.

245
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello? Is this the assassin,
Brother Zhang?

246
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, it's me.

247
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,039
See.

248
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,440
Recently, I met a young lady.

249
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,919
She's so annoying.
She wouldn't leave me alone.

250
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Yes.

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,640
Deal with her for me
when you're free, will you?

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,119
All right. Stop acting.
Who do you think you're bluffing?

253
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,799
You've got some guts, young lady.

254
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,400
I heard Granny mention him once!

255
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,359
So what is the evidence

256
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,479
that Grandma Fushun left for us?

257
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,039
I haven't been able to open it yet.

258
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,707
(See you next time)

259
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,239
"See you next time".

260
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,559
"See you next time"?

261
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,640
I got it.

262
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,320
Brother Zhang must have known

263
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,799
that Xu Guanghan's men were nearby.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
That's why he didn't dare to
bring the evidence out.

265
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,719
It's all right.

266
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,159
At least we know
that we can follow this trace.

267
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,479
How are we going to contact

268
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,440
Brother Zhang?

269
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,719
Our priority right now

270
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,799
isn't to contact him.

271
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,159
It's to find out who the spy is.

272
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,679
Sorry, Qianya.

273
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,119
For not believing you guys

274
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,599
and thinking there wasn't a spy.

275
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,719
If there wasn't a spy,

276
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,559
Xu Guanghan would never
have been able to find us so quickly.

277
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,000
He sent his men after us

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,280
the moment we got the evidence.

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,799
We need to think carefully

280
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,479
the time when things

281
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,760
started to go wrong.

282
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,400
It must be the time
when we were separated

283
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,080
after the log cabin
was found by Xu Guanghan,

284
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,599
and before we gathered together again.

285
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,960
Something must have happened

286
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
during this time

287
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,200
that caused one of us
to turn to the other side.

288
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,239
There's another possibility.

289
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,719
Someone who just joined us that day.

290
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
Qi Chuan can't be the spy.

291
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
He must not be the spy.

292
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,119
If he was the spy,

293
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
he wouldn't have arranged
so many things for us.

294
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,679
And he was actively
looking for the spy.

295
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,119
That leaves the other three, then.

296
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,799
The incident with Lanlan

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,200
cleared Su Lie's suspicions.

298
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,000
We can't exclude the possibility

299
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,559
that he might have
planned it ahead with Xu Guanghan.

300
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,359
To create a false incident

301
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,559
to gain our trust.

302
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Actually, we've been neglecting
to mention someone.

303
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,119
Are you referring to Xu Nian?

304
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,799
Qianya,
I know you don't want to doubt him.

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,719
But he has been acting

306
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,599
a little weird lately.

307
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,520
How so?

308
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,359
When you went to see Zhang Lanlan,

309
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,200
Xu Nian told me

310
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,359
not to bother about the spy first.

311
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,440
We should focus on the evidence.

312
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
The more I think about it,
the more I think something is off.

313
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
Why should we look for the spy first

314
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,679
when we should be
looking for the evidence?

315
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,960
I mean if we find out

316
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
that Zhang Lanlan
was sent by Xu Guanghan,

317
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,479
then I have nothing to say.

318
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,280
But if they did all that

319
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,200
and she's clean,

320
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,559
we would have lost a lot of time.

321
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,159
When we got into an argument
after you came back,

322
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,960
he didn't side with me.

323
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,599
I understand.

324
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,440
Ultimately,

325
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,679
the three of you from the outside world

326
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
just don't trust

327
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,840
the four of us
who escaped from the Bay House.

328
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,599
But have you ever thought about this?

329
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,919
Why would we try so hard
to get out

330
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,280
if there's a spy among us?

331
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,960
That seemed

332
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,080
out of character for him.

333
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,559
He must be hiding something.

334
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,919
I have my doubts too.

335
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
On the day we were separated,

336
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,760
he knew

337
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,919
that all of us were
going to the library.

338
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
But he didn't go there.

339
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,039
Instead, he chose to watch fireworks
by the lakeside.

340
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,320
Don't you think that's odd?

341
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,280
Personally speaking,

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't want
to think of Xu Nian as the spy.

343
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
But I think
what you guys said makes sense.

344
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,199
Let's meet up with everyone

345
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,640
and look for the spy.

346
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,280
But how will we find the spy?

347
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,800
I have an idea.

348
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,880
Qianya called me just now.

349
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,319
She and Kele are safe.

350
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,479
They're with Lu Xiao.

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,359
Isn't Lu Xiao the spy?

352
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Are they being held hostage?

353
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,239
Lu Xiao isn't the spy.

354
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,479
He got the evidence.

355
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,719
They're on their way back now.

356
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,239
Since we've got the evidence,

357
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,719
we'll be able to plan our next step
to take down Xu Guanghan.

358
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,839
I knew there were no spies among us.

359
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,959
You're back.

360
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,719
Qianya said you got the evidence.

361
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,839
Where is it?

362
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,079
The numbers Grandma Fushun gave us

363
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,079
didn't refer to a book.

364
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,160
It was a person.

365
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,959
I've met up with him.

366
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
He gave me a new address.

367
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,079
The evidence is held there.

368
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,439
The evidence is inside this envelope.

369
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,839
Everyone must be tired.

370
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,560
We'll rest for tonight.

371
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,800
We'll go and get the evidence
first thing tomorrow.

372
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,239
Come in.

373
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,319
Qianya. What's the matter?

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
It's about the evidence.

375
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,479
Lu Xiao may have been
cleared of suspicion,

376
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,640
but we were ambushed

377
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
in the library again today.

378
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
That means

379
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
there is a spy among us.

380
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,479
I told them

381
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,760
that we'd act first thing tomorrow.

382
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,640
But that's just to trick the spy.

383
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,079
The real operation will be tonight.

384
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,000
If we can get the evidence tonight,

385
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,319
we'll be able to
get ahead of Xu Guanghan

386
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,319
and take him down
before he has time to react.

387
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,000
Out of all the people here,

388
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,680
you're the one I trust the most.

389
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,920
This is the address.
Make sure you memorize it.

390
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,340
(Da Du Road 312)

391
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,280
Da Du Road 312.

392
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
Did you keep it in mind?

393
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,680
You have to be careful.

394
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,920
Make sure to keep in contact

395
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,000
no matter what happens.

396
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,760
Kele,

397
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,920
I never expected
that you trusted me this much.

398
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,800
It's not just me.

399
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,920
After that incident with Zhang Lanlan,

400
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,079
you proved yourself.

401
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,640
Everyone trusts you now.

402
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,199
So you must not

403
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,560
let us down.

404
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,300
(Bai Hua Road 18)

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,640
Did you keep it in mind?

406
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,640
Recite the address.

407
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,439
Bai Hua Road 18.

408
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,319
Good.

409
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Did you keep it in mind?

410
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,599
I did.

411
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Are you sure?

412
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,239
Fa Hua Road 29.

413
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,180
(Fa Hua Road 29)

414
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,400
I've installed security cameras

415
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,479
at all three places.

416
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,359
We'll know who the spy is

417
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,479
if Xu Guanghan's men show up.

418
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,359
Kele, this is a clever idea.

419
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,079
I'm smart and wise.

420
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,740
(Da Du Road 312)

421
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,100
(Fa Hua Road 29)

422
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,319
We failed this time.

423
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,719
It was my fault.

424
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,680
You caused such a ruckus in the library.

425
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,599
And you let them get away.

426
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
If I were you,

427
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,680
I wouldn't even have the courage
to stand here

428
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,119
and apologize.

429
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,000
Boss, please give me another chance.

430
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,920
We sent someone with them, right?

431
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,119
Any news from that person?

432
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,199
Where are they now?

433
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,520
They're at Qi Chuan's place.

434
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,839
I'll go and catch them right away.

435
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Get back here.

436
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
That's not the place you should go.

437
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,839
Lu Xiao did not
get his hands on the evidence.

438
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,520
He only got a new address

439
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
from that old man.

440
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,640
We've been waiting for so long.

441
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,199
Why is no one showing up?

442
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,119
They didn't see through our plans,
did they?

443
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,640
Be patient, Kele. Let's keep waiting.

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,160
Just waiting here is too boring.

445
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:35,199
Why don't we play a game?

446
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's place a bet on who the spy is.

447
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,319
I'll go first.

448
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,760
My bet is on Xu Nian.

449
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,640
You're betting on Xu Nian

450
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,680
because you like Qianya, right?

451
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,280
You'd love it if he were the spy.

452
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,599
You'll get your chance then, right?

453
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,959
Is this really the time for gossip?

454
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,239
Right. Stop gossiping.

455
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,239
Who do you think is the spy?

456
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,119
Maybe... Luo Ke? What about you?

457
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,160
I wanted to say Su Lie,

458
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
but I guess

459
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,959
I have no choice but to say Luo Ke.

460
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,199
Why isn't Xu Nian back yet?

461
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,199
You must be glad

462
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,880
that it's not Xu Nian, right?

463
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,280
Well, someone might not be as glad,

464
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,839
since he lost a chance.

465
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,959
What are you talking about?

466
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,520
Everyone's trying to get out alive here.

467
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,199
And you're still gossiping.

468
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm just trying to liven the mood.

469
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,920
Qianya, what exactly is going on?

470
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,319
Tonight is a test for you guys.

471
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,680
You and Su Lie passed the test.

472
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,920
We found the spy.

473
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,160
It's Luo Ke.

474
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,800
My place is no longer safe.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,199
Let's get in the car and leave here.

476
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,560
What about Luo Ke?

477
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,479
Why should you care about a spy?

478
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,479
Come on.

479
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,479
Let's go.

480
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,560
Luo Ke?

481
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
Lu Xiao! They found out
about our operation!

482
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,359
I headed to the address you gave me.

483
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,319
Xu Guanghan's men were already there.

484
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,079
I didn't dare approach them.
I came back right away.

485
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,959
It wasn't that they found out about us.

486
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,880
It was you who leaked
the information to them.

487
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,079
You'd better leave.

488
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,359
Are you calling me a spy?

489
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,560
Didn't you say

490
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,199
that I am the one
everyone trusts the most?

491
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,520
That's just a test.

492
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
Why did you sell us out?

493
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,079
I didn't.

494
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,839
If I were a spy,

495
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,319
why would I come all the way back here

496
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,439
to let you guys know about it?

497
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,800
Because that was a fake address.

498
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,400
You didn't find the evidence.

499
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,040
You had to come back
and continue your act

500
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,920
to keep spying on us.

501
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,239
Once you find the evidence,

502
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,119
you'll report it to Xu Guanghan

503
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,439
and catch us for good.

504
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:56,359
Su Lie, do you think I'm the spy too?

505
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,119
Luo Ke, I don't want to suspect you.

506
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,359
But Xu Nian
and I took the test as well.

507
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,640
Why was your address the only one

508
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
that got leaked?

509
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,040
I don't know!

510
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,959
You've seen my phone records!

511
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
I didn't contact Xu Guanghan!

512
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,760
If you don't believe me,
let's go meet Xu Guanghan right now.

513
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Ask him in person.

514
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,599
That's enough, Luo Ke.

515
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,640
We will not go with you

516
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,479
and surrender ourselves.

517
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,719
Don't even think about it.

518
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,280
Stop wasting your breath with the spy.

519
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,439
If we don't leave soon,
Xu Guanghan's men will catch up.

520
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,439
Let's go.

521
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,760
Where are you guys going?

522
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,359
Take me with you!

523
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,040
Luo Ke.

524
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,479
You'd better leave.

525
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,640
Leave? Where could I go?

526
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,920
Anywhere.

527
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,079
Stay away from us.

528
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:04,920
Qi Chuan,

529
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,760
do you have another safe place

530
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
for us to go?

531
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,800
I do. The city of Chuan.

532
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,439
They didn't name the city
after you, did they?

533
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,119
Kele, you're so cute.

534
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:20,439
I'll work hard for the city of Chuan.

535
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,239
Then where are we going right now?

536
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,880
Wherever the car will take us.

537
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,640
Better than staying at home
and getting caught.

538
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,880
That's true.

539
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,680
Lu Xiao, we got rid of the spy.

540
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,319
You can tell us

541
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,479
the real address now, right?

542
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,719
We're going to get it now.

543
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,479
Brother Zhang never told me the address.

544
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,280
He told me he would
meet up with me on another day.

545
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,880
He didn't give me
a way to contact him either.

546
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,880
Well, that ends the line of the clue.

547
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,760
Brother Zhang was exposed.

548
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,040
He probably wouldn't
go back to the library.

549
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,839
Do you have any other information?

550
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,000
All I know is that
he works as a janitor in the library.

551
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,160
And his surname is Zhang.

552
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,000
He might not be able
to return to the library.

553
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,199
But we can ask his colleagues

554
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,079
in the library,

555
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,000
to see if anyone knows his home address

556
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,439
or the way to contact him.

557
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,359
Back to the library again?

558
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,199
We barely made it out last time.

559
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,760
I know someone

560
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,959
who could get in contact with him.

561
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Su Liang! Su Liang!

562
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,199
Su Liang!

563
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,199
Don't get the wrong idea.

564
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:26,800
What are you guys doing?

565
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,719
Mr. Zhang!

566
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,599
Calm down.

567
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,199
We just want to ask you something.

568
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
You guys told me

569
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,160
not to contact her anymore.

570
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,267
(Lanlan)

571
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,560
We stopped contacting
each other ever since.

572
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,920
We told you not to contact her
because we were worried

573
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
you would get her into trouble.

574
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
But she might be the only one

575
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,319
who can get us in touch
with Brother Zhang.

576
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,199
Why don't you try sending her a message?

577
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,719
Send it.

578
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,800
(Lanlan, are you free right now?
I have something urgent to tell you.)

579
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,239
Lanlan blocked me.

580
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,599
Give me her phone number.

581
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,479
I'll call her instead.

582
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:18,920
She's not picking up.

583
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,280
There's no other way then.

584
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,599
We'll just have to try our luck

585
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,640
and wait for her

586
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
in the area she lives in.

587
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,079
Okay.

588
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,319
Qi Chuan.

589
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,839
Got it.

590
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
Lanlan!

591
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,400
Lanlan, why did you block me?

592
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,599
Didn't Guan Qianya say

593
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,119
that we shouldn't be in touch?

594
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,640
So I blocked you.

595
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,160
Why are you here?

596
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,839
We are in trouble,

597
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,920
and we need your help.

598
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,119
Do you know Mr. Zhang,

599
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,599
the janitor from the library?

600
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes, why?

601
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,280
Do you know how to reach him?

602
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,160
No.

603
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
Could you help us to ask around then?

604
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,000
We really do need to see him.
It's urgent.

605
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
I don't care
if you guys are lying or not.

606
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,319
I don't want to be a part of this.
