1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,480
I met Xu Guanghan

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,280
in the winter 14 years ago.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,439
Back then,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,039
I was just a naive genius.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,960
I had a lot of dreams,

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,079
but I didn't know how harsh...

7
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:20,559
I didn't know how cold humans can be.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,280
Stop.

9
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:29,280
Get out.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,119
That's awfully stingy
for a celebrity like you.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,720
Sorry, where was I?

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,240
How cold humans can be.

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,040
At that moment, I was

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
having a meal with a friend.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,000
Then I went busking by the street.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,759
Xu Guanghan passed by and asked

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,759
if I wanted to be a singer.

18
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,560
I was shocked.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,080
Why did I trust him so easily?

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,319
Why were you busking by the street

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,000
when you're out having a meal
with your friend?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,279
That's not the point.

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,319
My bad.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Xu Guanghan

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,240
spent less than a year

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
to prep me for a debut.

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,160
For the next five years,

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,440
my popularity grew.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
It was such smooth sailing.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,040
The fortune I amassed was enough
for several lives.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,879
They called me a music prodigy.

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,519
The industry called me
the Master Songwriter.

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,639
In that case,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,239
Xu Guanghan treated you quite well.

35
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,519
I was fooled by him that time.

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,919
Only until I left him that

37
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,360
I realized he has left

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,839
such a huge problem to me.

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,080
How huge?

40
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:29,080
This huge.

41
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,680
You know,

42
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,400
as a songwriter,

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,239
music is my life.

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,639
When I decided to part way with him
six years ago,

45
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,440
I realized that

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,919
the copyright of all my music

47
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,239
belongs to Xu Guanghan.

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,919
Do you know what this means?

49
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
You lost your life.

50
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,120
No.

51
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,199
It means whenever I sing

52
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,400
a song that I wrote,

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,480
I have to pay him royalty.

54
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,199
So, that's why

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,919
you brought Xu Guanghan to court.

56
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,680
Yes.

57
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Not only will I reclaim the copyright,

58
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,480
I will also reclaim the time lost.

59
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,960
You don't sue someone

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,679
to reclaim your youth.

61
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
It's bound to be a failure.

62
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
If the legal system
cannot right the wrong,

63
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,559
then I shall rely on a
more personal method.

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,399
Enemy of my enemy is my friend.

65
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,119
Let's join forces,

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,919
group up,

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
and defeat Xu Guanghan.

68
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,320
I'd love to overthrow Xu Guanghan too,

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,960
but there's one thing
I don't understand.

70
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,279
You have a simple message

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,880
but why do you have to be

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,600
so long-winded?

73
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,919
Sorry.

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
Allow me to correct your mistake.

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,919
This is not long-winded.
This is expressive.

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,880
Adding textures

77
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,119
to something simple

78
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,639
is what a musician does.

79
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,080
Cheers.

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,199
I'm busy. Pardon me.

81
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,559
Lafite from 85 is still my favourite.

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,759
Why is this elevator so slow?

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,119
You just can't wait

84
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,399
to see how they look like
in new clothes.

85
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,470
=Love Crossed=

86
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,470
=Episode 6=

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,880
The cleaning is already done this early?

88
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,519
The cleaning lady
is getting more efficient.

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,119
Oh no!

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,279
I left my phone on the sofa!

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,079
Hi, Mr. Xu.

92
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,320
Looking good.

93
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,279
Nice sports attire too.

94
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,799
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

95
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,760
I thought Lu Xiao is untamable!

96
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,399
Why is he so obedient

97
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,600
faced with Xu Guanghan?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,359
Mr. Xu has prepared these costumes

99
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,519
for you guys for this season.

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
Even if all of you are reclusive

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,640
and have no chance to meet others,

102
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,279
I still want you to dress properly.

103
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,359
Do you know why?

104
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,839
So that we're
at the forefront of fashion.

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,679
Good.

106
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,320
In order to maintain
your glamorous appearance

107
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
and sophisticated taste,

108
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,880
I have invested far more than
you can imagine.

109
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,559
Yet, you let me down.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,839
Data!

111
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,720
Your weight and emotional level

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,920
have gone through drastic changes.

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Luo Ke. 2.4kg heavier.

114
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,000
Su Lie. 2kg heavier.

115
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,640
Xu Nian. 1kg heavier.

116
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,839
Only Lu Xiao is lighter by 0.2kg.

117
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,559
I won't mention
the one who slimmed down.

118
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,760
But the others, what's wrong?

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Aren't you eating
what you have been eating?

120
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,920
Why are you heavier then?

121
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,279
Luo Ke?

122
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,559
I must have drunk too much water.

123
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,880
It's the water weight.

124
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,559
Su Lie?

125
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,079
I... I don't know.

126
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,839
Must be some paranormal activities.

127
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,359
So that's how Su Lie sounds like?

128
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,200
His voice cracked under pressure.

129
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,559
Paranormal activities?

130
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,079
Get up!

131
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,799
Who told you to get up?

132
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,559
Do you really think that

133
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,720
you can hide

134
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
everything from me?

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,799
When a secret was born,

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
lies will snowball.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,399
And to convince people of your lies,

138
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,239
you tell more and more lies.

139
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,880
It's like fats

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,760
accumulating layer after layer.

141
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
The best solution

142
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,640
is to come clean, confess,
and accept punishment.

143
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,799
Lu Xiao knows this the best.

144
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,320
Lu Xiao, you lost weight.

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,559
Stand up.

146
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,320
Yes.

147
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,880
You've been staying with them.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,559
Tell me.

149
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,000
What happened this week?

150
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,000
Something did happen

151
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,640
recently.

152
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm screwed.

153
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,519
Even though the merciful me

154
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,720
have forgiven Lu Xiao,

155
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
but since he's so petty,

156
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,839
he'll definitely rat me out.

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,119
Who knows that

158
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
I would fall
by the hands of my favourite man.

159
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
Oh love!

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
You gave us a week off.

161
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,359
Within this week,

162
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,399
we ate

163
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,440
then slept. We woke up then ate.

164
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,079
That's why we put on weight.

165
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,000
That's all?

166
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,880
That's all.

167
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,480
You said you wanted to kick me out

168
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,079
but then you're protecting me.

169
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,600
Men only know how to bluff.

170
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,279
I can't believe the three of you

171
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,799
are so weak-willed.

172
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,760
What a total lack of discipline.

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Lu Xiao is too disciplined.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,119
He made us look bad.

175
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,440
Excuses!

176
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,359
Haven't I told you?

177
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,280
Never ever put on weight.

178
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,840
I should try to be
as disciplined as Lu Xiao.

179
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,919
One glass down. Three glasses left!

180
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,159
Come in.

181
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,640
Ms. Guan.

182
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,599
The endorsement contract
for Qi Chuan is here.

183
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,960
The endorsement fee is 1 yuan?

184
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,159
No extra condition?

185
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,919
Nothing can escape your scrutiny.

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
There is one extra clause.

187
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,280
A very weird breach clause.

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,320
It says if you're addicted

189
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,799
to Love Boys,

190
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,280
Qi Chuan will terminate the contract

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,840
and will ask for one million yuan
as compensation.

192
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,719
That's ridiculous.

193
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,400
I know!

194
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,159
But ignore that clause.

195
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,919
The endorsement fee
is cheaper than the printing fee.

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
This is my first time hearing that.

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,159
So who do you think

198
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,880
should take the credit
for such a great deal?

199
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,280
You.

200
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,760
Thanks, Ms. Guan.

201
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,719
Your effort is worth one yuan.

202
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,599
Obesity will disrupt your metabolism,

203
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,080
cause cardiovascular diseases,

204
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,000
and even stunt your intellectual growth.

205
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,640
It will also cause mental health issues
like depression,

206
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,840
and can bring forth cancer.

207
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,599
Due to obesity,

208
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,239
human's average life span
has decreased by six to seven years.

209
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,320
Obese patients under the age of 30

210
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,599
have their longevity shortened
by 20 years.

211
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,799
Even if it's just for surviving,

212
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,119
you should avoid getting obese.

213
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Understood?

214
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,760
Understood.

215
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,599
Yes.

216
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,440
Seems like Luo Ke isn't convinced.

217
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,559
Let me start over again then.

218
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,359
Obesity will disrupt your metabolism,

219
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,719
cause cardiovascular diseases,

220
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,000
and even stunt your intellectual growth.

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,400
Hello.

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
Hello. Is this Ms. Guan?

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
The server of the website has been fixed

224
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,280
but we need your authorization

225
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,640
to retrieve the previous data.

226
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,119
Can you please come to the server room?

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,679
Okay. I'll come over now.

228
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,600
(Crush on Love)

229
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,559
Let's go out first.

230
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,818
(System Notifications)

231
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,826
(Love Boys patch update is now complete)

232
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:55,850
(Log in now to experience new content)

233
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,830
(and receive maintenance compensation)

234
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Give me your phone.

235
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,599
I don't have it.

236
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,719
Are you from our company?

237
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes, from the IT department. I'm new.

238
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,719
Have I met you before?

239
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,559
I told you I'm new here.

240
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,719
Do you know who I am then?

241
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
The boss.

242
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,919
But now, I'm not just a staff.

243
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm also your savior.

244
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,239
You mean

245
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,919
you want a raise?

246
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,840
Sure. Tomorrow morning,

247
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,359
I'll ask HR to fire you.

248
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,200
Seems like I just have
to treasure the time I have now.

249
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,200
After all, I won't be able to spend time
with my boss alone anymore.

250
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,599
Let me tell you a bedtime story.

251
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Once upon a time,
a farmer saved a snake.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,640
Stop.

253
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,799
Not this story then.

254
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,719
I'll pick another one.

255
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,359
Once upon a time,

256
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:32,919
Mr. Dongguo saved a wolf.

257
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,520
Shut up.

258
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't open your mouth.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
You make so much noise.

260
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,359
You keep tossing and turning.
I can't sleep like that.

261
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,679
I'm still awake.

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,840
So the almighty boss

263
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
got insomnia from such trivial matter?

264
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,280
You're wrong.

265
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,440
I have insomnia
for more than one decade.

266
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,599
What?

267
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,880
Since we can't sleep,

268
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
why not chat a bit?

269
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,599
When I was a little boy,

270
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,159
I wanted to be a pilot.

271
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:29,960
Picking up girls, huh?

272
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,520
I read a lot of books about it.

273
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
About picking up girls.

274
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,559
The books mentioned

275
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,919
how American pilots

276
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,200
managed to fall asleep quickly.

277
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,000
-They...
-Hold on.

278
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,679
How to fall asleep quickly?

279
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,719
First,

280
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,320
find a position
you can fall asleep quickly.

281
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,799
Be it lying down or sitting.

282
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,719
Hold your hands together.

283
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Like this?

284
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,359
Let me teach you.
Open your hands.

285
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,679
Palm upwards.

286
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,719
Like this.

287
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,159
Close your eyes.

288
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,799
Imagine that

289
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
you're in a dark room,

290
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,280
lying on top of a soft bed.

291
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,119
I can't sleep
if you stare at me like that.

292
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,919
Fine, I'll look the other way.

293
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:48,919
Now,

294
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:53,599
your emotions are concentrated
on your face.

295
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,440
Your face remains relaxed and peaceful.

296
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,040
Every muscle slowly relaxes.

297
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,599
From your shoulder,

298
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,560
to your arms and your body.

299
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,319
All of them are relaxing

300
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,400
and you sink with them.

301
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,319
Now, relax your legs.

302
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,599
From thighs to calves, then to ankles

303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,400
and your feet.

304
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,079
Every single muscle

305
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,599
is relaxing.

306
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Slowly.

307
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,280
Slowly.

308
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,560
Slowly.

309
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,520
And now, you can't feel anything.

310
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,560
Xu Nian?

311
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,833
(Guan Qianya)

312
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,309
(Return to the game)

313
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,746
(Return to the main menu)

314
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,280
(The player has been offline,
would you like to quit?)

315
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,800
Interact 1-on-1 with the user?

316
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,599
Some of our users

317
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,560
are weird.

318
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,599
The current program

319
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,599
has no effect on them.

320
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,400
In order to further improve this system,

321
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,959
I need you to accomplish
this experiment.

322
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,640
But I've never done it.

323
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,680
I might let you down.

324
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,479
I believe in you.

325
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,479
This user
seems to be more interested in you.

326
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,560
She hovered on you for a minute

327
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,479
when she was picking
the character she likes.

328
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,520
Only you can do this.

329
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,920
Okay.

330
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,439
Lei Na will send you the equipment
as well as the user guide.

331
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
You'll also receive

332
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
the data of this particular user.

333
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,839
Analyze

334
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,160
what to do

335
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
to make her fall for you.

336
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:40,719
Just one thing.

337
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,959
You can't let the user know that

338
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,239
this is an experiment.

339
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,599
Make her fall for you

340
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,119
as soon as possible.

341
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Can you do that?

342
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,319
I will do my best, sir.

343
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,439
That's odd.

344
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,359
Who changed my lens?

345
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,239
Come in.

346
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,400
Ms. Guan.

347
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,959
Yesterday afternoon,

348
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,239
you might have taken my lens by mistake.

349
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,599
(Crush on Love)
This is yours.

350
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,839
Did you wear them?

351
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,640
Of course not.

352
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,719
Go back to work.

353
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay.

354
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,959
Did I really take them by mistake?

355
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
Here, you're now a permanent member
of the Lavender Club.

356
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,280
That's all for my mission?

357
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,760
Yes, well done.

358
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,680
This card is your reward.

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,599
See you, Ms. Guan.

360
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,280
I've always disliked Guan Qianya anyway.

361
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,400
Who is she to publicly humiliate
our lovers?

362
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,119
Even without this reward,

363
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,920
I'd still help you.

364
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,239
Mr. Xu never skimps

365
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,880
on his allies.

366
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,359
You know what I mean?

367
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,920
Of course.

368
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,319
Don't worry.

369
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,920
No matter what happens,

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,199
I won't tell anyone about this.

371
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,319
Just let me know

372
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,400
if you need me in the future.

373
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,439
You can definitely count on me.

374
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,760
And I'm loyal too.

375
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,560
You just betrayed your boss.

376
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,640
The moment she renounced Y4,

377
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,079
she's already not my boss.

378
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm back, Kele.

379
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,959
Kele?

380
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,239
She's out this early?

381
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,801
(Qianya)

382
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,479
Hey, Kele.

383
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,079
Where did you go?

384
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,119
Hello?

385
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you okay? Why aren't you speaking?

386
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,359
So this is what a phone call
feels like!

387
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,719
Who are you?

388
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,400
Why do you have Jiang Kele's phone?

389
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm Jiang Kele's new friend.

390
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
My name is...

391
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,920
Hey, Qianya.

392
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,880
I'm fine. Bye.

393
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,119
New friend?

394
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,119
Kele found a new boyfriend?

395
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,640
So it's not that
she went out early in the morning.

396
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,280
She spent the whole night somewhere.

397
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
But no.

398
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Why would she want
a real-life boyfriend?

399
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,680
Why did you take my phone?

400
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,760
It's mine!

401
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,599
Why are you here so early?

402
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,000
None of your business.

403
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,680
Also,

404
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,959
you said you'd bring me
milk tea last time.

405
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll bring it to you next time.

406
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,760
Bye.

407
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
Where are you going?

408
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,439
You won't understand anyway.

409
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,520
If you don't tell me,

410
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
how will you know if I can understand?

411
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
What are you two doing?

412
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,839
This timing... Must be Mr. Xu.

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,239
Hide!

414
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,880
Where to?

415
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,359
Upstairs.

416
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,239
No! She'll be found out.

417
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,359
Under the table.

418
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,760
No! She'll be found out too.

419
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,880
Lu Xiao, can you come up with something?

420
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,040
Lisa said that

421
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:57,400
Guan Qianya didn't suspect anything.

422
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,079
Like I said,

423
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,760
Guan Qianya is just dumb.

424
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,560
Indeed.

425
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,800
That's why her employee betrayed her.

426
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,479
When Lisa got the permanent membership,

427
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,119
she said that she's willing
to be a loyal pawn

428
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,920
to serve us.

429
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,479
Yes, she did help us there

430
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,000
but I despise infidelity.

431
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,000
How is she a loyal pawn

432
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,800
when she betrayed her own boss
so readily?

433
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,479
She's just an opportunist.

434
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't use her again.

435
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,599
Noted.

436
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,880
Hi, Mr. Xu.

437
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,359
Why are you guys here?

438
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,760
Why look so nervous?

439
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,880
Guilty of something?

440
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Nothing.

441
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,800
It's just that we weren't informed
of your arrival.

442
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,079
So now I have to
make an appointment to see you?

443
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
No, no.

444
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,000
Luo Ke!

445
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:55,479
Cut your left sideburn by another 0.5mm.

446
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,520
It's not symmetrical.

447
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,920
Stop sunbathing, Su Lie.

448
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,959
You're too tanned.

449
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
This color palette
doesn't suit you too.

450
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,800
You'll look too tanned.

451
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,160
Even now

452
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,839
your fashion sense
hasn't improved a bit.

453
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,560
Lu Xiao!

454
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,079
You did well.

455
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,599
Take care, Mr. Xu.

456
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,000
No need to be that uptight.

457
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,640
Mr. Xu just wanted to have a chat
with Xu Nian.

458
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,280
How's last night?

459
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,719
Everything went according to the plan.

460
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,359
No accident whatsoever.

461
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,040
What's the result?

462
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,719
She fell asleep.

463
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,880
And you?

464
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,479
I did too.

465
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,040
So the two of you

466
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,839
fell asleep together.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,880
Anything happened

468
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
before that?

469
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,959
She's very active.

470
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,280
What did she do to you?

471
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,599
When she fell asleep,

472
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,560
her head was resting on my shoulder.

473
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,880
That's all?

474
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,079
Nothing else?

475
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,040
Nothing.

476
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,040
So nothing happened then.

477
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,319
You lack experience.

478
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
It's your first mission

479
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,920
so mistakes are bound to happen.

480
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,079
It's understandable.

481
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,920
But don't forget that

482
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,239
your main mission

483
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,959
is to make her fall for you.

484
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,079
Most importantly,

485
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,680
don't let her fall asleep

486
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,760
when you interact with her.

487
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,800
Guan Qianya has insomnia.

488
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,119
I knew I picked the right guy.

489
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
You didn't let me down.

490
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,880
Come, tell me everything again.

491
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,800
Let's forget about
what happened just now.

492
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,920
How's last night?

493
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,239
She fell asleep.

494
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:56,680
So, she has insomnia

495
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,520
but she managed to fall asleep

496
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,239
because of you.

497
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,520
Well done.

498
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,439
I believe

499
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,400
you'll meet her again soon.
