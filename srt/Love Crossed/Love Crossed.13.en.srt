00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,720
What is it?

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,840
Good news, Ms. Guan.

3
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,599
I've contacted my ex-wife's best friend.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,479
Is your shocking exclusive story ready?

5
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,560
At my fingertips.

6
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,919
Nice!

7
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,720
(Kele, I'm sorry.)

8
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,440
(Exposing Xu Guanghan)

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
(might cost you your job.)

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,919
(But don't worry.)

11
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,160
(I'll support you financially forever.)

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,839
(This is what I have to do.)

(All four of them are here.)

16
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
(I'll do it at one fell swoop.)

17
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,360
(There's still humanity left
in Xu Guanghan.)

18
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,479
(Their living environment
is pretty great.)

19
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,080
How did she get in?

20
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,759
Speak up. Did you give her the passcode?

21
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,920
She's your aunt after all.

22
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,120
Just tell me. Was it you?

23
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,400
Lei Na.

24
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,759
You betrayed my trust.

25
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,879
You have one chance now
to redeem yourself.

26
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,439
Do you want it or not?

27
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,199
Even if it is an oncoming bullet,

28
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm going to catch it.

29
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Very well.

30
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,800
I admire your desperate attempt

31
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,159
to please me.

32
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,560
Run to my house now.

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,680
Remove the door and change the lock.

34
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,279
All right.

35
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Mr. Xu.

36
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,999
The door is perfectly fine.

37
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,080
Well, you can just change the code.

38
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,199
No way!

39
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,439
Just like my psychological defense,

40
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,800
that door is damaged.

41
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,319
Even if I change the lock,

42
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,879
it can't give me
the sense of security anymore.

43
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,879
So the entire door has to be changed.

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,640
Remember.

45
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,920
Only you and I know this new password.

46
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,960
Clear as crystal.

47
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,920
But Fushun is your family.

48
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm just an outsider.

49
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,640
You're right.

50
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,039
How about this?

51
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,120
Just change the lock.

52
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll set the password myself.

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
From now on,

54
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,960
G4 are my only family.

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,319
Right, I'm on it now.

56
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't move.

57
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,800
You scared me.

58
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:44,640
There's booze.

59
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,360
Beer.

60
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,680
That's right.

61
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,840
This is the divine drink

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
that you have always wanted to try.

63
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,479
Hold on.

64
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,800
This isn't the way to drink it.

65
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
It has to go with the food,

66
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
and your favourite Shizuren
sour and spicy noodles.

67
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,719
Got it.

68
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,520
Why just you two?

69
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,439
Where are the others?

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
They're taking a shower.

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,159
We came here first
since we finished earlier.

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
(Shizuren sour and spicy noodles)

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
Wait for them then.

74
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,240
That's really good.

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,759
Here's a toast.

76
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,479
I want to thank all of you

77
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,360
for looking out for me.

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,360
May our friendship last forever.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Long may Bay House reign.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,279
-Here.
-All right. Cheers.

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,240
That's good.

82
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,439
It tastes a little bitter.

83
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,159
Didn't you feel sick because of
your hangover yesterday?

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,400
Why are you drinking now?

85
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,840
My dad said,

86
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,199
if you feel sick
because of the hangover,

87
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,719
you shall drink some the next day

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,560
then it won't feel bad anymore.

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Besides,

90
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,879
even if it is,

91
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,840
someone will prepare
the honey water for me.

92
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,319
Honey water? What is it?

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,039
I have no idea.

94
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,240
Did you make it for me?

95
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,360
Of course not.

96
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,120
If I did, why would I ask?

97
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,039
I know.

98
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,640
In this house,

99
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,599
only Xu Nian knows

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,080
that honey water can cure a hangover.

101
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:19,920
It wasn't me.

102
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,560
I haven't watched the documentary

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
about hangover cures.

104
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
Then I know what happened.

105
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,360
What do you know?

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,960
Just drink up. Shut your mouth.

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,920
(Shizuren sour and spicy noodles)

108
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,319
Why did you take such a small sip?

109
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,560
You shall be punished
for three more glasses.

110
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,760
I learned that from the drama.

111
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
Why does it seem so hard
for you to drink?

112
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,440
Here, I'll show you.

113
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,599
Look, Kele drank it already.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,839
Stop dragging your feet.
Are you a man or what?

115
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,560
I learned that from the drama too.

116
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Well done.

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,560
Here, let's drink.

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,719
Okay, since we're all here,
let's drink up.

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,399
Here, I'll pour you some.

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,639
Here. Bottoms up.

121
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:21,719
Cheers.

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
Cheers.

123
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,079
Lu Xiao, what a happy day today.

124
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,440
Next time, it is on me.

125
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,639
-Sure!
-Cheers!

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,560
Cheers!

127
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,560
There's no more! I want to drink!

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,760
Let's go.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,760
So Jiang Kele's job
is to drink with them?

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,519
We're almost there, Lu Xiao.

131
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,079
How is it? Are you okay, Lu Xiao?

132
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,000
No, my head is spinning.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
Spinning?

134
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,399
Let's play a game.

135
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,360
I ask a question, and you answer me.

136
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,159
Sure.

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,159
All right.

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Did you sneak out the other day?

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
No.

140
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,399
I only sneaked out once.

141
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,519
Just once.

142
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,599
Where did you go and what did you do?

143
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,360
I went to see her.

144
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,920
It's a she?

145
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,479
Lu Xiao?

146
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:23,200
A private gym
and a private swimming pool.

147
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
Compared to them,

148
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm just like a beggar.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Who is that?

150
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,399
Turn around.

151
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Surprise!

It's the person who gave it to him.

touch it.

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,279
To see you.

174
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,920
So you really do know a lot
about pilots.

175
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
Everything I told you was true.

176
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,820
(Existence and Void)

177
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,360
The things you said

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
weren’t made up just to trick me.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,039
I don't know what made you think that.

180
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,440
But you should know this.

181
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,560
Although the person interacting with you

182
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
in the game is a virtual character.

183
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,599
Behind that, it is the real me.

184
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,479
Oh, no! Mr. Xu is coming.

185
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
Mr. Xu.

186
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,639
Why are you here alone?

187
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,680
Where are the others? Get them here!

188
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,240
I don't think that's possible.

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
Where did you get the beer?

190
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,079
The beer?

191
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,240
There's more? I want some more!

192
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,039
Knock it off.

193
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,519
You're getting out of hands.

194
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
Have you forgotten the rules?

195
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,760
Do you want to be punished?

196
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,920
Xu Nian!

197
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,519
Tell me what's going on!

198
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,719
Here.

199
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,399
Hide here.

200
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,719
Mr. Xu, I dare not do it anymore!

201
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I promise!

202
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,599
I won't bring them beer,

203
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,039
or make them drink with me ever again!

204
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,360
The renowned Y4

205
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,839
became drinking buddies for a janitor?

206
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,760
No!

207
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,519
We merely drank

208
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,560
as friends.

209
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,639
I promise you! I won't do it again!

210
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
Also, I'll clock out on time,

211
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,880
and I won't drag my feet.

212
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,279
I won't see them again.

213
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
(Lu Xiao's current data,)

214
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,800
(is no longer like
a roller coaster ride,)

215
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,279
(but bungee jumping.)

216
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,360
You foolish girl.

217
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,959
Things easily get overcompensated.

218
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,719
Since this is your first offense,

219
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,479
I can forgive you.

220
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,399
From now on,
you don't have to clock out on time.

221
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
You're friends after all.

222
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
If you stop seeing each other
all of a sudden,

223
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm worried it will upset them.

224
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,479
After all, they're my family.

225
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Mr. Xu.

226
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,399
You're the most
broad-minded person alive!

227
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,159
Am I the most broad-minded man alive?

228
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,240
Broader than the ocean.

229
00:15:58,839 --> 00:15:59,760
But you guys have committed a crime

230
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,639
deeper than the Pacific Ocean!

231
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,599
Tell those two drunks that I was here.

232
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
I'll deal with you later.

233
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,879
So your workout paid off after all.

234
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,440
Hold them both

235
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,759
till they sober up.

236
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,359
Let's drink!

237
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,800
-Luo Ke, drink up!
-Cheers.

238
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,820
(To Trains)

239
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,953
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station,
Entrance 6)

240
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,239
Guan Qianya, do you have a death wish?

241
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
You're screwed if he finds you.

242
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,239
Show me the pictures you took.

243
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,440
These mean a lot to me.

244
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,279
(I don't know what made you think that.)

245
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,680
(But you should know this.)

246
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,680
(Although the person interacting
with you)

247
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,119
(in the game is a virtual character,)

248
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,080
(Behind that, it is the real me.)

249
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,920
(I need to find out)

250
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,080
(if Xu Nian acted
under Xu Guanghan's order)

251
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,519
(to do all those things to me.)

252
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,080
Come on in.

253
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,359
Ms. Guan.

254
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
Is the exclusive news you said

255
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:24,680
ready?

256
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,920
My ex-wife's best friend
is pushing me for it.

257
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,159
She asked me out for dinner.

258
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,440
Do what you have to do.

259
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,080
I need to sort out the materials.

260
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,159
Is it ready?

261
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,359
Yes, but it's still not enough.

262
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,840
I need to take another risk.

263
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,680
Please come in.

264
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,480
Miss, make yourself at home.

265
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,159
Okay.

266
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,879
Aunt, I'll put the fruits on the table.

267
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,399
Thank you.

268
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:58,720
Aunt.

269
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,759
Do you know
the little boys in this photo?

270
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,840
They are my sons.

271
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Both of them?

272
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,239
She hung up on me?

273
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,239
I can't believe it.

274
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,039
Stop calling.

275
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,840
Granny?

276
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,399
We brushed past one another.

277
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,519
Are you blind

278
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,960
or you just don't give a darn?

279
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,119
Why are you here?

280
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,159
That's because I know

281
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:47,519
a girl with a lot of questions

282
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,039
is going to ask me questions.

283
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Granny.

284
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
You told me to work in Bay House,

285
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
and now,

286
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,359
you made me look after a patient
at the nursing home.

287
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,600
Are these two things

288
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,519
connected?

289
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,399
Yes.

290
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,680
I forgot to tell you this.

291
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,320
I'm planning

292
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,920
to adjust the wages for both
to the same amount.

293
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,200
Don't think about buying me with money.

294
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,080
Look.

295
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,279
I love money,

296
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,399
and I'm a fool at times.

297
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:20,759
But I'm a good girl.

298
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,119
Usually, good girls

299
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,960
will only pull their own weight.

300
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,039
They won't go snooping around.

301
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,879
Well, that's my own problem.

302
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,239
Granny.

303
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,080
Is the lady in the nursing home

304
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,720
who has a brain tumor

305
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,279
Lu Xiao's mother?

306
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,680
What do you think?

307
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,239
I've seen the picture before.

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,639
I think she is.

309
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:47,119
What if I say otherwise?

310
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,920
So is she or is she not?

311
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,519
You're making me confused.

312
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
Find out the answer by yourself.

313
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm leaving.

314
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Granny!

315
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,159
"Tomorrow is like a box of chocolates."

316
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,560
"What's its taste like?
It's full of imagination."

317
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:12,800
Granny!

318
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,159
Why are you suddenly
reciting the lyrics?

319
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,680
So Lu Xiao's mother is Aunt Youya.

320
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,639
I bet Lu Xiao sneaked out

321
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:34,840
to see her the other day.

322
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,279
So did they meet up or not?

323
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,320
Does he know his mum is sick?

324
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,680
No, I bet he doesn't know.

325
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:44,800
Otherwise,

326
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,399
Granny wouldn't ask me

327
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,519
to look after her.

328
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,279
So she wants me

329
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,560
to pass the message to Lu Xiao?

330
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,560
But why?

331
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
Why are you drinking alone?

332
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,239
Qianya, if you had come home earlier,

333
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:07,879
I wouldn't

334
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,560
have to drink alone.

335
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Kele.

336
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,039
I finally know

337
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,999
what Xu Guanghan's real motive is.

338
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,359
He created Y4, the virtual characters,

339
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
instead of letting them
become the real stars.

340
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,440
That way, he can control them

341
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,680
and make money,

342
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,200
without anyone finding it out.

343
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,759
This is his real plan.

344
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,600
So you were taking pictures
the other day

345
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,759
to expose Xu Guanghan?

346
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,920
What else could it be?

347
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,800
Did you think

348
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,879
I sneaked in through the tunnel

349
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,279
for the sake of love?

350
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:50,759
My goodness!

351
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,359
You didn't do it for love?

352
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,600
You know what?

353
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,720
Your image in my heart is almost ruined.

354
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,759
Luckily, you're still standing.

355
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,800
Hold on.

356
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,600
You actually made a counter-plan
behind my back?

357
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,039
Kele, thanks to you,

358
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,320
I've figured it all out.

359
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
When the plan works,

360
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,879
it will cost you

361
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,279
your job at the Bay House.

362
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,560
But I'll support you financially
forever.

363
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,480
No.

364
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,480
It's not me that I'm worried about.

365
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,200
I can always find another job.

366
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm worried

367
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,440
that if you expose Xu Guanghan,

368
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,519
what will happen
to the four of them

369
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,119
if he goes down?

370
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,080
They don't know anything.

371
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
How are they going to survive out there?

372
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
They are real people.

373
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,480
They have the right to know the truth.

374
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,920
If they don't want

375
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,320
to live underground,

376
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:45,720
no one has the right to imprison them.

377
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,359
They have the right to know the truth?

378
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,080
That's right.

379
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm going out.

380
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,519
Where are you going?

381
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
I want to tell Lu Xiao the truth

382
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,560
about his mother's illness.

383
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,279
I'm coming with you.

384
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,840
I'll ask Xu Nian what he thinks

385
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,159
and give him a chance to choose.

386
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,039
Let's go.

387
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,119
Why are you still here?

388
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
I came back.

389
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,320
Go home and sleep
if you were drunk.

390
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,960
There's no honey water today.

391
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,440
Lu Xiao, I have something to ask you.

392
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,720
What did you want to ask?

393
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,720
When you were drunk the other day,

394
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
you told me that you sneaked out once.

395
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
You went to see her, right?

396
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,600
She's your mum, right?

397
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,840
I didn't expect you to come back again
so soon.

398
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
I have something to ask you.

399
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,080
Perfect timing.
I have a surprise for you.

400
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,279
I don't need surprises.

401
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,840
I just want to ask you a question.

402
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
See the surprise,

403
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,720
and I'll answer your question later.

404
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,239
Come on.

405
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,600
Don't alert the others.

406
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,600
Are you out of your mind?

407
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,999
It's none of your business
whether or not she's my mum!

408
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,279
Stay out of it!

409
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,080
Lu Xiao.

410
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,039
Did you know
that your mother has cancer?

411
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,999
Lu Xiao, don't you want to go out
to see her?

412
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,720
Spend time with her

413
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,159
during her final days.

414
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,560
You'll create memories together!

415
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,200
Even when she's gone,

416
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,440
you can recall memories
of you two together!

417
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm going to bed.

418

Lu Xiao, hear me out!

419
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm going to bed!

420
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,039

even if Xu Guanghan didn't tell you to?

442
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:02,039
Why would you ask that?

443
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,239
We first met

444
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,800
in the game.

445
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,080
Xu Guanghan sent you, right?

446
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,800
What did he tell you?

447
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,320
Mr. Xu told me

448
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,480
that some players are more picky

449
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
and need one-on-one live service

450
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,920
to meet their requirements.

451
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,920
And?

452
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,999
And I have to make you
fall in love with me.

453
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,080
And?

454
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,039
That's all.

455
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,119
So you approached me

456
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,480
simply because of the task
that Xu Guanghan gave you?

457
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,680
In the beginning, yes.

458
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,960
At first, you were just a player to me.

459
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:48,600
Later on...

460
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,840
I couldn't control myself.

461
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,680
You once told me

462
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,879
to follow my heart in everything I do.

463
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,359
Eat and drink to my heart's content.

464
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:05,840

I want to know everything about you.
