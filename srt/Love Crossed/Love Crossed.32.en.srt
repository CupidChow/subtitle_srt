1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:00,959
Don't worry.

2
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,480
I've prepared

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,159
one final trump card for you.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,719
What is it?

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
It's an item

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,159
enough to prove

7
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,600
all of Xu Guanghan's crimes.

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,479
I hope you get your hands on it soon.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,279
I hope you will succeed.

10
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,440
Good luck. Love you all.

11
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,000
Evidence to bring me to justice...

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,159
Boss,

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,120
could the evidence be with Fushun?

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,760
Why else would they risk
breaking into your place

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,200
to rescue her?

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,560
Would I not have noticed

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,919
if it was with her?

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,560
Also, who gave you the permission
to call her Fushun?

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,680
Search the area.

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,560
Leave no stone unturned.

21
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,159
Understood.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,319
Go.

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,839
Wouldn't it be a waste
of electricity to keep this plugged in?

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,680
The old lady isn't very thrifty.

27
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,320
Xu Guanghan's men.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,199
Stop right there!

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
(This elevator goes to B1)

30
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,360
Where are we?

31
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,559
Wait.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,479
That's the cosmetic store I worked at.

33
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,199
Follow me.

34
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,279
Come on.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,340
(Su Lie)

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,399
Get in.

37
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,639
We can hide out here for a while.

38
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:15,839
Okay.

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,759
Welcome.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,759
Would you like

41
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,119
to buy a gift for your girlfriend?

42
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,080
Or would it be for yourselves?

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,320
Or... Are you planning
to give each other a makeover?

44
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,720
You'll have to act fast, though.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
We have a team-building session today.

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
We'll be closing soon.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
Stop wasting our time.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,240
Did you see two people pass by earlier?

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
Yes.

50
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,240
You guys.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
I meant a guy and a lady.

52
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,199
Then, no.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
Gentlemen, could you

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,759
help me close the sliding doors?

55
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,720
It's a bit heavy. Thank you.

56
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,600
Over here.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,679
Oh, no!

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Qiqi!

59
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:13,919
Can you push it?

60
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,800
No.

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,799
We can't get out.

62
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,040
Boss!

63
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,440
Found it.

64
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
Is this what you call evidence?

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,119
You were played by her.

66
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,600
Boss, as per your orders,

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,839
we've checked every single room.

68
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,519
We've checked
all the electronic gadgets as well.

69
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,160
There is no sign
of the so-called evidence.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
I was wondering if it's possible
that they had already taken it away.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,200
What would they do if they had

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,239
the evidence?

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
We've been searching this place
for so long.

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,839
If they had the evidence,

75
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,160
they'd have acted by now.

76
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,399
But we haven't heard

77
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,959
from them until now.

78
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,480
That leaves only one possibility.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
They don't have the evidence either.

80
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,839
What should we do now?

81
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,200
Don't worry.

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,079
No matter where the evidence is,

83
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,359
it'll end up in my possession.

84
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,519
Is it working?

85
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,760
No.

86
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,959
Try this then.

87
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:43,959
No.

88
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,359
I can't get it open

89
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,480
without the right tools.

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
What will we do now?

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,279
Qianya and the others
are waiting for us at the library.

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,839
I looked around as well.

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
I couldn't find the spare key.

94
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,559
If worse comes to worst,

95
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,399
let's break it open.

96
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,119
We can't.

97
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,880
If we break it open,
the alarms will go off.

98
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,799
I know.

99
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,160
But what else can we do?

100
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll give it another try.

101
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,399
All right. That's enough.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,920
Don't tire yourself further.

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,239
If we can't get out,

104
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,359
we'll just stay here for the night.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,119
Someone will definitely
open the door tomorrow.

106
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,119
Okay.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Wait here.

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,799
Guan Qianya.

109
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,640
It's been a long time.

110
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,399
Why are you here?

111
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,079
I thought I'd check out some books.

112
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,920
I never expected to see you here.

113
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,679
What a fateful coincidence.

114
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,000
Who are you waiting for?

115
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,480
None of your business.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,559
It's not Xu Nian, is it?

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,559
I was right.

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,279
I saw him earlier.

119
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,359
I can take you to him.

120
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,000
Guan Qianya,

121
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,720
what is wrong with you?

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,279
Have you fallen in so deep
into the game?

123
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,679
Did you really see Xu Nian?

124
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course, I did.

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
The entire street is full
of his advertisements.

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,000
Why are you waiting
for a virtual character?

127
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,119
You wouldn't understand.

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Tell me.

129
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,760
What exactly happened?

130
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,040
Who are you waiting for?

131
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,359
Tell me.

132
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,079
After all,

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,359
who else would be willing to help you

134
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,720
besides me?

135
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,559
Qi Chuan,

136
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,799
do you still see
Xu Guanghan as your enemy?

137
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,720
You must be hungry.

138
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,920
Here, eat something.

139
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,959
Kele,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,880
where did you get all this food?

141
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,399
These aren't mine. They're Qiqi's.

142
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,720
Qiqi?

143
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,720
The cashier?

144
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,679
Yes. She's my colleague.

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
Qiqi doesn't have a lot

146
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,640
but she always

147
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,799
has a bunch of snacks.

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
Is it really okay

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
to eat her food?

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,599
It's fine.

151
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,719
If she knew that it was you
who ate her snacks,

152
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,799
she'd be over the moon.

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,159
Because you're her favorite character

154
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,359
in the game.

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,479
That's not me.

156
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,559
That's the virtual Lu Xiao.

157
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,880
I'm the real me.

158
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,840
Strong survival instincts.

159
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Eat up.

160
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,119
Aren't you going to eat?

161
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

162
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,640
I'm happy just seeing you eat.

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,799
Okay.

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,960
(She hopes that you'll be able)

165
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,000
(to let go of your worries and concerns)

166
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,960
(and live happily under the sun.)

167
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,080
If you need my help,

168
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,440
I will definitely do my best.

169
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,400
Because...

170
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,119
Kele, close your eyes.

171
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,799
Why?

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Trust me. Close your eyes.

173
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,479
What... What are you trying to do?

174
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,840
Don't open your eyes. I'm not done yet.

175
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,880
Are you done?

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,679
Not yet.

177
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,479
Almost. Just wait a bit longer.

178
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,520
Kele, you can open your eyes now.

What dinner is it called again?

182
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,359
A candlelight dinner.

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,320
Right.

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
A candlelight dinner.

♪Because you are the only one

187
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,599
we're having dinner
with just the two of us outside.

188
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,239

Guan Qianya,

205
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,599
I always thought

206
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,159
that you were a silly woman
who gave up her entire career for love.

207
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,200
But I never expected
that you did so many things

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,520
to oppose Xu Guanghan.

209
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,799
That's amazing.

210
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,559
If only I had trusted you back then.

211
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,080
I wouldn't have lost out on so much.

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
It's not too late.

213
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,919
Would you be willing to help me?

214
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:51,960
Of course.

215
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,880
But on one condition.

216
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,039
What is it?

217
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
You know

218
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,960
that my concert is happening next week.

219
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,840
If we're going to take down Xu Guanghan,

220
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,479
we have to do it before next week.

221
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,880
That way, I'll get to sing more songs.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,479
That's the reason

223
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,359
you're willing to help me?

224
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,400
Can it not be?

225
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,159
Life itself is boring.

226
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,799
That's why everyone is chasing after

227
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,239
the meaning of life.

228
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,679
Acting all deep does not suit you.

229
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
Tell me the real reason
you want to help me.

230
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,119
Because... I love you.

231
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,080
Reason not accepted.

232
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,119
Because I want to take down Xu Guanghan.

233
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,039
I want all the women in the world

234
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,400
to love only me and not Y4.

235
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,960
I want world peace.

236
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,440
Are you done?

237
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,359
Are you aware

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,479
that you'll be in danger

239
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,200
if Xu Guanghan finds out
that you're helping us?

240
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,479
Of course.

241
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,000
But the best he can do
is to lock me up in the virtual world

242
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,919
and starve me to death.

243
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,719
I got an idea.

244
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,479
Why don't I name my next song,
"virtual world"?

245
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,119
What do you think?

246
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,960
Oh, well. Not the time for creativity.

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
How do you want me to help you?

248
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,760
Take me to Xu Nian.

249
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,960
These guys...

250
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,799
How are they so different
from their characters in the game?

251
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,039
Ruined your fantasies, did they?

252
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,599
I've told you.

253
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,320
That game was designed

254
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,880
to scam women like you!

255
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,119
Are the other two guys
so different as well?

256
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,520
Quite.

257
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,400
But not as different as these two.

258
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,239
Hello? Ms. Guan?

259
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,000
How is it?

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,159
Did you meet up with Kele and Lu Xiao?

261
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,719
No, they never came.

262
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,320
So I'm going to look for them.

263
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,479
But I'm worried that they'll be back

264
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,559
after I leave the place.

265
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,799
How about this?

266
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,039
I'll head over there right now.

267
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,799
No, no, no.

268
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,880
Don't come. Your leg was injured.

269
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,239
Get Su Lie and Luo Ke to come over.

270
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,119
Those two...

271
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

272
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,039
I'll let them know.

273
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,039
Look.

274
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,440
Ms. Guan went to look for the others.

275
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,880
Just in case,

276
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
could one of you

277
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,400
go and keep watch at the library?

278
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,320
The world outside is dangerous.

279
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm not going.

280
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,679
You'll put on a disguise.
You won't be that obvious.

281
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,640
I'm not going, no matter what.

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,039
No, I mean...
What's the worst that could happen?

283
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:22,919
Luo Ke.

284
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,239
Mr. Cui is injured.

285
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,679
Either you go,

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,840
or I'll go.

287
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,640
If you're so concerned about Mr. Cui,

288
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,440
then you go.

289
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,400
Fine. I'll go.

290
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,400
Be careful out there.

291
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,039
Don't worry.

292
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,520
You were injured?

293
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
It's fine.

294
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,039
I already treated it.

295
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,479
Let me take a look at it.

296
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,919
I'm worried.

297
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,200
It's not suitable...

298
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,559
We're an old married couple.
What's not suitable about it?

299
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,359
Ow! Ow!

300
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,479
Okay, okay. I'll let you take a look.

301
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,760
Wait.

302
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,640
I need to use the washroom.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
Don't go too far!

304
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,919
Let me see it.

305
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,559
Here.

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,799
Ow! Ow!

307
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,440
Goodness! You...

308
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't leave it like this!

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,799
Your wound is inflamed!

310
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,119
Cui Hengzhi!

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,119
Must you always push yourself too hard?

312
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,719
Will you never learn
to take care of yourself?

313
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,679
No...

314
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
Listen up.

315
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,679
You're listening to me this time.

316
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,239
You have to go to the hospital!

317
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Okay. I'll do as you say.

318
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,359
You made me worry on purpose,
didn't you?

319
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,640
It's so cold.

320
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,460
(The Colorist)

321
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:39,700
(Secret)

322
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,119
Kele?

323
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,160
Kele?

324
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,880
Take a break if you're tired.

325
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,119
I'll look for the evidence.

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,680
No, I'm fine.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,560
It's just...
We've been looking for it for so long.

328
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,280
But we still don't know where it is.

329
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,800
This book here says that

330
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,319
if you have something you want,

331
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,439
you have to believe that you'll get it.

332
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,479
The universe will receive your signal

333
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,479
and try its best to help you.

334
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,640
But I've been sending signals
all day long here.

335
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,479
Where is the evidence?

336
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,839
What about your book?

337
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,280
Our books are volumes
of the same series.

338
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,959
I think the content is connected.

339
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Let's not rush to conclusions.

340
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,760
Let's keep looking.

341
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,239
I'm sure the evidence is inside somehow.

What are you trying to do?

00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,920
My leg...

360
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,239
I think I twisted my ankle.

361
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,599
It hurts.

362
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,000
Please help me.

363
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,800
My leg...

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
Could you help me up?

365
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,040
Are... Are you okay?

366
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,199
It hurts. I twisted my ankle.

367
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,079
Why won't you look at me?

368
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,599
Do I look that scary?

369
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
No, no, no. I...

370
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,800
It's because...

371
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm afraid of women with red lipstick.

372
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,800
Hold on.

373
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,920
Is this better?

374
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,719
You look so much

375
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,599
like Su Lie in Love Boys.

376
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,239
You're not him, are you?

377
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
No, I'm not.

378
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,319
Then what's your name?

379
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,760
I'm Su... Su Liang.

380
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,119
Su Liang?

381
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,280
Hello, Su Liang.

382
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,520
I'm Zhang Lanlan. Nice to meet you.

383
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,199
It's late. Why didn't you go home?

384
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,079
Why are you sleeping all alone here?

385
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,359
I... I'm waiting for my friends.

386
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,199
Friends?

387
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,400
You must be bored waiting alone.

388
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,160
I'll keep you company
while you're waiting.

389
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,160
Don't... Don't you need to go home?

390
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm all right.

391
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm working as an intern here.

392
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,400
And my house is nearby as well.

393
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,760
I can go back a bit later.

394
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,000
Okay.

395
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,520
Did you bring your phone?

396
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Let's play a game together.

397
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,800
I did.

398
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,800
But I'm not used to it yet.

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,079
That's okay. I'll teach you.

400
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,520
Here.

401
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,920
You start this up first.

402
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,439
Right. Then put your hand here.

403
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:50,479
I'll do the same.

404
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,719
We've searched the night markets,
restaurants and bars.

405
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,640
Think. Where else did you guys go?

406
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,079
We don't often meet
in the outside world.

407
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,599
Besides,

408
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,000
he can't go to my office
to look for me either.

409
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,400
What am I going to do?

410
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,239
You don't think something actually
happened to him, did you?

411
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Don't overthink it.

412
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,439
Who knows?

413
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,280
He might be on his way
to the library right now.

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,439
Let's go back to the library.

415
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,479
Take me to a place.

416
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,280
I read this in a book once.

417
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,520
The book said

418
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,319
that lovers in ancient times

419
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,280
didn't get to meet often.

420
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,920
So they'd use the lantern festivals
as an excuse

421
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,160
to go on a date.

422
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,640
There were no
communication tools back then.

423
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,599
The streets were crowded and noisy.

424
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,000
But they were never worried

425
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,119
that they would be separated.

to get the car here?

441
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,839
It's not my fault.

442
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,119
I had to cross over the entire city

443
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,000
to get here from your place.

444
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,199
But

445
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,439
why did you ask me
to bring the minivan here?

446
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:54,199
I'm a music producer.

447
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,319
The reason why
I forgo sleep and stand in the wind

448
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,560
would only be producing music.

449
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,560
Did you get inspiration for a new song?

450
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,760
But, why would you need a minivan

451
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,239
to produce a new song?

452
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,119
Are you going
to name your new song, "minivan"?

453
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,199
Why do you talk so much?

454
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,199
If you keep talking,

455
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,199
I'll lose all of my inspiration.

456
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll stop. I'll stop.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,119
I'll leave right now.

458
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,280
Oh, right. Take this car back.

459
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Okay.

460
