I am fine.

She's spending the holidays alone,
pity on her.

Let's go get some bubbles.

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,639
Who is she talking to?

25
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,279
Have a bite.

26
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
No.

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
Are they crazy or am I crazy?

00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,240
Miss.

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,839
Happy holidays.

30
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,360
Spending the holidays alone?

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Do you need a boyfriend
on New Year's Eve?

32
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:48,919
I have a boyfriend.

33
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,440
It's good you have a boyfriend.

34
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,399
But that doesn't mean

35
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,240
you have a perfect relationship.

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,679
Your boyfriend isn't home all the time.

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,479
That's when you need our

38

41

Here.

42
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Aren't you selling spectacles?

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,919
You are such a brag.

44
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,119
This is different.

45
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,199

Do you see the boys?

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,480
I see them.

54
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,679
They are our Love Boys.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,799
Look.

56
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,559
Each girl gets to choose

57
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,079
the type that they like.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,720
How is it?

59
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,480
With it, you'll have perfect love.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,239
I don't need it.
My love life is perfect.

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,399
Goodbye.

62
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,160
No.

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Your boyfriend is not as perfect as our

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
Love Boys.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Miss.

66
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,600
Dad! Have you docked?

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,600
Kele.

68
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,320
I can't go back to be
with you this time.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
The ship's fishing mission

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
hasn't completed.

71
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,239
We need to go to the next stop.

72
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,519
When are you coming back?

73
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,399
It'll take two or three months
at the earliest.

74
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
I am sorry, Kele.

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,399
I promised to be with you
on New Year's Eve.

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,600
I can't make it this time.

77
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,160
It's all right, dad.

78
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,279
Two or three months

79
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,559
will pass very quickly.

80
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,320
Are you still staying with your friend?

81
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
You two girls

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,359
must take care of each other.

83
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,959
Remember to pay rent.

84
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,239
Let me know if you don't have enough.

85
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll remit it to you.

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't worry about me, dad.

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,119
I have a stable income.

88
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,040
I am on my way to work now.

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
And

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,480
I'll soon get my year-end bonus.

91
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,600
Kele, I feel so bad for

92
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,959
not coming home this time.

93
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,279
By the way,

94
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,399
have you received the gift I bought you?

95
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,760
What gift?

96
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,519
Hello?

97
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,839
(TodayMart.)
Happy new year, boss.

98
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,279
Welcome.

99
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,880
What did you say, boss?

100
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,079
I am not your boss.

101
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Did you sell the shop?

102
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,880
Welcome.

103
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,119
I didn't sell the shop,
but you are fired.

104
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,399
Why fire me?

105
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,920
You are late for five minutes.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,760
Isn't that a good reason?

107
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,440
Yes.

108
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,119
Just five minutes.
You are being harsh.

109
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm not harsh.

110
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,040
People who hold multiple part-time jobs

111
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,799
should manage their time.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,239
I didn't work part-time today.

113
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,200
I bought a computer
for my boyfriend today.

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm not interested.

115
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,559
I planned

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,399
to fire you tomorrow.

117
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,079
But you didn't bother to work hard

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,119
on your last day here.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,279
You don't value your job.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,640
How would I know

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,519
today is my last day?

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,279
If you care about this job,

123
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,559
you'll treat each day

124
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,040
as your last day and
work hard, won't you?

125
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes.

126
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,679
We don't need any brainwashing.

127
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll leave.

128
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:56,799
Wait.

129
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,200
Year-end bonus.

130
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't you like to eat
expired rice balls?

131
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,720
Year-end bonus.

132
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,359
Next year's.

133
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,239
The following year.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,200
The year after.

135
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,079
Enough?

136
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,279
This is mine.

137
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,119
Only this?

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,559
Do you want me?

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,119
Please come again.

140
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,600
Never.

141
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,640
Have you waited long?

142
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,039
Why do you want to see me suddenly?

143
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,880
I want to spend
the New Year's Eve with you.

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,039
I wanted to ask you out a few days ago.

145
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,880
But I am on the night shift.

146
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm suddenly free today.

147
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,080
Can you accompany me
to watch the fireworks?

148
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,159
I can't go to the waterfront with you.

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
It's all right.

150
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,359
Go get busy if you have something to do.

151
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,119
Well then.

152
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,679
This is your new year gift.

153
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,280
You don't like it?

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
I thought you like it

155
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,559
the last time we went shopping.

156
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,840
I bought it for you.

157
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,479
Kele.

158
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,479
Let's break up.

159
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,000
Why?

160
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,479
I fell in love with someone else.

161
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,640
I agreed to meet you today

162
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,039
because I want to tell you myself.

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,039
It's over.

164
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,799
When we were first together,

165
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,359
didn't you say we'd never be separated?

166
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,599
People will change.

167
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,799
Everything will change too.

168
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,400
Be realistic, Jiang Kele.

169
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,479

But you are fired.

224
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,960
I didn't steal food
from the store, boss.

225
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,400
This rice ball is expired.

226

I'm helping you to get rid of it.

227
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,640

You don't have to eat it.

236
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,440
But on your last day of work,

237
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,599
you are still stealing food.

238
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,799
Last day of work?

239
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm not aware today is my last day.

240
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,960
If you're passionate,

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,840
you'll treat each day as your last day.

242
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,159
You are right, boss.

243
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,960

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,679
Yes, I do.

00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,359
No.

246
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,400
You're not fit to work in my store.

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Go away now.

248
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,159
Boss.

249
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,719
What about my year-end bonus?

250
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,880
Oh yes.

251
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:30,919

In all my working years,

259
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,559
I've never been so proud

260
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,679
as I am today.

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,719
Thank you.

262
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,960
Yes!

263
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,479
Let's go to another place.

264
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
Where are we?

265
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,880
It's your house.

266
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,080
My house?

267
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,440
Look at this.

268
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,679
So many dishes.

269
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,039
Did you cook these?

270
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,640
Where did you go, Kele?

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,200
Wash your hands and let's eat.

272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,559
Dad.

273
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,239
I miss you so much.

274
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,119
Why are you only back now?

275
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:36,960
Are you going to leave again?

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,840
Listen.

277
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,960
If you are leaving,

278
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,239
teach me how to cook
braised fish in soy sauce.

279
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,760
Whenever I miss you,

280
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
I'll cook this dish myself.

281
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,880
I won't leave you again.

282
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,239
I'll stay with you every day.

283
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll cook anything that you want to eat.

284
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,080
Really?

285
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,039
Let's eat.

286
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,319
Thank you.

287
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,280
I know they are not real.

288
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,239
But I am truly happy.

289
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,959
I haven't seen my dad for a long time.

290
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,920
As long as you are happy,

291
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,280
why do you care if it's real or not?

292
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,439
Are you fulfilling my wishes?

293
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
What about my third wish?

294
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,479
I'm afraid I can't help you

295
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,160
with your third wish.

296
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,119
That depends on

297
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,839
whether you're willing to trust me?

298
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,079
(I didn't expect to return to
the new year's countdown)

299
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,239
(to count down with someone I love.)

300
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,199
(He can realize such a wish too.)

301
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,280
(Lu Xiao and I)

302
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
(can be considered as
love at first sight.)

303
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,557
(One year later.)

304
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,880
(One year later.)
(They are a girl's perfect boyfriend.)

305
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,839
(They are top idols.)

306
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,920
(They are the four
most-watched men in the world.)

307
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,560
(Today they are celebrating
their third birthday.)

308
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
(They are the Love Boys.)

309
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,079
Did you use to work
in a convenience store?

310
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,000
This is not important, Qiqi.

311
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,439
Don't you think

312
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,439
my love story with Lu Xiao

313
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,719
is very touching?

314
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,199
I've listened to the story of

315
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,479
you and Lu Xiao numerous times.

316
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,040
I am late.

317
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,079
I got to go now.

318
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,800
You know

319
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,680
the Love Boys are celebrating
their third birthday today.

320
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,959
Hold on.

321
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,280
Are you going to the birthday party too?

322
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,719
What do you mean?

323
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Do you think I am free?

324
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
I told you so much

325
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,280
because I want you to feel touched

326
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,359
and stand in for me.

327
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,560
So that I can go to
Lu Xiao's birthday party.

328
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
Qiqi.

329
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,400
I know you are the best.

330
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
Could you stand in for me?

331
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,319
You don't have a ticket anyway.

332
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:33,920
You can only stand outside.

333
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,839
It's better to stand here.

334
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,839
You earn while you stand.

335
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,040
You sound as if you have a ticket.

336
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:41,880
Well,

337
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,736
I have one ticket.

338
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,920
(Birthday party admission pass)

339
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
How did you get it?

340
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,079
Did you join the Lavender Club?

341
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,920
That's impossible.

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,920
It's expensive.

343
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,119
You can't afford it.

344
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,040
If you promise to stand in for me,

345
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,119
I'll tell you

346
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,599
how to get an admission ticket

347
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,319
without spending money.

348
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,680
So today next year,

349
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
you can be like me.

350
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,959
You can officially

351
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,119
attend the birthday party

352
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,280
to see Lu Xiao.

353
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
What do you think?

354
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,280
Besides,

355
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,119
I have a bracelet

356
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,719
from the second anniversary
birthday party.

357
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,199
It's from Lu Xiao.

358
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,439
It's a limited edition.

359
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,319
I'm willing to do it.

360
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,040
Really?

361
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,199
I love you.

362
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
(They are superstars.)

363
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,719
(But they are not the usual superstars.)

364
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,000
(They are idols.)

365
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,599
(But they are not the idols you know.)

366
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,880
(Their existence)

367
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,520
(redefines the meaning of
an superstar and idol.)

368
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,680
(They are virtual humans,)

369
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,599
(more perfect than real idols.)

370
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,199
(They are true knights)

371
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,599
(who bring happiness to
thousands of women.)

372
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,400
(His gentle smile)

373
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,760
(warms you up like a breeze.)

374
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,040
(Lu Xiao.)

375
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,520
(Xu Nian, as deep as the autumn,)

376
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,920
(is full of intellectual charm.)

377
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,400
(Su Lie, strength and beauty in one,)

378
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,839
(is a guardian who belongs only to you.)

379
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,000
Su Lie, Su Lie.

380
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,640
(Being with him)

381
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
(is always full of joy.)

382
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,959
(Luo Ke, the vitamin boy.)

383
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,079
Our event today has been cancelled?

384
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,359
I didn't choose a proper date, Ms. Guan.

385
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,119
It clashes with Y4's birthday.

386
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:21,806
(Crush On Love)

387
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,560
To celebrate these four men's
three-year-old birthday,

388
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,319
don't you think it's ridiculous?

389
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,439
Because of this ridiculous matter,

390
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,119
none of our female guests turned up.

391
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,880
All the single ladies in the city

392
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,119
went to their birthday party.

393
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,599
None of them came
to our offline dating event.

394
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,680
What about our long-term female guests?

395
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,959
Those few we employed?

396
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,280
None of them came.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,199
Put in place the backup plan.

398
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,520
(Lu Xiao.)

399
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,800
(Attention to all ladies
who are joining the birthday party.)

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,119
(You can now enter with your ticket.)

401
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,959
(Lu Xiao)
See you soon.

402
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Oh no, it must be something bad.

403
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,239
Hello.

404
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,079
Why are you panting?

405
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,880
What's up?

406
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,839
I'm organizing an 8-minute speed dating event.

407
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
The ladies didn't come.

408
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,000
Can you come?

409
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
I have already reminded you.

410
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,160
Your dating event is exactly on the same day

411
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,839
as the Love Boys' birthday party.

412
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,839
Will anyone come?

413
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,560
No.

414
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,520
You are my only friend.

415
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,479
You must support me.

416
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,439
I'll pay you.

417
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,040
Lend me eight minutes

418
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,280
and get a free one-year rental.

419
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,760
No, I don't have even
one minute to spare.

420
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,000
I got to hang up now.

421
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,719
Hello?

422
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,000
Ms. Guan.

423
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,920
Your backup plan isn't working.

424
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,040
I curse you to be hit by a car.

425
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,160
Luckily, it didn't hit me.

426
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,599
They are not here?

427
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,280
It's more than an hour.

428
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,920
Seriously.

429
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
Look at this.

430
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,640
What's this?

431
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,199
What's this? No one shows up.

432
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,400
Finally, a female guest has arrived.

433
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,280
Pretty.

434
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,920
(Crush On Love)
We don't have to wait for eight minutes.

435
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,079
I want her.

436
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,400
Yes, she's the one.

437
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,959
She's mine.

438
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't wait, choose her.

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,199
I want her too.

440
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,680
Calm down, everyone.

441
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,040
Let me introduce to you.

442
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,199
She is

443
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,520
the CEO of Crush On Love.

444
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,119
Ms. Guan Qianya.

445
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,079
What?

446
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,400
The CEO?

447
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,359
CEO?

448
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,160
Where are the ladies?

449
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,599
So, you're Ms. Guan.

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,079
Please explain to us

451
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,239
what's 8-minute speed dating?

452
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,000
We've waited for 80 minutes.

453
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,560
Yes.

454
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,280
Not a single lady.

455
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes.

456
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,119
Isn't this a dating event?

457
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,920
That's right.

458
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,160
Ms. Guan, I think
this is a good suggestion.

459
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,599
Starting as friends.

460
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,319
Let them become friends with each other.

461
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,319
Dear members, we are very sorry.

462
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,760
It's our mistake
the event didn't go well.

463
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,040
But please rest assured.

464
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,719
We will provide a satisfactory

465
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,479
compensation plan.

466
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
We have to call off today's event.

467
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,640
Once again

468
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
we are very sorry.

469
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,439
How can you do that?

470
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,239
We waited so long.

471
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,040
Our consultants

472
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,839
will get in touch with you soon

473
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,239
with the compensation plan.

474
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,239
Don't leave.

475
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
How could you leave?

476
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,400
Please continue to make friends.

477
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,959
Ms. Guan, you spoke about compensation.

478
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,359
How do we compensate?

479
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,560
I haven't thought about

480
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,880
how to compensate.

481
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,319
We've discussed this in our meeting.

482
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,800
Organizing the event on Y4's birthday

483
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,439
is very risky.

484
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,119
Love Boys.

485
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,040
I will never let you live
beyond four years old.

486
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,670
(Inpatient Department)

487
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,680
(Lu Xiao.)

488
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,959
How is she, doctor?

489
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,160
Right tibia fracture.

490
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,599
No other major problems.

491
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,479
Are you sure she's wearing a helmet

492
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,560
when accident happened?

493
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,640
I am sure.

494
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
There's no injury on the head.

495
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,280
But she's still unconscious.

496
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,400
Looks like a further inspection
is needed.

497
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,439
Thank you, doctor.

498
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
I've paid the medical fee.

499
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:35,959
Here.

500
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,920
This is my number.

501
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,599
Call me

502
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,719
if she wakes up.

503
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,479
I got to attend

504
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,400
to an urgent matter.

505
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,319
I am late.

506
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Ten.

507
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,640
Nine.

508
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,520
Eight.

509
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,400
Seven.

510
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,280
Six.

511
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,199
Five.

512
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,160
Four.

513
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,000
Three.

514
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,839
Two.

515
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,880
One.

516
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:04,920
Happy birthday, Y4.

517
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:13,959
What's the matter?

518
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,640
It's over.

519
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,640
I have a ticket.

520
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,199
Please step back.

521
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:16,880
I have a ticket.

522
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,599
Why can't I go in?

523
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,839
We all have tickets.

524
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:19,959
If you have tickets,

525
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,079
why didn't you enter?

526
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,680
The ticket gate was closed.

527
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,400
(The ticket gate will be closed
ten minutes before the party starts.)

528
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,680
I...

529
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:30,640
Ladies.

530
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,239
We took the trouble to obtain a ticket.

531
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,400
Why can't we go in?

532
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,920
We can enter a concert any time.

533
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,880
Why can't we go in?

534
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,319
Are we too nice to be bullied?

535
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,800
Are you stupid?

536
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,719
How can you compare this with a concert?

537
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,160
When you

538
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,800
attend your boyfriend's birthday party,

539
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,959
you knew the time and venue,

540
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,119
but you were late.

541
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,560
Can you blame your boyfriend?

542
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,800
Y4 are never late for our date.

543
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,800
We're not punctual.

544
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,920
We deserve to be locked out.

545
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,479
Reflect on yourself

546
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,640
why you are late?

547
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
Don't yell out here.

548
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,760
You are not a good girlfriend.

549
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,079
I sent an old lady who fell

550
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,119
to the hospital.

551
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,040
That's why I'm late.

552
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,839
Don't make excuses for yourself.

553
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,280
You are not a member
of the Lavender Club.

554
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,800
How did you know?

555
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,400
By looking at how you dress up.

556
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,160
You can't afford the membership fee.

557
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,959
How did you get the ticket?

558
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,359
I spent two hours every day
playing online games and

559
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,119
clicking on the ad 50,000 times.

560
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,239
I redeemed the ticket with points.

561
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,560
You are poor and have time.

562
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,040
It's so sad to be your lover.

563
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,839
You have money but you're outside too.

564
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,479
Who is she?

565
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,599
What are you doing?
