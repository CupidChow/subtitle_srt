1
00:00:00,519 --> 00:00:01,559
Just tell me.

2
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:02,640
How did you do that?

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,119
To be exact.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,560
I have no idea.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,079
Granny, I came all the way here

6
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,439
just to hear you say "I have no idea"?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,359
Chill. Calm down.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,959
I made you come all the way here

9
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,079
because I wanted
to ask you something else.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Well, how is it going

11
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,360
with you and Lu Xiao?

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, Granny,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,719
why did you suddenly bring that up?

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,080
I'm curious.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,200
You have gone out of your way
to help him.

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,919
I'm sure there are sparks
between you two.

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,080
There are plenty.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,439
Well, I mean hugs and kisses.

19
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,319
I don't mean physical intimacy.

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,880
On a spiritual level.

21
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,520
Your relationship.

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,840
Relationship?

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,680
I've been calling him my boyfriend,
haven't I?

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,040
I don't mean the game.

25
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,159
I mean in real life.

26
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:56,159
How come you haven't confirmed

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,040
what your relationship status is

28
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,599
just yet?

29
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,080
What's there to confirm?

30
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,840
Well, we share the common knowledge.

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,439
Isn't that enough?

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,720
You might think that way,

33
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,080
but do you know

34
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,199
what's on his mind?

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,440
Wait, I don't get it now.

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,919
Look, stop going round in circles.

37
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,959
I'll go back

38
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,959
and get an answer from him.

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,720
No, sit down.

40
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,959
There's no rush.

41
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm trying to say

42
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,919
that if one day,

43
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,839
he has come round it

44
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,000
and wants to be with you,

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,959
how do you plan
to start the relationship?

46
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,559
How do I start the relationship
with him?

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Actually, I haven't figured it out.

48
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,239
Being able to see him every day

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,519
is good enough for me now.

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,959
Are you planning

51
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,519
to stay like this forever?

52
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,400
Has it not crossed your mind

53
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,599
to take him to the amusement park

54
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,919
for a roller coaster ride,
a Ferris wheel ride,

55
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,160
or a merry-go-round?

56
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,519
Haven't you ever

57
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,599
thought about traveling with him,

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,919
going on vacations

59
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,720
and traveling around the world?

60
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I get it now.

61
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,120
Granny.

62
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,279
I'll confirm our relationship status
with him now

63
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,400
and drag him out there.

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,639
That secret passage

65
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,239
is built

66
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,400
for our love!

67
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,000
God, help me.

68
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,639
Great. It's good
you think that way.

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Do it now.

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,440
=Love Crossed=

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,580
=Episode 19=

72
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,440
Lu Xiao, do you remember this place?

73
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,399
Of course.

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,240
This is where our love story began.

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
But it's also the end of it.

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,959
Kele, are you breaking up with me?

77
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,679
I'm sorry, Lu Xiao.

78
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,600
It's all right.

79
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,720
If you're breaking up with me,

80
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,559
I should be the one to apologize.

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,519
I must have done something wrong.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,239
Actually, you could have just told me.

83
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,399
I can change.

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,679
It's not you. It's me.

85
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,000
I have fallen in love with someone else.

86
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,279
Is it the guy you told me before?

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,239
The one who's a lot like me?

88
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought he always upset you

89
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,799
and broke your heart?

90
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,000
That was before.

91
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,160
Every relationship
has its ups and downs.

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,480
I came to see you today

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,880
to thank you for being with me
for the past one year.

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,320
You stayed by my side
when my ex-boyfriend broke up with me.

95
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,200
You made me realize

96
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,320
that there are people who love me
and I deserve to be loved.

97
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,399
You made me
become a better version of myself.

98
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,760
You gave me the courage

99
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,239
to face the reality.

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,559
So I look forward

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,440
to having a relationship
in the real world.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,200
The real world? What is real?

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,839
If you're talking

104
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,279
about the five senses,

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,119
they are just signals

106
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,760
received by our brains.

107
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,160
What you see

108
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,959
and what you feel now,

109
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,200
are none of these real?

110
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,880
I once thought

111
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,440
it's real.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,440
I was willing to indulge myself in it.

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,000
But I realized that wasn't the case.

114
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,119
You made me a convenience store owner.

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,359
I was really happy

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
when he was fired.

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
But when I removed the glasses,

118
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,760
I still had to spend my life
being subservient.

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,679
In the game,

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,119
you gave me a chance

121
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,519
to eat my favourite braised fish
that my dad made.

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
But after I removed the glasses,

123
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,720
it didn't bring my dad back.

124
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,000
The room was still empty,

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,959
and I could only order takeout.

126
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,160
But there's nothing I can do.
That's how it is for me.

127
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:26,799
I live

128
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,720
in the real world.

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,000
So from tomorrow onward,

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,760
I want to have a real relationship

131
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,640
in the real world.

132
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,760
I'll be happy for you

133
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,839
if you can find someone
in the real world

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,320
who can be with you.

135
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,480
But I just want you to know this.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,559
I exist only for you.

137
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:59,480
If he ever upsets you

138
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,799
or stops loving you,

139
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,959
you can always come back to see me.

140
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,959
I'll always be right here
waiting for you.

141
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,799
Lu Xiao.

142
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Goodbye.

143
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,079
Goodbye, Kele.

144
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,399
Remember. You have to be happy.

145
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,180
(Love Boys)

146
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,440
Goodbye, single life!

147
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,919
I shall succeed
in confessing my love today.

148
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,880
Qian...

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,599
Jiang Kele.

150
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,840
Why are you acting so sneaky?

151
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:10,159
I just want to borrow your cosmetics

152
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,080
to doll myself up.

153
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,919
To doll up?

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,559
The last time you did that

155
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,200
was for
the high school stage performance.

156
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,159
Why do you want to dress up
all of a sudden?

157
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,200
You want to confess to Lu Xiao, right?

158
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
What else could it be?

159
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,239
To dance with Xu Nian?

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm just a little nervous
and excited today.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,359
I want to put on a makeup
to boost self-confidence.

162
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:34,200
Save it. Given your makeup skills,

163
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,280
Lu Xiao would get a fright and pass out

164
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
before you even had the chance
to confess to him.

165
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,919
So should I or should I not
put on a makeup?

166
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,359
That's easy.
You want to look pretty, right?

167
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,453
Well, this is perfect.

168
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,880
(The Colorist)
I just bought a new set of cosmetics.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll help you.

170
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,880
Jiang Kele?

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,239
I didn't know you would look so pretty

172
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,880
when you doll yourself up.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,559
Girls look different
when they put on a makeup.

174
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,479
You look like a different person now.

175
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,760
All right. Say no more.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
Or you may be given a sack.

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,599
This way, please.

178
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,239
Hey, no! Jiang Kele!

179
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,320
I still have to say this
even if it got me fired!

180
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,559
Jiang Kele, you're so beautiful!

181
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
So beautiful!

182
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,679
Bro, nice one.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Kele.

184
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Your dressing is different from usual.

185
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Something big is going down today.

186
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,719
Are we having a party?

187
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,640
No.

188
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,320
Better to fall in love than to dance.

189
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm going to confess my love to Lu Xiao.

190
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,400
Well, I shall stay away then.

191
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,719
All the best.

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Who's this pretty girl?

193
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,679
You look pretty today.

194
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,799
What's going on with her today?

195
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,320
It's fine. She merely

196
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,159
put on some makeup.

197
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,200
Why is Su Lie acting like this?

198
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
He's fine.
You charmed the pants off him.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,239
Let's go and play game.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
We're going to play game.

201
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,039
Go on. Off you go.

202
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,599
Damn my charm.

203
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,599
Hello, Granny.

204
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,599
Kele, what's with you today?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,960
Did you put on a makeup?

206
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,559
Your dressing is different today.

207
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,840
Lu Xiao.

208
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,880
Your mom's gone.

209
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
What did you say?

210
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,719
She was a good person.
Why would this happen?

211
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,000
These were her belongings.

212
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,919
Take a look.

213
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,679
She used these every day.

214
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,039
Lu Xiao.

215
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
Lu Xiao.

216
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,640
Grandma Fushun.

217
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,640
I know. You must be wondering

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,080
why I'm here.

219
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,159
After Xu Guanghan took you in,

220
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,239
I would go to the orphanage every year

221
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,159
to visit your mom.

222
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,280
I told her
that you have been living well

223
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
and told her not to worry.

224
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,880
That's why she stopped looking for you.

225
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,880
She spent most of her life

226
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,280
looking for her beloved son.

227
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,960
Good thing she could see you

228
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,159
before she breathed her last.

229
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,159
There's no regret.

230
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,320
Lu Xiao, where are you going?

231
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,359
Don't follow me.

232
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,400
I want to go back to Bay House
and be by myself.

233
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,000
Kele.

234
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,280
What he needs now

235
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,119
is some space.

236
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,280
Be good.

237
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,479
You're back.

238
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
What's wrong?

239
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,239
Did your love confession fail?

240
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,039
Did you succeed?

241
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
What happened?

242
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,799
Lu Xiao's mom has passed away.

243
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,359
Did Lu Xiao know?

244
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,039
I brought him to the hospital.

245
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,840
How is he now?

246
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,760
He wouldn't talk to me.

247
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,799
I wanted to be with him,
but he wouldn't let me.

248
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,520
He went back to Bay House himself.

249
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Kele.

250
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,559
Lu Xiao must be very sad now.

251
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,719
Some people just want to be alone

252
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
when they are sad.

253
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,559
How about this? Today,

254
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,760
let him be by himself.

255
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,359
You can see him tomorrow

256
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,599
and help him

257
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,440
walk out of sadness.

258
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,280
All right?

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,599
Good girl.

260
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:09,840
It's all right.

261
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
You finally come.

262
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,040
After Lu Xiao came back last night,

263
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
he locked himself in the room

264
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,719
and wouldn't come out.

265
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,560
Lu Xiao's mother has passed away.

266
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
I've heard it from Qianya.

267
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,560
But still, he can't starve himself.

268
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,560
I called him this morning,

269
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,479
but he wouldn't open the door
or even say a word.

270
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,959
I don't know what do to.

271
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,479
Why don't you talk to him?

272
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
Lu Xiao, it's me.

273
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:02,040
I brought you breakfast. Eat something.

274
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,439
It's all right.

275
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,239
If you have no appetite,

276
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,719
I'll leave the food outside.

277
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
I'll wait for you out here.

278
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,880
If you are hungry

279
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,599
or feel like talking to someone,
I'm right here for you.

280
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,599
How did it go?

281
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,160
He ignored me too.

282
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,959
What do we do?

283
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
Perhaps, he just wants to be alone.

284
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,239
It's okay. I'll stay here with him.

285
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,319
Don't worry.

286
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,079
All right then.

287
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I'll go to rehearsal
with Su Lie and Luo Ke.

288
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,359
We'll be back later.

289
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,079
Okay.

290
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,800
Look how indolent you are.

291
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,319
When are you going to dance?

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,680
It's not us.

293
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,359
It's Lu Xiao.

294
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,719
We've been waiting for him.

295
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,000
He's not coming today.

296
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:34,800
Why?

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,760
He's sick.

298
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,479
Why does Lu Xiao keep falling sick?

299
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,560
I think he's just trying
to skip the training.

300
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,479
Have you seen him
skip the training before?

301
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,880
It's the two of you.

302
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,319
You keep slacking off.

303
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,800
You are so strict with us,

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,199
but you simply indulge Lu Xiao.

305
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,199
It's not fair.

306
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,119
That's right.

307
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,599
Not fair, huh?

308
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,680
Fine. You two go to talk to him.

309
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,000
-Sure.
-Fine. Let's go.

310
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,560
Captain, let's get started.

311
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,959
I'm ready.

312
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's begin.

313
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,040
Lu Xiao,
since you didn't take your breakfast,

314
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll take the food away.

315
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:28,920
Lu Xiao.

316
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,119
If you keep starving yourself,

317
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,680
you'll not be able to take it.

318
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,239
I made you lunch.

319
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,439
It's your favourite.

320
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,160
Do you want to have a try?

321
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,199
Lu Xiao.

322
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,800
I don't know if you can hear me.

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,199
But I don't mean to bother you.

324
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,319
But you're not eating

325
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,400
or talking to us.

326
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,599
We're all worried about you.

327
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,959
I'm worried about you.

328
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,119
Lu Xiao didn't eat at all?

329
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,959
It looks like he's really sick.

330
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,560
Now you believe me, right?

331
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,839
Since he's sick,
we should call Lei Na.

332
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,199
That's right.

333
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,040
-Let's call her.
-Let's go.

334
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,160
-Wait!
-No!

335
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,359
Why?

336
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,560
Since Lu Xiao is sick,

337
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,959
we should call Lei Na.

338
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,319
Isn't that normal?

339
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,560
Don't you have any sympathy?

340
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,119
She was here just now

341
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,119
when you were at the rehearsal.

342
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
Lei Na told us

343
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,079
not to bother Lu Xiao

344
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,560
and let him rest for a few days.

345
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,599
What sickness does he have
that he needs a few days of rest?

346
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,599
Speaking of lunch,

347
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm starving after the training.

348
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Hey, Jiang Kele.

349
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,719
Can we have the food
you have in your hand?

350
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,839
Sure, it's Lu Xiao's breakfast.

351
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,880
But it's cold now.

352
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,800
How about this?
I'll heat up the food for you.

353
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,000
Sure.

354
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:00,920
Let's go.

355
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,599
Let's go.

356
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,280
Let me introduce you to someone.

357
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,560
This is Zhenyu.

358
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,000
From now on,

359
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
he's family.

360
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,359
Okay.

361
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,146
Zhenyu, this teddy bear is for you.

(Guan Qianya)

388
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,800
(It's late. But Kele isn't back yet.)

389
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,439
(Is she still in Bay House?)

390
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,560
(She's been waiting outside
Lu Xiao's room all day.)

391
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,239
(I'll check up on her now.)

392
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,199
Why am I here?

393
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,599
I don't know.

394
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,520
Lu Xiao.

395
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,800
Lu Xiao!

396
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,400
It's late. Where could he be?

397
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,160
I'll call Grandma Fushun
and ask about it.

398
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,239
I know you're upset.

399
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,760
But it's not safe out here.

400
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,439
Let's go back to Bay House first.

401
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,839
What is it? You want to drink?

402
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,680
I'll drink with you then.

403
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm a good drinker.

404
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,520
How did you find me?

405
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,439
Grandma Fushun told me.

406
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,400
She said this's the place

407
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,479
the dean adopted you.

408
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,479
So this is where

409
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,959
you grew up.

410
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,439
Lu Xiao.

411
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,920
You must be missing her, right?

412
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,280
If...

413
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,079
If I hadn't left,

414
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,520
my mom wouldn't have died so soon.

415
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
If I hadn't left,

416
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:11,400
my mom would be with me
for a little longer.

417
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,239
It's all my fault.

418
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,920
Lu Xiao, this isn't your fault.

419
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,839
You can't put all the blame on yourself.

420
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,599
Fine, even if you hadn't left back then,

421
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,839
you would probably
have a different life now.

422
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,439
But there might be other regrets.

423
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,000
My dad told me

424
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,239
that we shouldn't

425
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,479
regret the past.

426
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,359
We need to move on
and live in the moment.

427
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll take you to a place.

428
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,839
Xu Nian.

429
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,880
Why haven't I heard you

430
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,959
talk about your parents?

431
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,439
I grew up in Bay House
since I was a kid.

432
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,280
I don't know who they are.

433
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,400
What could I say about them?

434
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,560
Don't you ever feel curious

435
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
or haven't you thought
about looking for them?

436
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,680
I heard from Xu Guanghan

437
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
that my mom is an irresponsible person.

438
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,040
When she was pregnant with me,

439
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,959
she didn't even know who my father was.

440
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,599
She left me in the hospital
after giving birth to me.

441
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,439
Having a mother like this,

442
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,119
why bother looking for her?

443
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,719
I'm sure Xu Guanghan made up the story.

444
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,199
He didn't want you
to look for your parents.

445
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,520
I thought the same.

446
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,439
So I've decided

447
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:01,199
to look for the truth

448
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,319
after I leave Bay House.

449
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,680
You have decided to leave the place?

450
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,640
But not now.

451
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,640
If I were to disappear,

452
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,719
Xu Guanghan

453
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,319
would surely hurt them.

454
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,199
You can take them with you.

455
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,880
Lu Xiao's mom just passed away.
He's still in a bad mood.

456
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,800
I think I should wait
until he feels better

457
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,160
to talk to him.

458
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,160
Be patient, all right?

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,920
Wait to hear from me.

460
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,079
I'll always be waiting for you.

461
