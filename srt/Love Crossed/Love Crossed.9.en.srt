(Xiaoya)
Guan Qianya.

2
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,479
It's time for you to
prove your innocence.

3
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:15,880
Answer it.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Did you turn on the loudspeaker?

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,239
I forgot.

6
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,799
Hello, can you hear me, Kele?

7
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,040
Yes, I hear you, Qianya.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,360
The signal was disrupted just now.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
Jiang Kele.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,720
It's so late already.
Why aren't you home yet?

11
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,000
I... Wait.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,200
Qianya, calm down.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,479
I want to ask you something.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,919
Do you know where I work?

15
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:42,919
Don't you know

16
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,000
where you work?

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,119
I've never told you

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,919
about my work, right?

19
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,000
You talk about work with me every day.

20
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,479
What's wrong?

21
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,880
Have you lost your memory because
you are drunk from fake alcohol?

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,959
Where are you? Tell me.

23
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,720
I'll go and get you.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,799
Guan Qianya, don't cause me hurt!

25
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,919
What did I do?

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,560
Are you playing truth or dare?

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,319
Ask the person beside you to answer.

28
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,760
Hello. She is drunk.

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Send me the address.
I'll go and get her.

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,879
She won't be going back tonight.

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,160
I see.

32
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,360
Are you that savage man

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,919
with low IQ?

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,480
Don't think that I can't recognize you

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
just because you changed your voice.

36
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:41,879
Have I proved my innocence yet?

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,559
No.

38
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,760
Wait.

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,879
If you release me now,

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,440
I can prove my innocence to you.

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,480
Impossible.

42
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,319
Before my investigation is complete,

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,199
you won't be going anywhere.

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,239
I'm doomed.

47
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,000
Cheers.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,080
If I had known that Jiang Kele

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,919
would be staying in
Lu Xiao's room for so long,

50
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,520
we should've given her a warning.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,039
Now, we won't be able to
see her anymore.

52
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,479
But if she clocks in and
clocks out on time every day,

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,119
we won't be able to see her too.

54
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,679
No, you are wrong.

55
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,479
We can still see her

56
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,639
when the system is upgrading

57
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
and lets us have a break.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Now, we won't be able to see her at all.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,199
Although I didn't say much to her,

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,279
I still feel

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,759
sad about it.

62
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:24,759
Where did you get the candies?

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
I stole them from Lu Xiao's room.

64
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,399
Give me one.

65
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,360
What are you doing?

66
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,919
Can't you see?

67
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,199
We are trying to get drunk.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,119
Get drunk?

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
You want to get drunk with water?

70
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,880
What else can we do?

71
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,520
Jiang Kele was caught.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,080
Our lives from now on

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
will be in misery.

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,279
Jiang Kele was caught

75
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,880
just because she stayed
for a little bit longer

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,919
in Lu Xiao's room.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Looks like Mr. Xu is serious this time.

78
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,600
We are doomed.

79
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,119
Even Xu Nian is saying this.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,600
It means that

81
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,759
we won't be able to see her anymore.

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,720
If I had known,

83
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,160
I would've mustered up my courage

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,279
to talk more with her.

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,399
The past few days are

86
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,479
the happiest days in my whole life.

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,920
Stop it.

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,440
Lu Xiao. Jiang Kele might not
come back anymore

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,839
after she was caught this time.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Isn't that great?

91
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,320
Now, Su Lie doesn't need to
hide from her.

92
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,040
And Luo Ke won't be punished

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,959
for eating snacks in secret anymore.

94
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,480
And she won't bother me anymore.

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,559
This is great.

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Jiang Kele, how can you have fun

97
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,679
without me?

98
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,200
Blasted.

99
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm sure that

100
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,320
I can find someone to drink with me too.

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,480
Too old.

102
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,920
Fat.

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,519
Ugly.

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,200
This is not bad.

105
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,760
She has a husband already.

106
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,000
Blasted.

107
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,920
I can't find anyone.

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,079
I'm sure you have many people to

109
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,160
drink with you in the real world, right?

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,559
Why are you here with me instead?

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,799
I have many friends.

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
But I don't have many friends

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
who I can drink with.

114
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
Do you have a best friend?

115
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,897
(26th of October, Sunday)

116
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,839
Can't she drink with you?

117
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,799
Her?

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,679
She went out to have fun all by herself.

119
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
And she didn't invite me.

120
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
She went out to have fun all by herself?

121
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,519
You are not close?

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,959
Of course not.
Because we see each other every day.

123
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,040
Being too close is a bad thing,
understand?

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Look. That's her room.

125
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,519
What do I wish for right now?

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,959
I wish that after I close this door,
we'll be a world apart

127
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,559
and will never see each other again.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,399
Although you say that,

129
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,640
from the sound of it,

130
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,799
it looks like you are very close
to each other.

131
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,559
You live under the same roof.

132
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,799
You must have shared a lot
with each other.

133
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,720
Of course.

134
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,640
But she has been so secretive lately.

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,160
It's like she's hiding
something from me.

136
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,399
Aren't you curious about it?

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,359
Why should I?

138
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,679
Even though we are best friends,

139
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,839
we still need to have
our personal space.

140
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm keeping a secret from her too.

141
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
Do you know what it is?

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,880
It's me.

144
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,200
Shouldn't you drink with me then?

145
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,600
I can't drink.

146
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,279
In real life,

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,480
when a lady asks the man to drink,

148
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,959
the man will drink it

149
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,559
even if he can't drink.

150
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,440
You are indeed

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,720
just a virtual character.

152
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,399
Forget it.

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm being ridiculous.

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,480
Why am I putting hope in

155
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,959
a virtual character?

156
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,839
Mr. Xu, can you be rest assured now?

157
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,040
Jiang Kele has been proven innocent.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,880
This is just the beginning.

159
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,399
Guan Qianya is putting hope in Xu Nian.

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,200
It means that she has taken the bait.

161
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,559
Last time, you told me that

162
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,079
we have to always follow our heart.

163
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,720
It's too easy to eat and drink

164
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,160
whenever I want to.

165
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,799
But it's always so hard

166
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,520
when I want to see you.

167
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,000
There are two kinds of
happiness in life.

168
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:52,400
One is letting go of your burden.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
And the other one is

170
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,960
to get something that
you have never had before.

171
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,039
So, in life,

172
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,400
try to be more courageous.

173
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,479
Be more courageous.

174
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,479
They almost kissed.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,400
Kissing is not the important thing here.

176
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,719
Xu Nian has succeeded.

177
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,400
What about Jiang Kele?

178
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
How can you fall asleep
in such a serious place?

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,559
I didn't want to sleep either.

180
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,000
But I was sleepy.

181
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,799
I couldn't stay awake.

182
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:43,200
Your innocence has been proven.

183
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,840
Really? Great.

184
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,159
Finally, I'm found not guilty.

185
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,039
I'll go back now.

186
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,719
I still have to come to work tomorrow.

187
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,359
Wait.

188
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,520
Although you are not guilty this time,

189
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,919
we don't know what will
happen in the future.

190
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,599
You'll bring us trouble if we keep you.

191
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,400
So?

192
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,440
So,

193
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,039
you are fired.

194
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,719
But remember,

195
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,960
if you want to

196
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,679
live the rest of your life in peace,

197
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,119
keep everything

198
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,640
that you know about Bay House

199
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,119
a secret forever.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,280
What are you doing?

201
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,679
It's pointless to beg me.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
No.

203
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,799
My legs are numb because
I've been restrained for too long.

204
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,919
Life is too unpredictable.

205
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,159
I just got a well-paid job.

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,000
And now, I'm fired.

207
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,520
And Qianya's company is going to
go bankrupt soon.

208
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,520
Will I be able to afford
alcohol after this?

209
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,799
Why are you getting more and more
unkempt now?

210
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,599
You didn't even take off
your lens.

211
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,280
What's wrong, Kele?

212
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,799
Why do you look unhappy today?

213
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,840
I just lost a well-paid job today.

214
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,479
But I'm not upset because of the money.

215
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm upset because

216
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't see that person anymore.

217
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you talking about the person
who looks like me

218
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,640
that you told me about?

219
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,880
And some of his friends too.

220
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,239
Although they are
not that close with each other,

221
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,880
all of them treated me quite well.

222
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Besides, I've already

223
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
considered them my best friends.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,640
If I had known that

225
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,200
it would be our last time
seeing each other,

226
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,239
I would have bought them a big cake

227
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,840
and have a proper farewell with them.

228
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,119
They have never eaten a cake before.

229
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,760
Who has never eaten a cake before?

230
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,520
Alright now, Kele.

231
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,119
Don't be so upset.

232
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,840
You just can't see them

233
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,919
during working hours.

234
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,239
But you can still meet them in private.

235
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,119
I can't meet them in private.

236
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,159
It'll be hard to see them again
in this life.

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,559
Why?

238
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:48,840
Because...

239
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,280
Forget it.
You won't be able to understand.

240
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,719
Let me ask you.

241
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,599
If I went missing one day,

242
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,880
would you miss me?

243
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,080
Of course.

244
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,960
Although we see each other every day,

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
I still miss you.

246
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,840
But he won't.

247
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,239
It would be nice if you were him.

248
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,239
Don't tell me that
you finished your pills again.

249
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,719
Let me tell you. This is very dangerous.

250
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
Besides, didn't you promise me that

251
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,719
you'll not increase your dosage
without my permission?

252
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,799
Do you want to die, Guan Qianya?

253
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
I won't give you any more pills.

254
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,159
I won't come here for treatment anymore.

255
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,440
What do you mean?

256
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,039
Have you given up?

257
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,159
I don't have insomnia anymore.

258
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,320
Qianya, if you really don't have
insomnia anymore,

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,400
I'll be happy for you from
the bottom of my heart.

260
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,799
But with my experience,

261
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,280
it's clinically impossible for
a patient like you who

262
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,679
relies heavily on

263
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,520
sleeping pills to recover
just like that.

264
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm worried that

265
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,559
you might be relying on

266
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,880
something else.

267
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,239
Do you understand?

268
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't tell me that you took that...

269
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,679
Impossible.

270
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,640
I won't do illegal things.

271
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,520
Don't worry.

272
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,440
I really don't have insomnia anymore.

273
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,159
And I want to thank you

274
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
for treating me all these years.

275
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,679
You are always welcome here
if you need me.

276
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,119
It'll be a total of 102 yuan.

277
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,640
Please keep your receipt.

278
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,440
You can try all the make-ups
in The Colorist.

279
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
Please come back again.

280
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Thank you.

281
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,359
I'll go and restock the shelves.

282
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,872
(Luo Ke)

283
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:57,950
(Xu Nian)

284
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,479
Kele?

285
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,560
Why are you here so early today?

286
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
Yes.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,959
I won't earn more

288
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
even if I come here early.

289
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,800
Forget it.

290
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,479
This is my only job now.

291
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
I have to cherish it.

292
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,920
Wait.

293
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
That old lady fired you?

294
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,040
Did you recommend me to them?

295
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,599
Wake up.

296
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,160
Do you think it's easy money?

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Let me tell you.
That place is complicated.

298
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,439
And it's scary.

299
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,560
So, you did something wrong

300
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,760
and got scolded.

301
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,079
Not only I was scolded,

302
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,880
I was hit

303
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,000
and almost got injected...

304
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,839
I almost died.

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Kele, I was jealous of you
because you seemed

306
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,319
to be living a good life before this.

307
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,119
Now, I feel better after

308
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,319
hearing about your situation.

309
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,880
We are still best friends.

310
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
This is Lu Xiao's last mirror.

311
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,599
I kept it for you.

312
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,319
Okay. I'm off duty now.

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,439
Remember to pay for the mirror.

314
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
Fine.

315
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,359
We are still best friends.

316
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,640
I'll accompany you for a while then.

317
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,119
After all, you are going through

318
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,640
the hardest part of your life now.

319
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,439
Qiqi.

320
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,439
Don't be sad.

321
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,199
I never thought that you'll be the one

322
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,239
who treats me the best when I'm down.

323
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,079
Then,

324
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,079
can you give me
that old lady's phone number?

325
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm just joking.

326
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
You don't have to give it to me.

327
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
We are still best friends.

328
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,359
Okay now.

329
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,800
Mr. Xu, you are looking for me?

330
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,800
Where is Jiang Kele now?

331
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,560
I've already fired her

332
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,959
as you ordered.

333
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,520
But don't worry.

334
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,800
She promised that

335
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
she will keep everything here

336
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,959
a secret.

337
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,800
Very good.

338
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,359
I have another order for you.

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,079
Find her

340
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,680
and hire her to work
for Bay House again.

341
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,479
Why?

342
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Is Grandma Fushun
putting pressure on you?

343
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Of course not.

344
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
In this world,

345
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,439
no one can pressure me

346
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,560
except myself.

347
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,040
So, why did you

348
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,079
make this decision then?

349
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,520
Data.

350
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,239
Before this, Lu Xiao's emotional data

351
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,400
was like still water.

352
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,359
After Jiang Kele came here,

353
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,400
his emotions

354
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
are going up and down
like a roller coaster.

355
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,959
This is what we need for Project Y,

356
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,280
the positive emotional data.

357
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,160
You had the same idea many years ago.

358
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,920
You wanted to introduce someone
from the outside

359
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
into Bay House

360
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,319
to interact with the four of them.

361
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,719
But you didn't have any
suitable candidates back then.

362
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:07,359
That's why you didn't proceed
with the plan.

363
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
Now that Jiang Kele is here,

364
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,239
I can reinitiate this plan again.

365
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,959
Is this called getting more than
what you sowed?

366
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,160
No.

367
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,760
This is called beating someone
at his own game.

368
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,479
Hello.

369
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,239
I am Lei Na.

370
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,760
Come to Bay House now.

371
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,119
Hello, Mr. Xu.

372
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,160
Hello, Lei Na.

373
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,959
No need to act.

374
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,520
I asked you to come back
out of respect for Grandma Fushun.

375
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,599
But whether or not you can stay,

376
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,520
you'll have to gain their approval.

377
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
Jiang Kele.

378
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,000
This undaunted and reckless foolish girl

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,079
broke the house rule here.

380
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,199
She can't work here anymore.

381
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,359
But if you are willing to
get punished on her behalf,

382
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,319
I can consider giving her
another chance.

383
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,479
I'm willing to do that.

384
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,280
But what is the punishment?

385
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,880
One thousand repetitions
on the rowing machine.

386
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:14,959
I'm willing too.

387
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,520
I can even do 2000.

388
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,079
I can do it too.

389
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,239
Three votes.

390
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,520
What about Lu Xiao?

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,640
(This is bad.)

392
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,400
(He won't help me.)

393
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm willing to do it too.

394
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,280
Lu Xiao.

395
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,199
Since you hesitated for so long,

396
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,959
you'll be doing the 1000 repetitions

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,760
on the rowing machine on behalf of her.

398
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,760
It seems like you are worried about him.

399
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,079
How about you do
the 1000 repetitions yourself?

400
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,280
I've never done it before.

401
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
Can I don't do so many repetitions?

402
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,040
I don't mind.

403
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
I want a total of 1000 repetitions.

404
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,239
The less you do,

405
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,040
the more Lu Xiao has to do.

406
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,400
Seven hundred and forty-six.

407
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
Seven hundred and forty-seven.

408
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,359
Enough.

409
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,959
I can do the rest by myself.

410
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,920
No.

411
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,599
Lu Xiao, I'm sorry.

412
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,880
Before this,
I thought that you hated me.

413
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,199
I never thought that

414
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,400
you'll be willing to
get punished for me.

415
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,319
Did you secretly fall in love with me?

416
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,760
Wake up.

417
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,119
I didn't accept the punishment

418
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,439
because of you.

419
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,359
Not because of me?

420
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,000
Are you doing this for
the three of them?

421
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,479
Yes.

422
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,680
They want you to stay.

423
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,920
I just don't want to disappoint them.

424
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:15,920
Enough.

425
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,079
The three of them

426
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,359
won't believe you.

427
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,439
When did you become so close with them?

428
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,040
Alright now.

429
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,079
Since you like me so much,

430
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,560
let me feed you some candies.

431
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
Or else, your blood sugar
will drop too much.

432
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,079
Thank you.

You are going to

too rush for you.

So, I've prepared the article for you.

479
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,359
I rejected it, right?

480
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,560
I agreed to it on your behalf.

481

Didn't you see it?

485
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:46,239

Don't tell me that you are afraid.

Let me tell you.

You just need to read this
out loud tomorrow

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,479
It's another thrilling day today.

505
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,079
At first, I thought that I lost my job.

506
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,239
But I'm given a second chance.

507
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,119
And Lu Xiao even accepted the punishment

508
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,560
for me to stay.

509
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,719
Men are so stubborn.

510
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,400
He refused to admit that he likes me.

511
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,280
Fine.

512
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,640
I'll consider today as the day

513
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,719
you indirectly confessed to me.

514
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,959
And I said yes.

515
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,359
Let me jot it down.

516
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,319
(Groundbreaking news.)

517
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,199
(Guan Qianya is going
to fight against Xu Guanghan.)

518
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,239
(She has overestimated herself.)

519
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:13,920
What happened?

520
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,680
(Guan Qianya will lose for sure.)

521
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,599
(Let's buy the ticket now)

522
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,465
(and attend the live show
to support Mr. Xu.)

523
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,800
("Guan Qianya responded to Xu Guanghan's
challenge-To see how can I beat you.")

524
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,800
Amazing, Qianya.

525
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Finally, you are going to go
into battle with Xu Guanghan.

526
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,800
As your strongest supporter,

527
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:31,520
let me buy some good food for you
to give you strength.

528
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,079
It's clinically impossible for
a patient like you who

529
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,719
relies heavily on

530
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,760
sleeping pills to recover
just like that.

531
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm worried that

532
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,239
you might be relying on

533
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,520
something else.

534
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,680
Xu Nian.

535
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,319
Xu Nian.

536
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:57,755
(Guan Qianya)

537
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,119
Sorry for being late.

538
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,199
How can a virtual character be late?

539
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,920
Your acting is quite good.

540
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,280
There were some issues just now.

541
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,359
Why do you look so anxious?

542
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,319
What happened?

543
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,160
I can't sleep.

544
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,439
I have something very important tomorrow

545
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,079
that I don't want to attend.
I'm stressed out.

546
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,319
I have a solution.
