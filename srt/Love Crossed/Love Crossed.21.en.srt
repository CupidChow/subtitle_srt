1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,279
It's so boring.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,920
It's said to work is the happiest.
Indeed.

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,720
When are they coming back?

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,960
It's been only 30 minutes.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,479
Kele.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
Why are you back?

7
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,280
Aren't you at your training?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,600
I have completed all the tasks

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,920
ahead of schedule today.

10
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,040
Here I am to keep you company.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,239
It's so boring to watch the TV series
all by myself.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,439
That's why I'm here.

13
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:38,639
Thank you.

14
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,760
Kele, you're awake.

15
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,559
I was just about to go and wake you up.

16
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,080
Did you make all these?

17
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:34,839
Yes.

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,239
I learned to make these
from the recipe.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,199
Here.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,919
Take a seat.

21
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,480
Today, I've prepared

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,519
something special for you.

23
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,720
Braised fish?

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,480
How did you know that I like it?

25
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,040
Xu Nian told me.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
How did he know?

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
It must be Qianya who told him.

28
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,839
You could have just asked me.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,199
There's no need to do it
in a roundabout way.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,839
If I were to ask you,

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
there would be no surprise.

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,440
By the way,
this isn't any ordinary braised fish.

33
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,800
I called it

34
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,199
Kele Fish.

35
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,440
A dish named after me?

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,199
No.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,919
That's because it's a braised fish

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,639
made specially for Kele with coke.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,880
Give it a try.

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,000
If I were to say
what I'm about to say next,

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
my dad would be mad.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,639
But I have to say.

43
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,000
This is really good
given it's your first attempt.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,880
Really?

45
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,399
Have more.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,800
Dig in. Come on.

47
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,520
Here's another one.

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,240
Wait.

49
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,440
We can't finish everything ourselves.

50
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,800
Why don't we ask them to join us?

51
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,399
We've been waiting for you
to say that!

52
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,800
We have the utensils ready!

53
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,720
Don't eat too much.

54
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,119
Save some for Kele.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't worry. We're not like Xu Nian.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,440
He comes late and eats a lot.

57
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,559
Why do I feel like
someone's talking behind my back?

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,880
Speaking of the devil.

59
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,320
This is Kele Fish?

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,479
That's right.

61
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,440
I made it for Jiang Kele.

62
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,919

70
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,239
Lu Xiao, why are you here?

71
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,399
I'm here to pick my girlfriend up
from work

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,119
and send her home.

73
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,040
Sure.

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
How do you usually go home?

75
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,519
I usually take the subway.

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,679
If we move now,

77
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,119
we should be able
to catch the last train.

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,359
Let's go then.

79
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,640
Hold on.

80
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,399
Let's go home.

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,399
Kele, you're home.

82
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,359
I should get going now.

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,119
So you meant it

84
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:47,320
when you said you just wanted
to send your girlfriend home?

85
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,480
If not?

86
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,559
Would you like to come in

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,519
and have a drink?

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,839
What drinks?

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Jiang Kele.

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,839
Alright, I was just messing with you.

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,239
It's the boiled coke with ginger.

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I'm afraid you might catch a cold
since you got wet in the rain.

93
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
Here. Coke with ginger.

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,359
I didn't know it tastes so good.

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,559
It's not.

96
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,519
The Kele Fish that you made is the best.

97
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:45,880
Lu Xiao.

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,760
Thank you.

99
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,239
Thank you
for all you've done today.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
These are things

101
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,440
that I never dare to dream of.

102
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,920
Actually, I'm really happy today.

103
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,600
This is my first time
being in a relationship.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,119
So it turns out
that it actually feels that great

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
being able to take care of a girl.

106
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,440
From now on,

107
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
I'll make you happy every day.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
No.

109
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,279
Because if you have to work

110
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
and try to make me happy
at the same time,

111
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,559
it'll be really tough on you,

112
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,279
and you'll get distracted.

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
I just want you to focus on your work.

114
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,480
The sooner you complete the contract,

115
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,159
the sooner you can leave the Bay House.

116
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
That way,

117
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,919
we'll be able to date in public.

118
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,159
Whatever you say.

119
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,740
(Love Boys)

120
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,599
Do you think it looks like him?

121
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
I think it looks a lot like him.

122
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,599
Where did you get this picture?

123
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,400
Lisa took it.

124
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,440
Lisa?

125
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,960
Didn't Guan Qianya fire her?

126
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,919
Yes, that's why she's working
in the restaurant now.

127
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,359
She said Guan Qianya has lost her mind

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,000
and is addicted to the game.

129
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,799
She's even dating

130
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,719
a replacement
who looks a lot like Xu Nian.

131
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Lisa thought

132
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,359
this picture would be of use to us.

133
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,919
So she wanted something in return.

134
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,799
From the day
Guan Qianya stood up against me,

135
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,479
she has already lost her mind.

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,359
Mr. Xu, what should we
give Lisa in return?

137
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,440
What else does she want?

138
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,359
We have given her a lifetime membership.

139
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,359
It's her job to do us favors.

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay.

141
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,460
(Crush On Love)

142
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,440
I've seen this sweater
in Xu Nian's room.

143
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,599
He is Xu Nian!

144
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,159
I'm so blessed

145
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,440
to be able to have breakfast
with my Lu Xiao.

146
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:05,159
My goodness. I'm so happy
that I'm about to pass out.

147
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,520
That's a little exaggerating.

148
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,679
It's not like we haven't
had breakfast together before.

149
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,760
That's different.

150
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,119
We had it with the others,

151
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,119
but now, it's just the two of us.

152

170
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:36,919
What is it?

171
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,679
Xu Nian.

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Mr. Xu is here.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,559
Let's go.

174
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Hi, Mr. Xu.

175
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,679
Please give us the room.

176
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,320
I have something
to discuss with Xu Nian.

177
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,919
Get moving.

178
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,840
Lei Na, search Xu Nian's room.

179
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,559
All right.

180
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,119
Mr. Xu.

181
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,679
Jiang Kele took the sweater
the other day.

182
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,400
Well, let's see

183
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,239
if we find any contraband.

184
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,960
Okay.

185
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,200
Mr. Xu, I found a phone.

186
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,719
Who gave it to you?

187
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,799
It's a limited edition.

188
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,679
First, the sweater. Now, the phone.

189
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,559
I never expected such a big surprise
coming from you.

190
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,400
Xu Nian.

191
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,159
I have some questions for you.

192
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
Ask away.

193
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,200
I have questions for you too.

194
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,119
Let's see

195
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,359
who has more questions.

196
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,760
Why conceal the existence
of the four of us?

197
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,880
That's a good question.

198
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,119
Anything else?

199
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,640
Why did you lie?

200
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,719
Why tell everyone

201
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,760
that we are virtual characters in Love Boys?

202
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,000
Not bad. What else?

203
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
Why imprison the four of us?

204
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,440
So this is what Guan Qianya told you

205
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
after you sneaked out?

206
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,239
I didn't sneak out.

207
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,159
It has nothing to do with her.

208
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,239
I did some searching using my phone.

209
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,479
Tell me. Who gave you the phone?

210
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,440
You haven't answered my questions.

211
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,119
Fine.

212
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,159
If you really want to know,

213
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,919
I'll tell you slowly.

214
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,000
When I was young,

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
I was a celebrity manager
who started from scratch

216
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,919
and established Yao Entertainment

217
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,080
after a decade or so in the industry.

218
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,159
I've helped to bring fame
to many people.

219
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,000
One of them is Qi Chuan,
who became famous at a young age

220
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,400
and is all washed up now.

221
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,200
The other one was Ge Yilan,

222
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,159
the female star
who has once been popular

223
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,640
in Asia.

224
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,159
But she has withdrawn
from the show business.

225
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,479
My question is

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,799
why imprison us?

227
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,919
You have been living here
since you were kids

228
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,719
and you were happy all the time.

229
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,400
Now that you're all grown up,

230
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
you're asking me that?

231
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,200
Why did I specifically
mention these two people?

232
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,080
That's because

233
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,520
they have some moral flaws.

234
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,960
They were obedient
when they were nobody.

235
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,960
But they got out of control
once they gained fame

236
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,919
and betrayed me.

237
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,320
It broke my heart

238
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,119
and made me suffer setbacks

239
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,200
in my vision of building
an entertainment empire.

240
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,719
Because of them, I realized

241
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:34,840
that betrayal is human nature.

242
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,400
It's all in the blood.

243
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,840
So I thought

244
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,520
if the weakness of human nature
can be removed,

245
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,359
they'll be at my disposal.

246
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:51,479
So you used the four of us
as a bargaining chip

247
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,840
to create Love Boys?

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,919
That's right.

249
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,159
At first,

250
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,119
I wanted to create virtual characters
without humanity.

251
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,080
But then I realized

252
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,919
to make Love Boys a success,

253
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,679
humanity is imperative.

254
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,319
That put me in a dilemma.

255
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,400
But soon,

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,599
I found the solution.

257
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,239
That is to design Love Boys

258
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,560
using real humans as prototypes,

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,760
writing emotional responses
into data and codes.

260
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,640
That way, real human emotional reactions

261
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,000
can be presented
in the interaction with the players.

262
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,319
To achieve this great plan,

263
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,040
I set my sights

264
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,119
on my newly born son.

265
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,760
Since he was a kid,

266
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,079
I have him strictly trained
to learn etiquette, culture,

267
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,640
music, dance, et cetera,

268
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,359
to make him a perfect man.

269
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,119
I strived to get a

270
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,319
perfect virtual character in Love Boys.

271
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,199
Shortly after,

272
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,719
I discovered that women

273
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,359
have strange needs for men.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
All kinds of different needs.

275
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,680
But it can basically
be divided into four types.

276
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
Gentle, wise, outgoing, and obedient.

277
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
My son is the wise type.

278
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,239
So I found three other kids

279
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,920
who were about his age.

280
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,400
Lu Xiao.

281
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,599
Luo Ke.

282
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,239
Su Lie.

283
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,800
That's how the Y4 that
takes the world by storm is formed.

284
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,800
I bet you get the hint now, don't you?

285
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,040
Xu Nian, your real name is Xu Jin.

286
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,079
I'm your biological father.

287
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,359
That's impossible.

288
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,199
How could you possibly be my father?

289
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,719
Didn't you tell me

290
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,640
that my biological parents

291
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
abandoned me in the hospital
when I was born?

292
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,079
I lied to you.

293
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,959
It's impossible.

294
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,760
You're so young.
How could you possibly be my father?

295
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,239
You've been lying to me
all the years.

296
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,640
How can I believe you?

297
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,920
Kid.

298
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,359
What he said is true.

299
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,839
He's your biological father.

300
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,359
He's still in good shape.

301
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,959
Forever young and good looking.

302
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,800
I told you to cut down
the aesthetic treatments.

303
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,680
Now your son wouldn't even accept you.

304
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,000
Grandma Fushun,
why don't you go back first?

305
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:02,880
Who are you?

306
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,119
If you're not a member of the Xu family,

307
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,560
stay out of our family business.

308
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,959
Grandma, is he telling the truth?

309
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,400
Yes.

310
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,719
To be specific,

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,760
you should call me Great Aunt.

312
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,479
Aunty.

313
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,719
This isn't the time
for a family reunion.

314
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,479
Grandma Fushun.

315
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,560
If he's my father,

316
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,439
who's my mother?

317
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,680
Do you remember

318
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,040
that during one Mid-Autumn Festival

319
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,599
I played a movie for all of you?

320
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,839
The name of the movie is

321
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,920
"The Making of Female Stars".

322
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,040
Do you remember the story?

323
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,479
That movie

324
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,079
actually tells the true story

325
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,880
of your biological parents.

326
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,959
What do you need?

327
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:18,319
Sirloin steak medium rare.

328
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,040
Actually, I know who you are.

329
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,800
I've read news about you

330
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,479
and seen your interview on TV.

331
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,920
You're Mr. Xu Guanghan,

332
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,520
the top celebrity manager

333
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,400
who can turn an ordinary person

334
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,280
into a super star.

335
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,040
Right?

336
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,959
I have a friend who looks up to you.

337
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,319
She has sent a resume
to Yao Entertainment before

338
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,439
but didn't receive any reply.

339
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,439
So I wonder

340
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,760
if you could spare one minute for her?

341
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:05,920
Sure.

342
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,560
Really?

343
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,040
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

344
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,439
How can you dress like this at work?

345
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,439
How inappropriate!

346
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,079
I'm receiving complaints
from the customers.

347
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,040
I...

348
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,880
What? You're fired!

349
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,319
Get lost!

350
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,160
Don't talk to her that way.

351
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,359
From now on,

352
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,119
she works for Yao Entertainment.

353
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,400
It was a beautiful encounter.

354
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,920
But who would have known

355
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,760
what would happen later on?

356
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,280
You know what?

357
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,319
In the end, that girl

358
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,199
really became a super star.

359
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,800
(Universal Gilded Film Festival)
Lanlan, the audiences

360
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,160
are curious
about your relationship status.

361
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,479
Are you still single now?

362
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,959
Lanlan.

363
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,479
I heard that you
and the British actor, Eric,

364
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,439
have been secretly dating
for two months because of the drama.

365
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,680
Is it true?

366
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,439
Of course not.

367
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,560
We're just colleagues.

368
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,319
Behind the scenes, we're good friends.

(Film Star World)

370
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,319
Besides, I already have someone
that I like.

371
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,199
(Ge Yilan)
Someone she likes?

372
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,359
-Who is it?
-I have no idea.

373
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,719
I'm so curious.

374
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,460
(Ge Yilan)

375
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,640
Of course.

376
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,880
It's not convenient to reveal it
to you right now.

377
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Lanlan, you're so open
about your relationship.

378
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,959
I bet something good is going to happen.

379
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,000
What's your plan?

380
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,640
Share with us.

381
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,359
Indeed, we have plans in motion.

382
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,959
Sorry.

383
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,839
Thank you, everyone.

384
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,079
It's about time.
We have to go inside now.

385
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,199
Thank you.

386
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,119
-Lanlan!
-Bye!

387
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,640
Lanlan, look over here!

388
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,719
Lanlan.

389
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,920
If I hadn't stopped you,

390
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,719
were you planning

391
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,239
to make our relationship public?

392
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,160
Why not?

393
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,400
We've been together for so long.

394
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,959
It's just a matter of time.

395
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,040
When did I ever say

396
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,839
that we were going public
for our relationship?

397
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,920
But we can't hide it forever.

398
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,199
Guanghan, I want to be with you

399
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,640
out in the public like normal people do.

400
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,400
Since you have chosen this industry,

401
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,079
you should understand

402
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
the freedom sacrificed

403
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
is the price we should pay.

404
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
You're a public figure.

405
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,839
The fantasy of the people.

406
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,160
Most importantly,

407
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,640
do you think we'll get their blessings
by going public?

408
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,040
You're being too naive. It won't happen.

409
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,920
Once your reputation

410
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,359
is subject to uncontrollable changes,

411
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,680
your career will be at stake.

412
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:14,920
But...

413
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,520
No buts.

414
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,199
We have put in so much effort

415
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,000
to get to where we are today.

416
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,160
It's your dream to become
the most popular female star

417
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
and it's what I hope for.

418
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,119
If you do this,

419
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,439
it's as good

420
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,959
as destroying everything that we have?

421
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,640
But it's too late now.

422
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
Not at all.

423
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,560
I've asked someone
to take down the interview.

424
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,719
We'll make a new recording.

425
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,319
Just do as I say.

426
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,800
Tell them that your love life is bleak.

427
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,680
You yearn for love,

428
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,839
but you just haven't met the right guy.

429
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,800
Guanghan.

430
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,439
That's not what I meant.

431
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,520
I...

432
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,359
I'm pregnant.

433
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,599
It's the third month of pregnancy now.

434
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,839
I knew you would be surprised.

435
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,920
When I first found out,

436
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,199
I was really scared.

437
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,319
But the thought

438
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,839
of this baby
being the fruit of our love,

439
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,319
it made me so full of courage.

440
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,319
So I'm giving birth to this baby.

441
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,439
I can quit the showbiz.

442
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,760
Guanghan,
I know you lacked family warmth

443
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,000
since you were a kid.

444
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,280
So let's have this baby.

445
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
You, him and I

446
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:46,199
can become a warm family. All right?

447
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,319
This isn't the time for a relationship.

448
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,800
Your schedule for the next year

449
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,760
is all full now.

450
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,520
We can't afford any mistakes.

451
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,160
The golden career period of a female star

452
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,239
is very short-lived.

453
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,520
It'll be gone if you miss it.

454
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,520
Follow my plan.

455
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,680
Do as I say.

456
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,439
Let's take care of this discreetly.

457
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,359
I think we have a week.

458
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,839
One week.

459
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,719
When Xu Guanghan
had everything arranged,

460
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,119
Ge Yilan suddenly disappeared.

461
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,599
When Xu Guanghan

462
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
found her,

463
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,560
it was half a year later.

464
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,400
That's when Ge Yilan
was about to give birth,

465
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,760
and Xu Guanghan made his move.

466
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,479
As soon as the baby was born,

467
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,319
he told Ge Yilan

468
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,400
that the baby was dead.
