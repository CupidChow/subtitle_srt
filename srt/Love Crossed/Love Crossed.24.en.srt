00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
(Entrance)

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,320
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)
This is the outside world.

3
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:09,399
This place looks desolate.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,279
Is it the end of the world?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
Then... Do they still have bars?

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,399
Wait here. I'll make a call.

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,360
Who is he calling?

8
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,000
My guess is

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,799
he must be booking a room.

10
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:25,600
Booking a room?

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,280
He should have done so earlier.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,280
Right.

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,360
Hello? Qianya?

14
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,919
We got out of the Bay House.

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,279
What... What did you say?

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,000
I said

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,759
we got out of the Bay House.

18
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,520
All four of you?

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,360
Yes.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,799
But I don't know where to take them.

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,599
The Xiang Hua Qiao Alley is nearby.

22
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:46,400
Wait for me there.

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,520
I'll go pick you guys up.

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,599
Okay.

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,639
Kele! Kele!

26
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,959
Wake up!

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
They're out!

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,119
Come on. Let's go!

29
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,919
Let's go.

30
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,799
Your coat.

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,799
Let's go wait in the alley up front.

32
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,919
Someone is coming to pick us up.

33
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,319
The bar is sending a car to pick us up!

34
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,400
Then why won't they pick us up here?

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,360
Stop talking so much. Let's go.

36
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,599
Or do you want
to get caught by Xu Guanghan?

37
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,480
Let's go.

38
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,360
Come on.

39
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,120
Let's go.

=Episode 24=

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,279
This is more like it!
This is what the outside world is like!

43
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,239
Why are we on that thing?

44
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,000
That's how we look in the game.

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,233
(TAILG)

46
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,320
Oh, so that's what

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
our collected data looks like.

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,559
We look so cool in the game.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,639
That's us. Of course, we're cool.

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,399
Xu Nian, help us take a picture.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,199
Yes.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,080
Let's go.

53
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,360
Come on.

54
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,759
Why is Lu Xiao so grumpy
after getting out?

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Maybe

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,759
they need more time than us
to adapt to the outside world.

57
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,000
They've been out so many times.
Don't they get used to it yet?

58
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,600
That's way too slow.

59
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,199
Come on.

60
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,639
What smells so good?

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,559
It smells familiar.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,199
Junk food!

63
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,039
Let's go!

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,639
(Malatang)
We'd like to order.

65
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,199
Thank you.

66
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,639
Here you go.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,919
That'll be 85.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
But we don't have any money.

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,800
Here. I'll pay.

70
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,080
Xu Nian, we're being followed.

71
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,080
That's the good stuff.

72
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,679
We have to run. Mr. Xu's men are here!

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,160
Run!

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,559
They're still behind us!

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,240
Wait!

76
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:53,919
I can't run anymore.

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Mr. Xu's men are persistent.

78
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,119
Why don't we go back for today?

79
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
I can't run any further.

80
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,639
I can still run.

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,639
But I won't have any energy left
for clubbing.

82
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,800
What do you mean, clubbing?

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,919
Didn't we say we were getting a drink?

84
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,759
That's what they do on TV!

85
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,720
They aren't here again, are they?

86
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,320
Isn't that a bar? Let's go!

87
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,040
Let's go.

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,760
So this is a bar.

89
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,440
If I had known it'd be this exciting,

90
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,079
we should've run faster.

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,359
I feel pumped the moment I came in here.

92
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,200
Come on.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,399
Wait. Where are Xu Nian and Lu Xiao?

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,399
Go, go, go.

95
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,679
We finally caught up!

96
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
You guys ran so fast!

97
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,279
We didn't want to run!

98
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,320
They made us do it!

99
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,040
Yes!

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,399
They made us come out!

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,839
We hate bars!

102
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,440
They look even more alike
from the front.

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,519
You guys are the best impersonators

104
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,640
we've ever seen!

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,839
It's like you guys were 3D printed!

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Impersonators?

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,720
How are you guys so alike?

108
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,279
Which plastic surgery hospital
did you go to?

109
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,279
(We got into trouble.
It's settled now.)

110
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,320
(We're at JZ Club.)

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,959
They changed the location.
They're at JZ Club right now.

112
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,160
Okay.

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,239
Tell them to get a room and wait for us.

114
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,119
Don't let anyone find out.

115
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:43,760
Okay.

116
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,760
Go back.

117
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,359
Why do we have to stay in here?

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Those weren't Mr. Xu's men just now.

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,839
We're at a bar.

120
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,440
Why won't you let us go dance?

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,119
You guys can dance right here.

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
You can sing karaoke and dance.

123
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,519
Isn't it nice?

124
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,279
Here?

125
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,239
It's smaller than the training room
in the Bay House.

126
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
Right.

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,359
We could dance and sing

128
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,959
inside the Bay House too.

129
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,519
Why did we have to come all this way?

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,359
Stop fussing.

131
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
The door is right here.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,480
Leave if you dare.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Jiang Kele.

134
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,359
She's from the Bay House too.

135
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,760
Hello, I'm Luo Ke.

136
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
What "hello"?

137
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
Don't even think about it.

138
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
She's Xu Nian's girlfriend.

139
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,399
Close your eyes.

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,959
When did Xu Nian get a girlfriend?

141
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,959
How would I know?

142
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,519
We're the only ones without a girlfriend

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,359
in Y4.

144
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Should we talk?

145
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,679
Should we...

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,920
Let's go.

147
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Let's go, Luo Ke.

148
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,480
Hello.

149
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,320
What can I get you?

150
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,000
We want a drink.

151
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,119
Everyone is here for a drink.

152
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,040
So what would you like?

153
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,320
Could you give me the drinks menu?

154
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,279
Okay.

155
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,640
"Margarita".

156
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,760
"Singapore Sling".

157
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,040
These are all names of people.

158
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,279
"Bloody Mary".

159
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
There wouldn't be blood in it, right?

160
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,400
Luo Ke, do you understand this?

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,119
I... I do.

162
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,799
Excuse me.

163
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,520
Give us two glasses
of your most expensive drinks.

164
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,919
Okay.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,919
Here, sir.

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,159
Your Hennessy Ellipse.

167
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:55,919
Enjoy.

168
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,599
Wait.

169
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,119
Cheers.

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Cheers.

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,880
It's bitter and spicy.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,119
Is this really alcohol?

173
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,119
It's not the same
as the one Jiang Kele brought over.

174
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,719
It's real. Don't worry.

175
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,559
This isn't fake, right?

176
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,599
Don't worry. It isn't.

177
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,159
Su Lie. I have to go.

178
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,039
I've found my destined one.

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Luo Ke!

180
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,679
Hey, handsome.

181
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,559
Fancy a drink?

182
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,280
So shy. Just what I like.

183
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll show you a good time.

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,919
You dance well.

185
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,799
Really?

186
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,239
I could dance even better.

187
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,119
You look a lot like Luo Ke.

188
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,400
I am Luo Ke.

189
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,479
Oh, you're so funny.

190
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,000
Who's that?

191
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,919
Me.

192
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,039
Move.

193
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,880
How dare you dance with my woman?

194
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,000
Get in line.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,479
I said, get in line.

196
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,760
You're asking me to get in line

197
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
to dance with my girlfriend?

198
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,320
Is this shorty your boyfriend?

199
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,359
Not since a long time ago.

200
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm single tonight.

201
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,960
If you win against him, I'm yours.

202
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,479
A battle for love, eh?

203
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,039
Just like in the movies.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,239
Come on. We'll go one-to-one.

205
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
You want to go one-to-one
against my brother?

206
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,960
What's that got to do with you?

207
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm enough to take care of you.

208
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,320
What is this?

209
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Ganging up on me, eh?

210
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,520
Put me down!

211
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,320
Wait here. I'll call for backup.

212
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
Go after him!

213
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,760
I had to do it to keep you safe.

215
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,080
I understand.

216
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,039
Xu Nian,

217
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,239
I'm the one who should apologize.

218
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,880
I misunderstood.

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
I thought you were awful to Qianya.

220
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,000
I treated him quite badly
for a few days.

221
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,000
But you're such a gentleman.

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,719
You never rebutted me at all.

223
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,479
If anything like this happens again,

224
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,719
come to us.

225
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,119
We'll decide what to do together.

226
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,280
That way,

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
you won't have to shoulder everything.

228
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,760
Everything I do will be worth it
as long as you're safe.

229
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,640
Lu Xiao, I want a hug too.

230
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,159
Kele.

231
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,559
Jiang Kele.

232
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,159
Let's talk about the important things.

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay.

234
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,559
Later,

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,479
we'll take you guys

236
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,000
to a safe place.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
And I'll contact the journalists,

238
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,479
and expose the evidence I have.

239
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,200
Xu Guanghan will only notice
that we're gone

240
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,640
by tomorrow morning the soonest.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
But that's not enough time still.

242
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,239
We'll need your help

243
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,479
to do a video interview

244
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,559
to testify against Xu Guanghan.

245
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:56,760
No problem.

246
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,239
And lastly,

247
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,559
you guys can live
under the sunshine now.

248
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,400
That's great.

249
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,719
We've finally come to this point.

250
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,440
But I feel sort of bad.

251
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,119
The Bay House is a great house.

252
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,359
No! It's not a pity at all!

253
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,719
Not at all.

254
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,479
Hm? Why aren't the two of them singing?

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,679
Where are they?

256
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,559
They're definitely going to get it.

257
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,919
Split up and look for them.

258
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,400
Let's go.

259
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
Let's go.

260
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,719
Hey, are you all right?

261
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,239
What's wrong?

262
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Stop!

263
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,599
Wait.

264
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,599
Why aren't you guys following the rules?

265
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,000
We said we were going
to fight one-on-one.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,799
But you wanted to gang up on me.
And you wouldn't let me call for backup.

267
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,119
Backup? Who are you going to call?

268
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,799
Lu Xiao. Xu Nian.

269
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,119
And Su Lie.

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,919
No way.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,479
You're an impersonator.

272
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,760
And you even want to call
the other three in the game

273
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,719
to help you?

274
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,880
I told you. I'm not an impersonator!

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Get him.

276
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,200
Have you seen two guys

277
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,479
wearing caps?

278
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,200
About my height.

279
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,919
One of them is quite muscular.

280
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,320
There were too many people.
I didn't notice.

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,119
Aunty.

282
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,359
Have you seen

283
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,440
two guys about this height?

284
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,840
One of them was wearing
a leather jacket.

285
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,679
No.

286
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,159
Thank you.

287
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,159
Excuse me.

288
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,039
Have you seen these two guys?

289
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,679
They look a lot like Su Lie and Luo Ke.

290
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,760
No.

291
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,880
Bring them over

292
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,840
when you find them.

293
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,200
My friend here loves Luo Ke.

294
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Sorry.

295
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,960
Excuse me.

296
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,479
Have you seen

297
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,359
this person?

298
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,119
No.

299
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,280
Excuse me.

300
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,799
Have you seen these two men here?

301
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,359
One of them is tall.

302
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,440
- No.
- No.

303
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:20,919
Sorry.

304
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,000
Have you seen these two men here?

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,960
No.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,159
Stop it!

307
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,440
Stop it! You jerk!

308
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't beat up my Luo Ke!

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,599
Look carefully.

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,280
That's not your Luo Ke.

311
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,960
Get up!

312
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,080
I can't beat up the virtual Luo Ke.

313
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,039
But I can beat up
an impersonator like you!

314
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,440
I said I'm not an impersonator.

315
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm the real Luo Ke.

316
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,679
He's too indulged, isn't he?

317
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,159
Okay. If you like him that much,

318
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,400
then you'll suffer for his sake.

319
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,359
Why do you want to beat up Luo Ke?

320
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,599
Because he deserves it!

321
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,200
I spent all my money on this woman.

322
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,119
And this woman spent it all
on the virtual Luo Ke.

323
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,239
I spent all my money on her.

324
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,599
And she calls Luo Ke her "boyfriend".

325
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,599
But what does she call me?

326
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,919
"Hey".

327
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,679
Why can she call Luo Ke her "boyfriend",

328
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,919
but turn mute when it comes to me?

329
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,799
Beat him!

330
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,960
Stop it!

331
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,840
Stop it!

332
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,880
This is our problem.

333
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,239
It has nothing to do with Luo Ke.

334
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,679
Stop hitting him!

335
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,960
Stop it! He might die!

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,559
Stop it!

337
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,359
If you stop,
I'll get back together with you!

338
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,400
Stop it!

339
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,799
All right.

340
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,520
But you have to promise

341
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,359
that you won't mention breaking up
with me for three months.

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,479
Okay. Let's go.

343
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,680
I guess the outside world

344
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,239
hates Luo Ke too.

345
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,280
They don't even have phones.

346
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,319
Where could they go?

347
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,079
Let's split up and look for them.

348
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,959
You guys go that way. We'll go this way.

349
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:44,599
Okay.

350
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,199
Let's go.

351
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,280
Sir,

352
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,520
Sir,

353
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,119
have you seen these two boys?

354
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,119
Are they boys?

355
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,400
Yes.

356
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,359
No.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,599
Never saw them.

358
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,719
Okay. Thank you, sir.

359
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,040
Excuse me.

360
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,520
I'd like to ask,

361
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,520
have you seen these two people?

362
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,800
No.

363
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,199
Thank you.

364
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:13,839
Excuse me.

365
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,839
Have you seen these two people?

366
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,599
These two.

367
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,239
Luo Ke and Su Lie!

368
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,439
I have!

369
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,280
Where?

370
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,800
Over there.

371
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,199
I'll take you guys there.

372
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
These are the Su Lie and Luo Ke
you're looking for.

373
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,239
You can see them
once you put on the glasses.

374
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,439
Crazy lady.

375
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
You're the one who's crazy!

376
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,959
I brought you over here,
and you're insulting me.

377
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,439
I didn't notice earlier.

378
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,280
But he looks a lot like Lu Xiao.

379
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,040
You're being rude.

380
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,800
Why are you getting so close
to someone's boyfriend?

381
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,079
Fine. Fine.

382
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,520
He just looks like Lu Xiao.

383
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,040
The one I hate the most.

384
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,439
What did you say?

385
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,719
Lu Xiao's great. Why would you hate him?

386
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,719
Tell me who you like.

387
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,839
I won't back down.

388
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,560
I like Luo Ke.

389
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,880
Look. He's so cute.

390
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,040
Luo Ke?

391
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,000
Only beginners would like him.

392
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,280
You're the beginner!

393
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,119
You're just wasting my time.
Crazy lady.

394
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,520
Get back here!

395
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,319
All right. All right.

396
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,160
Lu Xiao, let go of me!

397
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,920
She was insulting you!

398
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,880
I'm going to get even!

399
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,719
That's enough.

400
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,560
She's just talking
about the virtual Lu Xiao.

401
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm right here, right?

402
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,959
It's fine. Don't get angry.

403
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,239
Who does she think she is?

404
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,760
She can't just insult someone,
whether they're fake or real.

405
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
Okay. Okay. Calm down.

406
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,359
I'm so mad.

407
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,920
If I see her again,

408
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
I'm going to beat her up.

409
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,560
All right. Don't get upset anymore.

410
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,599
I'm your exclusive Lu Xiao.

411
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,760
Were they two attracted by anything

412
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,479
when you guys got out?

413
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,319
Attracted by...

414
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,359
Malatang!

415
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,199
They wanted to eat it badly
but they couldn't!

416
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,160
Then they might have gone
looking for food.

417
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,920
Are there any
malatang stalls around here?

418
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,680
Wait.

419
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,760
Okay.

420
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,160
Luo Ke, over here!

421
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,479
There's a malatang stall up ahead.

422
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,560
Let's go check it out.

423
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:35,959
Let's go.

424
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,560
Okay.

425
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Luo Ke?

426
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,839
You... How did you get hurt?

427
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Who beat you up?

428
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,760
Was... Was it Lu Xiao?

429
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,640
Su Lie. I have something to ask you.

430
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,719
You have to be honest with me.

431
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,199
Am I really that unlikable?

432
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,719
No.

433
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,719
You can be a bit annoying
when you run your mouth,

434
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,119
but I still like you.

435
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,520
Everyone likes you.

436
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,719
Why do you ask?

437
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,839
I was abandoned by my parents as a kid.

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,040
Even my own birth parents
abandoned me...

439
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,800
Who could possibly like me?

440
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,119
I never felt it that much
inside Bay House.

441
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,040
But when I went outside,

442
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,719
I realized how unlikable I am.

443
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,920
Luo Ke, you shouldn't blame yourself.

444
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,719
That's not your problem.

445
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,839
The problem lies with the outside world.

446
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
The outside world ...

447
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,839
Oh, right. Why did you come back?

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,680
A bunch of women with red lipstick
were chasing after me.

449
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,359
I barely made it back here.

450
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,800
The outside world is too scary.

451
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,079
Yes.

452
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,959
It isn't like

453
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,760
the movies at all.

454
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,239
Let's not go outside anymore, okay?

455
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Okay.

456
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,000
How was it?
You guys couldn't find them too?

457
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,479
We tried all the places nearby.

458
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,680
Not a single sign of them.

459
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,959
We looked for them all night as well.
We're exhausted.

460
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,079
They don't know how to do anything

461
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,599
besides getting others into trouble.

462
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,040
I always held you back
from hitting them.

463
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
But now I feel like I want
to beat them up too.

464
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:23,880
You don't have to.

465
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,680
Someone else did it for you.

466
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:31,239
(World's best Luo Ke impersonator
appears at a bar!)

467
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,880
(Fails to catch a date
and instead gets beaten up!)

468
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
(Oh my gosh!
He looks like Luo Ke a lot!)

469
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,719
(It's a shame
I couldn't see him in person.)

470
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
(Ridiculous.)

471
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,920
(My Luo Ke wouldn't flirt around.)

472
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,160
(It must be Lu Xiao's crazy fans.)

473
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,479
(They're trying to pin it on Luo Ke.)

474
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,079
Luo Ke is the only one in the photo.

475
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,000
What about Su Lie?

476
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,000
Su Lie was with him.

477
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,119
And Luo Ke got beaten up.

478
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,439
I doubt he's in any better condition.

479
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,400
True.

480
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
The both of them

481
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
have never come outside.

482
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,319
They must be terrified.

483
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,319
They must be hiding somewhere.

484
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,800
It's their first time coming outside.

485
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,439
So the safest place for them

486
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,880
must be the Bay House.

487
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,800
Let's go find them.

488
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,180
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

489
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,079
Since Xu Nian's phone was discovered,

490
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,599
Fushun and Guan Qianya
have not made any reports.

491
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,439
It seems Xu Nian
is on your side, after all.

492
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,880
He is my son, after all.

493
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,640
Does he have any other options

494
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,079
but to side with me?

495
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:54,800
No.

496
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,880
Any other choices
will lead to a dead end.

497
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,239
The data collection is complete.

498
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,920
Should we proceed with the next step?

499
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,359
The Bay House has served its purpose.

500
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,119
It's time to transfer the four of them
to a different place.

501
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,160
There were too many of them.

502
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,239
I couldn't win by myself,
so I got beaten up.

503
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,479
And I ran back here.

504
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,319
Only to find that Su Lie
was already back here.

505
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,040
It's a good thing you weren't caught.

506
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,479
You were just bruised up.

507
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,239
All right. Let's go.

508
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,280
Go? Where?

509
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,280
Away from here.

510
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,199
But you guys can't move
on your own anymore.

511
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,359
You have to stick with the group.

512
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,599
That way, at least Xu Nian and I
can protect you guys.

513
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,839
Go out again?

514
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,319
No, no, no!

515
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,839
The world outside is too dangerous!

516
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,079
The bar isn't fun at all!

517
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I already discussed it with Su Lie.

518
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,199
We're not going anywhere.

519
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,599
We're not going to the bar this time.

520
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,839
We're leaving Bay House for good.

521
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,000
Leaving the Bay House for good?

522
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,359
Why?

523
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,640
We want to stay here.

524
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,760
We don't want to go anywhere!

525
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,239
Do you know

526
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,760
that your life could be in danger
if you stay here?

527
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Why would my life be in danger

528
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
staying in the Bay House?

529
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,800
The outside world is way more dangerous.

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,439
Have you forgotten about

531
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,400
Xu Guanghan's punishments?

532
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,800
As long as we're good,

533
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,760
Mr. Xu wouldn't hurt us.

534
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,400
Fine. Have it your way.

535
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,719
Stay here.

536
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,199
You'll understand when you die.

537
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,239
What would I understand
if I'm already dead?

538
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,239
The world outside is so dangerous.

539
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,719
Who knows who is going to die first?

540
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:20,880
You... Serves you right
for getting beaten up.

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
What are you afraid of?

542
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,640
Of others beating you up
for being an impersonator?

543
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,959
Then... Is it because you're afraid
of women, Su Lie?

544
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,400
A grown man afraid of a woman?

545
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
What good are you?

546
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:35,920
You tried your best.

547
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
If they don't want to leave,

548
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,280
then leave them be.

549
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,599
No, you don't understand.
Su Lie was traumatized.

550
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,239
He was kidnapped by a woman
when he was a child.

551
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,959
Why don't I buy you some fruits?

552
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,040
I don't want fruits.

553
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,719
I want to eat cotton candy.

554
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,800
Be good now. Fruits are more nutritious.

555
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,079
And they are sweeter than cotton candy.

556
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,439
Mommy will buy some for you.

557
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,959
What would you like, ma'am?

558
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,880
A bit of everything.

559
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,119
Here. This is for you.

560
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,959
How about I take you
to somewhere to play, little boy?

561
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,959
Does that sound good?

562
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:06,719
Okay.

563
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,560
Let's go.

564
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
After listening to your story,

565
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
why do I feel like

566
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,239
a woman with red lipstick
kidnapped you

567
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,439
and sold you to Xu Guanghan?

568
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,880
Don't slander Mr. Xu!

569
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,479
Mr. Xu saved Su Lie

570
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,479
and took me in.

571
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,040
He wouldn't hurt us now too.

572
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,400
Fools.

573
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,000
Look, Su Lie.

574
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
Not all women are bad
in the outside world.

575
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,359
Look at her.

576
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
She wears red lipstick too, doesn't she?

577
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,959
But she's a good woman.

578
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,160
Mr. Xu.

579
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,520
Oh, no.

580
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,520
Hello, Mr. Xu. Lei Na.

581
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,439
Jiang Kele.

582
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
You're cleaning up
so early in the morning.

583
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,199
Did you just arrive?

584
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,040
Or did you never leave last night?

585
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,640
Of course, I just came!

586
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
How could a girl

587
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,239
stay together with four boys,

588
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:23,880
right?

589
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,319
I'm not that kind of person.

590
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,280
Jiang Kele.

591
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
You performed well
for the past period of time.

592
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,280
You were never late,
and neither did you leave early.

593
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,920
You were very serious at work as well.

594
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:37,079
Mr. Xu and I are pleased.

595
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,359
Wait.

596
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,880
Are you firing me?

597
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,880
Because the last time I was praised

598
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,119
was when I was getting fired.

599
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:45,880
Yes.

600
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,959
