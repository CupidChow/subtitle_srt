1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,039
Lu Xiao.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,520
Don't bother hiding.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,720
This is a private ward.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,079
No one will see you here.

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,079
Granny?

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,680
What do you want?

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,200
It's all right. He is one of us.

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,799
Doctor, how is he now?

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,079
Why hasn't he woken up?

10
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:23,879
Is he ever going to wake up?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,159
Young lady, calm down.

12
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,159
His injury is not so severe.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,000
He suffered soft tissue contusion
at the chest.

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,280
He also got a concussion.

15
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,079
He won't be awake for quite some time.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,400
But he will be safe.

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,400
Some rest will be enough.

18
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,360
Young people heal fast.

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,080
Very well, I'll take good care of him.

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,720
I'll leave you be then.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,799
Thank you.

22
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:42,919
Thank you, doctor.

23
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,319
Granny!

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,319
Don't cry, please!

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,639
Hush.

26
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,759
Stop crying.

27
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,000
This is all my fault.

28
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,680
How is this your fault?

29
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,319
You heard the doctor.

30
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,360
Lu Xiao will be fine.

31
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,119
Not to mention

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,759
he is young and strong. He heals fast.

33
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,360
Right?

34
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,560
Look on the bright side.

35
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,639
Everyone managed

36
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,559
to escape safely.

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
That's the best you could ask for.

38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,160
Granny.

39
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,120
How is Qianya doing?

40
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,800
Who?

41
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,480
Qianya.

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
You only think of them now?

43
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,199
Tell me what happened!

44
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,279
They are doing just fine.

45
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,040
They all are staying
in Guan Qianya's house.

46
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,360
Qianya also contacted

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,599
the reporters.

48
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,680
They will all testify against

49
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,559
my dear Xu Guanghan.

50
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,120
We've finally made it.

51
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,519
I hope Qianya's plan will succeed.

52
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,199
Granny.

53
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,000
I beg of you, please help them.

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm not taking orders from you.

55
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,599
But when the time is right,

56
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,559
should you need my help in any way,

57
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,919
I'll gladly assist you.

58
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
That's because...

59
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,990
=Love Crossed=

60
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,130
=Episode 26=

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,919
Ms. Guan.

62
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
So this is the big secret
you mentioned before?

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,199
I thought you didn't want to expose him.

64
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,679
It wasn't the right timing.

65
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,800
You've met them in person

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,320
and you've heard their stories.

67
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,399
I need you to contact your team now.

68
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,919
Spread this news with a live stream.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,320
Sure, no problem.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,199
How should I approach this scoop?

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,160
Should I report it from the perspective
of a businesswoman

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,919
who is struggling with her dying company

73
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,800
while meeting her true love?

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Or should I report it

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,919
from the perspective of
a romance game addict

76
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,520
who finds out her virtual
lover is a real person,

77
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,800
that her wildest fantasy comes true?

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,479
Tell the public

79
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,279
that Y4 is a group of people that exist.

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,039
Xu Guanghan imprisoned them

81
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,320
for his own profits.

82
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,119
That's all you need to report.

83
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,360
That's too boring.

84
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,679
It won't pique anyone's interest.

85
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,320
There is no emotional plot.

86
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,279
It's hard for the audience to relate.

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,119
What do you have in mind?

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,839
I plan to employ a more novel approach.

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
I could live with them for some time

90
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,080
to uncover what they keep
in their hearts,

91
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
so that I could tell the story
from their perspective.

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
No, that can't be right.

93
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,240
It could be very exciting.

94
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,080
Lu Xiao.

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,679
His parents and friend passed away
from accidents.

96
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,039
He thinks he would bring misfortune to
those around him.

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,880
So he ended up being desperate
and wandering on the street.

98
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,559
Then Xu Guanghan tricked him into
joining Yao Inc.

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,600
Su Lie.

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,279
A woman abducted him

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,359
when he was a kid.

102
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,720
But now, he is the perfect lover

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,279
of countless women.

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
But he can't even look a lady

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,519
in the eyes.

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,480
Luo Ke.

107
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,880
His parents were knee-deep in debts,

108
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
so they sold him to Xu Guanghan.

109
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,760
Xu Guanghan has been imprisoning
and brainwashing him for so many years,

110
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,239
thus making him believe Xu Guanghan

111
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,760
is the only one who cares about him.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not brainwashing.

113
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,119
Mr. Xu has always cared about us!

114
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:50,119
The typical symptom
of Stockholm syndrome.

115
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,519
What syndrome?

116
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Stockholm syndrome.

117
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,519
Xu Nian.

118
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,880
As soon as he was born,

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,279
his mother, who was a superstar,
abandoned him.

120
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,399
Then her manager, who was the father
of her child,

121
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,399
imprisoned him

122
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,640
to shape him into a virtual character
admired by the world.

123
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,279
And then

124
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,799
he fell in love

125
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,720
with his father's nemesis.

126
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,079
He is even planning

127
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,040
to send his own father to jail.

128
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,399
These are very spicy scoops.

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,839
You don't even see this in TV dramas.

130
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,640
If you put it that way,

131
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,160
my story is just as spicy.

132
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,720
I am Cui Hengzhi.

133
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,920
At first...

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
At first, my wife and I

135
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,160
had a sweet

136
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,559
and happy life.

137
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,679
But after she became
addicted to the game,

138
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,279
she lost herself in it.

139
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,399
She even divorced me.

140
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,679
There's more.

141
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,359
My boss, Ms. Guan.

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Guan Qianya!

143
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,119
She was totally against this game.

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,880
She used the account I registered
to infiltrate the enemy's rank.

145
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,880
But what happened next?

146
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,040
She became an addict herself!

147
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,239
Her life was in danger.

148
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,959
But thanks to my help,

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,559
everyone escaped safely.

150
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,279
Then I contacted a woman reporter.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,679
Why?

152
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,239
I want the world to know
these shocking stories!

153
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,559
So what's the main takeaway?

154
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:22,640
You only have these stories
because of my contribution!

155
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,279
He does have a point.

156
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,399
Everyone has a thrilling story,

157
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,239
except for you.

158
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,160
This is too much information
for me to process.

159
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,799
I need to sort out the details.

160
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,519
Please make haste with it.

161
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
Ms. Guan, don't worry.

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,600
She seems like a capable person.

163
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,679
She can sort out everything.

164
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,480
That's not my concern.

165
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,839
I want to know when she can finish it.

166
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,720
The sooner we expose him,
the safer we are.

167
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,200
Qianya, don't worry. The plan will work.

168
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,480
It's too late.

169
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,200
Xu Guanghan got ahead of us.

170
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,559
Settle down.

171
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm not a celebrity.

172
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,559
I should start now.

173
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,600
To the players of Love Boys

174
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,959
and everyone who supports our company,

175
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,679
I must express
my deepest apology to you.

176
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,399
I told a lie.

177
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,959
Y4's image was not
the work of creativity.

178
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,679
The truth is,

179
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
they were based on real people.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,119
What?

181
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,799
I told a lie because

182
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,279
all four of them deserved sympathy.

183
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,880
Lu Xiao,

184
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
his real name is Li Zhenyu.

185
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,320
He lost his parents when he was young
and ended up on the street.

186
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,079
He was lonely and helpless,

187
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,279
so I took him in.

188
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,320
Su Lie, his real name is Su Minglie.

189
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,760
A human trafficker abducted him
when he was six.

190
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I met him and rescued him.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
I saved him from a worse fate.

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,200
Luo Ke, his real name is Luo Wenxuan.

193
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
His parents were in debt.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,040
They abandoned him.

195
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,079
I took him in.

196
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,880
As for Xu Nian...

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,959
Xu Nian is my son.

198
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,679
His son?

199
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,959
His mother is Ge Yilan.

200
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,640
Ge Yilan?

201
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
Ge Yilan? The superstar?

202
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,359
For the sake of her career in showbiz,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,559
she abandoned her own son.

204
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
I've carried out my duty
as a father for my son,

205
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
which made up for the pain
his mother had brought him.

206
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,919
By the way,

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,479
this is

208
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,119
my son's birth certificate

209
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:49,239
and the adoption certificates
for the other three people.

210
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,320
(Birth Certificate)

211
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,239
Over the years,

212
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,440
I did my best

213
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,119
to give them

214
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,760
a cozy place to call home.

215
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
I kept them from harm

216
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,840
so they could grow up without worries.

217
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,919
Fortunately, they are gifted.

218
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:10,039
It's their dream to become stars.

219
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,599
So I made their dream come true.

220
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,440
That's the story of the Y4 you love.

221
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,320
As a father,

222
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
I looked after them
for years unconditionally.

223
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,599
As a manager,

224
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,479
I signed contracts with them.

225
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,400
(Yao Inc. Brokerage Contract)
The contract expired.

226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
They should be free now.

227
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,520
May I know where they are at the moment?

228
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,520
Soon...

229
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,719
You will soon see them

230
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,719
in the physical world.

231
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,119
But I must remind you.

232
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,280
They lack experience with society.

233
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
They need time to acclimatize.

234
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,440
If they fall short of your expectations
in any way,

235
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,679
put the blame on me.

236
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,239
I see them as my own children.

237
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,039
A father can do anything

238
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,440
for his children.

239
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,039
So there are contracts.

240
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,320
But your method

241
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
is no different from imprisonment.

242
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,799
They lived in a place called Bay House.

243
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
We have security guards there,

244
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,280
but it is to keep them safe.

245
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,280
After all, they are superstars.

246
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
There is a secret passage to take.

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
They can come and go freely

248
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,280
via that secret passage.

249
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,840
See? A date at the restaurant.

250
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,479
Next...

251
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,359
He's dancing on the floor.

252
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,599
Does this look like imprisonment to you?

253
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

254
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,320
I am a strict father.

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,039
I'm a demanding manager.

256
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,239
However...

257
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,799
I'm not a criminal.

258
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
This is great!

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
Y4 really exists!

260
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,400
I can't believe this is happening!

261
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,820
(Yao Inc. CEO apologizes to fans
for real-life prototypes behind Love Boys)

262
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,440
What's so great about it?

263
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,280
Xu Guanghan is clearly lying!

264
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
You heard what he said.

265
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,799
It was a white lie.

266
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,520
Why should we care if he's lying?

267
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,440
We just want to enjoy the game.

268
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
I really expect to meet them

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,159
in real world.

270
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,760
If they even go on tours,

271
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,479
I will be there to root for them!

272
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,599
Yes! I can give up my life for them.

273
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,559
They've been imprisoned for years!

274
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,880
How could you be so cruel?

275
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
What imprisonment?

276
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,479
They were bound by contracts.

277
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,799
Those weren't contracts!

278
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,679
Those were unfair clauses!

279
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,440
The contract expired long ago!

280
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Xu Guanghan kept them
locked up regardless!

281
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,559
It was me who found the secret passage!

282
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,200
What are you talking about?

283
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
She must be crazy,

284
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,559
or she is just one of those haters.

285
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm telling you the truth!

286
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Please believe me.

287
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,119
I really think

288
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,440
you need to get a psychologist.

289
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,280
Oh no, our plan to thwart
Xu Guanghan failed!

290
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,280
Ms. Guan.

291
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,200
Ms. Guan.

292
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,039
Ms. Guan.

293
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,200
Ms. Guan.

294
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,239
Ms. Guan! The public's opinion

295
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,200
is taking his side.

296
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,479
They chose to believe Xu Guanghan.

297
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,119
After Y4’s existence in real world
was confirmed,

298
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,520
the game became even more popular.

299
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,960
They even asked for Y4

300
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,440
to debut and go on tours.

301
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,080
See?

302
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,799
Yao Inc.'s stock price
has skyrocketed!

303
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
It hit the limit up.

304
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
Under such circumstances,

305
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,479
our chances for financing are dwindling.

306
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,239
The company barely has any money left.

307
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,359
What should we do next?

308
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,960
I need some time alone.

309
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,440
Surprise.

310
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,000
Guan Qianya.

311
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,280
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

312
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,520
Why are you here?

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,559
Security guards!

314
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,599
Don't bother.

315
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,880
They knew your company is dying,

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,840
so they all left.

317
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,679
What do you want?

318
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,239
We are here

319
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,119
to give you an award.

320
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,679
Lei Na.

321
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Congratulations, Ms. Guan.

322
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,280
You're the Best Competitor of the Year.

323
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,440
You don't have to wear it.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Now, let's welcome Mr. Xu to
give us his speech.

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,919
Guan Qianya.

326
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,039
I have countless rivals

327
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,119
and enemies.

328
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,599
But why would I give you this award?

329
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
As a CEO,

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,520
you're nothing short of a failure.

331
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,359
As a rival,

332
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,520
you are barely a threat to me.

333
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
But I appreciate your creativity.

334
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,000
You actually

335
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,760
approached my son to bring me down.

336
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,880
You thought your plan was going to work.

337
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,400
But in the end,

338
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,159
you paid the ultimate price.

339
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,799
Your company is closing down
and you're broke.

340
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
Your effort is commendable.

341
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,119
You deserve this award more than anyone.

342
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,640
By the way,

343
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
I prepared a gift for you. Lei Na.

344
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,719
Thank you for your time and endeavor.

345
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,640
You have nothing left,

346
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,320
but at least you get
to keep this memory.

347
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,799
Just take it.

348
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,919
We didn't delete
the contents in that phone.

349
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
I don't need your award.

350
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,159
You should be grateful

351
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,520
to the ignorant public.

352
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,679
If they were slightly smarter,

353
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,679
you and your company

354
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,080
would be loathed by the whole world.

355
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,000
Do you realize why your plan failed?

356
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,200
You have too much faith in humanity.

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Humans

358
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,599
are animals with flaws.

359
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,599
Give them what they crave,

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,679
they will follow you blindly.

361
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,440
Your plan was destined to end with pain.

362
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,919
Your failure was inevitable.

363
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,919
That's all for the ceremony.

364
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,119
By the way,

365
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,880
pass a message to Xu Nian for me.

366
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,000
He is still my son.

367
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,840
When he comes to his senses,

368
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,880
I welcome his return.

369
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,440
Thank you.

370
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,440
Congratulations.

371
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,220
(In-patient Department)

372
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
Lu Xiao, you're finally awake.

373
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,640
How do you feel?

374
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,840
Do you need a doctor?

375
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,000
Kele.

376
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm fine.

377
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,559
Where are we?

378
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,719
You went into a coma after you got hurt.

379
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,760
But the doctor said you were safe.

380
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,239
You only need time to recover.

381
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,520
Where are the others?
Are they safe?

382
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,559
Don't worry.

383
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,960
They are safe.

384
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,200
What about Xu Guanghan?

385
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,479
Did you expose him?

386
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
So our plan to expose him failed

387
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,640
before it even got off the ground.

388
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,880
We didn't expect him to
make the announcement.

389
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,559
No word can describe my fury.

390
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,159
Forget about him.

391
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Well,

392
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,400
you need to have some food.

393
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,559
I brought you something.

394
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,440
Wontons with chicken soup.

395
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,880
You need to replenish your strength

396
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,159
so you can get well soon.

397
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,799
Sorry, Kele.

398
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,039
I don't have the appetite.

399
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,239
Lu Xiao!

400
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,599
What are you doing?

401
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,000
I know you're worried.

402
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,159
I'm worried too.

403
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,200
But we can wait to get back at him.

404
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,760
We are still young.

405
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,239
We couldn't bring him down,

406
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
but we could torment him.

407
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,800
Xu Guanghan is a despicable villain
who feeds the people lies.

408
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,719
I can't accept this.

409
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,160
I must expose his lies.

410
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,599
He can be cunning,

411
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,479
but it's a fact that he hit me!

412
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,560
I didn't injure you.

413
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,400
We were roughhousing.

414
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,760
Xu Guanghan's lapdog,

415
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,000
how dare you come here!

416
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,160
Mind your words.

417
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,839
I am merely a security guard
at the park.

418
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,640
I have nothing to do
with Mr. Xu's project.

419
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,560
But you were trespassing the park.

420
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,959
It was my duty to ask you to leave.

421
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,359
But you

422
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,719
slapped me in the face.

423
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,199
You pushed me off the building.

424
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,760
What did I do wrong?

425
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,800
I suffered severe injuries too.

426
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,800
I had broken ribs.

427
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,560
But I have the habit of working out.

428
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,400
So I healed fast.

429
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,000
Technically speaking,

430
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,520
I should demand you to pay
for my medical bill.

431
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm warning you.

432
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
Leave now if you

433
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,839
don't want to get slapped again!

434
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
Jiang Kele!

435
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,640
Calm down.

436
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,520
We don't plan to pursue legal actions.

437
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Xu
and the company.

438
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,439
to visit

439
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,160
our outstanding employee Lu Xiao.

440
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,359
Mr. Xu wanted

441
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,719
to come here in person.

442
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,439
But he is too busy.

443
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,160
His schedule is packed with interviews.

444
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,800
He can barely catch a breath.

445
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,599
Lei Na!

446
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,839
Spare me your lies!

447
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,239
The others might fall for his lies,

448
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,000
but you know the truth!

449
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,959
The truth?

450
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Whatever the people believe

451
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,479
will be the only truth.

452
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,119
Everyone believes

453
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,359
Mr. Xu's telling the truth.

454
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,119
Nothing you say can change that.

455
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Before Mr. Xu

456
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,280
made the decision to
announce your existence,

457
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,359
he had to muster great courage.

458
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,839
You should cherish

459
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,800
the freedom you have now.

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,520
Do not let his goodwill go to waste.

461
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,599
Right.

462
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,359
I'm here

463
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,280
to bring you even better news.

464
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,920
The public has high hopes

465
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,199
for the four of you.

466
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,000
So Mr. Xu

467
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,359
plans to turn you

468
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
into a top idol group.

469
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,599
He wants you to publish albums,
film ads and movies

470
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,479
and even go on tours.

471
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,959
He wants you to enjoy the spotlight

472
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,760
as you stand on the stage in person.

473
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,280
If you are willing to do so,

474
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,187
(Yao Inc.
Artist-Company Brokerage Contract)

475
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,400
go through this contract.

476
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,760
We will never believe

477
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
anything he says!

478
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,439
Kele.

479
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,239
You are too young and reckless.

480
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,880
Your decision doesn't
represent the others'.

481
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Am I right?

482
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,340
(Yao Inc.
Artist-Company Brokerage Contract)

483
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,959
Send my word to Xu Guanghan.

484
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,920
Whatever he says or does,

485
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,599
I will never trust him again.

486
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm never going back
to Yao Inc.!

487
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,239
You only regained your freedom recently.

488
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,760
This is all very fresh to you.

489
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,839
But you have no idea

490
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,800
what the harsh reality is like.

491
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,800
You only learned how to
sing and dance in Bay House.

492
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,239
You have no choice
but to debut as an idol.

493
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,079
Ponder on what I said.

494
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,319
When you come to your senses,

495
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,599
feel free to call me.

496
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,880
Yao Inc. will always

497
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
welcome your return.

498
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,760
I'll still be like a sister to you.

499
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,319
Don't touch me.

500
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:51,880
Xu Nian.

501
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,280
I never knew you could cook.

502
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,280
That's right.

503
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
We should have asked you

504
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,079
to cook for us back at Bay House.

505
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,439
We wouldn't have needed Kele.

506
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,560
Xu Nian.

507
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
Did you learn

508
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
how to cook from your father?

509
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
He was never my father.

510
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,520
Just eat.

511
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,119
You should eat something.

512
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,959
That day at the flagship store,

513
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,079
the fans were staying up all night

514
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,040
just to get in line

515
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,520
to buy the products of us.

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,719
I should have known

517
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,239
how the world would react.

518
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,000
But we were too naive.

519
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:19,959
Xu Nian.

520
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Was I too conceited?

521
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,359
Was it a mistake right from the start?

522
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,479
Qianya.

523
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,839
You did the right thing.

524
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,079
It's the world's fault.

525
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,560
It's said the truth is held
by the powerful few.

526
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
So what's the point of having the truth?

527
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,400
I really thought I could save the world.

528
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
I thought I was a woman warrior

529
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,199
and a leader.

530
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,599
But when I think about it,

531
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,359
people are having fun
in their own fantasy.

532
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,280
Why should I wake them up?

533
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,640
Or perhaps...

534
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
I should be the one to open my eyes.

535
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,239
Qianya.

536
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,160
Had you not seen it so clearly,

537
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,400
had you not tried,

538
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,239
we would never have met each other.

539
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,000
I met Xu Guanghan today.

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,199
He wanted you to know

541
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,359
that you were always his son.

542
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,920
He would forgive everything you've done.

543
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,119
So if you wished to go home,

544
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,280
he would always welcome you.

545
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,760
Let's pretend you never said this.

546
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,940
(In-patient Department)

547
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,079
He's almost healed.

548
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,599
After your discharge,

549
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,119
you must take exercise, rest well and
replenish your nutrients.

550
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,520
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

551
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:49,839
Very well.

552
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,239
Thanks.

553
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:50,760
I should get going.

554
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,880
Thank you, doctor.

555
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,640
I'll get the slippers.

556
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,359
You're discharged.

557
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,239
Lu Xiao!

558
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:56,959
- Granny.
- Granny.

559
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,160
You're finally discharged.

560
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,439
How are you holding up?

561
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,719
So you've learned to show your concerns.

562
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,280
You're the only ones

563
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,520
we know in the real world.

564
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,280
Xu Nian asked us to visit you.

565
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,479
When you get well,

566
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,199
let's go out and have fun.

567
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,839
Where are Xu Nian and Qianya?

568
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,680
Qianya's company

569
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,319
filed for bankruptcy and liquidation.

570
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,599
From now on,

571
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,199
Qianya's house and cars

572
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,599
will be confiscated.

573
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,359
Luo Ke and Su Lie

574
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,280
will be living with me.

575
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,239
Kele.

576
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,280
Lu Xiao.

577
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,239
Why don't you live with me too?

578
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,439
In that case,

579
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,560
Qianya's hard work and career

580
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,599
are all lost.

581
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,160
She must be depressed over this.

582
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,760
Kele, it's all right.

583
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,599
We'll be together

584
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
from now on.

585
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,560
But Qianya and I

586
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,439
lived in that house for so long.

587
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,760
It's full of our wonderful memories.

588
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,719
And now we are going to lose it.

589
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,680
Granny.

590
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,880
For the next few days,

591
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,239
I want to keep Qianya company.

592
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,560
While you're doing so,

593
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,880
you should also figure out

594
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,239
how to start your new life.

595
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,740
(Crush On Love)

596
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
Ms. Guan.

597
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,239
Have you packed up everything?

598
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,560
We should leave now.

599
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,719
The company is gone.

600
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,959
What's the point of packing anyway?

601
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,199
Perhaps...

602
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,479
You could take something from here

603
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,000
as a token of memory.

604
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,199
What's the point?

605
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,400
It will remind me of the pain.

606
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,599
We should take this.

607
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,520
On the first day I started this company,

608
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,880
Kele gave it to me.

609
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,000
All right.

610
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,319
Mr. Cui.

611
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,280
When I started this company,

612
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,920
you were the first to be here.

613
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,280
Now that I lost the company,

614
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,280
you are the last to leave.

615
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,439
Thank you for all this time.

616
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,599
I must have let you down.

617
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,520
Please don't say that.

618
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,839
I've been working with you for years.

619
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,400
It has been an honor.

620
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,959
I've been enjoying it.

621
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,880
What is your plan?

622
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,199
I...

623
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,520
I would give myself a break.

624
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,920
After all,

625
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,160
I went through quite a lot.

626
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,119
I want to visit my ex-wife.

627
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,959
What about you?

628
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
What do you have in mind?

629
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,400
I didn't have the time
to make a plan.

630
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,119
Ms. Guan.

631
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,479
If you ever make a comeback,

632
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,000
feel free to contact me.

633
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll gladly return as your aide.

634
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,160
You've been an outstanding partner.

635
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,160
But I failed as a boss.

636
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,719
Thank you for not giving up on me.

637
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,800
Ms. Guan. Take care.

638
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,239
Goodbye.

639
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,319
Qianya.

640
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,599
Why are you here?

641
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,959
