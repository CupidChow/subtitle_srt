1
00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:01,720
He told Ge Yilan

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,799
that the baby was dead

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,800
the moment he was born.

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,319
Don't cry.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,639
He won't come back
no matter how hard you cry.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,079
How heartless of you.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,399
That child's not only mine.

8
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,479
That was your child too.

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,559
Don't you feel sad at all?

10
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:31,840
I've said

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,599
it's no use for me
to be upset about it as you are.

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,360
Rather than bother about such matters,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
it'd be better for you to focus

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,000
on how to regain
the popularity you lost over the year.

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,279
How about this?

16
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:45,319
I'll postpone your itinerary
to a month later.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,799
To give you some time to adjust.
Would that work?

18
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,560
How could you be so heartless?

19
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,560
I understand now.

20
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,959
This child and I

21
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,319
mean nothing to you at all, don't we?

22
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:08,919
All you care about is your work.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
It's my work.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,199
But isn't it yours as well?

25
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,559
Who was the person
saying she wanted to become a star?

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,800
If I had known that you would
be such a heartless bastard,

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,160
I'd have never approached you!

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,040
You said publicizing our relationship
would ruin my career.

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,599
What about now?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,720
My life is ruined
because of you, Xu Guanghan!

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,400
Your career isn't ruined.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,760
All the public knows

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,599
is that you've taken a break
for health issues.

34
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,160
If you follow my plans,

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
you'll still be that star
you wanted to be.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,319
I will not!

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,000
I will not return to the stage!

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,440
From now on,

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,639
I won't be controlled by you any longer!

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,720
You said you were doing
all of this for my sake,

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,639
but you did it all for your own gain!

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,279
I hate you!

43
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,760
Get out!

44
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,360
Leave! I never want to see you again!

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,919
You selfish man!

46
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't ever let me see you again!

47
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,639
My baby...

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Ge Yilan couldn't handle
everything that had happened.

49
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,320
So she left the stage

50
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,199
and migrated to Canada.

51
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,839
Xu Guanghan

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,839
hid the child.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,080
That child

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
is you.

55
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,479
Xu Nian.

56
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,080
Please stop interfering, Aunty.

57
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,240
Answer me first.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,399
What did this child do wrong?

59
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,119
You had to tie him up

60
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,160
and punish him like this?

61
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,600
Are you behaving like a father at all?

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,720
I found a phone in his room.

63
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,559
He knows everything

64
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,160
about Y4 now.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
I gave him the phone.

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
Why would you do that?

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Because you promised me!

68
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,479
You said you would let them go

69
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,479
when they became adults.

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,119
Well, they are adults now.

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,479
And your game is about to be complete.

72
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,160
Did you let them go? No.

73
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,320
I just thought

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,080
that they should
learn about the outside world.

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,360
So I gave him the phone.

76
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,279
I'm sorry! I was wrong.

77
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,520
Sorry! Sorry!

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Punish me!

79
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,559
Come on! Punish me!

80
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,600
Here. Cuff me!

81
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,600
Activate the electric bolts!

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,880
And the water board!

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,839
And the shots!

84
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,919
Lei Na!

85
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,440
That's not what I meant!

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Who told you to cuff her?

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
I meant...

88
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,960
Aunty is tired. Send her back.

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,679
Sorry, Aunty.

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,839
Be careful, Grandma.

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,559
It does hurt.

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
Aunty.

93
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,679
Go back first.

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,039
I have to talk to my son.

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,039
Okay.

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,279
You should.

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,119
Both of you should be honest

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,080
and have a heart-to-heart talk.

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,679
I hope you'll be able

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,320
to clear all misunderstandings.

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm warning you.

102
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,359
If you dare to touch a hair
on my grandnephew,

103
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,480
I will destroy

104
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,600
the entire Bay House.

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't be afraid.

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,839
The dumbest woman in the world.

107
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,399
Aunty, I'll see you off.

108
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,959
Now, will you believe
that I'm your father?

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,399
Son.

110
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,040
How could a father like you exist?

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
A father that would treat
his own son like this.

112
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,519
I do.

113
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,040
I am a pessimist.

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,839
I believe

115
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,519
there might be optimism
in humanity.

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,559
But all I've seen

117
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,399
is pessimism, laziness,

118
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,079
selfishness and greed.

119
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,160
I've seen too many people

120
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,440
coming from a wealthy family

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
ruined their own lives step by step.

122
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,320
If you had known that you were my son

123
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
from the beginning,

124
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,640
would you have become

125
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,600
such an excellent person?

126
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,480
I admit. As a father,

127
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,079
keeping you in the Bay House

128
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,480
was my selfish will.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I wanted my son

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
to help me complete this game.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
It is my greatest wish in life,

132
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,959
and it is also something
that could change the future of human.

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
Can you help me?

134
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,760
What about the other three?

135
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,760
I took Lu Xiao in when he was homeless.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,920
Luo Ke was abandoned by his parents.
I raised him.

137
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,959
Su Lie was kidnapped
by human traffickers. I saved him.

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,160
If it weren't for me,

139
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,559
all three of them

140
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,880
might not even be alive right now.

141
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Or do you think

142
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,200
that I should not

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,959
have bothered about any of them?

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
And let them die of hunger and cold?

145
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,399
Is that what you want?

146

148
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
Are you all right?

149
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,720
Did Granny find you?

150
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,239
Xu Guanghan didn't do anything
to you, did he?

151
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,679
No.

152
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,399
By the way, how did you get a phone?

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Do you still have it? Can I borrow it?

154
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,119
Su Lie.

155
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,839
It was confiscated.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
Xu Nian.

157
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,720
What did you want to talk
to me about today?

158
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,480
It's nothing.

159
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm tired. I'll go back and rest now.

160
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,279
Xu Nian is back now.

161
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,480
It shouldn't be anything serious, right?

162
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,399
I did call Granny.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
Then ask Grandma Fushun

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
about what exactly happened.

165
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,399
Okay.

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,480
(Granny, Xu Nian came back safely.)

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,799
(But he seemed to be in low spirits.)

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
(He didn't want to talk to us either.)

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,640
(Did Xu Guanghan really punish him?)

170
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,480
(Don't worry.)

171
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,119
(He just found out about something)

172
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,679
(he should have known a long time ago.)

173
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,920
(He just needs time.)

174
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,600
"Something he should have
known a long time ago"?

175
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,080
What things?

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,799
Here.

177
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
I'll go back and ask Qianya right now.

178
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Su Lie! Luo Ke!

179
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Go away! Don't interrupt
our romantic time together!

180
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,200
Go away.

181
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,039
Every day.

182
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,719
What is it?

183
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,919
Kele. I gave it some thought.

184
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
I'd like to ask you
to help me with something.

185
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,320
(Xu Nian, have you told them
about the plan)

186
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,159
(to escape Bay House?)

187
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,860
(Kele)

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,080
Hello?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,200
Hello? Qianya?

190
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,119
Do not text Xu Nian!

191
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,159
Why?

192
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,159
What happened?

193
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,880
Xu Nian was caught!

194
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
Why was he caught?

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Tell me!

196
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,599
Xu Guanghan found out
about the phone you gave him.

197
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,719
The phone is in Xu Guanghan's hands.

198
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,520
So you can't text him.

199
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,280
Understand?

200
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,400
What about him? Is he safe?

201
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,479
He's safe.

202
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,400
Thanks to my cleverness,

203
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,919
quick-thinking and...

204
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,840
Speak normally.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,520
I sent Grandma Fushun a message.

206
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,799
I asked her to cover for us

207
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,359
and say that she gave him the phone.

208
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,400
Xu Guanghan bought it.

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,679
And that's how Xu Nian was let go.

210
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,919
That's good then.

211
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,599
Oh, right.
Xu Nian asked me to deliver a message.

212
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,960
He asked you to wait for him
at the office tonight.

213
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,440
He has something very important
to tell you.

214
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,559
Something very important?

215
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,679
Do you know what it is?

216
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,919
How could I know?

217
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,640
I'd have told you otherwise.

218
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,239
You know

219
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,919
that I can't keep secrets.

220
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,119
Well, you kept the Bay House
a secret long enough.

221
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,679
Let's not bring up the past, all right?

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,479
Something important...
What could it be?

223
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,119
Why does it matter?

224
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,640
You'll find out when you get there.

225
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,239
What time is it now?
Shouldn't you get dressed?

226
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,039
(Could Xu Nian
have thought of a plan already?)

227
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,479
Let's go.

228
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,039
How was your trip here?
Was it safe?

229
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,640
Did you tell the other three

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,880
about the plan to escape Bay House?

231
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,119
I wasn't able to do it

232
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,280
before the phone was confiscated.

233
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,400
Kele said you had something important
to tell me.

234
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,840
Do you have a plan?

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,119
It isn't safe here.

236
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,640
We need a safer place.

237
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,559
We can't go
to the restaurant we used to go.

238
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,159
Okay. The evidence is all in my phone.

239
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
We'll go to my friend's bar.

240
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:10,960
Let's go.

241
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,159
Xu Nian's data

242
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,520
has been perfect as your desired.

243
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm sure it won't take long

244
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,760
for the other three to be the same.

245
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

246
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,280
Your hard work for all these years
has not gone to waste.

247
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,520
Don't celebrate so early.

248
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,799
We have only completed
Xu Nian's data collection.

249
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:35,880
That means our plan

250
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,520
is only 25 percent complete.

251
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,119
(Completion Rate: Luo Ke 94%,
Lu Xiao 97%, Xu Nian 100%, Su Lie 95%)

252
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,960
It will only be truly complete

253
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,159
when the other three reach 100 as well.

254
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,640
We are at a critical moment.

255
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,039
There can be no mistakes.

256
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,679
When all of this is complete,

257
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,119
will you really let them go?

258
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,599
Freedom?

259
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,880
Tell me. What do you think is freedom?

260
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,719
To be able to do what I want.

261
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,239
And to be able
not to do what I don't want to do.

262
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,479
That's freedom as well.

263
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Freedom is relative.

264
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
Everything in this universe is the same.

265
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,440
They are all bounded by certain laws.

266
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
There is no absolute freedom.

267
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,119
It is only a matter
of how restricted you are.

268
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,359
Then... What about the Bay House?

269
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,559
So Xu Guanghan is your father?

270
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Yes.

271
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,679
My biological father
is right beside me all this time.

272
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,080
And my mother used to be a star.

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,960
Then she went abroad
and was never heard from again.

274
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,159
My father raised me.

275
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:00,919
And?

276
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,840
Su Lie was kidnapped.

277
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,719
Luo Ke was abandoned.

278
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,679
Lu Xiao was homeless.

279
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,239
My father saved all three of them.

280
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
So what are you trying to say?

281
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,679
All four of us
are indebted to Xu Guanghan.

282
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,919
Indebted?

283
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,239
What sort of debt?

284
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,159
He locked all of you up

285
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,440
for the sake of his own good.

286
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,440
This is a crime, Xu Nian!

287
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,000
Qianya.

288
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,559
Since I was a child,

289
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I always thought I was an orphan.

290
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I never thought

291
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,039
that I'd be able
to experience the warmth of a home.

292
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,880
But I never expected

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
my father's right by my side all along.

294
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,359
Taking care of me. Loving me.

295
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,559
So...

296
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,280
As his son,

297
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,000
I cannot go against

298
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,679
my birth father.

299
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200
Then what about me?

300
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,039
Did you ever consider my feelings?

301
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes.

302
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,840
Of course, I did.

303
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,679
I have no right

304
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,280
to have you give in to Xu Guanghan.

305
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,479
But I cannot give everything up
to be with you

306
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,799
and fight against my father.

307
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,679
We will eventually be on opposing sides.

308
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,520
and there'll not be a happy ending
for us.

309
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,880
Let's

310
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,239
break up.

311
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:58,140
♪You and I have different memories♪

312
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,480
♪As if we're searching

313
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,000
From now on,

314
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,239
I won't see you anymore.

315
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,159
Please don't come find me either.

316
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,340
♪I'm falling hard♪

317

♪Of the memories we shared♪

327
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,320
All right. That's enough.

328
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
Guan Qianya, why are you here

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,440
drinking all alone?

330
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,679
Didn't you meet up with Xu Nian?

331
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,840
Xu Nian broke up with me.

332
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Broke up?

333
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Why?

334
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,520
Because Xu Guanghan is his father.

335
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,400
Xu... Xu Guanghan is Xu Nian's father?

336
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,320
Hard to believe, isn't it?

337
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
I still think so too.

338
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,599
It's no wonder Xu Nian
has such a good temperament.

339
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,799
It's because he is Mr. Xu's son.

340
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
Qianya,

341
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,559
you're so clever.

342
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,320
You picked

343
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,880
the richest one out of the four of them.

344
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,520
I thought

345
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,000
you chose a boring one.

346
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,559
But now that I see it...

347
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,959
You guys are the perfect match.

348
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,479
But if you guys are perfect
for each other,

349
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,520
why would you break up?

350
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,239
Because he wants
to be on Xu Guanghan's side.

351
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,959
And I am Xu Guanghan's enemy.

352
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,839
Just... Just because of that?

353
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,959
Is that not enough?

354
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,040
Not enough? It isn't a reason at all!

355
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,680
Guan Qianya, you opposed Love Boys

356
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,000
to save your company, right?

357
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
That's how you became
Xu Guanghan's enemy.

358
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,719
But now that he's Xu Guanghan's son,

359
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,560
as long as you don't oppose him,

360
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,319
you guys can go on just fine.

361
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,280
And you won't have to worry
about your company.

362
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,959
The entire Yao Entertainment.
might even be yours someday!

363
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,560
You'd acquire both
romance and career! That's amazing!

364
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm no longer trying
to take down Xu Guanghan

365
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,719
for the sake of my company.

366
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,319
I'm doing it for those
who are addicted to the game.

367
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,040
For those who went insane,
who went bankrupt,

368
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,959
and who were imprisoned...

369
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,959
"Imprisoned"?

370
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,880
They just signed a contract, right?

371
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,199
Never mind. Let's just drink.

372
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,719
Qianya.

373
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:17,959
Now I understand

374
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,479
why you are so upset.

375
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,520
It's normal for people in a relationship

376
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,719
to get into conflicts.

377
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,359
And the best way to solve it

378
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,000
is either for one to change
or for the other to compromise.

379
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
It is unexpected to hear those words

380
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,560
coming out from your mouth.

381
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,520
A woman in love

382
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,160
grows every day.

383
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,280
I figured out
your relationship with Xu Nian

384
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,479
a long time ago.

385
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,079
Don't believe me?

386
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,160
Then let me tell you.

387
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,680
What you want is an evenly matched love.

388
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,479
And what is "evenly matched"?

389
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,640
It's when you are strong,
and he is strong as well.

390
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,640
But when both of you get into conflicts,

391
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,319
neither is willing to give in.

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,359
What will you do then?

393
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,079
Xu Nian has his stance.

394
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,640
And you have your beliefs.

395
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,560
It's all down to see
if you'll persist with your ideals,

396
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,119
or you will compromise

397
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,839
for the sake of your romance.

398
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,800
Where's my phone?

399
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,359
Qianya, have you washed up?

400
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,400
I bought you breakfast and coffee.

401
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,319
It'll help relieve your hangover
and wake you up.

402
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,160
Qianya! What are you doing?

403
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,719
I can't find my phone.

404
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,119
I'll make a call.

405
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,839
It's turned off.

406
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,880
There are only two possibilities.

407
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,160
One. It was stolen.

408
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,280
Two. It's out of battery.

409
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,359
Oh, no... Where could it be?

410
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,760
Qianya, I guess you are broke.

411
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,959
You never cared this much

412
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,160
when you lost branded goods.

413
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,560
Why are you so anxious
about losing your phone?

414
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,640
Never mind.

415
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,599
As your best friend,

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm happy to chip in

417
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
to get you a new phone.

418
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,400
No, it's not that.

419
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
I have evidence

420
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,719
that could take down Xu Guanghan
inside my phone.

421
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,439
Lu Xiao!

422
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,400
Kele.

423
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,520
Have you asked Qianya?

424
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,719
What exactly happened?

425
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,119
Don't bring it up.

426
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Too many upsetting things have happened.

427
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,719
The evidence is in my phone.

428
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,199
Let's go to my friend's bar.

429
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
I'll hang it up for you.

430
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,680
Okay.

431
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,800
Xu Nian.

432
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,280
What is it?

433
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,439
Kele told me everything.

434
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,239
She said you broke up with Guan Qianya.

435
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,199
Because

436
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,959
you're Xu Guanghan's biological son.

437
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,239
Is that right?

438
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,719
Yes.

439
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,839
But hear me out...

440
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,199
Or do you think

441
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,119
I should have left the three of them be?

442
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,599
Let them die of hunger and cold.

443
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
Is that what you want?

444
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,239
You saved them.

445
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,560
But you restricted their freedom.

446
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,280
That's imprisonment.

447
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,760
It's illegal.

448
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,640
You are my son, after all.

449
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,280
You have a good head on your shoulders.

450
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,680
I suggest you turn yourself in.

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,359
Do you think I would agree?

452
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,640
You can't possibly be that naive.

453
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,760
Tell me. What is your bargaining chip?

454
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,560
It can't be

455
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,959
that woman, right?

456
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,880
Guan Qianya.

457
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,959
I don't know how you escaped.

458
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
But that woman

459
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,160
must know everything about me.

460
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,079
If she does anything that harms me,

461
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,000
I will make her disappear right away.

462
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,160
Why are you grinning?

463
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,000
Because you are foolish.

464
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,359
If I had escaped...

465
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:07,920
If I had really gotten together

466
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,479
with this silly woman,

467
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,119
why would I come back?

468
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,800
And get caught by you?

469
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,040
Would you have done so

470
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,160
if you were me?

471
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,479
If you didn't side with Xu Guanghan...

472
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,560
Then why did you break up
with Guan Qianya?

473
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,239
I did it on purpose.

474
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,319
And I found out

475
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,040
that the evidence was in Qianya's phone.

476
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,359
After I left Xu Guanghan,

477
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,280
I immediately broke up with Qianya,

478
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
and stole the evidence.

479
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,319
So you're doing this

480
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,680
to protect Guan Qianya as well, right?

481
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,280
Yes.

482
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,040
Because I don't know

483
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,160
what she might do

484
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,359
if she finds out about the truth.

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,319
She might be in danger

486
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,760
if Xu Guanghan finds about it.

487
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,000
So I had to make the first move.

488
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,040
I hope it'll buy us some time.

489
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
Buy time?

490
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Why?

491
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,239
For all of our safety.

492
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,000
Mr. Xu,
the Bay House is located underground.

493
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,760
We found out immediately

494
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
when Lu Xiao sneaked out last time.

495
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,599
But if Xu Nian had sneaked out,

496
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,920
there was no sign of it at all.

497
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,479
How did he get out?

498
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Perhaps this way, and perhaps that way.

499
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,040
Then... Did Fushun
really give him that phone?

500
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,880
Maybe yes, maybe no.

501
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,160
Then...
Does he really have the evidence?

502
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,599
Maybe yes, maybe no.

503
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,839
If he did, would it be with Guan Qianya?

504
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,439
Maybe yes, maybe no.

505
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,959
If so,

506
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,800
why didn't they report us sooner?

507
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Lei Na,
there are a thousand possibilities.

508
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
Don't think too much about it.

509
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,239
My personal credo

510
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,640
is to be skeptical of everything.

511
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,119
That's how you minimize risks.

512
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay.

513
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll go follow Guan Qianya
and Fushun right away.

514
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,479
No need. I've sent others to do it.

515
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,239
Why not me?

516
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,439
Do you know how to stalk someone?

517
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,680
Maybe yes, maybe no.

518
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,239
Then do you know
how to make someone disappear?

519
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,560
You're here again.

520
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,439
Haven't you had enough
to drink last night?

521
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,920
I lost my phone. Did you see it?

522
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,760
Phone?

523
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,079
Yes.

524
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,119
Hold on.

525
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,800
These

526
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
are all the phones
my customers left behind.

527
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,079
See if any of them might be yours.

528
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,439
So many?

529
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,319
None of these are mine.

530
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,479
When I tried calling my phone,

531
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,560
it was turned off.

532
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,880
I'll help you check
I've watched the security footage.

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,479
Okay.

534
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,119
Here.

535
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,719
Have some water.

536
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,760
No, just give me a drink.

537
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,280
Okay. Have this first.

538
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,239
Boss.

539
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,959
What's the situation?

540
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,280
I followed her.

541
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,839
Guan Qianya is at a bar right now.

542
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,239
No one drinks this early in the morning.

543
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,959
Something is definitely up.

544
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,239
Or has she really fallen?

545
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,719
Keep following her.

546
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,760
Report to me immediately
if you notice anything.

547
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Understood.

548
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,800
Got it.

549
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,560
It doesn't look like

550
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
your phone was stolen.

551
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,079
Both of you were so drunk.

552
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,160
No one went near you guys.

553
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,719
But I searched my entire house

554
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,000
and I couldn't find it.

555
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,479
Could you have left it somewhere else?

556
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
In the car on your way back, maybe?

557
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,280
Or maybe

558
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,239
you lost it before you came here?

559
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,760
Think again.

560
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,599
Xu Nian!

561
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,119
Are you all right?

562
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,839
I'm fine.

563
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,520
I've watched the security footage.

564
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,079
Do you remember
that I wanted to tell you something

565
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,040
the day I was taken away
by Xu Guanghan?

566
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,319
Of course.

567
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,760
So what did you

568
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,319
want to tell me?

569
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,439
I wanted to ask

570
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,640
if you'd be willing to escape

571
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,680
Bay House with me?

572
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,719
Escape?

573
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,959
Why?

574
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:51,839
According to the contract,

575
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,239
we'll be able to leave this place

576
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,719
once the data collection is complete.

577
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,719
It's not that simple.

578
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,079
Think.

579
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:02,040
The four of us
are Xu Guanghan's business secrets.

580
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,119
If he lets us go,

581
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,640
what will happen to his business?

582
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
That's why Xu Guanghan

583
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,160
will never give us freedom.

584
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,479
I've already discussed it with Qianya.

585
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I came back to discuss

586
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,760
with the three of you
about escaping from Bay House.

587
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,680
If the four of us manage
to escape this place,

588
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,239
Qianya will expose the evidence

589
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,479
and take down Xu Guanghan.

590
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,800
I made plans
for the worst-case scenario as well.

591
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,560
If Xu Guanghan
doesn't keep his promise,

592
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,439
I'll still get you guys out of here.

593
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,719
