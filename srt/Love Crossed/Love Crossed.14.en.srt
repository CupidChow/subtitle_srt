00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,679
You said you had fallen in love with me.

2
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:02,799
Is that true?

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,639
Then come with me.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,600
To where?

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,520
Away from here.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,319
To the outside. To the real world.

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,920
Why?

8
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't you want to see the world outside?

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,120

Qianya.

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,639
I don't think I should go out.

12
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,159
Why?

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,639
We're only one step away

14
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,959
from the outside world.

15
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,080
You've been in here for so many years.

16
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't you want to see
what the outside world is like?

17
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,880
Qianya, this is all too sudden.

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm not ready yet.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,319
What is there to get ready for?

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,119
All we have to do
is go through that door.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
I've never gone out.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,559
I'm worried that I won't know what to do

when I go out there.

27
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,519

00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,399
I can't help but say
that Xu Nian is a wimp.

79
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,399
He's too cowardly.

80
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,600
He didn’t even dare to step outside.

81
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,119
Lu Xiao's the same, isn't he?

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,239
He wouldn't even
go see his mother, who is ill.

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,519
Jiang Kele,

84
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,239
I think you should reflect on yourself.

85
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,559
On your tastes in men.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Well, you should do the same.

87
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
Let's reflect together then.

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,480
Qianya, I've got it.

89
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,480
I shouldn't have been a busybody.

90
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,480
I think

91
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,399
one's love should be pure.

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I think I have
too many other intentions right now.

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,279
From now on, when I love someone,

94
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,880
I'll only focus on him.
I won't bother about anything else.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,720
Am I right?

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,480
Qianya,

97
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,519
I think you shouldn't
be so concerned about other things too.

98
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,279
You don't love him that much yet.

99
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,880
It's not too late for you to back out.

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,679
Do what you have to do. Expose them.

101
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,400
If Xu Guanghan goes down,

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,760
they'll get to come out,

103
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,039
right?

104
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,400
I wonder who the person was,

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,799
worrying that they wouldn't

106
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,559
be able to fit in the real world
if they came out the other day?

107
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,719
I wonder why
that person has changed her mind?

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,359
I... Yesterday, I...

109
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,440
I was just too empathetic yesterday!

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
We're worried about them.

111
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
But who will be worrying about us?

112
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
Right?

113
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,559
Qianya, if your company goes bankrupt,

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
will any of them care?

115
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,359
I risked losing my job

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,239
to tell Lu Xiao that his mother's ill.

117
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,200
Did anyone care
that I might have lost my job?

118
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
No. None of them!

119
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,479
And what are those guys doing right now?

120
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,599
They are sleeping

121
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,719
comfortably in their cozy beds.

122
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,280
We're the ones
who stayed up all night worrying.

123
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,039
Qianya, aren't we so silly?

124
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes.

125
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:32,919
Yes.

126
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,719
We're too silly.

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,559
Absolutely.

128
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,280
I'll see you tonight.

129
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,760
Hang on. Where are you going?

130
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,799
Change my clothes and get to work.

131
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,039
Some people

132
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,919
don't even have the time
to figure out love

133
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,239
before they have to get to work.

134
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,520
You say that as if
you don't have to get to work.

135
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,799
I applied for leave.

136
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,799
Why?

137
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,479
Because I have some
important matters to attend to.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,559
What sort of matters?

139
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,840
Oh, your mother’s birthday!

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,000
Qianya.

141
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,440
My dad is coming back today,

142
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
so could I have the room...

143
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
Jiang Kele.

144
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,840
Even if your father never
goes out to sea again,

145
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,520
that room will be his
for the rest of his life.

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,599
We kept that room
just for him, didn't we?

147
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Thank you, Qianya!

148
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,919
Go get changed.

149
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,640
I'll go back after I finish my food.

150
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,479
Okay.

151
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,200
I'll take one to go.

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,760
Bye.

153
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,559
Wait.

154
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,719
Do you know why
Lu Xiao is being punished?

155
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,239
Is it because he went against
the contract?

156
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,320
Yes!

157
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,000
He was curious about the outside world.

158
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,239
So he sneaked out
when the electricity was down.

159
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,760
He got caught and was brought back.

160
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,159
Both of you live under the same roof.

161
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,359
Did you really not notice
that he sneaked out?

162
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,039
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

163
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,640
But Mr. Xu,

164
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,479
I honestly never thought

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,359
that someone would disobey your orders
and sneaked out.

166
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,599
I never thought so too.

167
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm sure Lu Xiao didn't mean to do it.

168
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,919
And he won't do it again.

169
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,679
Please forgive him.

170
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,479
I wasn't planning on forgiving him,

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,039
but you
the person I trust the most,

172
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,119
are pleading for him...

173
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
Let him up.

174
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,479
Xu Nian, you are the leader.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,679
You are the one I entrust
the most responsibilities with.

176
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,320
I hope you do your duties as a leader.

177
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
If something like this happens again,

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,719
even if you think there is the
slightest chance that it could happen,

179
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,000
report it to me immediately.

180
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,359
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you curious about the outside world?

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,760
If someone tries to leave again,

183
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,280
you'll suffer with them.

184
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,840
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
However,

186
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,640
what if you were the one to sneak out?

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
But I'm sure that you wouldn't do that.

188
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,080
Xu Nian, it's time for training.

189
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,239
Hold on. I'll be right there.

190
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,119
♪Where are we going?♪

191
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
Kele.

192
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm coming!

193
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,559
Dad!

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,119
Dad!

195
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,919
Kele!

196
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,760
Come in! Come in!

197
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,679
You're finally back!

198
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,880
I missed you so much!

199
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,520
Here.

200
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I've got your bed all ready for you!

201
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,119
Really?

202
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,320
Let me tell you
about our plans for today.

203
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,159
Later, we'll go and see mom.

204
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,440
Then, tonight, when Qianya gets back,

205
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,960
let's have dinner with her.
Does that sound good?

206
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,119
-Have a seat.
-Sounds good.

207
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
Let me have a good look at you.

208
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,520
Okay.

209
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,479
Kele.

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Our time onshore is short this time.

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,039
I won't be able to stay the night.

212
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
I have to go back by tonight.

213
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
We'll be departing at night.

214
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,440
Only for such a short time?

215
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,559
You stayed the night last time.

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,520
Dad, why don't you just quit your job?

217
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,679
I'm working and earning money now.

218
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,479
I can take care of you.

219
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,159
And Qianya

220
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,919
said that room is all yours.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
You can stay for as long as you want.

222
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,440
Good, good. I'm happy

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,799
just to hear you say that.

224
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm still young and healthy right now.

225
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,039
I'll work hard for a few more years
to save up money.

226
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,919
When I'm old,
and my legs don't work as well,

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,520
you'll have to take care of me. Okay?
It's a promise.

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,559
I've been

229
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,080
to many places this year.

230
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,840
I got you a lot of presents.

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,119
I hope you like them.

232
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,440
Dad.

233
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,359
Don't bring so many things

234
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,479
back with you next time.

235
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,520
These look so heavy.

236
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't worry.

237
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,479
You can get everything online now.

238
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,640
Here. Look at this.

239
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,320
This is a nautical souvenir,
a small boat.

240
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,159
Isn't it nice?

241
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,359
There are more!

242
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,679
Here. Look at this.

243
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,039
Look at how soft this is.

244
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,679
It's a carpet from Tunisia.

245
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,599
It's a branded carpet.

246
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,799
Oh, and this here too.

247
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,119
Coffee beans from Kenya.

248
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,520
Share some with Qianya.

249
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,479
Dad, you can buy all these things

250
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,960
online now.

251
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,280
You don't have
to bring them over yourself.

252
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,039
Speaking of that.

253
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,200
There's something
that you can never buy online!

254
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,000
What is it?

255
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,320
Here. Open it.

256
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,359
These... These look expensive!

257
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,320
Do you like them?

258
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,760
You might not know this, but...

259
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,919
In Africa,

260
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,760
there's a tribe called the Simba tribe.

261
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,119
It's the most beautiful place in Africa.

262
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,280
When their daughters get married,

263
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,039
they'll prepare
these pieces of jewelry as dowry.

264
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,239
I have a colleague

265
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,320
whose daughter
is getting married this year.

266
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,599
So he prepared a set for her.

267
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,200
And then I thought,

268
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,119
my Kele is all grown up now too.

269
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,159
She'll get married someday.

270
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,559
So I bought a set for you as well.

271
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,704
But how much did this cost you?

272
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,359
Not a lot.

273
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
A few months of my salary.

274
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,719
So expensive?

275
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,479
(Made in China)
I mean, as long as you like it.

276
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,020
(Made in China)

277
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,679
Dad, you were tricked once again.

278
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,679
What do you mean?

279
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,520
"Made in China".

280
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,960
Come in.

281
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,640
Ms. Guan, it's me.

282
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,080
(Crush On Love)

283
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,559
I see you're busy.

284
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,200
Yes.

285
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,559
I have something to tell you.

286
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,919
My ex-wife's best friend

287
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,359
wants me to ask you

288
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,280
about that "exclusive story"
you mentioned before.

289
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,919
She wants to know
why didn't you expose it.

290
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,520
Why does she want to know so badly?

291
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,679
I asked her about that!

292
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,559
She said it's her right as a journalist

293
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,440
to know the truth.

294
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,679
If she wants the truth,

295
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,039
she should go look for it herself.

296
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,640
She's just trying to get
something for nothing, isn't she?

297
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,679
Well, you said it yourself.

298
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,200
Take another risk,

299
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,280
and you'll be able to get
that "exclusive story".

300
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,640
So... Did you take that risk?

301
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,119
Did you get the story then?

302
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,039
I don't want
to continue this conversation.

303
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,039
Go get busy.

304
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:24,960
Ms. Guan.

305
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't want to push you,

306
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,679
but I have to.

307
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,919
With the way our company is right now,

308
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,760
we may not be able
to hold on much longer.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,159
The investors are pulling out.

310
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,320
Look.

311
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,119
The employees are all worried sick.

312
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,080
Qi Chuan might have
received compensation,

313
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,440
but he's furious.

314
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,559
Legally,

315
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,159
he can't do anything.

316
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,520
But he didn't take it so easily.

317
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,479
He's taking revenge on you!

318
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,159
How?

319
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,520
He wrote a song,

320
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,840
"Better to dance than to fall in love".

321
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,624
He said he'd spend 1,000 yuan

322
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:55,134
to hire you
as the lead actress for this MTV.

323
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,239
And he'd play the male lead, "Xu Nian".

324
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520
In the MV,

325
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,880
both of you will re-enact

326
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,400
the dance you danced with Xu Nian.

327
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,359
Don't mind him.

328
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
He's just trying to ride the wave.

329
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,479
Of course he did!

330
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,320
I've rejected him on your behalf.

331
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,719
But what's worse than all this

332
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,520
is that our company has had

333
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,440
zero membership growth for months.

334
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,319
And zero revenue.

335
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
Our company's fund

336
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,800
can only last us till next month!

337
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,719
All in all,

338
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I only have one thing left to say.

339
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,079
Ms. Guan,

340
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,319
if you do have
the exclusive story to tell,

341
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,760
please do it.

342
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,959
If you don't have it,

343
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,079
it's all right.
We'll all think of something else.

344
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,098
Okay. I understand.

345
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,592
(Crush On Love)

346
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,239
I'll leave now.

347
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:45,880
Dad.

348
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,800
Please don't buy me all those things

349
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
when you come back next time.

350
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,800
You get tricked too easily.

351
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,199
Kele, your mother left us too soon.

352
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,319
And I'm often out in the seas.

353
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,479
I can't take care of you.

354
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,599
I just want to buy some presents

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,040
for you to make you happy.

356
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,920
But I guess I messed it up again.

357
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,160
Okay.

358
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,000
I won't buy them again. I promise.

359
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,800
Next time,

360
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,160
buy some things for yourself.

361
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,239
You're here early today, bro.

362
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,880
I've got it all ready for you.

363
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,239
Dad.

364
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,119
Do you have anything
to tell mom this year?

365
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,520
I'll write it down for you.

366
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,199
Okay.

367
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,640
Honey, another year has gone by.

368
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,079
Rest assured, I've been well.

369
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,839
Our ship went to Africa this year.

370
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,880
Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia,

371
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,560
Somali, and many other places.

372
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,359
It's good. I earned a lot of money.

373
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,520
I thought

374
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,520
that Kele is all grown up now.

375
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,359
So I bought her a set

376
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,815
of African jewelry for her as her dowry.

377
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,319
I...

378
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:09,760
Dad.

379
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,920
Let's not write that down.

380
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,680
If mom found out you were tricked,

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,680
she'd be angry.

382
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,359
No, I mean...
Just don't tell her that it's fake!

383
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
No, I can't do that.

384
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
This is a pen of honesty.

385
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,280
I can't write any lies with this pen.

386
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,839
Silly girl. I'll write it then.

387
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:25,959
You'll talk, okay?

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,599
Okay. I'll start now, all right?

389
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Okay. Go.

390
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,520
Mom,

391
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,560
Dad spent a busy year out in the seas.

392
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,640
But he didn't make any money!

393
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,280
Hey, why would you say that?

394
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
But fortunately,

395
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
he's safe and sound.

396
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,800
I, on the other hand,
had a different year!

397
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,920
I made immense progress in my career!

398
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,400
Immense progress.

399
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,319
Okay, okay. I got it.

400
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,160
Not only am I working
at a cosmetic shop,

401
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:58,040
I got a part-time job that pays well.

402
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm working as a janitor

403
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,239
in a fancy house.

404
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,680
My wage is five times
the salary of a convenience shop worker.

405
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,000
Five times!

406
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,199
Why did you stop, Dad?

407
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,560
You said this's the pen of honesty.

408
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,319
How could I write that down?

409
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,920
It is the pen of honesty.

410
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
I'm telling you the truth.

411
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,160
The wage is good.

412
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,560
Kele, if they're paying you so much,

413
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
the job must be really tough. Is it?

414
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,719
It's not hard at all.

415
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,000
It's easy and fun.

416
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,719
My daughter's all grown up.

417
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,359
She knows to hide
her suffering from her father.

418
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,920
I don't have a hard time
working as a janitor, Dad.

419
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,640
Never mind. You wouldn't understand
even if I explained it.

420
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,560
You've been overseas for too long.

421
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,280
You're out of the loop.

422
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,800
You don't know
how capable your daughter is.

423
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,520
Kele.

424
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,359
I have a few words to tell you.

425
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,760
I know you've always been
a very understanding child.

426
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,760
All these years,

427
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,439
you've been taking care of yourself.

428
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,359
But I don't wish to see you

429
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,359
having a hard time in your life.

430
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
That you'd have
to work so hard just to earn money.

431
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,599
I only want you

432
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,280
to be like other people of your age.

433
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,119
If there's something you want to do,

434
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,479
just do it.

435
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,319
Go after your dreams.

436
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:07,839
Okay?

437
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,079
But I am doing it now.

438
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,560
See. I'm working hard to earn money now.

439
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,439
I have a job.

440
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,079
I want to buy a big house.

441
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,239
And we'll all live in it together.

442
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
That way,

443
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,520
you won't have
to go out to the sea anymore.

444
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,199
That's what mom wanted, right?

445
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay. Then,

446
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,719
I will work hard with you.

447
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,880
We'll both

448
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,400
try our best
to fulfill this dream together.

449
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,199
Okay?

450
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,280
We can do it!

451
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,760
We can do it!

452
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:53,599
Three.

453
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,119
Two.

454
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,680
One.

455
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,760
Honey!

456
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,280
-Happy Birthday, dear!
-Happy Birthday, mom!

457
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,199
Dad.

458
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,920
It's mom's birthday today.

459
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,959
But why isn't she here yet?

460
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,520
Haven't I told you this before?

461
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,640
she is in heaven now.

462
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,760
That's why I brought you here,
on a hot air balloon.

463
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,479
Because this is the closest place
we can get to her.

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
Will I be able to see her?

465
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,079
Will I be able to talk to her?

466
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,280
Here.

467
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,199
We'll write down the things

468
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,640
you want to say to her.

469
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,359
I guarantee
that she'll be able to read them.

470
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,400
Here.

471
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,079
Happy Birthday, mom.

472
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,760
I miss you.

473
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,675
(Happy Birthday, mom. I miss you.)

474
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,800
Here. Hold this.

475
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:04,119
Three, two, one.

476
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,660
(Cash check: 20 million yuan)

477
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,319
Please let me know
if you have any requests.

478
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll do my best to make it happen.

479
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,199
I only have one request.

480
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,239
I want you to leave the company.

481
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,160
Me? Leave the company?

482
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes.

483
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,800
I can relate to you very much.

484
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,839
I have my own company too.

485
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,119
You've been running
this company for all these years,

486
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
only to end up in this situation.

487
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,280
It must be hard for you.

488
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,079
You might not
be able to accept this right now,

489
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,959
but you're responsible
for leading your company

490
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,000
to this situation right now.

491
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,599
You don't have to sell me
your company right now.

492
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,959
But if you don't,

493
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Crush On Love may cease to exist.

494
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,680
However,
if you take my offer and leave...

495
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,640
The company may not be yours any longer,

496
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,439
but it will continue to exist.

497
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,560
I have the ability to make it better.

498
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,520
Mr. Zhang,

499
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,640
please give me some more time.

500
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
I brought Crush On Love

501
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,280
to the place it is today.
I've gotten this far.

502
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,552
I can bring it back again.

503
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,359
No, you won't.

504
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,880
If you were capable of doing so,

505
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,439
you would have saved
the company a long time ago.

506
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,199
Mr. Zhang.

507
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,000
There’re many reasons why

508
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,920
the company ended up this way.

509
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,880
But unfortunately,
I can't share those reasons with you.

510
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,959
Of course, there're
many complicated reasons

511
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,839
why the company ended up this way.

512
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,959
But as the CEO of a company,

513
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,760
you must always put the interests

514
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,719
of the company first.

515
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,000
Your own personal interests
and relationship must give way

516
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,680
to the interests of the company.

517
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
This is the most fundamental requirement

518
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
for a company's CEO.

519
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,719
If you can't even do that,

520
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
then I suggest you

521
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
take the money

522
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,880
and go do what you can do.

523
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,560
Mr. Zhang,

524
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,680
if I considered myself
just a businesswoman,

525
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
under these circumstances,

526
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,040
it'd be the easiest way out

527
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,520
for me to take the money and go.

528
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,959
But I built Crush On Love
from scratch.

529
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,040
I put my heart and soul

530
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,359
into this company.

531
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
To me,

532
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,959
it isn't just a company.

533
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,040
It's a part of my life.

534
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,680
I won't hand it over to anyone.

535
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,400
Thank you for your offer.

536
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,640
You won't get the same offer

537
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,000
if you come back again.

538
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,640
I won't be back.

539
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,140
(Existence and Void)

540
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,760
I have a question for you.

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Do you think that there is any meaning

542
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,040
in your existence
as a virtual character?

543
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,560
Do not dwell too much
on the meaning of existence.

544
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,760
There is a line that I like very much.

545
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,719
"When I am hungry, I eat."

546
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,959
"When I am tired, I rest."

547
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,319
"When I want to do something,

548
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,839
I do it."

549
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,599
So

550
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,119
when you miss me,

551
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,040
come and see me.

552
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,920
I'm here.

553
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,479
What are you afraid of?

554
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,280
Xu Nian.

555
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,199
If you love me and trust me,

556
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,079
then come with me to the outside world.

557
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:22,473
(Please don't follow
the dangerous activities.)

558
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,220
(Entrance)

559
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,860
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

560
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,079
May both of you be in love and happy.

561
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,199
Are you looking to buy flowers
for your girlfriend?

562
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,040
I'm closing up. You can have this.

563
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,959
Thank you.

564
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,959
You're welcome.

565
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:09,479
