1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,599
Qianya, you haven't been recovered yet.

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,119
Where are you taking me to?

3
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:04,960
Come over here.

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,199
Do you remember

5
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:07,719
the Newton's cradle you gave me?

6
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:08,960
Of course, I do.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,119
Don't you think
something is off about it?

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
No.

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,560
Hasn't it always been that way?

10
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,640
It'll stop when the swings slow down.

11
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
Look closely. Stare at it.

12
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,719
It doesn't stop!

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,360
It really doesn't!

14
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,559
Why won't it stop?

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,239
Because we're in the game!

16
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,559
This is a bug!

17
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,280
I know it's hard to believe

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,479
what I'm saying right now,

19
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:33,560
but I know how to make you believe me.

20
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,520
Verify it.

21
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,400
Me?

22
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,799
Only you can do it.

23
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:39,040
The ones caught and brought
into this game by Xu Guanghan

24
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,639
are real human beings.

25
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,040
Everyone else is an NPC.

26
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,319
Lu Xiao and Xu Nian

27
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,720
have been staying in
the Bay House all this time.

28
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,919
They've never been outside!

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
We're the only ones

30
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
who have been living in the real world
for over 20 years.

31
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,479
Find someone you know

32
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,360
and ask them

33
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,919
something only you guys would know.

34
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,159
You'll get your answer then.

35
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,520
Stop hesitating!

36
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
We're on a time limit!

37
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,119
Hang on. Let me think.

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,240
=Love Crossed=

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,380
=Episode 30=

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Kele!

41
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,440
Where did you go?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,160
Were you embarrassed
because I saw through your lie

43
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,279
last time?

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
What are you looking at?

45
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:06,839
Nothing.

46
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,759
I'm just trying to see
if anything about you changed.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
We see each other every day.
How could I have changed?

48
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,039
Why did you pinch my cheek?

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,119
Your skin is quite soft.

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
I just did my make-up,
and you ruined it.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,360
Qiqi!

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
What are you doing?

53
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,960
Can't you see that I'm touching up

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,279
my make-up?

55
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,199
I know.

56
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,039
But why are you using your own make-up?

57
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,039
Why do you keep

58
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,800
asking me these silly questions today?

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,199
If I don't use my own make-up,

60
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,160
should I be using yours instead?

61
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,520
You'd use the store's, of course!

62
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,839
The biggest advantage

63
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,839
of working here

64
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,600
is that I'll never have to buy make-up.

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,119
Eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick.

66
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:46,919
They have everything here!

67
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,440
You can try out
all sorts of new products.

68
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,520
Which color do you think

69
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
looks better?

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
I'll ask you another question.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Do you remember

72
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,080
what I told you about my past jobs?

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
How would I know about that?

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,240
Try to remember it.

75
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
You were so surprised back then.

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,119
Why would I be surprised?

77
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,679
You've never told me about it!

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,720
Oh, you worked at a convenience store.

79
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,679
That's not important, Qiqi.

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,279
Don't you think

81
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,279
the love story
of my boyfriend Lu Xiao and I

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,479
is very touching?

83
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,080
She is indeed an NPC.

84
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,000
All right. I'm off then.

85
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,199
Where are you going now?

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,919
You'll get scolded by the boss.

87
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,440
You haven't paid for that yet.

88
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,119
Go ahead. Tell him.

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,399
Tell the boss I quit.

90
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,199
From now on,

91
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,639
you'll be responsible
for everything in the store.

92
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,960
You'll get double the pay.

93
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,039
Are you happy?

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,399
Do you see this bug?

95
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,399
Qianya is telling the truth.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
We're in the game now.

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,520
Everyone else besides us

98
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,919
is an NPC.

99
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,160
I know it's hard to believe.

100
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,279
I couldn't believe it at first either.

101
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,759
But I'll prove it to you

102
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,759
when Grandma Fushun

103
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,360
comes back later.

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,919
Guan... Guan Qianya?

105
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,160
Didn't you get into a car accident?

106
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
Why are all of you staring at me?

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Granny,

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,920
do you still remember
the number of the ward

109
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,959
Lu Xiao's mother was in
before she passed away?

110
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,320
She has already passed away.

111
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,480
Why would you ask me
about the number of the ward?

112
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,760
Just tell us.

113
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,399
How would I remember that?

114
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm already so old.

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,839
Okay. Next question.

116
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,480
What was Lu Xiao's mother's

117
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,920
favorite pastime activity?

118
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,000
How would I know what his mother liked?

119
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,160
Besides,

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,880
what has her favorite pastime activity

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,399
got to do with me?

122
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,239
She loved to play mahjong.

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,959
Oh, right.

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,959
Well, old people.

125
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,480
All old people like to play mahjong.

126
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,720
Not like me.

127
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,440
I love riding motorbikes.

128
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Riding through the streets and alleys.

129
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,679
So cool.

130
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,160
How could I be so cool?

131
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,720
Ask her something more direct.

132
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,160
Okay. Final question.

133
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,959
Granny,

134
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:07,799
do you remember

135
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,079
what was cremated along

136
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,440
with Lu Xiao's mother?

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
Why are you asking

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
such strange questions today?

139
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,799
It's not a strange question.

140
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,200
It's a very important question.

141
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,279
Last time, you...

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
You even reminded

143
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,160
Lu Xiao to put something down

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,760
when we started dating in public.
What was it?

145
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,799
His worries.

146
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,320
No.

147
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,600
It was a Barbie doll.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,720
That's right!

149
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,399
Apart from playing mahjong,

150
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,959
his mother loved Barbie dolls!

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
That's right!

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,399
You guys have a nice chat.

153
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll make some food for all of you.

154
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,679
That's right.

155
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,839
Barbie dolls!

156
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,480
Now, do you believe it?

157
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,399
Quiet down!

158
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,119
I was wondering
why my ex-wife was so weird.

159
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,799
I asked if she wanted
to get back with me,

160
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,839
and she immediately agreed.

161
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,720
So it was a lie all along.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,399
I was so happy to hear that.

163
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,880
No wonder people
in this world act so irrationally.

164
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,160
They were all designed

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
according to Xu Guanghan's will.

166
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,079
Qianya,

167
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,959
how can we get out of this place?

168
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
We'll be able to leave

169
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
when we die in the game.

170
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
Let's hurry up and die then!

171
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,359
Hold on. We still have two other people.

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,239
What exactly are you guys trying to say?

173
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
I won't accept your apology.

174
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,799
From now on,
you guys will live your lives

175
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,679
and we'll live ours.

176
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,799
We won't bother each other.

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
These NPCs are so annoying!

178
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,880
Let me handle them.

179
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,279
All right, everybody.

180
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,399
It's time to leave. Go on now.

181
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,239
We bought tickets.

182
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,160
You'll have to leave
even if you have tickets.

183
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,399
Go on now.

184
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,839
You guys are all fake anyway.

185
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,519
Be good now. Shoo.

186
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,839
What are you guys doing?

187
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,920
We'll get complaints from the customers!

188
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,559
Why don't we just

189
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,359
skip the explanation

190
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,760
and just have them die with us?

191
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,040
Die?

192
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
Why do we have to die?

193
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,399
They're just jealous
that we have great jobs.

194
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,519
Let's still explain it to them.

195
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,839
If we take them away by force,

196
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,200
we'll have to get into fights
with the NPCs.

197
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,160
That'll waste too much time.

198
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,799
Listen.

199
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,399
The world we're in right now

200
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,480
is fake.

201
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,679
Actually we've been

202
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,600
in the game

203
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,799
designed by Xu Guanghan all this time.

204
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,000
We didn't know enough
about the outside world.

205
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,399
That's why we never noticed.

206
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,160
In the real world,

207
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,480
we've been locked inside
the data collection room in Bay House

208
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,079
all along.

209
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,079
Understand?

210
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,160
Of course, we know

211
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,559
we're in the game.

212
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,000
Su Lie and I are good at games.

213
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:41,920
Of course, we would realize that.

214
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,600
We're leaving the game
and heading back to the real world.

215
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,839
Why?

216
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,880
Isn't it better to stay here?

217
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,880
You have food, games,

218
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,399
and everything you want here.

219
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,679
Why should we leave?

220
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,279
You guys can leave all you want.

221
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm not leaving.

222
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Su Lie, do you want to leave?

223
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,279
I...

224
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,399
No.

225
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm used to staying in the game.

226
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm not afraid of women
as I was before as well.

227
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,600
If I leave,
I'll have to get used to it again.

228
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,079
Can't we stay here?

229
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,760
No.

230
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,279
Mr. Xu has already let us go
in the game.

231
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,640
He even gave us new jobs.

232
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,320
If we go outside,

233
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,720
would Mr. Xu let us go?

234
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,679
That's right.

235
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:24,679
Why don't you guys stay here as well?

236
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,559
I think it's good if all of us stayed.

237
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
What do you mean, "good"?

238
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,600
Do you know

239
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,559
that if we stay here,

240
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
it won't take long before we die.

241
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,239
Our vital signs

242
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,679
are at less than 70 percent right now.

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,799
Once it hits zero,

244
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
we'll be dead in the real world.

245
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,359
And if we die,

246
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,760
the game is over.

247
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Do you get it now?

248
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,919
You... You're lying, right?

249
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,799
I don't believe you.

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,599
Then... How are we going to get out?

251
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,000
You can leave here
once you die in the game.

252
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,039
Die?

253
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,080
Never mind then.

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
We don't have time to explain.

255
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
Mr. Cui!

256
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,359
Wait for me!

257
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,239
Wait for me!

258
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,719
Help! We're being kidnapped!

259
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,440
Stop!

260
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,520
Let go of them!

261
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,479
Don't be afraid.

262
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,400
They're all NPCs. Hit them all you want!

263
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,919
Let me do it!

264
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,000
Bro! Bro!

265
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's go!

266
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Let's go.

267
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Come on!

268
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,719
Why don't we try another way?

269
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,679
I'm afraid of heights.

270
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,359
Don't worry.

271
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,200
If you're afraid to do it,

272
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,840
I can help you.

273
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,239
I'll jump first. You guys follow up.

274
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,559
I'll do it with you.

275
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,400
Kele and I will go last,

276
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,239
in case both of you change your minds.

277
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,840
I don't want to die!

278
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Don't worry. It's fine.

279
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,679
Qianya died once, right?

280
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,719
And she's all right.

281
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,760
We'll be fine too.

282
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,919
On three.

283
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:00,919
One.

284
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Two.

285
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,760
Three.

286
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,799
Why did you kick me, Jiang Kele?

287
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,679
If I hadn't do that,
you'd have run away.

288
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,000
We were in the game.

289
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,080
We were in
the data collection room all along.

290
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,000
Why isn't Mr. Cui awake yet?

291
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,679
You're right. What's going on?

292
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
What else could it be?

293
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,119
He probably ran away.

294
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,679
Do you think everyone is like you?

295
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,159
Lu Xiao, weren't you the last to jump?

296
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,559
Did Mr. Cui jump?

297
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,559
He went before Kele and me.

298
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
Could it be... Did something go wrong
with the equipment?

299
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,719
I'll go back and find him.

300
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,559
You're all awake!

301
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
Mr. Cui, you...

302
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,440
I was caught in a tree.

303
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,880
I had to climb back up
to the roof again,

304
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
and jump down the second time.

305
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,400
Come on. We have to look for the exit.

306
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,799
Okay.

307
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,880
I haven't been able to get in touch
with Kele and Qianya.

308
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,960
Did something happen to them?

309
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,080
Aunty,

310
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,960
where are you going?

311
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,039
To find you.

312
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,840
But you came instead. Perfect.

313
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Saves me some fuel.

314
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
What do you see me for?

315
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,679
Why did you come?

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,679
I... Nothing in particular.

317
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,880
I just came to check on you.

318
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,679
To see how you were doing.

319
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
Your men keep watching on me
all day long.

320
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,799
I can't eat, I can't drink,

321
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,960
I can't sleep, and I can't go shopping.

322
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,640
Do you think I'm doing well?

323
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
How would my men
be able to keep you here?

324
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,159
All you have to do
is dig another tunnel.

325
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,799
You'll be able to get out then, right?

326
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,919
So you found out about it.

327
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
So you came to interrogate me.

328
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,760
I wouldn't go that far.

329
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
I just want an answer.

330
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Why did you betray me, Aunty?

331
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,000
Why couldn't you be on my side?

332
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,119
You're wrong.

333
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,000
All these years,

334
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,080
I've always been on your side.

335
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,719
I never changed.

336
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,520
You changed.

337
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,440
You strayed further and further away.

338
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,359
Please tell me

339
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,960
where the kids you locked up are

340
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
right now.

341
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,039
Kids?

342
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
What kids?

343
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,760
Stop pretending.

344
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,559
The people you locked up!

345
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,679
I'm not pretending.

346
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,440
I simply don't understand what you mean.

347
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,679
I've never locked anyone up.

348
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,200
So who are those kids
you're referring to?

349
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,880
You've done things your way
all this time.

350
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,440
You know very well

351
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,200
what awaits you at the end.

352
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,640
It's not too late to turn back now.

353
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,119
Aunty,

354
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,239
I haven't accomplished
what I set out to do yet.

355
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,919
Please don't interfere any longer.

356
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,119
What is the point of waking us up?

357
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,000
We can't do anything either.

358
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,599
I'd rather go back into the game

359
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,239
than die out here.

360
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,039
This is my spot. Yours is over there.

361
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't care. I'm going to sleep!

362
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,599
Where would I sleep then?

363
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,799
Stop fooling around!

364
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,359
We have to get back
to the floor you guys were living in

365
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,679
as soon as possible.

366
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,400
You know that place well.

367
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,000
You might be able to find some clues.

368
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,440
Yes, we do.

369
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,760
But we've looked all day,

370
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,119
and we still can't find a way out!

371
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,280
And the electricity is down.

372
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,679
I think we should just get some rest
in the game.

373
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,880
That way,
when the electricity is back on,

374
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,320
we'll have enough energy to get out.

375
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,159
Luo Ke!

376
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,960
You little...

377
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
I think he's right!

378
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,359
Since we can't get out right now,

379
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,400
we should take some rest

380
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,440
and save up our energy.

381
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,119
That's logical, right?

382
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,479
Then how much longer
will we be trapped in here?

383
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
No, I mean...

384
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,000
- We can't just wait here...
- Stop arguing!

385
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,799
We'll take the elevator.

386
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,400
Didn't you say the electricity was out?

387
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,359
Who told you that you couldn't use
the elevator without electricity?

388
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,039
We'll pry the door open

389
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
and head down the elevator shaft.

390
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,960
How much did Xu Guanghan pay you?

391
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,559
I'll pay you 10 times the amount.

392
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,440
I'll check the secret passage.

393
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,760
Right! That's our last hope!

394
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,520
Find a coin for me!

395
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,440
Coin!

396
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Right!

397
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,080
Search for it!

398
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,479
Hurry! Who has a coin?

399
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,159
No need! The bookshelf is open!

400
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,919
Let's go.

401
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,679
It's blocked!

402
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,000
It's completely blocked!

403
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,679
We should've expected this.

404
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,919
I have an idea!

405
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,679
The vent in the living room!

406
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,359
We got out from there
in the game once!

407
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,239
Wake up. That was in the game.

408
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,359
Even the secret passage was blocked.

409
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,760
Do you think they would
leave the vent open?

410
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,679
That's right. You're dumb.

411
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,960
But Xu Guanghan isn't!

412
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,960
We're doomed.

413
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,559
Hello?

414
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,520
Boss, something terrible happened!

415
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
Fushun is gone!

416
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
What about the men watching her?

417
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,040
They... They disappeared too!

418
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,719
Head to the subway station.

419
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,560
Yes, sir.

420
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,599
I got it.

421
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,400
What?

422
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,920
We'll write messages

423
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,040
and put them in a bottle.

424
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,959
We'll send the bottles out
through the waterways

425
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,359
and let them float
into the rivers and the sea.

426
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,040
Think of it as a drift bottle.

427
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
You have some wild ideas.

428
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,239
We have no other choices.

429
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,079
I watched an old movie once.

430
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,560
The protagonist was trapped in prison.

431
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,719
He got out by digging through a tunnel.

432
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
I watched that movie!

433
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
But that guy took 10 years to get out!

434
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,719
Will we even last until next week?

435
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,319
But that was a good movie.

436
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,520
Let me tell you...

437
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,880
Kele!

438
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,640
Kids! Are you all right?

439
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,920
Are you okay?

440
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,920
Granny!

441
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,273
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

442
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,400
Hurry, kids!

443
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,319
Get in the car!

444
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,239
Hurry, hurry!

445
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,599
Open the doors! Quick!

446
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,520
They're here!

447
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,959
Get in! Get in, Su Lie!

448
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,439
- Come on!
- Okay.

449
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,040
Granny!

450
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,880
Don't worry about me, Kele.

451
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
You guys go ahead. I'll be fine.

452
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,319
Where are they?

453
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,280
Where are they?

454
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,839
They've been safely transferred
to another place.

455
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm the only one here now.

456
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,119
What will you do now?

457
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,479
Get her.

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
You let all of them
get away just like that?

459
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
Not all of them...

460
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,160
I knocked out your aunt.

461
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,439
She's in the car right now, unconscious.

462
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,199
I'll send the men
to get them back right away.

463
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,719
Do you even know where to find them?

464
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,560
I do.

465
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,760
I'll send men to look for them

466
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,239
at every possible place they could be.

467
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,640
And what if they don't show up?

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
They left in a minivan,

469
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,599
provided by your aunt.

470
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,640
I've sent people to check
the number of the license plate.

471
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm sure we'll get a location soon.

472
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,199
Go.

473
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,079
Oh, right.

474
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,439
Send my aunt to my place.

475
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes, sir.

476
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
What should we do now, Mr. Xu?

477
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,119
Should we wait for Zhang Yang?

478
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,560
I always take the initiative.

479
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,599
Contact the press.

480
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,439
We lost them.
We're safe for now.

481
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm worried about Granny.

482
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,640
Will she be in danger?

483
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Grandma Fushun is Mr. Xu's aunt.

484
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm sure

485
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,280
she'll be fine.

486
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,880
Don't worry, Kele.

487
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,520
Grandma Fushun
is a very capable person.

488
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,079
I'm sure she'll contact us somehow.

489
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,880
But we ran all this way here.

490
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,319
We don't have phones too.

491
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,560
How is she going to contact us?

492
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Don't worry too much for now.

493
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
We'll expose Xu Guanghan first.

494
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,359
Then we'll go and find Grandma Fushun.

495
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,000
Luo Ke!

496
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,560
Look! We're on TV!

497
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,040
(Yao Inc.
has released an urgent announcement.)

498
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,359
(Pioneer Entertainment)
(Four men)

499
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,800
(were said to have been imitating)

500
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,520
(the virtual characters
of their company's game.)

501
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,400
(They claimed to have been imprisoned)

502
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,319
(by the CEO, Xu Guanghan,)

503
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,920
(to gain sympathy and money)

504
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,959
(from the Lavender Club.)

505
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,040
(The company would like
the public to take caution)

506
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,239
(and be wary of potential scams.)

507
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
Xu Guanghan!

508
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,560
A thief crying "stop thief"!
Manipulator!

509
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,800
Xu Guanghan is too cunning.

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,760
He publicized the photos
of all four of you ahead of time.

511
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,680
That way,

512
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,239
when I bring you guys
with me to sue him,

513
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,599
the public won't buy it.

514
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,959
They'll just think
that you guys are imitators.

515
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
But Xu Guanghan in the game

516
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,839
used an even more shameless method.

517
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,640
That's right!

518
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
He made a press release

519
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
and announced
the existence of all four of you!

520
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,439
If the public believes him as well,

521
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,040
that's when

522
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,880
we'll really know that we've lost!

523
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,560
He won't use
that trick in the real world.

524
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,359
The public won't be as foolish
as the ones he designed.

525
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,000
They wouldn't blindly believe him.

526
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,400
So we need to find stronger evidence

527
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,680
to expose Xu Guanghan.

528
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,079
We'll need to start over
and make a better plan.

529
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,079
Let's head back

530
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,280
and discuss it further.

531
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,359
- Okay.
- Okay.

532
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's go.

533
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,439
Quick, get in the car!

534
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,160
We'll go scout the area.

535
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,400
We'll let you guys know
when it's safe to come down.

536
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,359
Be careful.

537
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,239
Keep a tight watch on the place.

538
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,959
Yes, sir.

539
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,359
Xu Guanghan's men.

540
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Our home isn't safe anymore.

541
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,959
Quick. Let's head back.

542
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,400
They're back!

543
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,119
Xu Guanghan's men are
all over the place.

544
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,000
Then... Where else can we go, Ms. Guan?

545
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,119
Definitely not the house.

546
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,560
The company isn't safe either.

547
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,319
Granny got us out of the place.

548
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,079
That means they must be
keeping an eye on her place too.

549
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,359
We can't go to any place

550
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,079
that's related to us.

551
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,160
- What will we do then?
- What will we do then?

552
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,959
Oh, no. They saw us!

553
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,079
Get in the car!

554
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,359
Don't lose them.

555
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,479
Hurry!

556
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,479
We got rid of them.

557
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,839
It's a good thing we abandoned the car.

558
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
We lost the car.

559
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,119
We can't go back home.

560
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,359
We can't go to the company either!

561
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
We can go to a hotel!

562
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,680
No. They don't have any identification.

563
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,959
They won't let us check in there.

564
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,920
The three of us will ask around

565
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,760
and see if anyone we know
can let us stay for a few days.

566
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,319
The three of us will be gone.

567
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,719
Then what about the four of them?

568
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,239
We'll wait for you guys here.

569
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,760
This place isn't safe either.

570
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,199
If Xu Guanghan's men find this place

571
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,160
and you guys were forced to split up,

572
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,680
we won't be able to contact you guys.

573
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,920
I know a place.

574
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,800
We can put them there first.

575
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,119
Where?

576
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,880
Your favorite place.

577
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,359
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.

578
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,479
Eat up.

579
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,560
You guys are Kele's friends.

580
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,719
Kele is a regular customer of mine.

581
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,199
So I have to take good care of you guys.

582
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,920
You must be starving.

583
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,479
Thank you, Sir.

584
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,560
Sorry for the trouble, Sir.

585
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,680
Not at all.

586
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,560
Eat up. Let me know if you need more.

587
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,760
Thank you.

588
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,040
The owner here is quite friendly.

589
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,880
He's much better
than the one in the game.

590
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Sir!

591
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,719
I'd like another serving of fish tofu!

592
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,920
I'll give you four servings! Right away!

593
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,040
Fish tofu.

594
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,040
Qiqi.

595
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,599
You scared me!

596
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,760
What are you doing, Kele?
Acting so suspiciously.

597
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
I have something to tell you.

598
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,959
You can find me at the store.

599
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,119
Why would you need to stop me here?

600
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,760
I... I took sick leave today.

601
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,400
They would find out I was lying
if I went to the store, right?

602
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,719
Then why did you pretend to be sick?

603
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,079
My relatives came to visit.
I want to hang out with them.

604
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,680
Then go and have fun.
I'm not going to tell on you.

605
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,719
They don't have a place to stay.

606
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,880
I wanted to ask if they could
stay at your place for a few days.

607
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,119
How many people are there?

608
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:48,560
Five, six, seven...

609
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,880
I know that's a lot.

610
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,760
But I would be grateful
if you could let as many of them stay.

611
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, I mean,
I share that place with others.

612
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,160
It's okay if it's just you,

613
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,079
but with so many relatives,

614
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,439
I don't think it would be possible.

615
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,000
All right.

616
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,560
I'll think of something else.

617
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,800
See you.

618
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,439
Kele!

619
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,800
There's a parcel for you at the store.

620
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I'll pick it up next time.

621
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,760
It's from that granny.

622
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,439
Would you like a bowl as well?

623
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,280
No.

624
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,079
Mr. Cui.

625
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,119
Ms. Guan.

626
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,560
I talked it through with my ex-wife.

627
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,479
We can stay there.

628
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
But the house is a bit small.

629
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
It won't fit all of us.

630
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,959
Only two people.

631
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,839
Only two...

632
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,920
That works. The other three
can stay at my friend's place.

633
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
We'll be splitting up for a while then.

634
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,280
Will we cause trouble to other people

635
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,000
if we stay at their place?

636
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes.

637
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,959
But it can't be helped.

638
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,599
We'll do our best to be careful.

639
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,119
Try not to get the others involved
as much as possible.

640
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm back.

641
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,479
How did it go, Kele?

642
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,880
I picked up a parcel.

643
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
You had time to pick up a parcel?

644
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,640
It's a parcel from Grandma Fushun.

645
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,040
She left us a map.

646
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,400
There's a place circled on it.

647
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,239
I think she knew

648
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,000
that we would be in danger,

649
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,599
so she left a hideout for us.

650
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,280
That's great!

651
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,119
We won't have to split up then!

652
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
We're finally here.

653
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,719
This should be

654
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,280
the place Granny circled on the map.

655
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,920
A cabin in the woods.

656
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,839
I can't believe Grandma Fushun

657
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,760
prepared such a great place for us.

658
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Yes.

659
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,719
Let's look around first.

660
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
You search that area.

661
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I'll look over here.

662
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,079
Isn't that us?

663
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,460
(Su Lie's mother, lost, orphanage,
Xu Guanghan's secretary, Bay House)

664
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,980
(Crush On Love manager, Jiang Kele,
shop keeper, Crush On Love CEO, friends)

665
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,460
(Xinle Orphanage, Dean of the Orphanage,
child accidentally falls into water)

666
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,880
So Grandma Fushun planned all of this.

667
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,359
What's this?

668
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,880
A blueprint of the Bay House.

669
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,280
There's even a secret passage on it.

670
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,359
That means

671
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,599
this is Granny's secret hideout.

672
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,040
She arranged for the parcel
