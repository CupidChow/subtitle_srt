1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
(Lu Xiao, we will always support you.)

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,720
Since the appearance of Love Boys,

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,719
it has gained a lot of attention
and popularity.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,680
Lu Xiao, Xu Nian,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Su Lie and Luo Ke.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,359
These four virtual characters

7
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,560
have also become household names.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,280
However, I know

9
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,200
that a virtual love

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,159
is no longer enough
to satisfy all of you.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,719
What you want

12
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,639
is a real lover that you can touch.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,080
(Su Lie, Luo Ke, Lu Xiao)

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
We understand your feelings.

15
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,360
But...

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,720
It is easy to create a vessel.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
But it is hard for it to have a soul.

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,040
It has been my greatest wish for them

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
to possess souls like human beings.

20
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,119
Thanks to Yao Inc.'s
persistent efforts,

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,479
we have finally overcome this obstacle!

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
(I'll protect you, Lu Xiao. Luo Ke.
Lu Xiao, I love you)

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,279
Now, let us welcome

24
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,880
the AI robots of Y4 to the stage!

25
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:05,040
(Luo Ke, Su Lie, Lu Xiao)
Y4! Y4! Y4!

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,440

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,580
=Episode 36=

28
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,240
Hello, everyone. We are

29
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
Y4!

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm Lu Xiao.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
Lu Xiao! Lu Xiao!

32
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,479
I'm Xu Nian.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
Xu Nian! Xu Nian!

34
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm Su Lie.

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,119
Su Lie! Su Lie!

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,759
I'm Luo Ke.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,199
Luo Ke! Luo Ke!

38
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,620
(Xu Nian, Su Lie, Lu Xiao.
We will always support you)

39
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,839
Everyone,

40
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,600
this is a historical moment.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
Even though,

42
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,240
I've watched all of you grow
to where you are today,

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,320
I can't help but be amazed still.

44
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,080
You are perfect.

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
Every details about them looks
just the same as a real human being.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Members of the Lavender Club!

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,919
Take out your phones

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,080
and log into Yao Inc.'s website.

49
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,600
I hereby announce

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,320
that there will be 1000 "Lu Xiao",

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,440
1000 "Xu Nian",

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
1000 "Su Lie",

53
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,839
and 1000 "Luo Ke"

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,679
available for pre-order today!

55
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,679
- They are all out!
- There's no more!

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,759
They are all sold out!

57
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,880
I know.

58
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,559
Many of you didn't manage
to order one, right?

59
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,919
- Yes!
- Yes!

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
Don't worry. From next week onward,

61
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,559
they will be officially available
in all Y4 flagship stores.

62
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
However,

63
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,839
your boyfriends

64
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,440
will be arriving one week later

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,239
before they can knock on your door,

66
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,239
dine with you,

67
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,760
and go shopping with you.

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Now, let us enjoy

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,200
the performance from the real Y4!

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,780
(Xu Nian, Su Lie.
Lu Xiao, you are my only one)

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Y4! Y4! Y4!

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,279
Sorry.

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,320
Pause the music.

74
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,559
I have some things to say.

75
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,559
Actually, we aren't AI robots.

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
We are real people.

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,480
Brother Zhang, were you the one
who called the police?

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,359
I thought you had run away.

79
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,799
Kele told me to call the police.

80
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,679
Careful.

81
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,399
Call the police.

82
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,839
Are all of you safe?

83
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,720
Yes.

84
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,559
We'd better look for Xu Guanghan now.

85
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,600
We'll need you to cooperate with us.

86
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,980
(Love Boys)

87
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,160
- Luo Ke!
- Welcome...

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
Um...

89
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,279
Did you see my message?

90
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,160
I got it.

91
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,760
You found the AI spy,

92
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,040
and you rescued Xu Nian.

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
You also caught Zhang Yang.

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,880
But why are you here?

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,679
We're going to expose Xu Guanghan.

96
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,320
We're going to let everyone know

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,959
all the crimes he did.

98
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:56,839
So

99
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,399
the three of them are on their way
to the stadium right now.

100
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,079
Will you come with me?

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,959
You just need the three of them.

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,119
What do you need me for?

103
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,399
Luo Ke.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,279
Don't you want to let everyone know

105
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,200
who you are?

106
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,320
Don't you want to be able

107
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
to live proudly as Luo Wenxuan?

108
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
We are human beings that exist

109
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,959
just like all of you.

110
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,940
(Luo Ke, Lu Xiao, I love you)

111
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,880
Those aren't the lines we planned
during the rehearsal,

112
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,679
but the reaction is good.

113
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,920
If my guess isn't wrong,

114
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,640
you must have planned this,
right, Mr. Xu?

115
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
Something isn't right.

116
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,000
Except that...

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,359
The four of us were imprisoned

118
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,506
by Xu Guanghan in the Bay House
since we're kids.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,839
- What?
- How could that be?

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,359
And he forced us

121
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,640
to provide the data
he needed for Love Boys.

122
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,586
(I'll protect you, Lu Xiao)

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,440
Once the data collection is complete,

124
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,079
Xu Guanghan will deliver
the AI robots of Y4

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
to the world.

126
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,519
By that time, the four of us

127
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,559
may actually be imprisoned forever.

128
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you saying?

129
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,959
Don't move!

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,839
Stay still!

131
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,760
Xu Guanghan,

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,719
there is nothing you wouldn't do

133
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,919
to accomplish your goals.

134
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,960
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

135
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,599
You spared no one,

136
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,679
not those who opposed you,

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
and not even those closest to you.

138
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,119
You've done so many evil deeds
for all these years.

139
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,200
Now, you are finally going
to pay for your crimes.

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Spend the rest of your life in jail.

141
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,320
That way, you'll get a taste
of what it's like to be imprisoned too.

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,359
You idiots.

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,159
You don't understand

144
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,679
what you are destroying.

145
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,200
You've ruined the future of humanity!

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
The future of humanity

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
only lies in humans.

148
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,780
(Freedom
4 Love Boys)

149
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,000
All that's left

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,520
is the battle between us women.

151
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
Why should women make things
difficult for other women?

152
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,719
You're the one who started all of this.

153
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,400
I advise you to surrender.

154
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,880
I've been with Mr. Xu for years.
I've picked up some moves as well.

155
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,559
Lei Na!

156
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,159
We've always been living

157
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,679
in a world of lies.

158
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,159
But from now on,

159
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,919
we'll be returning to the reality.

160
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,039
I hope that you guys can do the same

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,599
and return to the real world.

162
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,280
So Luo Wenxuan is Luo Ke.

163
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,880
I misunderstood Su Lie.

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,119
I can't believe
he is actually a real person.

165
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,320
We want to thank everyone who helped us.

166
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,320
It was your sense of justice
and selflessness

167
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,760
that led us

168
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,440
through all those obstacles.

169
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,719

because I wanted to earn money?

00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,919

But every now and then,

263
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,640
I can't help but remember the days

264
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,000
before I signed the contract
with Yao Inc.

265
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,039
I used to be

266
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,559

268
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,080
back then,

271
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,119

Singing is something
that makes people happy.

275
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,080
It's not for money

276
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,239
or for someone.

277
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,280

I wanted to be a singer.

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,319
So, my answer is...

341
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
Of course, I don't mind.

342
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,400
All right, kids.

343
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,319
Slap your right leg
with your right hand.

344
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,400
That's right.

345
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,479
Now, move your right leg backward.

346

(China Taekwondo Association
Belt Examination)

347
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,359
Get ready.

348
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,119
One, two, three.

One, two, three.

351
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,479
One, two, three.

352
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,119
All right. Back to your position.

353
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Everyone did well today.

354
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,400
Everyone was concentrated.

355
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,119
That's it for today's class.
Thanks, everyone.

356
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,199
Thank you, sir.

357
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,599
Sir! Sir!

358
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,760
Could we invite you

359
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,319
to get some ice cream after class?

360
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,280
No.

361
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,400
Why?

362
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,520
Because your parents

363
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,640
will be picking you up after class.

364
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,079
You can't just leave.

365
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,439
And you must not talk to strangers.

366
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,199
And you must never, ever,

367
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,680
eat something a stranger gives you.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,359
You have to know
how to protect yourselves,

369
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,319
all right?

370
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,439
Sir! Sir!

371
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Could we exchange phone numbers?

372
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,760
That way, we won't be strangers.

373
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
It's still a no.

374
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,640
Maybe when you are older.

375
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,079
Go on now.

377
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,719
You came back early.

378
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,800
Didn't we agree I should pick you up?

379
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I changed the dates.
I came back a day early.

380
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,439
Do you remember what day today is?

381
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,040
Today...

382
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,040
It's not your birthday.

383
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,319
It's not mine, either.

384
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,599
It's not our anniversary, either.

385
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:25,079
It's not the day
Xu Guanghan was caught, either.

386
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:25,640
Today...

387
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
There's nothing on today.

388
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,560
I just wanted to surprise you.

389
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,920
I knew it.

390
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,760
I wouldn't forget
any of our important anniversaries.

391
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:33,880
Oh, right.

392
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,239
I have a present for you.

393
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,439
It's adorable.

394
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,839
I have one myself too.

395
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,119
They are a pair.

396

Mr. Zhang.

397
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,760
Ms. Guan.

398
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,479
It's been a long time.

399
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,599
Please have a seat.

400
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,359
Oh, Ms. Guan,

401
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,760
how the tides have changed.

402
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,000
A year ago, I wanted to invest in you.

403
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,280
A year later, and here you are,

404
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,199
purchasing my company.

405
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,920
It is not that the tides have changed.

406
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,479
This is just how business works.

407
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,239
Every company has a month's notice

408
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,560
before they go bankrupt.

409
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
If you have any requests,
please let me know.

410
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,439
I'll do my best to fulfill them.

411
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,800
I only have one request.

412
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,959
I want to stay in the company.

413
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,680
Mr. Zhang,

414
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,719
I understand your feelings well.

415
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,400
Both of us run our companies.

416
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,239
It must be hard for you

417
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,359
to watch and accept

418
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,640
your company being the way it is now.

419
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,560
However, you are responsible

420
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,640
for what it is today.

421

(Crush On Love)

422
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Mr. Zhang,

423
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,000
you may choose not to sell the company.

424
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,199
However, the only ending that awaits

425
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,800
is bankruptcy.

426
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,479
When that day comes,

427
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,119
all we have to do is to buy it

428
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,160
at the lowest price.

429
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,719
You know

430
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,479
there aren't many companies
on the market right now

431
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,520
that can afford the price.

432
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,319
You may not be staying
in the company

433
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,239
if you take the money
and leave right now,

434
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
but at least you'll know
that it's under our management.

435
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,640
It will be able to live on.

436
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,920
But...

437
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,520
Mr. Zhang,

438
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,119
from what I know of you,

439
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,920
you are a businessman to the core.

440
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,040
As long as the price is right,

441
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,079
there is nothing you can't give up.

This is not revenge.

of course you can!

to go on a date tomorrow?

I thought I told you

490
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,160
not to open the door for me anymore.

491
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,119
It'll be bad if the paparazzi
get a photo of it.

492

We made it public, didn't we?

I'm afraid

495
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,239
that it will affect my professionalism
as a manager.

496

Don't mind what others think of you.

497
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,119
All right.

498
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560

00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,760
It's expected that they'd be late.

510
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,000
That's right!

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,280
To emphasize our entrance,

512
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,239
we came early

513
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,079
and waited half an hour
outside the door.

514
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:21,800
Isn't that right?

515
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,800
All right. Stop bickering.

516
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,800
Here it is.

517
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,400
The main dish of the day.

518
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,560
- Thanks, Grandma!
- Thank you, Grandma!

519
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,000
I spent a lot on these dishes today!

520
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,520
See, there are so many of them!

521
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,760
Granny,

522
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,199
when did you learn
how to make "Kele fish"?

523
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,199
It's a good thing
your name is Jiang Kele

524
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,599
and not Jiang Mayou.
[*Mayou means sesame oil in Chinese]

525
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,239
Otherwise,
I'll have to make chicken in sesame oil!

526
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,160
Try it.

527
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
- Okay. I'll...
- I'll...

528
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,239
Is your name Kele?

529
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
Sit down, will you?

530
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,680
I...

531
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,160
Eat, Kele. Eat.

532
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,640
Eat, Kele.

533
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,839
Here. Try this piece.

534
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,319
Is it good?

535
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,280
This isn't the "Kele fish".

536
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
This is a braised fish!

537
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,640
Kele.

538
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Dad!

539
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,800
Did you really make this?

540
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
When did you come back?

541
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Not only am I back,

542
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,400
but I'm back for good.

543
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,239
Really?

544
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,760
Come. Have a seat.

545
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,319
I talked to dad about it.

546
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,400
He's always busy working.

547
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,079
It's rare that he...

548
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,040
What did you call me?

549
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,040
You guys aren't married yet, are you?

550
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,599
Uncle.

551
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,040
It's rare that Uncle
gets to take time off.

552
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,000
Right.

553
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,119
So...

554
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,760
It was you who invited my dad?

555
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Of course.

556
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Kele,

557
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,520
your dream finally came true.

558
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,239
Yes.

559
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,839
My dad is back for good.

560
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,040
And I have Lu Xiao now.

561
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,560
This feels amazing.

562
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,920
It's as if I'm back

563
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,280
in the game again.

564
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,280
You scared me, Jiang Kele.

565
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,239
So everyone carries that
with you as well, huh?

566
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,479
Of course.

567
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,640
All right.

568
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,079
Since we're sure
that we're not in the game,

569
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,479
we should celebrate.

570
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,239
We should!

571
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:23,800
Here, here.

572
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,520
Cheers!
