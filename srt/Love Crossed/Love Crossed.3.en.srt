1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Apart from the love index,

2
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,959
indexes for energy, stamina,
speed, stability,

3
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,079
reflexes, and expressibility

4
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,440
are within normal range.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,639
Xu Nian's completion rate
is at 97 percent.

6
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:28,840
(Completion Rate)
Luo Ke at 92 percent.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,079
Su Lie at 90 percent.

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,440
And Lu Xiao at 89 percent.

9
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,759
(Luo Ke, 92 percent)
Is that right?

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,919
The numbers haven't changed much
from last year's. Why is that so?

11
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,360
Has the IT department

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
been slacking off this entire year?

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,159
Mr. Xu,

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,159
the IT department

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,360
has tried everything they can.

16
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,279
This is the highest completion rate
we've been able to achieve

17
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,240
without contacting the outside world.

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,799
Especially Xu Nian.

19
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,520
His completion rate is at 97 percent.

20
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:52,799
I don't care,
even if it's at 99.9 percent.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,119
What do I expect?

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,959
Perfection.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,799
And what is perfection?

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,959
A hundred percent.

25
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:05,553
(Completion Rate)

26
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,080
What happened that day?

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr. Xu,

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,680
the night when the electricity went off
at Bay House, Lu Xiao...

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,310
=Love Crossed=

30
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,350
=Episode 3=

31
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,119
Who is it?

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Delivery for you.

33
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,520
It's heavy.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,440
Let me put it inside for you.

35
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,559
Okay. Thank you.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,039
Please put it down here.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,279
Please sign here.

38
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,000
Stay still and listen well
if you want to live!

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Get your valuables out.

40
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,240
Okay.

41
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,080
Hurry up!

42
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,559
What's this?

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Trying to call the police? You little...

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,839
Stop!

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,919
Whenever and wherever you are,

46
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,240
I'll come and protect you

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,759
when you're in danger.

48
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,679
Where did you come from?

49
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,320
What's with those cheesy lines? Gross.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,279
So this is Love Boys?

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,199
It feels incredibly real.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,559
A brave woman

53
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,119
should protect herself well.

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,920
Don't bother. It's not real.

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
It's real

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,640
in my game.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
If you immerse yourself entirely
into the game,

58
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,679
everything you feel is real.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
It's our first time
meeting each other today.

60
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,279
I can grant you a wish.

61
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,200
I wish you'd disappear.

62
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,440
All right.

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
Jiang Kele's taste isn't
that good at all.

64
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,640
I thought you'd be cold

65
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
so I got you a hot chocolate.

66
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,359
For me?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,519
Don't you know I have severe insomnia?

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,079
Cocoa does not contain caffeine.

69
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,359
Cocoa can contain

70
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,720
up to 0.214mg of caffeine.

71
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,160
A virtual character?

72
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,440
A not very well-designed character.

73
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,640
♪Why is this feeling
tugging at my heartstrings?♪

74
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:01,119

79
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Are you trying to trick me?

80
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,959
What a lame game.
The server shall break down soon.

81
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,290
(Yao Inc.)

82
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,440
Why did the server suddenly break down?

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
If it hadn't broken down,

84
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,479
we wouldn't be able
to get off work early.

85
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,679
Who cares?

86
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,000
It'd better stay down.

87
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,599
We'd get to play games every day.

88
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Play games?

89
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,960
If we don't complete our task,

90
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,359
we'll have to stay here forever.

91
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,599
What's wrong with that?

92
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,559
The outside world is dangerous.

93
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,559
Well, I want to go out to the outside
world and see what it's like.

94
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't worry.

95
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,000
Once the contract is up,

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,039
we'll be able to go out.

97
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,520
The first thing I'll do when I get out

98
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,960
is to gorge myself on all the food!

99
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
Lu Xiao, do you want to come with us?

100
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,760
Don't touch me.

101
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,919
Have you forgotten how long
it's been since you last got a beating?

102
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
I'm a genius when it comes to cleaning.

103
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,039
I can't believe I managed
to finish cleaning up this entire house

104
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,159
with time to spare.

105
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Time to call it a day.

106
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
If anyone discovers you,

107
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,640
you're doomed.

108
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,239
Oh, no! Someone's back!

109
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,239
Did you guys notice something strange?

110
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,760
No one cleaned our rooms yesterday.

111
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,400
That's right.

112
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,359
Do you think something happened
to Grandma Fushun?

113
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,559
She might have just slacked off.

114
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:09,960
I'll just complain to Lei Na

115
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,119
if no one

116
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
cleaned my room.

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
It's all tidied up.

118
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,159
Don't you get tired of that?

119
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
Don't just complain
about every little thing.

120
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Come on. Let's play a game.

121
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,159
Okay.

122
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,320
Lu Xiao, we finally got some free time.

123
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,359
Do you want to join us?

124
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,400
Don't you guys get tired
of being together all the time?

125
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,320
I never expected our enemies

126
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,158
to be four non-existent
virtual characters,

127
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,960
rather than competitors

128
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,919
from the same line of work.

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,359
Does anyone have
anything to say regarding the impact

130
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,080
Y4 had on our performance?

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,359
Don't feel stressful.

132
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:21,760
Speak your minds.

133
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,440
You go first.

134
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,159
Since Y4 are so popular right now,

135
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,280
why don't we cooperate with Yao Inc.?

136
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,840
By inserting our advertisements

137
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
into their game,

138
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,719
we might be able
to get some of our clients back.

139
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,320
I'd agree.

140
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,080
But do you think Xu Guanghan will agree?

141
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,520
Ms. Guan, I have a suggestion.

142
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,559
If Yao Inc. refuses to work with us,

143
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,640
let's compete then.

144
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,080
They made a virtual love game, right?

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,239
Let's make one too.

146
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,440
They used four men
to lure our female clients away.

147
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,000
We can make 48, Ms. Guan.

148
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
We could make a girl group.

149
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,039
We have so many
male clients too.

150
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,840
That's a good idea.

151
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
That means

152
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,840
we'll have to get rid
of everything we've worked on so far

153
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
and start from scratch again.

154
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,239
Do any of you
have the knowledge or the expertise

155
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
to create virtual characters?

156
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,359
Do you want to be fired?

157
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
I have a suggestion as well.

158
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,119
My idea

159
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,400
will not only allow us to stick
with our main business structure

160
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,320
but also

161
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
integrate our business model
with virtual love games.

162
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,080
The number of people
getting married is decreasing.

163
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,679
Why don't we develop something
related to virtual weddings?

164
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,080
To put it simply,

165
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,799
we'll make it so
that the players can marry

166
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
the virtual characters.

167
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:29,960
What do you think?

168
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,719
That's a creative idea.

169
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,760
Is that your plan for job-hopping?

170
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,919
Are you planning to take that idea

171
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,119
and apply for a job at Yao Inc.?

172
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,159
I think

173
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,520
they'd make you a manager.

174
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Really?

175
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,840
Would they really offer me
a managerial position?

176
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
You could try.

177
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,840
Your salary will be transferred
to your pay card.

178
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,559
This meeting is over.

179
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,119
What is it?

180
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,599
Hello? Ms. Guan?

181
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,320
Have you tried the game?

182
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,520
You didn't get hooked on it, did you?

183
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,159
Only a woman as foolish as your ex-wife

184
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,960
would get addicted

185
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
to a game like that.

186
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,799
Please don't say that.

187
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm glad

188
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,359
that you didn't get addicted.

189
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,919
You didn't call me

190
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,359
just to ask this, did you?

191
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,320
Mr. Cui.

192
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,719
If you had put the same amount of effort
you have for gossip

193
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,960
into your work,

194
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,799
your ex-wife

195
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,640
would not have been
seduced by those men.

196
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,239
Ms. Guan, you've got me all wrong.

197
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,320
I called you

198
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,440
because I have something very important

199
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,520
to report to you.

200
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,840
Lisa's playing this game too.

201
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,479
I know.

202
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,559
No, that's not it.

203
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,080
It's Ji Peng Holdings.

204
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,039
They're pulling out.

205
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,080
Pulling out?

206
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,000
Why?

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,239
They didn't explain.

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,640
It must be because
of the company's performance.

209
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,520
No. It's not about that.

210
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,159
It's Y4.

211
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,960
Right. It's Y4.

212
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,000
Ever since that Y4
appeared out of nowhere,

213
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,039
our company's performance
has been declining year after year.

214
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,479
It's time to bring this matter up

215
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,679
to the public.

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,960
We need to get everyone
to tackle this problem.

217
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,719
I will not let

218
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,400
such a silly game

219
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,280
take over the future of humanity.

220
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,520
Ms. Guan!

221
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm most impressed.

222
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,200
You are incredible.

223
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,000
I can't believe you can spin

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,559
your own company's profits and sake

225
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,760
into something on the same level
as the well-being of humanity.

226
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,320
My goodness.

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,000
But what will you do?

228
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,719
Yao Inc. will not be easily defeated.

229
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
And do you think I, Guan Qianya,
will be defeated that easily?

230
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,280
The student outgrows the master.

231
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,640
I think

232
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,400
that you are more suited

233
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,960
to be in the line of business
as a janitor.

234
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,159
I do get
a sense of accomplishment as well.

235
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Here.

236
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,000
But after giving it some thought,

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,280
I don't think
it's something to be proud of.

238
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,840
No matter how good I am,

239
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,359
I'd turn out like you in the end,
won't I?

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Working my entire life as a janitor.

241
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,679
What's wrong with being a janitor?

242
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,599
Let me tell you this.

243
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,359
Everything has its value.

244
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,239
Think.

245
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,520
We help humans

246
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,799
to keep the environment clean

247
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,080
and comfortable.

248
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,200
That's an amazing thing.

249
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,559
It's a virtue.

250
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,880
Granny, you have a good heart.

251
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,239
Young lady.

252
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you mind if I share with you

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
my life experience?

254
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,159
No matter what you do,

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,440
the most important thing
is to mind your heart.

256
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,880
You must be able to take it at ease.

257
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,679
A lot of people ask me

258
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,119
why I want to be a janitor.

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
And I've decided

260
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,880
that I would be a janitor for life.

261
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,719
Why?

262
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,200
There are two reasons.

263
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,559
First of all,

264
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,119
I don't know how to do anything else.

265
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,599
Right.

266
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,159
And the second reason?

267
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,119
It pays well.

268
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,919
Don't try to fool me.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,760
If it paid well, you wouldn't be
making me pay for your medical bills.

270
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,840
Young lady, you are too narrow-sighted.

271
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,760
Let me tell you this. From now on,

272
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,080
you'll help me clean the Bay House.

273
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,239
The wage I'll pay you

274
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,960
will definitely be much higher
than the medical bills

275
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,479
you're footing for me right now.

276
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,119
Really?

277
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,559
How much?

278
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,919
How much?

279
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,239
That's five times the amount
I get paid working at the cosmetic shop!

280
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
How did you get so much money?

281
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:26,760
Well,

282
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,640
my original salary
was 10 times that amount.

283
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,400
That family is rich, after all!

284
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,719
That's enough.

285
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,919
Listen up.

286
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,280
From now on,

287
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,880
you'll go clean the place in my stead.

288
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,640
Okay.

289
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,039
And I'll wait for you to come back here.

290
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,080
We'll split the wage

291
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,640
when I get paid.

292
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,880
That way everybody wins!

293
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,679
Thank you for taking the tram.

294
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,679
Please give your seats up
for passengers who need them.

295
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,559
(Who does this woman think she is?)

296
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,280
(Attacking Y4 like that!)

297
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,119
(Who is she?)

298
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,479
(Come on, girls. Let's gather
our resources and beat her!)

299
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,920
(Who the heck is she?)

300
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,520
(How dare she attack Y4!)

301
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,439
(Over the past three years,

302
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,079
(you've been blinded)

303
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,199
(by the system created from big data)

304
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,640
(and the characters
created by the system.)

305
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,359
(You've all been brainwashed.)

306
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,839
(Today,)

307
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,920
(I'm going to expose)

308
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,319
(the true colors of the game,
Love Boys,)

309
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,880
(which is contaminating our society.)

310
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,359
(Love Boys)

311
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,520
(is a blood-sucking vampire)

312
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,160
(who is destroying
the future of humanity)

313
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,880
(by using those
soulless virtual characters)

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,160
(to extract huge profits
under the guise)

315
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,479
(of providing a love paradise
for women.)

316
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,319
Mr. Xu.

317

That article has been
shared 320,000 times.

334
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,920
What should we do about it?

335
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
Should I contact someone

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,119
to remove the article?

337
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,520
Contact the people you know.

338
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,239
But don't remove it.

339
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,319
Hype it up. Make it the hottest topic.

340
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,400
Make sure as many people
read it as possible.

341
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,079
But the article contains
a lot of criticism against us.

342
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,359
Won't that have a negative impact on us?

343
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,319
Worry not.

344
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm sure that Y4's "girlfriends"

345
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,599
are much more upset
at this matter than we are.

346
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,359
Let's wait and see.

347
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
All right.

348
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,199
Oh, right. Fire the chef.

349
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:00,959
Why?

350
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,040
Everyone else was served
the standard employee meal.

351
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,920
But he prepared a gourmet dish for me.

352
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,040
I do not need employees who attempt
to butter me up or read my thoughts.

353
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,199
Also,

354
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
the employees who didn't greet me.

355
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,239
The ones
that are sitting in that corner.

356
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,640
Fire them too.

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,640
I have an even lesser need for employees

358
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,800
who do not respect me.

359
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,520
Understood.

360
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,119
You won't see them tomorrow.

361
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,199
Not tomorrow.

362
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,680
Forever.

363
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160
Guan Qianya!

364
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,400
What the heck did you write?

365
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,880
Do you have a death wish?

366
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,239
I'm still alive, aren't I?

367
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,839
Why would you write something like this?

368
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,959
I made it clear in my article.

369
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,160
I want silly women like you

370
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,319
to wake up and see the clear picture.

371
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,959
Don't try to change the subject.

372
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,280
I know you.

373
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,959
Do you know

374
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,280
that Y4's fans are coming after you?

375
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,400
You'd better issue a formal apology!

376
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Or you might lose your life,

377
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,520
never mind your money!

378
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,319
Jiang Kele.

379
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,599
I can tell you're concerned about me.

380
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,560
I thought you were
so addicted to the game

381
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,599
that you had lost
the basic emotions of a human being.

382
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,199
Who cares about you?

383
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,079
Don't think too much into it.

384
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,640
Guan Qianya!

385
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,160
What?

386
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,359
Didn't the doctor warn you

387
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,199
that an overdose of sleeping pills
can cause you to get addicted?

388
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,520
And you just drank alcohol!

389
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,839
It works better with beer.

390
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,479
Should I be praising you, then?

391
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,719
What's with you?

392
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,680
What's the matter with you?

393
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,760
What's up with you?

394
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
What's the matter with you?

395
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,040
Is your zodiac a dog?

396
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,079
You hit me!

397
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,479
I'm taking this beer.

398
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,439
Drink some water.

399
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,959
I can't sleep without the pills.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,839
Then stay awake!

401
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,599
Should I sleep with you, then?

402
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,839
I don't want to sleep with you.

403
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,520
I'll sleep with you!

404
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,160
I'll sleep with you!

405
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,000
You're sleeping with me tonight!

406
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,839
I won't sleep with you! I...

407
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,160
You have to sleep with me tonight!

408
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,359
Qianya, sleep with me!

409
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,640
I don't want to sleep with you.

410
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,880
Oh, you!

411
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,950
(Yao Inc.)

412
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Hello? Guan Qianya?

413
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,599
You're done for, you know?

414
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,319
What?

415
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,000
Aren't you done lecturing me yet?

416
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,920
It's Y4's fans.

417
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,319
They're all camping downstairs!

418
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,800
They look really angry.

419
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm telling you,

420
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,560
don't come out today, understand?

421
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,319
Don't come out!

422
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,000
Guan Qianya!

423
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,599
Hold it right there!

424
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,640
Guan Qianya, come out and apologize!

425
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Guan Qianya, come out and apologize!

426
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,000
Guan Qianya, come out and apologize!

427
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
Guan Qianya, get out here!

428
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,959
Guan Qianya, apologize!

429
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,719
Ms. Guan, are you all right?

430
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,199
Of course, I am.

431
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,239
To the company.

432
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,160
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,239
Guan Qianya, come out and apologize!

434
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,800
Guan Qianya, come out and apologize!

435
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,239
Guan Qianya, come out!

436
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,359
Get out!

437
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,560
Who are you?

438
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,599
Girls!

439
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,359
I'm a fan of Lu Xiao too!

440
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,479
Are you here for Guan Qianya?

441
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,079
Yes.

442
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,920
That's the way to do it!
Camp till she comes out!

443
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,920
We got the wrong person.

444
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,599
She's not Guan Qianya.

445
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,479
Guan Qianya, you horrid woman!

447
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,280
Guan Qianya, you horrid woman!

448
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,920
Guan Qianya, apologize!

449
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't worry, Ms. Guan.
I've prepared for this.

450
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,760
Guan Qianya, apologize!

451
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,680
Guan Qianya, apologize!

452
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,920
(Guan Qianya, come out and apologize)
Guan Qianya, apologize!

453
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,199
Wait! That's Y4! We can't hit it!

454
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,319
Guan Qianya, apologize!

455
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,359
Kele's idea worked.

456
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,719
Apologize! We demand an apology!

457
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,959
Apologize, you horrid woman!

458
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280
Ms. Guan.

459
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,479
Ms. Guan.

460
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,800
We're going to go directly up against Y4

461
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,920
just like this?

462
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,719
Yes.

463
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,359
It's a matter of life and death
for our company.

464
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,079
All of you must be prepared.

465
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
Understand?

466
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,319
Are you all right?

467
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,439
I'm fine, Ms. Guan.

468
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,119
But I'm very upset

469
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,280
about what happened today!

470
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,680
They were throwing things.

471
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,319
But what were they using?

472
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,560
Eggs!

473
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
But what are eggs?

474
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,680
Eggs are food!

475
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Yet, in this world,

476
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
there are so many people
who are starving.

477
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:37,920
Am I right?

478
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,920
Network department,

479
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,239
you must be sure
to use this against them online!

480
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,839
Who knew that I, Jiang Kele,

481
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,400
would be able to protect Guan Qianye?

482
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,560
It's already two o'clock.

483
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,680
I think I have to quit my job
at the cosmetic shop.

484
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,400
Otherwise,
I won't even have time for lunch.

485
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,520
No, I have to work.

486
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,520
I don't mind losing my job
at the cosmetic shop,

487
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,560
but it will be a real shame
if I lose this job that pays so well.

488
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,400
Guan Qianya, apologize!

489
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,719
(Guan Qianya, go die)
Guan Qianya, get out here!

490
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,560
Guan Qianya, get out here!

491
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,599
Ms. Guan.

492
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,479
(Crush On Love)
Updates on the new investor.

493
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,160
There'll be a meeting today
at 4pm in the company.

494
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,119
No.

495
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,599
We'll have the meeting elsewhere.
Arrange for dinner.

496
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,760
(Crush On Love)
Who would dare invest in us

497
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,319
if they see the scene outside?

498
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
Understood. I'll make the arrangements.

499
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,920
Guan Qianya, apologize!

500
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,719
Guan Qianya, apologize!

501
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,040
It's another wonderful day.

502
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,160
I've finally finished all my work.

503
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,560
I should have something good for dinner

504
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,839
to reward myself.

505
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,119
Where's my Malatang?
[*A spicy hot pot dish]

506
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,959
Oh, no.

507
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,239
Someone's back.

508
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,319
Oh, no.

509
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,800
Oh, no.

510
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,880
Jiang Kele.

511
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,359
You screwed up
on your second day of work.

512
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,760
If you get caught,

513
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,640
don't worry.

514
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,479
Place a coin

515
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,760
into the piggy on the bookshelves,

516
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,040
and you'll have a place to hide.

517
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,119
Piggy!

518
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,520
Piggy!

519
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,439
Piggy.

520
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
Piggy!

521
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,959
I'm exhausted.

522
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
You slacked off today.

523
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,800
You don't get to say you're tired.

524
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,040
Do you think you did right to our dad...

525
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,880
No. To Mr. Xu?

526
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,800
Did you say

527
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,400
Mr. Xu's our dad?

528
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,319
You're such a good son.

529
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,239
Who cares what I call him?

530
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,079
Mr. Xu

531
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,959
is like a dad to us.

532
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
By that logic,

533
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Lei Na's our mom then.

534
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,439
Stop talking.

535
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,000
Or else I won't let you win tonight.

536
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,079
Su Lie, I got a question for you.

537
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,640
I'm the one who always lets you win,

538
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,119
am I not?

539
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,680
I'll hit you.

540
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,000
Look.

541
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,680
There's something over here.

542
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,880
You picked it up from the floor.

543
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,119
It must be trash.

544
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,880
But don't you think

545
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,280
this thing smells strange?

546
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,359
Why don't we open it up and take a look?

547
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,079
It's junk food.

548
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,479
Mr. Xu said

549
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,280
that junk food is high in salt
and fat content.

550
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,599
It's bad for our health.

551
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,640
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu...
You bring him up every day.

552
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,800
Aren't you guys tired
of just eating healthy food?

553
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,359
Don't you want to try something new?

554
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,839
Why don't we just take a look
and get rid of it?

555
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,119
I don't care.

556
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,839
I want to eat it.

557
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,640
You can't eat it.

558
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,640
Three guys?

559
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,560
That's strange.

560
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,040
I thought a family lives here.

561
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,560
Is their mother no longer here?

562
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
But their voices sound familiar somehow.

563
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,479
You ate it!

564
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,560
What does it taste like?

565
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,800
Like my tongue was burned.

566
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,800
Like there are
a thousand ants on my lips.

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,199
It's not poisonous, is it?

568
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:28,959
It's not.

569
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,319
It's delicious!

570
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,280
Let me try some.

571
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,160
I remember seeing this
in an old documentary.

572
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,640
It's a pain sensation
produced by chili and pepper.

573
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,520
It's called numbing spice.

574
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,040
Why would they call

575
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,359
something so delicious as junk food?

576
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
Maybe it's because it's so good

577
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,599
that you'll get addicted.

578
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,119
That's why they call it junk food.

579
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,359
Slow down.

580
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,319
Hey, hold on.

581
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm good. I don't want it anymore.

582
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,280
Stop.

583
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,680
Who are you?

584
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,760
Turn around.

585
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:26,920
Turn around.

586
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,239
