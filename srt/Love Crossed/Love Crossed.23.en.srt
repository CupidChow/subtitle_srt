1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:03,200
Who stole your phone?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,519
Do you want me to call the police?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,960
No, I can take care of it.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,760
Please pour me a glass of wine.

5
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:10,920
Okay.

6
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,560
Eventually, we will stand
on the opposite sides

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,360
and there'll not be a happy ending
for us.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,680
Let's

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,119
break up.

10
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,812
=Love Crossed=

11
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:49,730
=Episode 23=

12
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,080
Go to Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

13
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,479
Follow her.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,279
Boss.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,119
Guan Qianya just came out of a bar.

16
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,919
She's acting strange
like she's a little tipsy.

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,720
She's taking a cab.

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,119
Not sure where to.

19
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,679
Zhang Yang, look.

20
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,839
She probably knew
that you were following her

21
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,639
and trying to throw your off the scent.

22
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,440
Follow her closely. Be careful.

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
Got it.

24
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,399
Hello, Boss.

25
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,559
What's the situation?

26
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,360
She just got off the car.

27
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,119
Where?

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,839
By the roadside near the subway station.

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,479
She took a cab
and now she's changing to the subway?

30
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,240
What is she up to?

31
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,839
She's throwing up.

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
Drinking early in the morning.

33
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,320
She went to different bars

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,240
and finally threw up after drinking.

35
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,600
I think I've overestimated her.

36
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,119
She's useless now.

37
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,559
Should we keep an eye on her, still?

38
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,240
Stop following her.

39
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,559
Compared with her,

40
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,679
I'm more worried about my aunt
who's a lot harder to read.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,199
What's my aunt up to now?

42
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,800
I've sent someone to keep an eye on her.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,399
She's been home all day
and hasn't gone out.

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,199
Just go.

45
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,880
Why would someone be watching me?

46
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,279
Did Xu Guanghan find something?

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Jiang Kele.

48
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,720
Are you holding something against me?

49
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,160
Why would I?

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm just a commoner,

51
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,399
and your dad writes my paycheck.

52
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,320
I wouldn't dare.

53
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,119
Xu Nian.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
It's the data collection time.

55
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,760
Okay. Go on.

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,559
Why aren't you coming?

57
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,839
Of course not.

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
His status is different now.

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,959
Why?

60
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,399
Because he's Xu Guanghan's son.

61
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,000
Knock it off, Jiang Kele.

62
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,959
How could he possibly be his son?

63
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm not kidding.

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
Ask him if you don't believe me.

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,760
Is it true?

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
I always thought

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,679
Su Lie should be Mr. Xu's son.

68
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,320
Can I still call Mr. Xu "dad"?

69
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,279
Ask your brother.

70
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,440
Kele.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,239
All right. That's enough.

72
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,799
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,880
I stuck up for him last night.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,959
He looks completely fine now.

75
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,279
Seeing him really gets up my nose.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Xu Nian.

77
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,399
Don't take it to heart.

78
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:42,839
Let's go.

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,279
Your thief, give me back my phone!

80
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,760
Mr. Xu, you're here.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,480
Why is it only the three of them?
Where's Xu Nian?

82
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Xu Nian

83
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,320
has already achieved 100 percent

84
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,559
and completed his task.

85
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,720
So he doesn't have to come.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
At this time,

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
you left Xu Nian all by himself.

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,799
Don't you find it weird?

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,480
Xu Nian isn't alone.

90
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,440
Jiang Kele is in Bay House too.

91
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,559
Is Jiang Kele one of us?

92
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,160
I'll get Xu Nian here right away.

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
- Don't move.
- Let's go.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
Not only you betrayed me,

96
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,839
you even stole my phone

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,679
to get the evidence for your dad, right?

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,640
What a good son, Xu Nian.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,839
Hear me out. Calm down.

100
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,640
I'm very calm now.

101
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,640
If it wasn't to steal my phone,

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,480
you wouldn't be bothered
to break up with me in person, right?

103
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,279
What a jerk.

104
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,119
Hear me out!

105
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,880
Look.

106
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,519
Did anyone follow you

107
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,559
when you came in
from the secret passage?

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,600
It's none of your business!

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,359
Give me back my phone!

110
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,359
Did anyone follow you?

111
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't know. I guess not.

112
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:40,399
Let's go.

113
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,359
Return my phone and I'll leave.

114
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,519
I can't do that just yet.

115
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,920
But I promise you

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,880
after all of us get out here tonight,

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,440
I'll explain everything to you.

118
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,839
All of you?

119
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,239
Yes, all of us.

120
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,239
She took a cab, and then the subway.

121
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,959
What was she up to?

122
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,839
Turn around.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,480
Okay.

124
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,880
Xu Nian?

125
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,359
Xu Nian?

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Check the front exit.

127
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,679
Okay.

128
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,719
Xu Nian, are you in there?

129
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,359
Xu Nian?

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,119
Xu Nian?

131
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,320
Why isn't he here?

132
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,960
Jiang Kele!

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,039
Jiang Kele!

134
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Jiang Kele!

135
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,719
I'm here, Lei Na.

136
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,039
Have you seen Xu Nian?

137
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,200
Xu Nian?

138
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,320
Where he goes

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
is not under our control now.

140
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,359
What does that mean?

141
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,479
What does that mean?

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Xu Nian is Xu Guanghan's son.

143
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,520
How did you know?

144
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,400
This is huge.

145
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,679
The entire Bay House knows.

146
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,679
Don't you know?

147
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,559
When someone asked you that question,

148
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,760
it means they already knew.

149
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,679
Well, I'm sure you don't know

150
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,799
some of the things that I know.

151
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,039
What else do you know?

152
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,280
Xu Nian is a jerk.

153
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
How so?

154
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,400
Jiang Kele.

155
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,520
Mind your words.

156
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,840
If you think I talk too much,

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
ask your dad to find a new janitor.

158
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
What did you do to her?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,840
Why did she call you a jerk?

160
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,280
She's been holding grudges

161
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
about the sweater incident.

162
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,479
Why are you here?

163
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,719
Mr. Xu wants to see you.

164
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,159
Get moving. Your dad wants to see you.

165
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,679
Let's go.

166
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,359
Mr. Xu, he's here.

167
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,840
Mr. Xu, anything?

168
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,520
Here. Take a look.

169
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,559
You used to be in that place
and be controlled

170
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,159
for data collection.

171
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Now you're looking at this
from another angle.

172
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,679
How does that feel?

173
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,520
What are you trying to say?

174
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,559
You're different from them
since you were born.

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,119
After so many years of training,

176
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
you've completed the task.

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,719
As long as you wanted it,

178
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,400
this could all be yours.

179
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,559
Of course.

180
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,599
That includes the freedom
of your three best friends.

181
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,719
You must have known,

182
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,640
even after they complete the task,

183
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
there's no way

184
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,919
I'm going to let them leave.

185
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,200
What do you need me to do?

186
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,119
I need you to stand by my side

187
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,000
as my son

188
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,760
and never betray me.

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,679
Tell me everything you know

190
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,239
including the evidence

191
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,119
and your connection out there.

192
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,119
Give me some time.

193
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,239
I'll think about it.

194
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,000
Time is precious.

195
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,880
Don't take too long.

196
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,749
(Please do not follow
the dangerous activities.)

197
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,440
Hear me out!

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,799
Look.

199
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,479
Did anyone follow you

200
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,559
when you came in
from the secret passage?

201
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,400
It's none of your business!

202
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Give me back my phone!

203
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,520
I can't do that just yet.

204
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,960
But I promise you

205
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,880
after all of us get out here,

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
I'll explain everything to you.

207
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,119
(Xu Nian is going to get them
out of here tonight.)

208
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,479
(Why did he break up with me then?)

209
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,919
(Is he having some difficulties?)

210
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,960
Who are you?

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,919
I was the one who saved you earlier.

212
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,919
Didn't you know
you were being followed?

213
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Who were they?

214
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,039
Isn't it obvious?
Of course, it's Xu Guanghan's men.

215
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,280
Why did you help me then?

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm a friend of Jiang Kele.

217
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,719
I am the one

218
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,159
who introduced her to this job.

219
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,359
So you're Grandma Fushun?

220
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,000
Just call me Fushun.

221
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay. Thank you.

222
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,919
May I know

223
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,359
if you gave Xu Nian the phone?

224
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,239
Actually, you don't have
to be on your guard against me.

225
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,880
You have to trust me.

226
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:03,559
I was the one who dug up
this secret passage.

227
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,039
How did you do that?

228
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,679
First of all, I'm Xu Guanghan's aunt.

229
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,919
I was the project manager

230
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,080
when Bay House was built.

231
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,039
After that, I became the housekeeper.

232
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,640
When Bay House was built,

233
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,719
I secretly

234
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,440
kept this secret passage.

235
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,919
I took care of the phone situation.

236
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,679
But I was being followed.

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
So I was thinking

238
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,080
Xu Guanghan must be up to something.

239
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,599
So I came here.

240
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,119
But I ran into you instead.

241
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,919
So we share a common goal?

242
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,440
You, too, want those four guys

243
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,200
to escape Bay House?

244
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm just curious.

245
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,359
Why would a smart girl like you

246
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,280
become good friends with Jiang Kele?

247
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
A smart granny like you

248
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,359
became friends with her too, isn't it?

249
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,679
My name is Fushun.

250
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,840
Okay.

251
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,719
A smart lady like me

252
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,400
must have my ulterior motive
for making friends with her.

253
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,719
So you had Kele work in Bay House

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,479
and led Kele

255
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,840
into discovering Lu Xiao's background

256
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,640
to serve as a wake-up call for Lu Xiao

257
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,799
and get everyone out of there?

258
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,320
Bingo!

259
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,359
You got it all right.

260
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
I just love talking

261
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,119
to smart people.

262
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,200
It's so easy.

263
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,559
But I never thought

264
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
you could make Xu Nian
come round to it.

265
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,960
So I would like to know

266
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,359
if you have any plans with him.

267
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,200
Things are a little complicated now.

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,599
But I think they'll leave this place
soon enough.

269
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,440
No problem.

270
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,719
Come to me if you need my help.

271
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,960
Fushun.

272
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,507
(Level of Completion, Luo Ke 100%,
Lu Xiao 100%, Xu Nian 100%, Su Lie 100%)

273
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,719
It's finally completed.

274
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,960
I've worked on this project
for eight years.

275
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,520
How many eight years does a person have?

276
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,280
From now on,

277
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,119
there'll be countless eight years.

278
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,239
Mr. Xu, are you really planning
to train Xu Nian

279
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,479
and make him your successor
in the future?

280
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,239
This isn't completely up to me.

281
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,559
It depends on him.

282
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,559
If he's loyal to me,

283
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,039
I'll give everything to him.

284
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,679
What if he lets you down?

285
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,280
Then he is just like everyone else
to me.

286
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,119
I'll make them disappear together.

287
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,359
But you have just reunited with him.

288
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,880
Now do you understand

289
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,320
the sacrifice I made for this world?

290
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,640
I hope you can treat yourself better
in the future.

291
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
I hope you can talk less in the future.

292
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,300
(Level of Completion, Luo Ke 100%,
Lu Xiao 100%, Xu Nian 100%, Su Lie 100%)

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,239
Let's make a move tonight.

294
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,359
Tonight?

295
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,520
Do you have a plan?

296
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,599
Let's bring Luo Ke and Su Lie around.

297
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,160
Then we'll contact Qianya
once we get out.

298
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,599
Contact Qianya?

299
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,239
Will she believe you?

300
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,839
I've thought about that too.

301
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,040
But I think

302
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,959
if we can get out of here,

303
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,199
Qianya will surely understand.

304
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:48,880
Okay.

305
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,719
But what I'm worried about the most

306
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,839
are Su Lie and Luo Ke.

307
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,439
We can't tell them the truth.

308
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,959
So we have to trick them
into going out

309
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,640
and tell them everything after that.

310
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,959
You're right.

311
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,760
But...

312
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,119
What if they still refuse to go out

313
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,719
even after we tricked them?

314
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,640
Let's drag them out then.

315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,599
By the way,

316
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,959
I think Jiang Kele

317
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,599
has a big misunderstanding with me.

318
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,959
Please help me out.

319
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,680
Convince Jiang Kele
to pass a message to Qianya.

320
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,719
Okay, no problem.

321
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,400
Lu Xiao.

322
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
You must be tired after the sauna.

323
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,959
Drink some water.

324
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,760
You're still here.

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sorry.

326
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,959
I didn't bring extra.
You'll just have to endure the thirst.

327
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,319
By the way, you don't have anything
on your schedule today.

328
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,040
What were you doing with Lu Xiao?

329
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:54,640
Look.

330
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Don't think about driving a wedge
between us.

331
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,839
Your silence

332
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,479
will not protect you!

333
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,359
To escape is shameful and useless!

334
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Kele.

335
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,479
I have something to tell you.

336
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,280
Wait.

337
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,680
Did he talk you

338
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,000
into breaking up with me?

339
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,880
It has nothing to do with that.

340
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,439
You scared me.

341
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:20,199
That's great. Tell me.

342
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,439
As soon as you get off work,
go to Guan Qianya right away.

343
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,119
Make sure your phone is reachable.

344
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,359
I'll contact you tonight.

345
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,719
You want me to find Qianya after work

346
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,680
and make sure my phone is reachable.

347
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,119
Do you want to get in touch with Qianya?

348
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,239
Xu Nian?

349
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,640
Impossible!

350
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,160
I won't help him.

351
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,280
He broke up with her,

352
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,839
and he's trying to get in touch
with her now?

353
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,079
Tell him to do it himself.

354
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,920
The secret passage isn't sealed.

355
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,239
Oh, right. He doesn't need
to use the secret passage now.

356
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,680
He could have just asked his dad
to send him there.

357
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
Kele, I think you've misunderstood him.

358
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,599
He has his own reasons.

359
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
Help me out.

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,520
You'll find out why tonight.

361
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,199
He has his own reason?

362
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,280
All right then.

363
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,280
I'll help him one last time then.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,239
Okay.

365
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,079
Hold on.

366
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,719
Will you break up with me?

367
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,439
How's that possible?

368
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,839
My goodness.

369
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,959
Why did you keep following me?

370
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,160
I'm just doing

371
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,319
what Lu Xiao told me to.

372
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
Why did he ask you to do that?

373
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,479
It's a secret. You'll find out tonight.

374
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:17,239
Xu Nian wants to use your phone
to contact me.

375
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
You guessed it all by yourself.

376
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,599
Don't blame me
when there are no surprises tonight.

377
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,439
He could have just
sneaked out the place.

378
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,319
But he insisted on reaching me
via the phone.

379
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,160
Who knows? It's quite mysterious.

380
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,479
Give me your phone.

381
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh, no.

382
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,680
I left it in Bay House.

383
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,760
I didn't bring it back!

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,880
What do I do?

385
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
Look

386
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,680
how nervous you are.

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
Just pulling your leg. It's with me.

388
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
Give it to me.

389
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,199
Sure.

390
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,800
I don't have it.

391
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,680
Are you serious?

392
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,920
Jiang Kele!

393
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,599
Where's my phone?

394
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Where is it?

395
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,560
Where is it?

396
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,560
I was just messing with you.

397
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,079
I have it with me.

398
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,520
Okay, I'm giving it to you now.

399
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,479
What are you doing?

400
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:14,719
Give it to me.

401
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,800
Stop fighting.

402
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,520
I just wanted to cheer you up.

403
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,160
So? It doesn't feel

404
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,839
like a long wait now, isn't it?

405
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,479
All thanks to you.

406
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,560
You're welcome.

407
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm on it. I'll go first.

408
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,839
Hurry. I'll serve the dish first.

409
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,560
I'll serve the dish.

410
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,479
Me first.

411
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,479
Cut it for me.

412
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,319
Hurry up.

413
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,719
There are eight seconds left.

414
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,560
Hurry. Give it to me.

415
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,719
Why did you turn it off?

416
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,239
I have something important to tell you.

417
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,239
What's so important

418
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,079
that you can do it after the game?

419
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,280
We were about to level up.

420
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,119
Hear me out first.

421
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,239
No, it's so annoying!

422
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,119
Xu Nian, turn it on now.

423
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:45,719
Play a round with us.

424
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,719
We'll listen to you if you win.

425
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,400
No, I...

426
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,160
Given his skills,

427
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
it's not that easy for him to defeat us.

428
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,319
It might not be easy for him.

429
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,640
But to me, it's a piece of cake.

430
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,439
Who will go first?

431
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,719
Xu Nian, you wanted
to ask us something, right?

432
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,760
Ask away.

433
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,239
Do you find it boring

434
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,079
to stay in Bay House all day

435
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,920
and just play games?

436
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,040
Want to go out to have some fun?

437
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
We...

438
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,040
If you do,

439
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,319
I'll take you out tonight.

440
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,640
I know.

441
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,319
You've never been out there,

442
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
and you're worried about Mr. Xu.

443
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,199
We can finally go out!

444
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,199
Even if he breaks my legs,

445
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,439
I'm going out tonight!

446
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,239
That's right.

447
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,400
We'll leave at nine.

448
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,359
Nine?

449
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,479
Why so late?

450
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,959
No, it's dangerous to leave now.

451
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,479
But where do we go to have fun
so late at night?

452
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,239
Of course, the bar.

453
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,719
Bar?

454
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,560
Let's dress up.

455
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,319
Let's go.

456
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,839
It's too homey. You're going to a bar.

457
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,400
Do you think it's bedtime?

458
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,280
It's nine already.
Are you not ready yet?

459
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Almost there.

460
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,079
Almost there.

461
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,640
How long?

462
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,359
An hour.

463
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,160
I'll give you one more minute.

464
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,199
That will do.

465
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,160
59.

466
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:55,079
58.

467
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,560
5...

468
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,280
Stop it.

469
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,280
Let's go.

470
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,280
We're coming.

471
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,239
Stop.

472
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,719
My hair is all messy now.

473
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,880
It took me so long to style my hair.

474
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,239
You ruined it.

475
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,400
And this.

476
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,199
Take it.

477
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,160
Why do we have to wear a mask?

478
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
Why does it seem so troublesome?

479
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,199
Let's go.

480
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
Why do we have to wear a cap?

481
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,280
Let's go.

482
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,359
What is it?

483
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,359
This way, please.

484
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,640
No, go this way.

485
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,160
Wow.

486
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,920
There's a secret switch.

487
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,239
When did you find out?

488
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,280
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,199
Keep your voice down.

490
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,319
Have you been going out

491
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,439
and have fun

492
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,719
behind our back?

493
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,520
So this isn't your first time

494
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,479
going to a bar.

495
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,439
Shut up.

496
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,680
Get moving.

497
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:18,920
Let's go.

498
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,079
Why is the outside world so dark?

499
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,800
Lu Xiao, did you remove the lights?

500
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:36,520
Yes.

501
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,920
It's so scary.

502
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:38,920
It's fine.

503
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
We're not there yet.
There's another passage to go.

504
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,000
A passage?

505
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:44,959
A passage?

506
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Luo Ke!

507
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,719
Get moving. Stop dilly-dallying.

508
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:55,119
Who pushed me?

509
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,959
Be careful!

510
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,119
Why is there a slide?

511
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,560
My clothes are dirty.

512
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,439
Which way to go? It's so dark.

513
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,439
Come with me.

514
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,880
Be careful. It's dark here.

515
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,560
Xu Nian, where did you get a phone?

516
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,920
That's right.

517
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,199
Wasn't your phone confiscated?

518
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,839
Why do you have so many questions?

519
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:46,959
I know.

520
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,880
Mr. Xu is his dad.

521
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,560
I'm sure Mr. Xu gave it to him.

522
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,280
Xu Nian, can you tell Mr. Xu

523
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,760
to give us a phone too?

524
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,079
Don't worry. You'll get one soon.

525
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,079
Put on your cap.

526
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,479
Okay.

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:20,861
