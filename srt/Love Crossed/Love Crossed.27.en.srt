1
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:04,400
Qianya.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,520
Why are you here?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,880
I am here to pick you up.

4
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,560
It's all right now.
Everything will pass.

5
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,040
Why do you sound so sentimental?

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,279
It's just bankruptcy.

7
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
Qianya.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Actually,

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,360
you don't have to be tough
in front of me.

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,879
When it happened for real,

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,400
I thought it wasn't a big deal.

12
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,000
Since my first day of venture,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
I have thought about various endings.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
Bankruptcy is one of them.

15
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,400
But the company went bankrupt

16
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,000
because of us.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,480
Xu Nian, what are you talking about?

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,559
This is my choice.

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,120
I'll take responsibility
for my own choices.

20
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,319
My company may have closed down,

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,040
and I've lost my assets.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,480
But the four of you are free now.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,080
As long as the four of you

24
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,160
live well in the real world,

25
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,680
there's no regret now.

26
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,080
Losing everything

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,919
might be a good start too.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,800
What's your plan?

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,279
I'll do it with you.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,199
The future seems so far away.

31
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,480
I don't want to think about it.

32
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,360
All I want is to loosen myself up.

33
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,000
Loosen up?

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,800
Come on. I'll take you to a place.

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,240
=Love Crossed=

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,380
=Episode 27=

37
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,240
What do you think?

38
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,080
I bet you haven't been here
for a long time.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
My father took me here when I was a kid.

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,000
But I haven't been here ever since.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,559
It's better when I was a kid.

42
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,679
It was so carefree.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,720
I'll take you back
to your childhood time

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
and let loose.

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,360
Come on.

So? Have you loosened yourself up?

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,959
There's one more thing left,

63
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,839
and I'll be able
to forget all my trouble.

64
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,119
One more thing?

65
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,720
Let's get it done then.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,839
The only thing left is to get wasted.

67
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
Cui Hengzhi.

68
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,480
What are you doing here?

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,559
Well... I...

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,160
I was just passing by.

71
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,359
You just happened to pass by?

72
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,799
Actually, I have something
to say to you.

73
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,640
My company has closed down.

74
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,720
Lately, I've experienced

75
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
some ups and downs in life.

76
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,640
It made me realize a lot of things.

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,399
I have neglected you back then.

78
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,799
I only made you drink hot water
when you were sick,

79
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,119
and I worked overtime
even during holidays.

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
I don't even know

81
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
what you like to eat or drink.

82
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,880
I always thought

83
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,600
that marriage

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,480
doesn't require much work

85
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,959
or effort

86
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,119
as long as one stays faithful.

87
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
In other words,

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
what I'm trying to say

89
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,760
is that I don't blame you
for the divorce.

90
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,559
I lost.

91
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,399
I lost to the game.

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,839
I lost for not giving you
the time of the day.

93
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,399
Yes, you lost.

94
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
You don't have the looks,
nor are you considerate,

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,359
romantic, and gentle like other guys.

96
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,239
You're nothing like the others!

97
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,679
I wish you all the happiness.

98
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,239
But you're the most important one!

99
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
About our divorce,

100
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm partly responsible too.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,359
That game

102
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,239
satisfies all my fantasies about love.

103
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,720
But in real life,

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,480
love is not just
about chocolates and flowers.

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,920
There are also trivial things
like life's daily necessities.

106
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,119
After all, games aren't real

107
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,320
and cannot replace reality,

108
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,720
let alone you.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Are you hungry?

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
No.

111
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,519
I am.

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,119
What would you like to eat?

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
My treat.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,160
I can't ask you to treat me
since you're unemployed.

115
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:00,920
It's fine.

116
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,679
It's what men should do.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,640
So you want to talk
about gender equality?

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Let's pay our own bill.

119
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,880
Pay our own bill?

120
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,119
That's a pretty good idea.

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
This place is nothing
like the Bay House.

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,160
But I hope you don't mind.

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,799
Things will only get worse for us

124
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,320
after this.

125
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,079
It's all right.

126
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,880
I'd experienced

127
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,359
all sorts of things when I was a kid.

128
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,119
I even slept on the streets.

129
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
I'm an adaptable person.

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Don't worry about me.

131
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,760
Really?

132
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,280
Well, that makes us
quite a perfect match.

133
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,440
I'd been through a lot too.

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,719
I remember

135
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,719
working six jobs at a time.

136
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,479
Actually, it's not too bad.

137
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,479
I still have my job
at the cosmetic shop.

138
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll find a few more jobs tomorrow.

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,760
Don't worry.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,359
Things will get better for us.

141
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,280
Kele.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,479
I don't want you

143
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,719
to work so hard.

144
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,520
So I plan to find a job tomorrow.

145
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's do this together.

146
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,599
Sure!

147
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,280
But I don't know
what kind of job is right for me.

148
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,719
No, I can think of a few.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Look, you're good at the piano.

150
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,039
You can be a piano teacher.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,479
Can I really do it?

152
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,159
Of course.

153
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,400
My Lu Xiao is handsome

154
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,719
and good at playing the piano.

155
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,799
Mr. Lu Xiao, teach me.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,760
Mr. Lu Xiao.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,960
Relax.

158
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,280
Do, do, so, so, la, la, so.

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Salad again?

160
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,599
And you are having a good meal yourself.

161
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
First of all,

162
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,559
you have been taking healthy food

163
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,080
for years now.

164
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,640
You can't just eat any food outside.

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,400
It's bad for your stomach. Got it?

166
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,919
Grandma Fushun, we're perfectly healthy.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,039
Jiang Kele has bought us

168
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,440
sour and spicy noodles many times.

169
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,080
We're used to it.

170
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,520
You're not young anymore.

171
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
You have a weak stomach.

172
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
You shouldn't take spicy food.

173
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,039
Why don't we exchange our food?

174
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,280
You're being so picky
when I had the food prepared for you.

175
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,559
I watched you grow up.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,080
You two are all take and no give!

177
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,640
Why are you scolding me?
I didn't even say anything.

178
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,000
Grandma.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,200
We're not like that.

180
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,520
We just have nothing to do.

181
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,719
Haven't you guys

182
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,479
thought about going out
to do something?

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,599
Why do we have to think about that?

184
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,359
Because everyone in the outside world

185
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,119
has their own jobs.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,119
Also,

187
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:10,719
everyone works hard to make a living,

188
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,799
live the life they want

189
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,000
and enjoy their favourite food.

190
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,799
I never thought about that.

191
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm not sure about Su Lie.

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Besides,

193
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,119
I never thought of getting out.

194
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,239
They forced us to leave.

195
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,919
There is something I want to do.

196
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,919
Return to Bay House.

197
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
We can eat and play

198
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,159
without having to work.

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,760
I can't talk with you anymore.

200
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,840
Not even for a second.

201
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,320
You always scold us whenever we talk.

202
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
It's us who don't want to speak to you.

203
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
Grandma Fushun.

204
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Why don't you give us some money

205
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
so that we can go out and have some fun?

206
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,159
Great.

207
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,119
Let me tell you something
in a calm manner.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
You know what?

209
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,559
Out there,

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,200
everyone has to pay their way.

211
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,520
Nothing is free.

212
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,320
You have to work to earn some money.

213
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,119
Fine, don't give us then.

214
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,239
Stop preaching.

215
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,159
I'm full already.

216
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,840
Bye, Grandma Fushun.

217
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,520
Wait.

218
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,719
You want money, right?

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,559
Here.

220
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,599
Here.

221
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,640
Go and earn it yourself.

222
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,719
If you can do it,
you'll have my respect.

223
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,679
If not,

224
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,559
I'll throw up on you.

225
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,359
How are these two going to survive?

226
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,719
Qianya.

227
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,200
I would like to know

228
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,599
why you love drinking that much?

229
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,239
Well,

230
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,840
alcohol can magnify
the intensity of our emotions.

231
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
When you're happy,

232
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,799
drinking can make you happier.

233
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, if I'm sad,

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,640
doesn't it make me feel worse?

235
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:40,320
No, when you're sad,

236
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,440
drinking makes you
forget all your troubles.

237
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,039
I often drink with Kele.

238
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,559
When you broke up with me,

239
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,719
I pulled it through by drinking.

240
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,880
When you get drunk,
you'll stop thinking.

241
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,479
But no matter how drunk you get,
you'll still sober up.

242
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,840
But at least, you're happy now.

243
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,119
Leave the troubles for tomorrow.

244
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,039
Here, let's drink.

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,080

Su Lie.

272
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,080
(Malatang)
Isn't that the one we wanted to have?

273
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,479
It dropped because we ran too fast.

274
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,239
But we have no money.
How are we going to eat it?

275
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,520
Screw it. We'll figure it out.

276
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,559
Okay.

277
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
Excuse me, we would like to order.

278
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,559

Thank you, sir.

285
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,760

This is the taste.

288
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,000
May I know if you're Luo Ke and Su Lie?

289
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,319
What is it?

290
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,199
Goodness, it's really you.

291
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,079
Can we take pictures together?

292
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Help us take some pictures.

293
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,680
Done.

294
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,880
Okay, thank you.

295
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

296
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,119
Take a look.

297
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
Here it comes.

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,560
You two are so popular.

299
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,920
Are you celebrities?

300
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,439
I'm Luo Ke of Love Boys.

301
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I'm Su Lie.

302
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,560
That reminds me.

303
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
I saw you on TV

304
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,040
two days ago.

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,239
So you really did come out.

306
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,599
Of course.

307
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Sir, since you know us,

308
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,520
why don't you treat us?

309
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,280
That's right.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,079
We just got out and we have no money.

311
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
No way.
It's a small business I have here.

312
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
You can't dine and dash.

313
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,719
This is Malatang.

314
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,199
Why did you say it's dine and dash?

315
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,119
Not paying is what it means!

316
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,599
What are you talking about?

317
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,599
I'm not following you.

318
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,439
Keep messing with me,

319
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,640
and I'll kick your arse!

320
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,439
If you hit him,

321
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,280
I won't go easy on you.

322
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,000
Stop!

323
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,880
Who are you?

324
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,599
Spare them. I'll pay.

325
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Be careful.

326
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,640
They are back.

327
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,079
Be careful.

328
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,560
Qianya.

329
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,000
Why are you back so late?

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,599
Be careful.

331
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,920
Keep your feet.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,719
Kele.

333
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,079
Sorry, I broke my promise.

334
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
I said I would support you financially.

335
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,119
But my company has gone bankrupt,
and I couldn't support you.

336
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,439
It's fine, Qianya.

337
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,400
I can work and support you.

338
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
You have me, right?

339
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,920
Well, let's go to bed now.

340
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,280
All right?

341
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,560
No.

342
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,920
Let's drink in the room then.

343
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
All right. Let's go.

344
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,079
Be careful.

345
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,560
Walk in a straight line!

346
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,560
I'll pour you a drink.

347
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,199
How are you feeling?

348
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,400
Have you been recovered?

349
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,119
I'm all good now.

350
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,280
That's great.

351
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,959
Lu Xiao.

352
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,760
Don't you feel

353
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,119
like the world has become
an unfamiliar place

354
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,520
since we've been out?

355
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,560
The world has always been that

356
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,680
for us.

357
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,800
We have to start from scratch.

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I've thought about it.

359
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,040
I will look for a job tomorrow.

360
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,119
Do you have any plans?

361
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,000
I haven't thought about it.

362
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,800
Qianya isn't in a good place lately.

363
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,359
She has suffered
such a huge blow lately.

364
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,400
She might seem calm

365
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,439
as if nothing had happened.

366
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,400
But deep in her heart,

367
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,280
she must be suffering.

368
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,479
So I want to keep her company.

369
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,479
Both of them

370
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,239
got us out from Bay House.

371
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,520
It's time we protect them.

372
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,079
Not only them.

373
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,040
Luo Ke and Su Lie as well.

374
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,439
After all,
they didn't leave voluntarily.

375
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,119
I bet they'd take longer time

376
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,599
to adapt to this world than us.

377
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,040
They'll need our help.

378
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,000
So we have to work harder.

379
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,319
Get me a glass of water!

380
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,479
You can make Qianya
a glass of honey water.

381
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,040
Who are you?

382
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Why did you take us here to eat?

383
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,719
Given your status,

384
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,359
how can you be eating street food?

385
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,680
Such an environment

386
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
and dishes could suit you better.

387
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,959
We have no money to pay for it.

388
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,760
Or you'll say we dine and dash again.

389
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,319
Don't worry.

390
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,599
Eat all you want.
You can add on if it's not enough.

391
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,160
It's my treat.

392
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,119
But why are you being so nice to us?

393
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,359
Because you've run into a good guy.

394
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,599
Allow me to introduce myself.

395
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,599
I'm the manager of Follow Entertainment
in Greater China.

396
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,347
(Wang Chao, General Manager
of Greater China)

397
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,959
Our company is good

398
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,040
at celebrity and idol branding.

399
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,760
We are involved in many fields,

400
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,880
such as music, variety shows, and performances.

401
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,439
What are you saying?

402
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,959
I don't understand a word.

403
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,400
Simply put,

404
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,079
I can make sure

405
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
that you'll live a worry-free life,
have a promising future,

406
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,160
and make a lot of money.

407
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,599
What do we have to do?

408
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,599
First, you have to sign a contract.

409
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,160
After that,

410
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,719
just do what you're good at,

411
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,560
which is to sing and dance.

412
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
As easy as that.

413
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,160
A contract? What contract?

414
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,920
Are you going to hold us captive?

415
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't worry.

416
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,920
You have all the freedom.

417
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,880
Besides singing, dancing and filming,

418
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
you can go wherever you want

419
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,719
after work.

420
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
By the way, I can hire bodyguards

421
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,640
and assistants for you.

422
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,439
You'll get to drive luxury cars,

423
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,000
enjoy good food,

424
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,959
and live in the best hotels.

425
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,160
Well, let us go through the contract

426
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,599
after it's ready.

427
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,760
(Contract, Follow Entertainment)
I have prepared the contracts.

428
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,479
Good morning.

429
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,640
Kele.

430
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,319
Where have you been?

431
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
If you still don't come to work,

432
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
the boss will give you a boot.

433
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,599
Well, it's a long story.

434
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,160
Don't bother then. Come over.

435
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,199
You know what?

436
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,199
The characters in the game, Love Boys,

437
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:34,479
that we played, turned out
to be real people.

438
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,199
And they're out in the real world now.

439
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,719
I... I know.

440
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:42,040
And my disappearance is related to them.

441
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,000
How so?

442
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,199
You're acting so mysterious.

443
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,520
Do you remember when I told you

444
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,640
that I was seeing someone in real life?

445
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,000
That person is...

446
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,000
Are you trying to say

447
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,040
that you're dating Lu Xiao in real life?

448
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,079
Keep it a secret.

449
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,040
Jiang Kele.

450
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Did you lose your mind

451
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,959
after learning they're real people?

452
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

453
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
How about this?

454
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,560
I'll introduce him to you
when I have a chance.

455
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,719
Don't wait.

456
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,560
Do it now.

457
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,280
If you bring them to me now,

458
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,400
I'll believe you.

459
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,439
Not now.

460
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,640
Lu Xiao is looking for a job now.

461
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,959
I can't disturb him.

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,040
Looking for a job?

463
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,680
What job?

464
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,599
A pianist.

465
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,079
Just like your dad? At the sea?

466
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,760
Gosh, I knew you wouldn't believe it.

467
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm telling you the truth.

468
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,000
He is now

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,719
working as a private piano teacher
for kids.

470
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,079
Keep dreaming.

471
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,079
Why would Lu Xiao

472
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,319
become a piano teacher

473
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,640
instead of a celebrity?

474
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Your story makes no sense.

475
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,199
I wonder how Lu Xiao's interview went.

476
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,079
Can he adapt himself
to the life outside?

477
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,079
Keep making up stories.

478
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,479
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,239
I don't want the others

480
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,719
to affect the interview.

481
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,319
Can I wear a cap?

482
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,839
No problem.

483
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,839
I have watched all the videos

484
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,199
of you playing the piano.

485
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,599
It is good.

486
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,719
That requires

487
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,479
at least a decade of practice
to get to where you are.

488
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,280
Thank you.

489
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,400
Can I start working tomorrow?

490
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,680
No rush.

491
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,359
Can you show me your resume?

492
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
You know my situation.

493
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,119
I have no resume

494
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,520
or working experience.

495
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm well aware of your situation.

496
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,400
But

497
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,760
why do you want to be a piano teacher?

498
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,479
Although I don't have a certificate,

499
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm pretty confident

500
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,079
in teaching the beginners.

501
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,959
Besides, I used to teach them

502
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,439
how to play in the game.

503
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,920
I get that.

504
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
But games are different

505
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,719
from reality after all.

506
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,760
The children got to practice

507
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,599
while they were playing the games.

508
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,000
That was something extra.

509
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,439
But it's different in reality.

510
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
Parents come to our institution
to hire a piano teacher

511
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,280
because they are serious
about the grading test.

512
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,239
If you have no certificate
or experience,

513
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,199
the parents won't let you
teach their children.

514
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,560
You should find another job.

515
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,000
So you came to persuade me

516
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,400
to look for another job?

517
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:19,079
I came for a personal reason.

518
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,119
My niece and I are big fans of yours.

519
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,920
Can I take a picture with you?

520
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,400
Can I?

521
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,079
Sure.

522
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,319
Ms. Guan.

523
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,599
This car will soon be handed over to us

524
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,479
for auction.

525
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,239
Please move out of your house
as soon as possible.

526
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Okay.

527
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,359
You have to sign here.

528
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,378
(Mortgager, Guan Qianya)

529
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,359
Thank you, Ms. Guan.

530
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,239
Can you confirm

531
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,839
if there are any personal items
in the car

532
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,040
that need to be taken away?

533
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,640
No, you may take the car now.

534
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,680
Hi, may I help you?

535
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,239
We are the VIPs
of the presidential suite.

536
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,280
We just went to the spa

537
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,119
and had a meal.

538
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,160
But we couldn't unlock the door
when we got back.

539
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,839
All right.

540
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,239
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,199
Your presidential suite is only booked
for one night.

542
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,719
It's already past the check-out time.

543
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,800
That's not possible.

544
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,640
That kind-hearted guy told us

545
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,199
to make ourselves at home

546
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,239
and we could stay as long as we want.

547
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,920
You can stay as long as you want.

548
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,959
But you have to pay for the room.

549
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,160
Call him. He'll pay for us.

550
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,119
Okay.

551
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,199
Sorry, the number doesn't exist.

552
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,199
Could he be a liar?

553
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,479
We freeloaded some meals
and got a free hotel stay.

554
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,599
We have nothing to lose.

555
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,959
Why don't we go now?

556
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,319
Okay.

557
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,079
Well, we're not staying anymore.

558
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,239
We'll leave now.

559
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,000
Bye.

560
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,040
Could you please settle the bill?

561
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,560
Hasn't the room been paid for?

562
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,800
Yes.

563
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,319
But you had

564
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,479
breakfast, lunch, spa,

565
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,640
gym and swimming pool.

566
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,719
Also you drank the drinks

567
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,160
from the minibar in the suite.

568
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,959
The total expense is 12,800 yuan.

569
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,839
That's so expensive!

570
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,520
But we...

571
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
We have no money.

572
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,000
Are you trying to renege on the debt?

573
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,040
Security guards!

574
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,280
Run!

575
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,560
Stop!

576
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,719
So you're Luo Ke and Su Lie, right?

577
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,800
That's right.

578
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,680
(Contract)
Did you two

579
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,239
sign this contract?

580
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,980
(Party A, Su Lie)

581
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,839
That's right.

582
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,319
Are you a friend
of that kind-hearted guy?

583
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,000
You're here to foot the bill, right?

584
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,520
Kind-hearted guy?

585
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,319
What are you talking about?

586
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,599
He's a liar!

587
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,880
He used this artist contract

588
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,479
to swindle money out of me!

589
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,000
You belong to me now.

590
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,160
Come with me!

591
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,839
We're not going with you.

592
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,880
We won't trust anyone ever again!

593
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,719
Where are you taking us to?

594
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,400
It has nothing to do with us!

595
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,359
Let them go!

596
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,319
They are actors signed by our company.

597
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,359
Here's the contract.

598
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,880
I have a contract too.

599
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,800
I have the endorsement contract too.

600
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,719
You've been conned.

601
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,119
This is an exclusive contract.

602
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,880
