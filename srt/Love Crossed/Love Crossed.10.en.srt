00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,079
I can't sleep.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,199
I have an important event tomorrow.

00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,960
But I don't want to go. I'm stressed.

6
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,399
I have an idea.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,879
What are we doing?

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,159
Dancing.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,639
I don't know how to dance.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,600

Qianya!

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,479
Kele, I...

32
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,160
You don't have to say anything.
I understand.

33
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,430
(The player has gone offline.
Would you like to sign off? Yes)

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,679
You've been doing that for half an hour.

35
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,880
Is there something wrong with you?

36
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,800
Was it loud and clear?

37
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,080
Doesn't it sound nice, Guan Qianya?

38
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,119
It's the sound of your words
biting back at you!

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Jiang Kele.

40
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,679
Do you want me to pour
this on your hair again?

41
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,279
Who said that

42
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,800
only silly women would play that game?

43
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,279
You're playing it now too.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,119
What does that make you?

45
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:40,919
Well, I'm not a silly woman.

46
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,559
Then why would you play that game?

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,279
I just wanted to give it a try.

48
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,720
Give it a try?

49
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,080
Then...
Was that your first time playing it?

50
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,199
It's your first time playing it
and you're already dancing with someone!

51
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,960
Who is that charming man?

52
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,839
Could it be my "husband"?

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,399
No way.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,759
He's my least likable type.

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,279
Su Lie?

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,919
Luo Ke?

57
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,199
Stop guessing. It's Xu Nian.

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
I was already

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,440
getting there.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,440
But why him?

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
He's boring,

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,039
and he always lectures others.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,799
Have I satisfied your curiosity?

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
Can we please enjoy our drinks now?

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,399
No.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
You just sparked my curiosity.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,239
Tell me. Why him?

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,079
Qianya, why? Why do you like him?

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Last time,
I got the wrong lens.

70
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,359
And Xu Nian appeared.

71
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,399
And for some reason,

72
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,679
he cured my insomnia.

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,079
That's why.

74
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,760
He cured your insomnia?

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Then why were you dancing?

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
You've fallen, haven't you?

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
No.

78
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,880
I have something on tomorrow.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,679
I couldn't sleep,

80
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,480
so he was helping me relax.

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,160
Oh, right.

82
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,839
Y... You're going to debate
with Xu Guanghan tomorrow.

83
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, how are you going
to debate with him

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,359
now that you've fallen for the game too?

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
For the sake of my company,

86
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,320
I have to bite the bullet and do it.

87
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,600
It's a good thing
nobody knows about this yet.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
You can pretend as if nothing happened.

89
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,160
You know about it, don't you?

90
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
I'm not a human.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,079
I'm a deity!

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
The deity of fortune!

93
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,160
Here. The money for the medical fee.

94
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,959
Where did you get this much money?

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,079
I earned this money

96
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,440
with my own hands, legally.

97
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,000
They're exhausted because of me.

98
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,119
Should I buy something for them

99
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,119
to show my appreciation?

100
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,640
That smells so good.

101
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,480
I'll buy a cake for them!

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Cherry cake.

103
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,839
A strawberry cake should be good.

104
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,359
Hello there.

105
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,350
(Strawberry Mousse 398/piece)

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,760
398 yuan.

107
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,799
That's so expensive.

108
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,160
Our cakes are baked fresh every day.

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,040
These just came out of the oven
less than two hours ago.

110
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,679
We use the best whipped cream, too.

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,239
It's still kind of pricey.

112
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,720
Maybe I should just bake one myself.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
That's more sincere too.

114
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,559
Never mind.

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,880
Miss.

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,679
We have a promotion going on

117
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,679
for the cake you saw earlier.

118
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,600
If you buy a large cake,
you'll get two little cakes for free.

119
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,480
Buy a large cake
and get two small ones for free?

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,559
Won't you reconsider it?

121
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,000
Give me another small cake for free

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,239
and I'll buy that large cake.

123
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,959
All right.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,679
It'll come out of my pocket then.

125
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,799
Really?

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Thanks! I'll come by often!

127
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,839
I'll give the big one to Lu Xiao

128
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,040
and give the rest
to the other three guys.

129
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,600
Perfect.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,679
Ever since I've tasted food
from the outside world,

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,359
these healthy diets

132
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,040
have become so bland and tasteless.

133
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,920
It's one thing for Lu Xiao and Xu Nian
to be able to bear with this,

134
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,679
but how are you taking this so easily?

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll teach you a trick.
Use your imagination.

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,959
Think of yourself as a rabbit.

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,519
And it'll taste good when you eat it.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,239
But it's still the same taste.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm just joking.

140
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,959
Good morning!

141
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,519
Jiang Kele!

142
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,839
Why are you here so early today?

143
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,160
Let me introduce myself.

144
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,119
From today onward,

145
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm officially an employee
of the Bay House.

146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,959
I'll be able to come and go freely.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
As a show of appreciation,

148
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,839
I bought you guys some goodies!

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,079
Here.

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
Delicious Shizuren
sour and spicy noodles.

151
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,679
Numbing and spicy!

152
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,640
We have to get the hot water ready.

153
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:24,839
Jiang Kele.

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,399
You have to keep
bringing us delicious food.

155
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,720
No problem!

156
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,160
Lu Xiao, as you've taken the punishment

157
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,400
for Jiang Kele,

158
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
I'll give her another chance.

159
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
She can come back to work tomorrow.

160
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,679
Do you have anything to say about that?

161
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,440
You've always kept your words.

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,119
But a man who keeps his words as I do

163
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,760
is often treated unfairly.

164
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,679
For instance, betrayal.

165
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,359
I will not betray you.

166
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,119
Thank you. I'm touched.

167
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,559
But I am talking about Jiang Kele.

168
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,599
I can't fully trust her.

169
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,719
Then why did you let her stay?

170
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,559
For you.

171
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:12,159
Lu Xiao, I can tell

172
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
that you want her to stay.

173
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,799
Otherwise,

174
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,320
you wouldn't have
accepted the punishment on her behalf.

175
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,479
All right. Let's leave this topic aside.

176
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,719
But I need you to do one thing for me.

177
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,359
From today on,

178
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,239
you'll observe her every move,

179
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,400
record it

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,880
and report to me periodically.

181
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,280
What?

182
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you refusing me?

183
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,640
Then I'm afraid
Jiang Kele will have to leave.

184
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,440
No.

185
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,280
I can't lift my hands.

186
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,919
You’ve had a very long day.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,520
Enjoy the food. I'll be leaving then.

188
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,559
Wait.

189
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,840
Can I have a bite of that large cake?

190
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,559
It's for Lu Xiao. How dare you?

191
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,679
Never mind. This small one will do.

192
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's just eat this.

193
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,359
How could that be?

194
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,119
I thought I would never
be able to come back

195
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,599
when I was fired last time.

196
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,159
My biggest regret

197
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,719
was not being able
to let you guys have some cake.

198
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,440
Here. Try it.

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,799
I'll call them over and share this.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Each of them has their own.

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
Xu Nian is Xu Nian, after all.

202
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,559
Always thinking of others.

203
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,599
Qianya has good taste.

204
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,479
What are you mumbling about?

205
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,880
I was saying...

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
Xu Nian.

207
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,679
What's your ideal type?

208
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
My ideal type?

209
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Jiang Kele likes Lu Xiao, doesn't she?

210
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,599
Yes. They've kissed.

211
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,880
But why is she asking Xu Nian now?

212
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,679
Has she fallen in love with him instead?

213
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,679
Falling for a guy one after another.
Women are scary.

214
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
Gentle.

215
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,719
Shall I help you wash your hair
with this beer?

216
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,479
No, I don't want to! Guan Qianya!

217
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't move!

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,039
Stay there!

219
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,719
Long hair.

220
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,479
Someone who is tidy
and has a good lifestyle.

221
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,520
Someone who is orderly.

222
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,919
That's my ideal type.

223
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,679
Are... Are you sure
you won't change your ideal type?

224
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,119
I've said that it's my ideal type.

225
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,559
Why would I change it easily?

226
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,359
That's what Xu Nian said.

227
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,520
I think

228
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,880
Jiang Kele doesn't have a chance.
Right, Su Lie?

229
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,679
Our noodles are done.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,359
Let's go and eat them.
Otherwise, it'll get cold.

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,239
You're right.

232
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,799
What are you doing here?

233
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Were you listening in on us?

234
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
I... was just passing by.

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,559
Oh, how convenient.

236
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,520
You aren't jealous

237
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,320
that I gave him
the cake in person, are you?

238
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,479
I don't care if you gave him a cake.

239
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,960
I could care even less
if you gave someone a cake.

240
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,479
All right.
I left the largest cake for you.

241
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,559
You can have it in a bit.

242
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,239
I don't like cake.

243
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,719
It's just a cake.

244
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,080
You don't need to be so worked up.

245
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,679
No, I spent too long
on the rowing machine yesterday.

246
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,039
Is it good?

247
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,359
It's all right.

248
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,049
(Love at first sight)

249
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,299
(Xu Guanghan)

250
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:58,393
(The best in the universe, Guan Qianya)

251
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,063
(Great Debate)

252
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,239
Good evening,

253
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,359
live studio and our audiences

254
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,960
that are watching us online!

255
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Welcome to the Great Debate.

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Usually, I'd have

257
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,760
a huge deck of cue cards in my hands.

258
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,799
But I don't need any of those tonight!

259
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,799
Because we've got some

260
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,119
major guests coming in tonight.

261
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:16,960
Did you notice

262
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,359
that I wore a raincoat today?

263
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,719
Because I'm worried

264
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,919
that I'll drown in their spit.

265
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,880
All right, that's enough small-talk.

266
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,559
Let us welcome

267
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,840
our guest on the affirmative side,

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,719
the man who calls himself
the most handsome man in the universe,

269
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
the father of Love Boys,

270
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,440
the president of Yao Inc.,

271
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,479
Mr. Xu Guanghan!

272
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's give him a round of applause!

273
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
I'd like to correct you.

274
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,280
I didn't proclaim myself

275
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,479
as the most handsome man
in the universe.

276
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,599
It's an acknowledged fact.

277
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,880
As domineering as ever, Mr. Xu.

278
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,440
Okay.

279
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
Now, who will be his opponent

280
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,400
tonight?

281
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,599
She is a woman acknowledged

282
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,239
as the last hope for women,

283
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,599
the most formidable woman
in the universe,

284
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,799
the president of Crush On Love,

285
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,080
Ms. Guan Qianya!

286
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,679
Let's give her a round of applause!

287
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,919
-Guan Qianya! Guan Qianya!
-Guan Qianya! Guan Qianya!

288
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
I'd like to clarify something as well.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,039
My "title" wasn't publicly acknowledged.

290
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,159
It's a modest term of address.

291
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,840
Ms. Guan is as humble

292
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,960
and sensible as ever.

293
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,799
I hereby announce

294
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
the greatest debate

295
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,400
ever to be seen on this show starts now!

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Let's fight!

297
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,280
Everyone yearns for love.

298
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,799
Unfortunately,

299
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,799
most of them do not manage to find love.

300
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,719
The birth of Y4

301
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,719
was meant to fulfill

302
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,520
this gap and regret.

303
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,719
(Jiang Kele)

304
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,640
(She is kneeling on the ground
as she cleans the pool.)

305
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,599
(She has a serious attitude.)

306
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,280
(But her actions appear clumsy.)

307
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680

308
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,719

00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,760
Lu Xiao, I can tell

337
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,920
that you want her to stay.

338
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,959
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
taken her punishment on her behalf.

339
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,959
You were the one who kissed me.

340
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,479
Yet you still refused to admit it.

341
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,959
I could tell right away from that kiss.

342
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,239
But why did he sneak out?

343
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,719
It doesn't make sense.

344
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,599
Surveillance is tight in here,

345
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,000
and there are security guards
by the entrance.

346
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,400
How did he get out of this place?

347
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,719
Did Granny make this secret passage?

348
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,040
How else would she
have known about this place?

349
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
But Lu Xiao shouldn't have known
about this place.

350
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:54,319
(Please do not imitate
the following actions.)

351
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,797
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station, Entrance 6)

352
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,640
When did they
build a subway station here?

353
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,239
Did Lu Xiao sneak out from here?

354
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,040
History has proven to us

355
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,760
that the progress of humanity
and technology

356
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,680
will not be stopped
just because it was opposed

357
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,160
by a small group of people.

358
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,319
The time for AR lovers
has long arrived!

359
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,400
It's time for everyone to wake up
and accept the change.

360
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,040
Or else you'll be crushed

361
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,079
by the wheels of time.

362
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,560
And you'll pay the price
by having your bones crushed!

363
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,520
All hail the father of Y4, Xu Guanghan!

364
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,319
All hail the father of Y4, Xu Guanghan!

365
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,119
All hail the father of Y4, Xu Guanghan!

366
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,920
All hail the father of Y4, Xu Guanghan!

367
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,119
The affirmative party's speech

368
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,520
is impassioned and resounding.

369
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,719
He has given his speech.

370
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,640
Now, let's see how many
of the 500 audiences

371
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,319
will vote for him.

372
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,680
Let's take a look at the screen.

373
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,280
The number of votes is going up.

374
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
Let's watch and see.

375
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,119
492.

376
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,839
493.

377
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,959
495.

378
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,079
498.

379
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:45,303
499 votes!

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,040
My goodness!

381
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,359
We have 500 audiences tonight.

382
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,199
And 499 of them

383
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,680
voted for Mr. Xu.

384
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,719
There was only one person

385
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
who didn't vote for Mr. Xu.

386
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,599
I wonder who that person is?

387
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,520
All right. Next,

388
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,839
let us invite the opposition party,

389
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,319
Ms. Guan Qianya

390
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,280
to give her speech.

391
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,319
A round of applause for her, please.

392
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,599
Guan Qianya! Guan Qianya!

393
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,280
A long time ago,

394
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,719
a female writer wrote a line

395
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
that I could not agree with more.

396
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,079
She said,

397
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,040
"I thought romance

398
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,800
could fill gaps and regrets in life,

399
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,040
but the one to leave the most regrets

400
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,560
is romance."

401
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,439
Mr. Xu made a good point
at the beginning of his speech.

402
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,599
Romance is filled with regrets.

403
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,199
But doesn't that make it
a part of romance as well?

404
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,719
Because of those regrets,

405
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,520
you'll remember those memories

406
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,839
and you'll strive for changes.

407
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,719
(People learn)

408
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,800
(from their failed relationships,)

409
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,079
(and step by step,
they become a better person)

410
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,000
(and a better lover.)

411
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,599
People look forward
to the next romance.

412
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,599
They look forward
to not leaving any regrets

413
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,079
in their next romance.

414
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,160
Mr. Xu said people yearned for love.

415
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,599
What he said was not wrong.

416
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,959
But aren't those people

417
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,719
yearning for love in real life?

418
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,239
Why would you
change the concept, Mr. Xu?

419
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Well-said!

420
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,680
(Players who have become)

421
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,520
(severely addicted to the game)

422
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,359
(continue to sink deeper and deeper.)

423
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,800
They neglect their studies, their work,

424
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
and their families.

425
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,719
They are unable to differentiate
between virtuality and reality.

426
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
Some of them were even hospitalized

427
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,319
and were diagnosed

428
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,520
as patients
with severe cognitive impairment.

429
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,160
They may never know

430
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
that the "father of AR lovers"

431
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,439
has long been blinded by profits.

432
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,400
You must know

433
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
that it is incredibly difficult

434
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,520
to escape the restraints
of the time, regardless of the era.

435
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,479
The most concerning matter is...

436
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,439
Perhaps Xu Guanghan himself

437
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,079
has not yet to realize

438
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,880
the harm and disaster
that the business

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,040
he is so proud of has caused
to our society.

440
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,160
Perhaps many years later,

441
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,280
when the people of the future

442
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,359
look back at us,

443
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,160
only then will they be able

444
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,640
to realize

445
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
that Xu Guanghan

446
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,520
was the main culprit

447
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,079
who led humankind astray
at the fork road in history!

448
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,640
Well-said!

449
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,400
Well-said!

450
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,719
That's our Ms. Guan!

451
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
Ms. Guan's speech

452
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,239
is indeed powerful
and thought-provoking.

453
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,479
Now, let's see

454
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,520
if the audiences

455
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,880
have changed their minds
after her speech.

456
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,599
Let's take a look at the screen.

457
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,760
Oh, my.

458
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,040
The voting result is changing fast.

459
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,920
Look!

460
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,119
The number of votes for Ms. Guan.

461
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,199
492, 493...

462
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:02,920
495.

463
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,040
498.

464
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,199
499.

465
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,640
500!

466
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:11,239
Ms. Guan has received full votes!

467
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,199
(The results are evident.)

468
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,800
(Let us give a loud round of applause)

469
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,520
(to our winner of the round, Guan...)

470
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,400
Hold on.

471
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,640
Mr. Xu,

472
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,920
is there something you'd like to say?

473
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,479
I have nothing to say.

474
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,319
Then shut up!

475
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,719
But I have something
I'd like to show all of you.

476
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,400
Mr. Xu is a veteran

477
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,560
in the entertainment world.

478
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,680
He even remembers

479
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,839
to save a surprise for us

480
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,199
before the end of the show.

481
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,119
That's great.

482
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Let's leave the stage to Mr. Xu.

483
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,079
Mr. Xu, please.

484
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,199
With your intelligence,

485
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,599
I'm certain that not all of you

486
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,160
will be able to understand my words.

487
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,479
