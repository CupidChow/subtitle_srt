1
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,200
You're actually...

2
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,479
Lu Xiao!

3
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,159
It's really you, right?

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,240
Let me take a look.

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,119
Stop!

6
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,520
Close your eyes

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,119
and let go of your hands,
then I'll tell you.

8
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,279
From today on,

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,440
we are strangers who
live under the same roof.

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
Who would've thought that one day

11
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:22,559
my best friend

12
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:23,279
will abandon her friend

13
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,480
to celebrate a virtual birthday

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,839
of her virtual boyfriend

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,000
in a virtual game.

16
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,000
I was ridiculed by the employees
and customers because of that.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,000
From now on,

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,199
you will waste your life

19
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,400
in your virtual game.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,080
And I will shine

21
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,879
in my real life.

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,239
Why don't you talk?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,599
Don't think that I'll forgive you

24
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,279
if you pretend to be melancholy!

25
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,559
What's wrong with her?

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
Is it really him?

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,919
If it isn't him,

28
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,720
then why do they look exactly the same?

29
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,279
But if it is him,

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,679
why is he in the real world?

31
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,759
Never mind. I'll have a look
at the game world.

32

=Episode 2=

34
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,720
Why does he fall asleep today?

35
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
Kele, you're back.

36
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,040
Did I wake you up?

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,880
You come back late today.

38
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,839
Did you work overtime again?

39
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,600
No.

40
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,279
Did you wait for a long time?

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,079
Sorry, I...

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Kele,

43
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,359
I might be

44
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,320
a form of recreation for you.

45
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,839
But for me,

46
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
you are my whole world.

47
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,279
I won't feel long

48
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,000
no matter how long you make me wait.

49
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
Because my birthday

50
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,720
is perfect only if you spend it

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,279
with me.

52
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,440
You're exactly the same.

53
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,760
What is?

54
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,320
Nothing.

55
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Hurry up.
Make a wish and blow the candles.

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
I have three wishes.

57
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,000
First wish,

58
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,880
I hope Jiang Kele

59
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,640
could be happy every day

60
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:21,440
just like the meaning of her name.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
Second wish,

62
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,559
I hope I could spend

63
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,200
my following birthdays with Kele.

64
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,920
Third wish...

65
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,079
What is it?

66
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,359
I'll leave the third wish to you.

67
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,720
Whatever you want to achieve,

68
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,279
I'll do it for you.

69
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,959
I want you to recreate

70
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,279
what happened today.

71
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,959
Let's go.

72
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,160
Hold on.

73
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,959
Where're the men chasing you?

74
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,480
I run fast

75
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
and dump them.

76
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,359
Now, it's our time together.

77
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,200
It's not like that.

78
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,959
Run slower this time.

79
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,239
Wait for me, love you!

80
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
You must wait for me!

81
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's go.

82
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,239
It's not like this!

83
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,519
♪I just found out that my♪

84
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:31,320
♪heart races, it's indescribable♪

85
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:33,919
What are you doing?

86
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
I would never abandon you.

87
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:43,919
Ms. Guan,

88
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,559
I contacted all the male members who

89
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,960
joined the 8-minute speed
dating yesterday.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
We have sold 39 pieces of

91
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,359
50 percent off
annual membership cards in total.

92
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,239
But there's a male member who is
particularly hard to deal with.

93
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,679
He asked for a full refund.

94
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,919
Why don't we give him 70 percent off

95
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,119
and provide him an exclusive
dating consultant?

96
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:57,760
All right.

97
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,400
Yes.

98
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,440
Ms. Guan,

99
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,239
the clients who
advertise on our website

100
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,880
are not going to renew
their contracts next month.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,599
To retain them, we halve
their advertising costs.

102
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,239
We pick a few important clients

103
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,200
and allow them access to
the targeted advertising, is it okay?

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,960
Yes.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Thank you, Ms. Guan.

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Ms. Guan, can you
lend me 10,000 yuan?

107
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
Sure.

108
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,359
Why do you borrow money?

109
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,599
I... I have something urgent.

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,239
I'll leave since you're busy.

111
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,119
I'll explain it to you later.

112
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,640
Remember to transfer the money to me.

113
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,039
Jiang Ke...

114
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,799
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu.

115
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,359
Mr. Xu.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,039
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,119
Why haven't the products of

118
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,440
the new season been shown yet?

119
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,840
They will be shown tomorrow.

120
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,520
I want to see them at noon.

121
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Yes.

122
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,359
(Females who are addicted to the games)

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,960
(have refused to
fall in love with a man)

124
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,919
(in reality.)

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,159
(This phenomenon has caused
a series of)

126
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,640
(social problems all over the world.)

127
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
(The marriage rate has decreased,)

128
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,919
(Divorce)
(and the fertility rate has decreased.)

129
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,000
(On the contrary, the divorce rate
continues to increase.)

130
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,359
There's another serious problem.

131
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,039
The consumption desire of these women

132
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
has fallen sharply.

133
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,119
(Leading to a slowdown
in the growth rate)

134
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,359
(of GDP of the society.)

135
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,880
(All from 90 percent off)
(What's more serious is)

136
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,479
(these women no longer
see Love Boys)

137
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,359
(as a simple game.)

138
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,119
(The hippocampus in
their temporal lobe)

139
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,280
(has already recognized)

140
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,719
(the game world as the real world.)

141
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,840
(And the father of Love Boys,)

142
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,359
(Xu Guanghan, the CEO of Yao Inc)

143
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,799
(should be responsible for all this.)

144
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,159
Mute it.

145
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,799
Mr. Xu,

146
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,840
I guess Dr. Chen

147
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
has taken advantage of our competitors.

148
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,599
That's why he talks nonsense.

149
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Please don't mind it.

150
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,039
Just earn his money

151
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,960
as an old man.

152
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,760
Why should everything

153
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,000
have to do with GDP?

154
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,239
Will you refute what he said

155
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,320
in the interview tomorrow?

156
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,520
I'll express some different opinions.

157
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,599
But it's not to refute him.

158
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,840
Do you know why?

159
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,119
Because he doesn't worth it.

160
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,599
Right, Mr. Xu.

161
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,200
I have one thing to report to you.

162
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
The electricity went off in the
Bay House yesterday afternoon.

163
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,840
The maintenance worker fixed it
in half an hour.

164
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,520
The electricity went off?

165
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,119
Lei Na,

166
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,840
I remember the
company's specifications mentioned

167
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
such problems should be resolved

168
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,440
within ten minutes.

169
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,799
Why did they take half an hour?

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,440
That's why I already
punished them for that.

171
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,440
Their salary for this month
will be deducted ten percent.

172
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,880
People

173
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,679
are always not trustable.

174
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,840
Just deduct nine percent.

175
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,640
Do you know what that one percent means?

176
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,119
Your kindness.

177
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,000
The color of your lipstick today
doesn't suit you.

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,359
Then you won't see this color tomorrow.

179
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,200
Why must it be tomorrow?

180
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,214
(Inpatient department)

181
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,679
Just ring the bell after you finish.

182
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,520
I'll come and clean it up.

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,440
Hold on, hold on.

184
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,960
You can clean it now.

185
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,239
This...

186
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm a human, okay?

187
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,080
Oh my god!

188
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm not a cow or a horse.

189
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,840
Give me some meat, okay?

190
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
Let me tell you.

191
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,919
You should eat something
light at your age.

192
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,080
It's good for your body.

193
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,400
My age?

194
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,640
How old am I?

195
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,080
I had bone fracture

196
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,320
not obesity.

197
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,559
Can't I eat some meat?

198
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,520
You mentioned my age.

199
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,159
Am I that old?

200
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,239
I... I didn't mean it.

201
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,039
How old am I?

202
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,000
Calm down.

203
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I... Am I older than you?

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,679
You think I'm older than you.

205
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,640
Right, I'm older than you.

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,400
But what I hate the most

207
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,080
is that people say I'm old.

208
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up first.

209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,239
Just find me if you need anything else.

210
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

211
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:22,760
Why are you sneaking around?

212
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
Come in!

213
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Granny,

214
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,200
are you feeling better?

215
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,840
You didn't escape?

216
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
You have a conscience

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
that you still come to visit me.

218
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,799
Or else

219
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,200
the lightning that strikes you
will be on its way.

220
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,039
Granny, I'm being courageous.

221
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,479
I'm not the perpetrator.

222
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm deeply in debt to pay for

223
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,119
your medical fee.

224
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,000
Moreover, I missed the birthday party

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,520
to send you to the hospital.

226
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
Try it, does it smell nice?

227
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
Are all the young ladies nowadays

228
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,080
like you?

229
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,599
Look pretty,

230
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,320
and have a pair of

231
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,599
sparkling black eyes.

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,919
Why do you

233
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,520
lie through your teeth?

234
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,440
Obviously, it was you
who ran the red light

235
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,760
and knocked me off.

236
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,320
I didn't run the red light.

237
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,359
It was yellow light.

238
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,880
Red for stop, green for go
and yellow for wait.

239
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,440
Have you learnt that before?

240
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,239
I...

241
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Then...Then why didn't you wait?

242
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,119
I... I... I...

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm so pissed off.

244
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,840
If I had known it,

245
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,640
I should've never stepped on the brake.

246
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,239
I should hit the gas

247
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,559
and smashed you into the sky.

248
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,440
You'll know by then.

249
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,520
You're such a vicious old lady!

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,320
If I had known it, I shouldn't
have saved you.

251
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,559
I'll let you lie on the road.

252
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,640
Right, hurry up and pay me back
the medical fee.

253
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,559
Then we're even.

254
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,039
In your dream.

255
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,880
I tell you.

256
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I never return things.

257
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay, then I'll do the same.

258
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,159
You...Don't go.

259
00:14:59,239 --> 00:14:59,919
Don't move.

260
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,559
Let me make a call.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,039
I'll call my elder brother.

262
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,919
Hi, are you the killer, Brother Zhang?

263
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Right.

264
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,039
I am, I am.

265
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,119
The thing is

266
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,000
I recently

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,520
met an annoying young lady.

268
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
She keeps pestering me.

269
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,640
Right, right, right.

270
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,640
Just handle her for me if you're free.

271
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:26,200
Forget it, stop acting.
Who are you scaring?

272
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,919
You're quite brave.

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,799
You really don't believe

274
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,760
he is the killer, Brother Zhang?

275
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,080
You even called him brother.

276
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,320
He must be really old.

277
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,960
That would be awesome
for him to walk upright.

278
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,799
Moreover, who would
look for gangster nowadays?

279
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,159
Do you have other ways?

280
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,119
Granny,

281
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,960
I suddenly thought of
something very sad.

282
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,000
I was very poor when I was a child.

283
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
I worked in a cosmetic shop

284
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,880
and can't make any money.

285
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,640
Now that I'm still staying in
my best friend's house.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,239
My father is not with me either.

287
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,919
I even paid your medical fee.

288
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,719
My life is particularly strapped.

289
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,000
Granny.

290
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,599
Granny...

291
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,960
Stop acting.

292
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,159
Why don't you become an actress?

293
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,640
You're quite good at acting.

294
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,960
Really?

295
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
Considering you

296
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,400
have a conscience and
didn't poison the soup,

297
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,440
I decide to pay you back the money.

298
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,679
Really?

299
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,679
But

300
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,760
you have to do me a favor.

301
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,039
Sure.

302
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,840
As long as it's not illegal.

303
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,679
Do you know?

304
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,280
Before I knew you,

305
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,039
I had a very stable job.

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,280
But after I knew you,

307
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,599
I became like this.

308
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm completely held up.

309
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,119
I can't go to work.

310
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,960
So if you complete my work for me,

311
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,239
I'll pay you back the money.

312
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,520
Sure.

313
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,959
What is your job?

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,079
Is it hard?

315
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,439
Do I have the ability to complete it?

316
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,680
It's not hard at all.

317
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,400
It's janitorial work.

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm doomed.

319
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,439
It seems that you're a
poor person like me.

320
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,439
You have no money.

321
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,199
I guess I can't get my money back.

322
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,040
Stop! Stop! Stop!

323
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,839
Stop crying! You're really noisy.

324
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,280
Young lady,

325
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm being very serious with you now.

326
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,479
If you can complete my job well for me,

327
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,719
I promise I will pay you back the money.

328
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,079
What's my guarantee?

329
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,719
My life.

330
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
But there are only few years.

331
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,839
Why do you find me?

332
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,640
Because we look alike.

333
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,160
Qianya?

334
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,199
You're just a girl in early twenties,

335
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,719
and always have drinks and play games.

336
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,520
If you keep doing that,

337
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
your life will be over sooner or later.

338
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
If you came back early,

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
I wouldn't have waited for so long.

340
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,599
Right, why do you borrow money today?

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,479
Don't scold me if I tell you.

342
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,280
You're into the shylocks?

343
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,319
Do you gamble?

344
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,479
No!

345
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,800
I...

346
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Did you help the old lady
cross the road again

347
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
and get blackmailed?

348
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,079
It's different this time.

349
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,439
Listen up.

350
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
I met an old lady today.

351
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,719
She flipped over in front
of me in an instant

352
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,239
and fell.

353
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:53,920
Then I sent her to the hospital

354
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,959
and paid the medical fee for her.

355
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,280
Do you understand me?

356
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,199
I'll say it again
if you don't understand.

357
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,199
I met an old lady today.

358
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,160
She flipped over in front
of me in an instant.

359
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,599
Stop! How could you possibly
get blackmailed like this?

360
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,880
I didn't get blackmailed.

361
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,199
She said she would pay me back.

362
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,800
Didn't the old lady from last time
say the same thing?

363
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,560
Did she pay you back?

364
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,640
This is not the point.

365
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,640
Then what's the point?

366
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,920
The point is

367
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,599
if I didn't meet this old lady,

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,520
I wouldn't have missed
the birthday party of Y4.

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
If I didn't miss the birthday party,

370
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,040
I wouldn't get kissed by a stranger

371
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
at the subway station

372
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,959
on my way

373
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,800
back home.

374
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,040
I told you I would drive you back.

375
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,239
Why did you insist on taking the subway?

376
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:28,920
I took...

377
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,520
This is not the point, Guan Qianya!

378
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,680
Then what is the point?

379
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,800
The point is...

380
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Guess who the man was.

381
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,920
Who else could he be?

382
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,800
Could he be Lu Xiao?

383
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,880
It's him!

384
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,479
Qianya, it's him!

385
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,359
Qianya,

386
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,839
I also didn't believe it at first.

387
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:45,359
So

388
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,839
I logged in to the game to verify.

389
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,520
I found out that they two
were totally different.

390
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,000
So do you understand what I'm saying?

391
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
Jiang Kele,

392
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,280
Lu Xiao is just a virtual character.

393
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,359
How could he appear in the real world?

394
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,920
You can't even distinguish between

395
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,079
virtuality and reality now?

396
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,079
If you keep acting like this,

397
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,319
I'll take you to a psychiatrist.

398
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,479
I can distinguish them clearly.

399
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,119
I'm not sick either.

400
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,319
What I say is true.

401
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,280
How can I believe you?

402
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,160
I can't make you believe me.

403
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,239
But what I say is true.

404
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,560
Jiang Kele, I tell you what.

405
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,000
No matter how perfect
and nice Lu Xiao is,

406
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,599
he is just a virtual character.

407
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,680
Understand?

408
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,319
I don't understand!

409
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:14,959
I...

410
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,839
Eat by yourself!

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,439
How nice would it be
if he's a real person.

412
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,479
Kele.

413
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,599
Kele.

414
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,599
Kele,

415
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,920
didn't we talk about this?

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
You have work to do today.

417
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,800
You can't sleep in.

418
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,640
Get up quickly.

419
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,680
Get up.

420
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,079
This pancake is really tasty.

421
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,079
Eat slowly.

422
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,199
No one will snatch it from you.

423
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,280
Let's go.

424
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
Ms. Guan.

425
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,280
What do you need?

426
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,839
I...

427
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,160
What exactly do you want?

428
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,599
As you requested,

429
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,560
I buy you the gaming device

430
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,479
of Love Boys.

431
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,359
Do you have to be this careful

432
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,520
and mysterious?

433
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,920
I only want to know thyself.

434
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
I can only completely defeat them

435
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,760
after understanding this game.

436
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,520
But I heard that many people

437
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,199
just want to give it a try at first

438
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,880
but they eventually
get addicted to this game.

439
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,640
But there's one thing
you can rest assured of.

440
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,640
I used a fake identity to register it.

441
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,119
Even if you get addicted,

442
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,520
no one would know it's you.

443
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,719
You're always thoughtful

444
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,640
but it's all useless.

445
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,199
I, Guan Qianya,

446
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,839
am such a self-controlling person.

447
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,880
How is it possible that I would
get addicted to this stupid game?

448
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,439
My wife used to say that too.

449
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:23,439
And then?

450
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,239
I became her former husband.

451
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,359
Get out.

452
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,319
Yes.

453
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,000
Welcome to Big Shot Face to Face!

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,439
The guest for this issue

455
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,199
is the one who's riding high,
the CEO of Yao Inc,

456
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,040
Mr. Xu Guanghan! Welcome!

457
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,520
Mr. Xu, the first question
I'm going to ask you is

458
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
about your creation

459
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,040
of virtual characters like Y4

460
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,439
which make women

461
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,040
all around the world go crazy.

462
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,400
Are you particularly proud of yourself?

463
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,520
Y4 should be the ones who feel proud.

464
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,400
It's their honor to be my creation.

465
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,640
Mr. Xu is as arrogant as

466
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,959
the people said.

467
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,079
Only those with low self-esteem
think that others are arrogant.

468
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,199
Mr. Xu really speaks sharply.

469
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Only vulnerable people will
find others incisive.

470
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,439
Before I came to show,

471
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,719
many colleague told me that

472
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
I should speak carefully.

473
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,359
Seems like it's really genuine.

474
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,000
Only those who lack...

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Forget it. Let's change the topic.

476
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:42,599
Dr. Chen, Doctor of Sociology,

477
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,640
has recently made a
negative comment on Y4.

478
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,560
What's your opinion on this matter?

479
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,839
Which Dr. Chen?

480
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,040
The sociologist, Dr. Chen,

481
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,359
who's really famous.

482
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,119
Should I know him?

483
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,199
It's fine not to know him.

484
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,839
I know over the years,

485
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,439
some people have always

486
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:01,520
made inappropriate comments
on Y4's success

487
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,560
out of jealousy or

488
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,359
other selfish thoughts.

489
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,599
But what I wish to say is

490
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,959
in these few years
since Y4 were launched,

491
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,719
they have brought unprecedented

492
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,880
love experience to the
majority of single women.

493
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,359
Even those women

494
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,640
who might have difficulty

495
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,719
making boyfriends
due to various reasons

496
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,439
have found an ideal
love experience here.

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,719
And with the upgrade of the versions,

498
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,880
it's not only that
Y4 can provide love experience,

499
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,800
it can also tutor the teenagers

500
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,719
and bring comfort to
the lonely old folks.

501
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,000
Many parents and
elderly service institutions

502
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,560
have started to buy the device.

503
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,880
I think Y4 are playing

504
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
a very active social role.

505
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:46,719
I don't understand why
those people would say that.

506
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,479
I really want to try Y4,
these virtual characters

507
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,760
after hearing that.

508
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,800
It's really great.

509
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,640
But Mr. Xu, I've been very curious.

510
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,439
You can create

511
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,520
a virtual character that looks like

512
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,599
a real boyfriend.

513
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,280
What is the biggest secret of it?

514
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,599
It's the big data.

515
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,599
I'm just kidding.

516
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
It's soul.

517
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,319
Only by giving the
virtual characters real souls

518
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,520
can we make them look like real humans

519
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,599
and even better than real human beings.

520
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:20,920
Soul?

521
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,079
Can I ask more about it?

522
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,040
About the soul that you mentioned,

523
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,319
what exactly is it?

524
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,359
This is a secret.

525
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,719
First,

526
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,040
you must wear cleaning clothes to work.

527
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:43,959
Oh my god!

528
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,959
It's really near to the Yao Inc.

529
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:46,959
Second,

530
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,239
you can't let anyone
find out that you're not me.

531
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,520
Firstly,

532
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,479
the elevator is on your
right as you enter.

533
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,760
And there are security guards.

534
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,800
Just show your access card
to the security guards.

535
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,599
Do not flinch.

536
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,800
Head up straight and walk upright.

537
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,959
This old lady is really weird.

538
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,760
Why does she wear a helmet?

539
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,079
What's so strange

540
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,280
about it?

541
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,359
It's strange for an old lady
to ride a motorcycle.

542
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
As soon as the elevator door opens,

543
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,560
that's the place you work,

544
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,439
Bay House.

545
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:42,959
Thirdly,

546
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,040
your daily working hours

547
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,599
is two to four o'clock
in the afternoon.

548
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,920
Remember that you have to
leave at four o'clock sharp.

549
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,000
If you are found,

550
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,680
you're dead meat.

551
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,079
Mr. Xu.

552
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Mr. Xu, please come in.

553
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,959
You're too fat.

554
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,239
Oh my god!

555
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,319
It's such a huge room.

556
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,479
It's several times
bigger than Qianya's house!

557
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,640
Oh my god!

558
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,439
This owner must be a rich man.

559
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,800
But why does a rich man

560
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,359
live underground?

561
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,560
I got it.

562
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,640
This must be the house of

563
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,719
the boss of a mysterious organization.

564
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,199
Put away your curiosity.

565
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,800
Stop being nosy.

566
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,439
Don't even try to

567
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,640
guess who the people living in it are.

568
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,839
It's not right.

569
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,599
My current main task is

570
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,800
to clean the house quickly.

571
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,839
It must be very hard

572
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,520
to clean such a huge house.

573
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,880
But it should be very fulfilling.
