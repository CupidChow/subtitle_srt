1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:01,279
Stop.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,720
Who are you?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,720
Turn around.

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,920
Turn around.

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,319
(Lu Xiao?)

6
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,200
Isn't that Grandma Fushun?

7
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,439
She's not Fushun.

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,119
Fushun wouldn't wear
a helmet inside the house.

9
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,080
(It is Lu Xiao.)

10
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,800
(He's a real person.)

11
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,360
She's not dead, is she?

12
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,440
No.

13
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,080
She just fainted.

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,360
(These four guys...)

15
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,199
(They look exactly like Y4.)

16
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,720
Let's tell Lei Na immediately.

17
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,160
She might wake up soon.

18
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,400
Wake up?

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,639
Let's report this to Mr. Xu instead.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
(Mr. Xu?)

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,199
(Do they mean Xu Guanghan?)

22
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,199
(But why would)

23
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,839
(Xu Guanghan keep them here?)

24
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,600
(Does this mean that the Y4
are actually real human beings?)

25
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,279
(So that's why Granny
made me keep this place a secret.)

26
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:28,320
(Oh my gosh, my dream is coming true!)

27
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,919
She moved.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
I'm fine. Don't tell anyone!

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,039
Don't come near us!

30
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,320
Who are you?

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm your "wife"!

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,600
Hello. My name is Jiang Kele.

33
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,000
The "Kele" for coke.

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
I don't care about your name.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
How did you get in here?

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,639
I used the elevator.

37
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,199
Then,

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,039
where is

39
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,720
the old lady cleaning this place?

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
She's injured.

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,279
I came to clean the place in her stead.

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,080
So...

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,639
Were you the one
who brought that junk food here?

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,479
That's enough. No more chit-chat.

45
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
It's stated in the contract.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,839
We have to report it
if a stranger enters the house.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,479
Right. Quick, go and press the button!

48
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,440
No, wait!

49
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,479
Wait!

50
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,160
Give... Give me 10 minutes.

51
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,759
Just 10 minutes.

52
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,160
Please!

53
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,830

55
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,239
Ms. Guan! Ms. Guan!

56
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,320
-It's terrible!
-What is it?

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you see it?

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Our company website has been hacked!

59
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,079
Don't worry,

60
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,880
I had the same reaction too.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,200
Y4's fans must have done this!

62
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,720
But not my ex-wife, of course.

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,279
I asked her,
and she said she wasn't involved.

64
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,720
Stop using work as an excuse

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,079
to go on a date with your wife.

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,679
Well, I mean, it's not like that...

67
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,920
We're already divorced...

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
All right. That's enough.

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

70
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,559
Report this
to the network department right away.

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,679
Have them get their IT staff

72
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,720
to fix this.

73
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,200
And send a notice out to all our members

74
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,119
informing them
that the website is under maintenance.

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,679
And tell the legal team that
we're having a meeting in 10 minutes.

76
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,519
They must pay for this.

77
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,320
Why are you still here?

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Ms. Guan, I think we can

79
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,959
send out the notice

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
and get the website fixed.

81
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,440
But won't you reconsider
filing a report

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
and legal procedures?

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,959
I'm worried that
if things get out of hand,

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,480
potential investors
may be dissuaded.

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,799
What will we do then?

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
Do as I say.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,640
I'll handle the investors.

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,519
All right then.

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Mr. Xu.

90
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,480
You said Y4's fans wouldn't

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,720
let Guan Qianya go that easily.

92
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,760
You're right.

93
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,480
Their website

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,920
has been hacked by Y4's fans.

95
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,359
Next time, don't show me

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,679
such unfortunate things.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,040
Take care of them yourself.

98
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,880
I'll continue to keep tabs on her.

100
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,160
Don't focus too much on her.

101
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
It'd be better for us
to focus on those four boys

102
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,959
than spend time on someone else.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
How are they today?

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
As usual.

105
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,839
Um...

106
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,760
Sir?

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,679
You are

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,119
the most reasonable one

109
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,679
out of the four of you guys, right?

110
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,760
What do you want to ask?

111
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,920
I don't want to ask about anything.

112
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm begging you.

113
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,480
Please don't report me.

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,279
I need to keep this job

115
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,720
to repay my debt.

116
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,399
Debt? What sort of debt?

117
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,799
I'll tell you a story.

118
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,600
The girl before you

119
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,799
is the most
unfortunate girl in the world.

120
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,679
Her mother passed away
when she was young.

121
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,399
Her father

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
is often overseas.

123
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,839
So she had

124
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,119
to grow up all alone.

125
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,760
She has to work several jobs

126
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,320
just to survive

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,559
in this society.

128
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,880
Suddenly,

129
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
an old lady riding a motorbike

130
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,399
fell in front of her.

131
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,079
This kind little girl

132
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,160
sent the old lady to the hospital,

133
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,320
and used all of her savings

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,559
to pay for the old lady's medical bills.

135
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,799
She was barely making a living.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
And now she has a debt to carry.

137
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
So, tell me.

138
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,839
Could you bear

139
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,440
to see the poor girl lose her job?

140
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,040
You're not talking about

141
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,519
Grandma Fushun, are you?

142
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,799
How is she?

143
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,959
It's her. It's nothing serious.

144
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,799
But she is up in her years.

145
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,600
So she should stay in the hospital
for a few days just to be safe.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,320
Don't you think?

147
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,200
Look. When she gets
discharged from the hospital,

148
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,279
I'll leave right away.

149
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,920
I mean it.

150
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,599
Stop following me.

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,000
I won't agree.

152
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,400
Xu Nian has already promised

153
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,679
that he wouldn't report me.

154
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,679
That's his problem. I'm different.

155
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay. Fine.

156
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
I mean, I could tell.

157
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,400
You

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
are a person
who likes to tell on others.

159
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,039
But think about it.

160
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,760
You've been telling on others
for over 10 years.

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
What good did it do for you?

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
But if you promise not to tell on me,

163
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,679
I'll make it worth your while.

164
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,559
How? Tell me.

165
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,679
You finished that entire bowl

166
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,119
of cold Malatang.

167
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,080
Based on that,

168
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,359
I can tell that you must be

169
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,039
a person who has high demands
for good food.

170
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,919
If you don't report me,

171
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,559
I'll make sure

172
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
that you get to eat...

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,159
Fried chicken.

174
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,679
Beer.

175
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,000
Grilled skewers.

176
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,320
Hot pot.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,919
Pasta.

178
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,320
Hamburgers.

179
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,479
Grilled meat.

180
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,119
S... Stop!

181
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,280
I... I promise.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,559
Good boy.

183
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,640
Su Lie! Su Lie! Please!

184
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,359
Don't come near me!

185
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,159
Please! Just hear me out!

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
Stay away from me.

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,359
Just hear me out.

188
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,080
Why are you making things
so difficult, Su Lie?

189
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,119
Don't come any closer.

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,960
Okay. I won't.

191
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,679
I...

192
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,239
I'll stay here. Okay?

193
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,200
From that cat and mouse game earlier,

194
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,559
I learned something.

195
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,599
Who knew

196
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
that a healthy, muscular boy like you

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,919
would have a social anxiety disorder?

198
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,239
Okay. I'll be frank with you.

199
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,719
If you don't report me,

200
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,679
I guarantee

201
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,119
that every day, every moment I'm here,

202
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,239
I'll be sure to stay far away from you.

203
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,039
But if you report me,

204
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,400
and I get chased out of this house,

205
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,280
there'll be someone new
to replace me the next day.

206
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,919
Even if you report that person,
another person will come in.

207
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,919
And the cycle will keep repeating.

208
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,719
It'll just repeat itself.

209
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,479
All sorts of people will come in here!

210
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,359
You must be tired
after a long day of acting.

211
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,159
Talk fast.

212
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,840
You don't have much time left here.

213
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
You're still acting.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
Do you really not remember me?

215
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,320
Why don't I give you a hint?

216
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,919
The day before yesterday.

217
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,479
At night.

218
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,159
At the subway station.

219
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,599
A sudden kiss.

220
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,000
(That's her?)

221
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't know what you're saying.

222
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,960
Okay. I'll make things clear for you.

223
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,080
You sneaked out that night, didn't you?

224
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,640
If you report me, I'll do the same.

225
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,679
I won't let you go that easily either.

226
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,400
Do you want that?

227
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,280
I never sneaked out.

228
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Fine. Let me kiss you.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,159
I'll know if it's you or not.

230
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,679
Do you want

231
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,760
to faint again?

232
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,799
No girl would just come up

233
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,440
and try to kiss someone, right?

234
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,679
All right. It's settled, then.

235
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,599
I won't report you.

236
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,080
And you won't report me, okay?

237
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,679
I'll be leaving then.

238
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,479
You don't have to see me off.
I'll be back tomorrow.

239
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm reporting you.

240
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,359
Sir!

241
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,119
It's not like we're enemies or anything.

242
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,719
Please don't do this to me.

243
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,359
Let go of me.

244
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,440
Your other hand, too.

245
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Fine.

246
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,119
Fine.

247
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
If that's how cruel you want to be,

248
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,799
then I won't live anymore.

249
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,960
I'll go jump off a building.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
This is a basement.

251
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,960
Of... Of course I know that.

252
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,039
There's a swimming pool, isn't there?

253
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,039
I'll jump into the pool!

254
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,280
I'll drown myself!

255
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,039
Don't just stand there.

256
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,640
Come with me.

257
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,440
Come and watch me drown.

258
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520
There's something wrong with you.

259
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Aren't you tired of this?

260
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,640
Jiang Kele,

261
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,400
you are a genius!

262
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,559
You've fooled the world's

263
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,320
four most handsome men!

264
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,200
But they are

265
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,320
so different from what they are like
inside the game.

266
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,719
Especially Lu Xiao.

267
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,080
What's up with his personality?

268
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,840
He just had to make me
pull out a woman's strongest weapon.

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,159
Well, he is my "husband",

270
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,359
so it's okay.

271
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,679
I'm sure

272
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,359
that in the following days,

273
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,559
he'll fall for my charms!

274
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,239
This motorbike looks awesome.

275
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,000
Motorbike.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,919
Safety helmet.

277
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,039
Jiang Kele.

278
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,159
Granny!

279
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,159
Why are you late today?

280
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,159
You must've slacked off

281
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
and ran into people
you shouldn't have, right?

282
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,280
Me?

283
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,280
Of course not.

284
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,159
I finished cleaning
the place early today.

285
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,599
I'm just here

286
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,840
for a stroll.

287
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,440
Really?

288
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,599
But it looked like
you were lost in thoughts there.

289
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,599
Was it because you saw
the four people living there?

290
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,039
Four?

291
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,039
There are four people living
in that place?

292
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I wouldn't have known
had you not tell me that!

293
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,880
Even that didn't get you, huh?

294
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,760
You must not have met them then.

295
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,039
However,

296
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,119
I still have to give you
a piece of advice.

297
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,960
No matter

298
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,119
what you see
or who you meet inside the house,

299
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,159
you must...

300
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
You can't let anybody know.

301
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,599
Okay. Work hard.

302
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,000
Wait, Granny!

303
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,320
Why are you here today?

304
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,679
Haven't you heard?

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,039
If a person

306
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,919
is able to walk out

307
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,280
of the hospital on their own,

308
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,359
that means they've fully recovered!

309
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,719
Oh my gosh!

310
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,159
You've recovered!

311
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,559
That's great!

312
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,320
Wait!

313
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,840
We had a deal.

314
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,119
You can't go back on it now.

315
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,640
I'd still work in your stead.

316
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,880
Of course.

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
Why wouldn't I want money

318
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,359
that I don't have to work for?

319
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,640
But I feel so down

320
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,320
all of a sudden.

321
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,840
I feel like there is only

322
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,559
one phrase to describe
the rest of my life.

323
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,400
What phrase?

324
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,679
That you're going to die alone?

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,640
No.

326
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:58,679
Eat, play, love, and laugh.

327
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Granny! You had me worried for nothing.

328
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,960
That's enough from you.
I'm going to catch the subway.

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,559
Bye.

330
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,799
Bye!

331
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,479
Qianya!

332
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,960
Why wouldn't you turn on
the lights when you're at home?

333
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
You scared me!

334
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,599
What is it?

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760
Are you scared?

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,119
Don't be scared.

337
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,200
All of those people are gone now.

338
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,440
What do you mean, scared?

339
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
I'm meditating.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
Why did you buy so many things again?

341
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,280
If you have the money,
you should pay me back

342
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,119
rather than go shopping online.

343
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
These aren't my parcels.

344
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,880
"Guan Qianya". All of these are for you!

345
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:49,990
(Recipient: Guan Qianya)

346
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,400
No way.

347
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,840
I never shop online.

348
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,606
Then it must be a parcel
from that secret admirer!

349
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,439
This teddy bear looks cute.

350
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,000
This... This is horrible, Qianya!

351
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,079
(Apologize)
They've invaded our living room!

352
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,040
And who is to blame for this?

353
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,000
They would've
only reached the front door,

354
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,479
but someone just had
to bring them inside.

355
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,119
Well, I didn't mean to...

356
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,719
I'll get rid of them.

357
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,959
There's no place for these things here.

358
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,079
Qianya.

359
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,280
We can't just let ourselves be bullied.

360
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
We need to get revenge!

361
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,079
Never mind.

362
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,959
These are all just the doings

363
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,920
of silly women.

364
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,439
I'm just glad

365
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,520
that you're not one of them.

366
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,008
Only because it's you.

367
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,439
Let's drink.

368
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,920
Again?

369
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,959
When a girl drinks every day,

370
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,160
that either means something good
happened to her,

371
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,040
or something terrible happened.

372
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,760
Kele. No matter what happened,

373
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,560
tell me.

374
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,760
Let your good friend share your joy.

375
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,680
Of course, something...

376
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
I still have to give you
a piece of advice.

377
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,479
No matter

378
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,680
what you see
or who you meet inside the house,

379
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,719
you must...

380
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,280
You can't let anybody know.

381
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,839
Of course, something bad happened to me,

382
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,560
Guan Qianya!

383
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
My dearest friend

384
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,800
still can't get a boyfriend yet.

385
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,000
I feel so sad just thinking about it.

386
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,040
I can't get a boyfriend?

387
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,839
I have more potential suitors
than those who are waiting outside!

388
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,359
Use mine!

389
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,199
-Use mine!
-Use mine!

390
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,000
-Use mine!
-Use mine!

391
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,920
Use mine.

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,359
Qianya, come with me.

393
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,599
I'll drive you home.

394
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Qianya, please accept my flowers.

395
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,880
Qianya, please accept this gift.

396
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,439
Qianya.

397
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:00,959
Qianya.

398
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,280
Come with me, Qianya.

399
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,599
Oh, that's right.

400
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,079
Then why won't

401
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,280
you choose one of them?

402
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,920
Because they're just like
those virtual characters in Love Boys.

403
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,959
They aren't real.

404
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,560
They're all just sucking up to me.

405
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
You know what that means, right?

406
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,800
It's so hard to find a man

407
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
who is on the same level as I am.

408
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,959
I have one guy in mind.

409
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,359
Who?

410
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,560
Xu Guanghan.

411
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,000
Jiang Kele.

412
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,800
Do you know what else
you can do with beer

413
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
besides drinking it?

414
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,760
Eat!

415
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,280
Beer duck stew is delicious.

416
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,479
Oh, and it's good for the hair too.

417
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,000
Let me tell you...

418
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,719
That's right.

419
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,400
Would you like to nourish your hair
with some beer?

420
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,319
No, I don't want to, Guan Qianya!

421
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,959
Don't move!

422
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:36,719
Stand right there!

423
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,719
There's a reason

424
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,160
you don't have a boyfriend,

425
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,800
Guan Qianya!

426
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,959
(Subway station.)

427
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,479
(A sudden kiss.)

428
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,800
I never sneaked out.

429
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,439
Fine. Let me kiss you.

430
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:05,719
I'll know if it's you or not.

431
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,400
Are you thinking about Jiang Kele?

432
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,239
I'm thinking

433
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,839
about the food she'll bring us.

434
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm thinking about her too.

435
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,800
But whenever I do,

436
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,239
I get scared.

437
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,439
Then let me ask you this.

438
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,400
Are you going to eat the food

439
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,680
that she brings over today?

440
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,119
If you want to eat,
you'll have to overcome your fears.

441
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,040
Overcome the fears.

442
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,000
Would you like chili with that?

443
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,800
Your business looks good, Sir!

444
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
Kele, you're here.

445
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,040
Choose whatever you like.

446
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,479
Tripe, needle mushrooms,
fried dough, bamboo shoots,

447
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
mushrooms and napa cabbage!

448
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,920
No problem. I'll get them all for you.

449
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,439
Four servings of each. Raw.

450
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,920
Planning a hot pot, eh?

451
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,800
That's right.

452
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,199
If I buy them from you,

453
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,359
I won't have to worry
about washing or slicing them.

454
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,640
I can just cook them and eat them.

455
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,719
It's the usual then.

456
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,079
Medium numb and medium spice.
With the base soup in a separate bag.

457
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,199
Exactly!

458
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,359
Four servings...

459
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,280
Kele, you bought so much.

460
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,319
Is your dad back?

461
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,880
My dad?

462
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,280
He should be in Somali right now.

463
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,199
Soma...

464
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
I've heard of Somali.

465
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,239
So your dad's gone
from a sailor to a pirate!

466
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,319
I'd hope so!

467
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,959
He'd better bring me back some treasure!

468
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
If I find any treasure,

469
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,079
I'll invest them in you!

470
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,160
Thank you for the thought.
I'll pack these up for you.

471
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,920
Sir,

472
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,119
won't you give me a sausage then?

473
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,079
I'll give you four.

474
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,280
Nice!

475
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,319
Here.

476
00:22:49,382 --> 00:22:51,718
(Yao Inc.)

477
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
I have to do good today.

479
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,160
and sees that
I've turned his room sparkling clean,

480
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,880
he'll definitely fall for me.

Jiang Kele,
you are a woman of your words!

498
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,119
This is a hot pot, right?

499
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,760
I saw it in a documentary once.

500
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
It could take days
just to boil the stock.

501
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,760
That's right. I've started preparing it

502
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,920
even before I met you guys.

503
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,839
This hot pot

504
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,959
is my gift to all of you.

505
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
Come, try it.

506
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,160
Come on. Let's sit down.

507
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,680
Su Lie,

508
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,479
you can go back if you're scared.

509
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,479
I won't force you.

510
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,680
I... I'll have some before I go back.

511
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,520
Come on.

512
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:18,959
Lu Xiao.

513
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,400
Won't you come and try my cooking?

514
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,239
Kele, don't bother about him.

515
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,880
I can finish all of this on my own.

516
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,079
Kele.

517
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,359
This hot pot

518
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,800
is basically
a larger version of Malatang.

519
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,400
It could also be
that Malatang is a simplified hot pot.

520
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
That makes sense.

521
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,280
(Who could have ever imagined)

522
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,959
(that there would be
a day when I, Jiang Kele,)

523
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,199
(would be able
to eat hot pot with these guys?)

524
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,920
(Who could have expected)

525
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,839
(that they'd be discussing)

526
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,880
(such a silly topic as well?)

527
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
Jiang Kele!

528
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,560
Here!

529
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,880
What's the matter?

530
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,560
Are you satisfied with the cleaning?

531
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,319
You don't have to thank me.

532
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,359
I did what I was supposed to do.

533
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,160
Get out of Bay House right now.

534
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,839
Why?

535
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,000
Lu Xiao, what's wrong?

536
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,839
She washed my teddy bear.

537
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,800
Do you have a death wish, Jiang Kele?

538
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,959
I've never met

539
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,599
such an unreasonable man like you.

540
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,239
The teddy bear was dirty,

541
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,160
so I washed it.

542
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,160
Not only are you not grateful,

543
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,040
but you're chasing me out.

544
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,439
Why do you care if it's dirty or not?

545
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,199
I hate it when people
try to meddle with my things.

546
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,719
Get out of here right now!

547
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,119
Why should I?

548
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,959
I won't leave!

549
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,520
Lu Xiao.

550
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,479
Calm down.

551
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,959
You can't blame Kele for this.

552
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,239
If you don't want her
to touch your things,

553
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,439
just tell her.

554
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,079
So what if you have big eyes?

555
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,239
Lu Xiao... What a horrid man!

556
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,560
He's a demon!

557
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,959
Not only did he not thank me

558
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,680
for washing his teddy bear,
but he yelled at me!

559
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,400
I could have forgiven him
because he was just so handsome.

560
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,760
But he wanted to beat me!

561
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,520
No. This won't do.

562
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,640
Qianya told me this.

563
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,719
If someone bullies you,
you have to fight back.

564
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,000
That's right. I want revenge!
