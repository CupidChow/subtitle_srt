00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,120
Come with me!

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,879
We're not going with you.

3
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:02,680
We won't trust anyone ever again!

4
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,640
Where are you taking us to?

5
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,400
It has nothing to do with us!

6
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,360
Let them go!

7
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,320
They're actors signed by our company.

8
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,279
Here's the contract.

9
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,960
I have a contract too.

10
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,000
I have the endorsement contract too.

11
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,760
You've been conned.

12
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,159
This is an exclusive contract.

13
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,719
Everything about them belongs to me.

14
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,959
Nonsense!
They signed my contract first!

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,879
They're mine!

16
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,120
I don't care! Get them!

17
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:26,719
Wait! Wait!

18
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,040
I have an idea!

19
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Why don't you guys fight it out?

20
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,119
We'll go with whoever wins.

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,680
Trying to divide us?

22
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:38,439
Everyone, beat them until they agree!
We'll split the contracts!

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,119
Stop!

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,639

25
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,240

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Lu Xiao! Why are you here?

32
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,760
You're working
the night shift today, right?

33
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,000
I came to keep you company.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I missed you all day.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,519
How's the interview?

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
It went well.

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,760
It went well?

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
Then... Should I be calling you

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,320
Mr. Lu from now on?

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,919
Actually, I'm still undecided.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,720
Their offer wasn't that good.

42
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,639
So I thought I'd check out

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,360
what other jobs there might be
for me tomorrow.

44
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,399
Sounds good.

45
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll support you
no matter what you do.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
Then...

47
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,000
What else do you think I can do

48
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,759
besides becoming a piano teacher?

49
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,039
Besides a piano teacher...

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
What about a dance instructor?

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,559
I'll give it a try tomorrow.

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,960
You must be tired
from running around all day.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,679
I'll treat you to something good.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,919
Sure.

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,320
Hold on.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,559
I am going

58
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,919
to teach you
the "Kele" way of eating this.

59
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,360
One bite of the croquette
and a bite of the Shizuren noodles.

60
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,279
Try it.

61
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,880
One bite of the croquette...

62
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,399
Is it good?

63
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,360
It's delicious.

64
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,839
Then... Do you want to try another way?

65
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,199
One bite of the croquette
and one bite of "Kele".

66
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,679
Take a bite of the croquette first.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,119
Was it good?

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,839
What's that sound?

69
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,119
Qianya.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Why aren't you asleep yet?

71
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,679
I can't sleep.

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
You can't sleep again?

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,880
Do you want me to help?

74
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,920
Cross your hands and close your eyes.

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,600
Imagine

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,920
that you are in a completely dark room.

77
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,920
Lying on a soft, comfortable bed.

78
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,239
At this moment,

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,839
your face
is the center of your emotions.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,679
It's peaceful. It's relaxed.

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,760
The muscles on your face

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
are slowly relaxing.

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
What is it?

84
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,480
Does that not work for you anymore?

85
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:43,920
That's not it.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,679
I figured out

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,559
what I'm going to do next.

88
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,000
The news reported

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,040
that the four of you existed.

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,760
At that time,

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,839
I thought it'd be great
if I could meet you guys.

92
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,440
I never imagined

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,519
that one of them
could be sitting before me right now.

94
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,559
Do you play the game as well?

95
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,480
Yes.

96
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,040
But I chose Su Lie.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,399
I had him work out with me.

98
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,720
Su Lie. He works out a lot.

99
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,720
What do you guys do
in that place

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,200
called the Bay House

101
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
for all these years?

102
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,600
We usually practice singing and dancing.

103
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
Sometimes, we work out too.

104
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,880
That doesn't sound much different

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,079
from what dancers do.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,799
I heard

107
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,880
your parents passed away
a long time ago.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
And you met Xu Guanghan

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,679
when you were in the streets.

110
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,920
Is that true?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Could you keep the questions
related to the interview?

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,119
I've already asked

113
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,640
what I needed to know.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
You can sing and dance.

115
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,799
You're well-suited
to be a dance instructor at our studio.

116
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,839
Besides, you're so popular right now.

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,399
I'm sure

118
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,079
that you'll bring a new image

119
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,959
to our studio if you join us.

120
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,880
Does that mean I'm hired?

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,440
Do I have a reason not to hire you?

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,799
When can I start?

123
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,880

It's written here.

Over 38.2 percent

suffer from insomnia and anxiety.

The prevalence in the elderly
is as high as 60 percent.

Losing sleep has serious impacts

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,920
on one's health, work, and lifestyle.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,119
There is no perfect cure
for it until today.

134
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,200
They can only rely
on long-term medication.

135
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,399
Just like I did back then.

136
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,799
Long-term medication

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,279
could also have serious side effects
on one's physical and mental health.

138

I may have failed
in running a social media platform,

139
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,679
but I gained a lot of experience.

140
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,519
And now,

141
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,480
we can create an application

142
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,519
targeting at people
who have trouble sleeping.

143
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,119
We can help relieve their suffering.

What do you think?

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
I think it's good.

146
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,119
The social media platform failed

147
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,399
because people
were addicted to the virtual world.

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Since we can't wake those people up,

149
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,359
we can help those
with sleeping difficulties

to sleep better.

Yes.

Two days ago,
I was still worried about you.

156

You are much stronger than I think.

157
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,440
Well, I'm an undefeatable bug.

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Well, if you need any help,

159
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,480
let me know.

160
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Help me look for information then.

161
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Okay.

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Give that to me.

That move earlier was too difficult.

169

I can't get it right.

teach it to me again?

Sure.

00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,159
Mr. Lu, I don't know
how to do that move too!

173
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,799
Like...

174
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,239
I can't do this part right.

175
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,400
Teach me, Mr. Lu!

176
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
Mr. Lu, I forgot all the moves.

177
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,359
Teach me, please?

178
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Okay.

179
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,039
Mr. Lu!

180
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,359
I came first!

181
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,679
No, I was first!

182
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,039
Mr. Lu, teach me!

183
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,919
Okay! Stop!

184
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,719
Since everyone needs extra lessons,

185
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,679
why don't we practice it again together?

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
Together?

187
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
Let's get back and practice.

188
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
Never mind.

189
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,640
All right. Follow me.

190
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,400
Five, six, seven, eight.

191
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,239
One, two, three, four.

192
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,000
Five, six, seven, eight.

193
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,919
Buckle up. Show some spirit, okay?

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you aren't as popular,

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
then learn from him.

196
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,080
You can't have his looks,

197
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,239
but still you'd try to
pick up some of his charm.

198
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,080
There's no use sulking here.

199
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,400
Go get busy.

200
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,000
(TR Dance Studio)
Five, six, seven, eight.

201
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,960
One, two, three.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,159
Mr. Lu, can I invite you to dinner?

203
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,760
Mr. Lu, let's have a meal together!

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,719
No, that's all right.

205
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,719
Um... Wait.

206
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,039
Mr. Lu!

207
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,320
It's late. Let's meet again tomorrow.

208
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,159
All right.

209
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,960
You have to come tomorrow.

210
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,679
We'll have a meal together then!

211
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes, tomorrow. Together.

212
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,479
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

213
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

214
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,679
See you tomorrow.

215
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,080
I don't know a lot of the moves!
You have to teach me!

216
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,799
Bye.

217
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,359
Bye. See you tomorrow.

218
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,320
Bye.

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,599
Why are you here?

220
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm here to pick up my boyfriend

221
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,080
and accompany him home.

222
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,239
How's work today?

223
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,400
I see you're quite popular.

224
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,200
I didn't expect it too.

225
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,640
People in the outside world

226
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,880
are actually quite friendly.

227
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
The salary is good
and there's even a bonus.

228
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,400
The boss is nice too.

229
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,479
Wow.

230
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,599
It's great that you didn't choose
to become a piano teacher.

231
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,479
This job sounds amazing.

232
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Yes.

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
And I noticed something.

234
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
What?

235
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:26,440
No matter if it's the virtual you

236
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,760
or the real you,

237
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,840
my Lu Xiao is amazing!

238
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,440
It was my first time
teaching someone to dance too.

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,359
I was quite nervous.

240
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,679
Don't worry. You did great!

241
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,280
It's not easy to face

242
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
all those women on your own.

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
All right.

244
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
It is your first day of work today.

245
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,719
I'll gather everyone

246
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,479
and let's have a hot pot feast
to celebrate!

247
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Sounds great!

248
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,479
Hello, Granny. What is it?

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,320
What?

250
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,840
Okay. I got it.

251
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,840
What's wrong, Kele?

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
Granny said that Su Lie and Luo Ke

253
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
haven't gone back
to her place for two days.

254
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,440
They must've been off having fun.

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,799
Don't worry.

256
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,679
Why don't we go look for them?

257
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,760
Hello?

258
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,119
Ms. Guan, something big happened!

259
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,359
What is it now?

260
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:30,880
It's Mr. Cui.

261
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,799
Didn't you go to see your ex-wife?

262
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,119
I did.

263
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,280
We even...

264
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,479
No, I'm talking about something else.

265
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,960
What? Did they get caught
and brought back to the Bay House again?

266
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,799
That's exactly it.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
It's about the Bay House.

268
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,479
I heard my ex-wife

269
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,039
said that it's been turned
into a tourist attraction.

270
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,159
And guess

271
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,000
who her friend saw there?

272
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,400
I found them.

273
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,840
This is the gift for you.

274
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,719
Thank you.

275
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,200
Why do you think
these people are so excited?

276
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
It's like they've never seen anything.

277
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,840
Maybe they've never
seen a house as big as this one.

278
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
This is the gift for you.

279
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,039
Thank you.

280
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, right.

281
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,599
Guan Qianya was a CEO as well.

282
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,200
But her house isn't that big either.

283
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,960
We even had to sleep on mattresses.

284
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,039
Grandma Fushun's place was worse.

285
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,039
Only a presidential suite
of a five-star hotel

286
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,479
could be better than this place.

287
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,000
This is for you.

288
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,840
Thank you.

289
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,719
Get over here.

290
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,359
Got it.

291
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,840
Stop! Stop!

292
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,280
Why are you guys here?

293
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you coming back
or are you here to visit?

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,159
Neither.

295
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
We'll just get in and get out.

296
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Get in and get out?

297
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,640
That means you're visiting.

298
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,679
Okay. Then we'll get the tickets.

299
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,960
Come visit tomorrow.

300
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,679
(Open to the public from 9 a.m. to late night)
We're closed for today.

301
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,599
Then,

302
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,960
get Su Lie and Luo Ke out here.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I have something to tell them.

304
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
No, no, no.

305
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,000
We're just security guards.

306
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,479
We're only here to guard the place.

307
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,880
We don't have the authority
to tell them to come out.

308
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,919
Hey, man.

309
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,479
Hello, bro.

310
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,159
Family.

311
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:30,919
Family.

312
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,159
We're a family.

313
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,000
I haven't seen you in a while.

314
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,599
You lost weight, didn't you?

315
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,400
Really?

316
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,880
Here.

317
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,520
Kele does know
how to do things, doesn't she?

318
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,840
Scan this.

319
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,000
You should eat something good.

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,239
Take a break. Have a late-night snack.

321
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:51,400
Well... Welcome to
the family of Yao Inc.!

322
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,479
Please.

323
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,479
Welcome.

324
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,039
A warm welcome.

325
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,239
Bro, did I do it well this time?

326
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,919
Those tourist ladies were so nice.

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Even though
they've never lived in a big house,

328
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,799
they gave us a lot of gifts.

329
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,640
Yes. The women who came here

330
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,159
are different from those outside.

331
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,119
They're kind and generous.

332
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,799
Oh my gosh.

333
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,119
A woolen cap.

334
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,719
This fits my image in the game.

335
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,919
But I won't use this in the house.

336
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
What's this?

337
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,320
Sunscreen.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
I can't even see the sun in here.

339
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Why would they give me sunscreen?

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,760
Because

341
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,119
they're treating you
like the virtual character

342
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,320
in the game.

343
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,080
They think you've been
going surfing every day.

344
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,239
These people are hilarious.

345
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,520
They can't even differentiate
between virtual and real world.

346
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,640
Why are you guys back?

347
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,159
We've claimed the rooms
in the lower floor.

348
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,400
You have to sleep upstairs.

349
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,119
We're not here
to fight you guys for rooms.

350
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,640
Did Xu Guanghan catch you guys
and bring you guys back here?

351
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,679
No, it wasn't him. It was Lei Na.

352
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,479
We were conned
and almost got beaten up.

353
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,599
Lei Na appeared just in time

354
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,960
and brought us back here.

355
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,559
She even gave us this job.

356
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,599
What job?

357
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,799
Weren't you guys rehired?

358
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,080
How could you not know?

359
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,280
We're basically doing the same things.

360
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,000
All we have to do
is to eat, sing, and dance.

361
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,039
The only difference is that

362
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,159
there are tourists now.

363
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,200
They'll take photos with us
every now and then.

364
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,640
So you guys are actors
in a tourist attraction!

365
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,359
Xu Guanghan really
knows how to make money, huh?

366
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,960
We weren't rehired.

367
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,640
We're here to get you guys out of here.

368
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
We did all of that
to get out of this place.

369
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,679
Why did you come back?

370
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,000
Come on. Let's go back.

371
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,799
No.

372
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,880
We signed a contract.

373
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,080
What contract?

374
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,479
Another contract to imprison you guys?

375
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,559
No. It's different.

376
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,159
The contract didn't
say that we couldn't go out.

377
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,479
We asked for it to be added on.

378
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,280
The world outside is too scary.

379
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,080
We want to stay here.

380
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,359
We don't want to go anywhere else.

381
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,559
Why?

382
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,840
Because the world outside
isn't good at all.

383
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,159
We need to work
and earn money.

384
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,200
And there are many scammers.

385
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,960
We get all we need here

386
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
and we don't even have to do anything.

387
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,559
Why should we leave?

388
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,039
You guys

389
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,880
have already tried the food outside.

390
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,159
But you have to eat
healthy food here.

391
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,039
Don't you crave the food outside?

392
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,359
You guys don't know about this.

393
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,479
Even though we're still
eating healthy food,

394
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,439
it's

395
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,079
more of a performance now.

396
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,359
The tourists would bring us
lots of tasty food.

397
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,680
The more we eat, the happier they are.

398
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Su Lie even dropped his banana.

399
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,280
They are all so excited about it.

400
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,000
Su Lie, weren't you afraid of women?

401
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,400
So many women come here every day.

402
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,239
Aren't you afraid?

403
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,439
But there are even more
women out there, aren't there?

404
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
In order to stay here and keep this job,

405
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
I'll do my best to overcome it.

406
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,839
Su Lie. Luo Ke.

407
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
You guys are helpless!

408
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,560
Why?

409
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,239
There's nothing wrong
with us trying to make a living.

410
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,719
Don't you guys have any pride as humans?

411
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,439
Xu Guanghan kept you guys here

412
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,640
as attractions for visitors
to see you and feed you.

413
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,280
How are you guys

414
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,000
any different from a monkey in a zoo?

415
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,119
Well, humans evolved from monkeys.

416
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,280
You guys might not even

417
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,239
be able to find a better job than we do.

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,599
Never mind.

419
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm tired of this.

420
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,400
Let them do what they want.

421
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,079
This friendship is over!

422
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,239
Fine.

423
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,280
But remember,

424
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,280
you're not the ones
who ended this friendship.

425
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,119
We're the ones
who decided to leave you guys.

426
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm so mad, Lu Xiao!

427
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,560
Beat them up for me!

428
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,839
That's enough. Let's go.

429
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,520
Let me know if you ever

430
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,719
want to come back.

431
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,479
I'll put in a good word
for you with Mr. Xu.

432
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,319
Don't be so upset, guys.

433
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,160
They've also seen the world outside.

434
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,040
So we should respect their choice

435
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,719
to stay in the Bay House.

436
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm not upset with them.

437
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,000
It's hard enough to hold myself back
from how angry I am.

438
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,839
They made that decision

439
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,119
because that's their view

440
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,040
of the world.

441
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,239
We can't convince them.

442
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:20,439
And they can't possibly

443
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,959
be like Xu Nian and Lu Xiao.

444
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm telling you.

445
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,119
I was so worried about them, you know.

446
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,400
I was worried

447
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,920
about how they'd survive in the outside world.

448
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:30,880
And now?

449
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,239
I have nothing to worry about anymore!

450
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll just leave them to their demise.

451
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,479
Lu Xiao,

452
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
don't be mad.

453
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
After I gave him a punch,

454
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,719
I think I can let it go now.

455
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,680
All right.

456
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,560
Let's not talk about

457
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,079
such unhappy things anymore.

458
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,160
I have a good news to share with you!

459
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,439
Lu Xiao's great at work.

460
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,400
He became a celebrity instructor

461
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,079
at a dance studio!

462
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,880
I have a good news too.

463
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,280
Xu Nian and I

464
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,079
are going to create
an application together.

465
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,400
Specifically for people with insomnia.

466
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,839
Qianya, that's a great idea!

467
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,359
You're using your pain
to cure somebody's pain.

468
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
It'll be our win

469
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,199
if Xu Guanghan ever uses this app,

470
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,119
don't you think?

471
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,160
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

472
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,040
We'll be meeting the investors tomorrow.

473
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
That's great.

474
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,920
The first thing I'll do
is to invest in you guys

475
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,959
when I get my salary next month!

476
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,800
Okay.

477
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,719
Let's have a toast.

478
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,199
I hope you'll manage
to get the funds you need.

479
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,599
And for us

480
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,239
to get used to living
in the outside world soon.

481
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:39,959
Cheers!

482
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,719
Cheers!

483
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,239
What do you think about the project?

484
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
I think you don't need to ask for funds

485
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,800
for this project.

486
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,839
All you have to do is to make copies
of your proposal and sell them.

487
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,079
Reading it could cure insomnia.

488
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
You might not understand it as well

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,400
because you don't have

490
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
any issues with your sleep.

491
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,359
Maybe that's why you can't relate
to the pain of our target users.

492
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,160
Yes. That's right.
If I can't relate to it,

493
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
why would I want to invest in it?

494
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,000
We won't take up
any more of your time then.

495
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,680
We've set up a meeting
with another investor as well.

496
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,479
Great.

497
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,479
I can't stay here a moment longer.

498
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,400
I'd better go back and take a nap.

499
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,000
It's okay.

500
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,199
You must be Xu Nian.

501
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,959
I came because I saw your name

502
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:46,920
on the proposal.

503
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,599
I have a few questions for you.

504
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
Is your father

505
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,479
the famous Xu Guanghan?

506
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,079
Why didn't you stay and assist him?

507
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,079
But instead, you decided

508
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,239
to start your own business?

509
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,040
Does every wealthy kid

510
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,160
want to prove themselves
through hard work?

511
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,560
They would only go back to inherit
their parents' wealth

512
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,719
when they fail?

513
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,079
I have nothing to do with Xu Guanghan.

514
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,000
Please do not mention him and me

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,199
in the same sentence again.

516
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,439
You guys got into a fight?

517
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,760
Will you guys ever make up?

518
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:11,880
No.

519
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,479
What do you want?

520
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,040
I want to use him

521
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
to get connected to Xu Guanghan.

522
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,119
Did you really think
I was interested in this project?

523
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,400
Why don't you take a look
at the proposal?

524
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,160
No.

525
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,760
I have a clear goal

526
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
in mind when I do things.

527
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,640
Since you no longer
have anything to do with Xu Guanghan,

528
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,880
then let's not waste each other's time.

529
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,800
Don't mind him.

530
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,640
I've met tons of weird investors

531
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,560
like him.

532
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,800
There's another one.

533
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,520
I only have five minutes.

534
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,599
Let's get to the point.

535
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,079
Then

536
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,560
I'll brief you on our proposal.

537
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,280
No need.

538
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,119
I read it on my way here.

539
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,160
The project seems fine.

540
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,959
Then...

541
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,280
Are you willing
to be our angel investor?

542
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,760
I haven't finished yet.

543
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,680
The project is fine.

544
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,640
But Guan Qianya is not.

545
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,040
Why not?

546
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,040
I have many years of experience
in starting a business.

547
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,079
I built Crush On Love...

548
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,439
You're still bringing up
your company that went bankrupt?

549
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,560
It could have had a bright future.

550
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,439
But you ruined it.

551
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,640
Guan Qianya,

552
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,479
have you ever reflected

553
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
on how you got to where you are today?

554
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,520
It's because this world is too foolish.

555
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,920
This world?

556
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,119
There are so many

557
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,119
companies that run social software.

558
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,079
But why did yours fail
when theirs did not?

559
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,040
That's because Qianya stood up

560
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,479
against Xu Guanghan.

561
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,239
If it's not the world that's wrong,

562
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,760
it's your competitor.

563
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,680
You are as laughable as they say.

564
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,439
If someone who keeps failing,

565
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,479
just keeps finding excuses,

566
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,920
they won't succeed

567
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
no matter what they do.

568
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,000
Aren't you in a rush?

569
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,199
If you aren't interested,

570
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
you can leave.

571
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,920
Guan Qianya,

572
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:10,439
where does
all that pride of yours come from?

573
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,959
I did my research before I came.

574
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,599
Your company's done for.

575
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,959
You lost your house and your car.

576
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,280
You'd probably
have to sleep in the streets soon.

577
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,439
You want to start over
with these slides?

578
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,800
Not likely possible.
Stop wasting your time.

579
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,560
Let me tell you this.

580
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,719
You've long been

581
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,439
blacklisted among investors.

582
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:27,479
Of course,

583
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,599
I don't care how many
investors you've met before this,

584
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,640
but those who are still
willing to meet you

585
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,719
are either

586
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,640
ones with ulterior motives

587
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
or newbies in the investment business.

588
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,520
Then which one are you?

589
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,319
As a businesswoman,

590
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,079
I'm here to give you a piece of advice.

591
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,839
Stop embarrassing yourself.

592
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,439
That's all I have to say.

593
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,400
And that's five minutes. See you.

594
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,319
It's okay. We still have chances.

595
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,880
Goodbye.

596
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,800
Bye.

597
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,119
What is it, Lu Xiao?

598
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,640
Boss, I have something to tell you.

599
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,560
Speak.

600
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,239
I want to quit.

601
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,239
Why?

602
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,760
Is the pay not high enough?

603
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,640
Were you approached by other studios?

604
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Now, I'm curious.

605
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,040
Why do you want to quit?

606
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,000
Because during the class today,

607
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,160
that girl...

608
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,280
Your move here was...

609
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,680
You want to quit

610
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
just because of that?

611
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,359
It's not a small matter.

612
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,599
It's harassment.

613
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,479
What sort of harassment?

614
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,640
You're the instructor,
and she's the student.

615
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
It's perfectly normal

616
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,839
to have physical contact
when you're teaching her to dance.

617
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,439
You're thinking too much into it.

618
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,680
Our female students

619
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,800
are all good students.

620
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,000
They wouldn't do something like this.

621
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,439
There's another thing as well.

622
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Mr. Lu,
I have something to tell you.

623
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,199
Go ahead.

624
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,560
Come closer.

625
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,560
Closer.

626
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,640
Just tell me. I'm listening.

627
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:24,959
Come closer.

628
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,400
That's a small matter too.

629
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
You call that a small matter too?

630
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,800
All she did was give you
a peck on the cheek.

631
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,119
She's just kissing goodbye.

632
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,880
If you're not used to it,

633
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
I can help you practice it every day.

634
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,680
That way, you'll get used to it.

635
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,560
No need.

636
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,359
All right. Go back to work then.

637
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,079
What? Is there something else?

638
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,119
Mr. Lu,

639
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,760
are you free after class?

640
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,719
Let's have dinner together.

641
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,000
Sorry.

642
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,280
I have something to do after work.

643
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,800
What could be more important than work?

644
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,439
If you promise to have dinner with me,

645
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll take care of your
KPI for this month.

646
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,560
If you go to a bar with me...

647
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,439
I'll have you covered
for the next six months.

648
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,520
Sorry. You came to the wrong person.

649
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,800
I have no obligation to go out with you.

650
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,239
What are you acting
all pure and noble for?

651
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,800
Who do you think you are?

652
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,280
If the people like you,
then you're a celebrity instructor.

653
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,359
But without them,

654
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,680
you're nothing.

655
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,719
I'm going to see your boss right now.

656
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,239
I'm going to cancel my membership!

657
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,400
Well, that's not funny.

658
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,520
You think she crossed the line, too,
don't you?

659
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,760
I think you're socially inept!

660
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,719
It's just dinner and a drink.

661
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,079
What's the big deal?
You've got nothing to lose.

662
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,079
Can't you treat a client as a friend?

663
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,640
But she...

664
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,680
What's with the "but"?

665
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,040
You need to understand
what it means to work with clients.

666
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,640
Understand?

667
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,079
If you get along with your clients,

668
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,359
your KPI will go up.

669
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,199
If your KPI goes up,
then your bonus increases as well.

670
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:53,599
Isn't that something good?

671
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,439
I won't be happy if that's

672
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
how my KPI goes up.

673
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,839
If you insist
on keeping your principles,

674
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,880
then I'm afraid this job isn't for you.

675
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,000
With that attitude of yours,

676
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,760
you won't last long
no matter where you work.

677
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,680
If you can't even stand
a little pressure like this,

678
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,680
then you should just go back
to your old life.

679
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,280
In this world,

680
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,640
no one is going
to give you something for nothing.

681
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,599
Oh, there is someone who would.

682
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,880
Xu Guanghan.

683
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,119
Qianya, why don't we leave first?

684
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,000
We still have another investor coming.

685
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,479
We've been waiting for two hours.

686
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,280
But I want to wait for them.

687
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,599
Why don't I take you to a place?

688
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,680
Where?

689
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,000
A place you know well.

690
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,839
Are you a student of ours?

691
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,079
Or are you interested
in having classes?

692
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,199
Oh, no. I'm here to pick up someone.

693
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,199
Pick up someone? Who?

694
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,239
Lu Xiao. I'm here to pick him up.

695
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,439
If he isn't finished yet,

696
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,719
I'll just wait over there.

697
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,000
Don't bother.

698
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
I fired him.

699
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Fired?

700
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,319
Isn't he a celebrity instructor here?

701
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,599
His dancing is great.

702
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,800
Why would you fire him?

703
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,079
Because he doesn't love this job enough.

704
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,839
Because he doesn't know
how to deal with people.

705
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,239
He doesn't know
how to deal with clients.

706
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,079
He's not dedicated enough,
and neither is he crafty enough.

707
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,439
Someone like him

708
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,239
should just stay in the Bay House.

709
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,119
It's not that easy to survive

710
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,359
