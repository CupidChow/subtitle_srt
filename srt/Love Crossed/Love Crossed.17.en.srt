1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,720
Are you all right?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,639
He has a fever and needs rest.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,599
Let's go outside.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,599
Okay.

5
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,680
When is the time
that you don't have to go to rehearsal,

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,720
workout,

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,080
and data collection,

8
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,080
and that no one disturbs you
for at least two hours?

9
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:45,080
If it's in Bay House,

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,799
the only time is when I have a fever
and has been put on a drip.

11
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,159
Is there no other ways?

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,520
No.

13
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,680
Give yourself a fever then.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,760
What do we do?

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,440
He has such a high fever. But
we couldn't send him to the hospital.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,760
Just ask for Lei Na's help will do.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're right. Let's do it.

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Let's go.

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,839
Did you manage to get her?

20
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,760
Why isn't there any response?

21
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,160
Don't worry. Lei Na will be here.

22
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,920
=Love Crossed=

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,910
=Episode 17=

24
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,920
Lei Na.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
You have such
great techniques.

26
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,120
When you gave me an injection last time,

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
did you make a blunder on purpose?

28
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,239
The three of them
will continue to rehearse.

29
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,840
Stay here and look after Lu Xiao.

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
I'll be back in two hours
to remove the needle.

31
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,280
Hold on.

32
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,719
Could you slow down the infusion rate?

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm worried that it'll hurt him.

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,680
Don't worry.
I've adjusted it to a slow rate.

35
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,599
Otherwise, it pains you to see it, huh?

36
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,120
Take care of him.

37
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,199
Lu Xiao, bear with it.

38
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,759
I'm not as professional
as Lei Na.

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,359
Let's go.

40
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,740
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station,
Entrance 6)

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,560
Lu Xiao, wait up!

42
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,919
Take the medicine.

43
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
No, we're running out of time.

44
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,960
Hurry. Listen to me.

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,359
Eat it.

46
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,519
We're here to visit a patient,
Jiang Wenyue.

47
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Sure, please register your name.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,120
Lu Xiao, go ahead. I'll take care of it.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,919
Okay.

50
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,400
What's your name?

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Jiang Kele.

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,799
I was asking for his name.

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,479
Li Zhenyu.

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
Relationship?

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,799
I'm his girlfriend.

56
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,039
I meant his relationship
with the patient.

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,400
I see. The patient.

58
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,519
Mother and son.

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,479
And you?

60
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,560
I told you. I'm his girlfriend.

61
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,799
No visiting is allowed
for non-immediate family members.

62
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,079
You can wait outside.

63
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Mom.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,639
Is that you, Zhenyu?

65
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,759
Come over.

66
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,359
Yes.

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,000
Mom, I'm Zhenyu.

68
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
I came

69
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,479
to apologize to you.

70
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
It's all my fault.

71
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm the reason Cheng Jun died.

72
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,519
Mom, I'm sorry.

73
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,000
It was an accident,

75
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,079
and it wasn't your fault.

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,440
I've never blamed you for it.

77
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:24,519
Son.

78
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,039
Where have you been all these years?

79
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
You left without saying a word.

80
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,560
Do you know

81
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,960
I've been looking for you
all these years?

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,720
Mom.

83
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,880
I thought you would blame me for it.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,519
That's why I ran away.

85
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,919
I thought

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,199
that would make you feel better.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,400
Silly kid, why would I blame you?

88
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,560
I lost a son.

89
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,880
I don't want to lose another son too.

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,960
Mom, I'm sorry.

91
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,759
Stop crying.

92
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,479
Don't cry.

93
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,720
Cry no more.

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,720
Ever since I was put in this ward,

95
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,359
I thought

96
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
there was nothing else
that tied me down.

97
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
But...

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,920
But when I think of you,

99
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,519
I wonder if there's still a chance
for us to meet again.

100
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,240
Mom.

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,879
I came too late.

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,400
I made you wait for so long.

103
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,519
Mom, I'm sorry.

104
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,720
It's not late.

105
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,439
Not at all.

106
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,079
All these years,

107
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,759
I've been happy.

108
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,960
Mom.

109
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,800
Don't cry.

110
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,879
Mom.

111
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,840
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,319
Don't cry.

113
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
Don't cry.

114
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,679
I'm glad you're back.

115
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:12,999
Mom.

116
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,199
Lu Xiao.

117
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,879
Are you all right?

118
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,879
Kele, thanks for bringing me here.

119
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,639
Wait, let's talk later.

120
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,480
There are 27 minutes left.

121
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Let's go now.

122
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,439
-Let's go.
-Come on.

123
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,160
Where's my motorbike?

124
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,119
Didn't you park it here?

125
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,600
I did.

126
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,160
Oh, no. We're going to be late.

127
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,319
Let's take a cab.

128
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:14,720
Sir.

129
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Where to?

130
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

131
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,920
Sorry, it's out of my way.

132
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,840
I need to hand over the shift soon.

133
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Close the door, please. Thank you.

134
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,439
It's fine. Let's wait for another cab.

135
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:27,759
Where to?

136
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,519
Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

137
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,559
Are you going the same way, sir?

138
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
-Ma'am, hold on!
-Sir.

139
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,079
Drive, please.

140
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,040
Ma'am, we came first!

141
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
To the market.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,759
What's the rush to go to the market?

143
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Hi, where to?

144
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,600
Let's hop in first.

145
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,960
Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

146
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,999
Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

147
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,319
Let's go.

148
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,720
What's going on?

149
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,960
Who knows? Why is there a traffic jam?

150
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,879
Sir, what do we do?

151
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,439
How long will it take?

152
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,920
Based on my experience,

153
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,280
it will take at least

154
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,319
another half an hour.

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,999
-Half an hour?
-Half an hour?

156
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,879
Can we take a detour?

157
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,519
This is the only way

158
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,800
to Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station.

159
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,819
(Level of Completion, Luo Ke 92%,
Lu Xiao 96%, Xu Nian 99.9%, Su Lie 90%)

160
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,040
Lu Xiao's data
is making a lot of improvement.

161
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
It has reached 96 percent.

162
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,679
I didn't expect Jiang Kele
to be of such great help.

163
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,639
Why not?

164
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,240
I saw it coming.

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
That's why I let her stay.

166
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,040
As expected of Mr. Xu,
the great strategist.

167
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Mr. Xu.

168
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,519
Have you noticed

169
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,840
that Xu Nian's data is improving too?

170
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
(Level of Completion, Luo Ke 92%,
Lu Xiao 96%, Xu Nian 99.9%, Su Lie 90%)

171
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
It's 99.9 percent.

172
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,119
It's almost perfect.

173
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,720
Mr. Xu, don't you find it weird?

174
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,879
Jiang Kele is the only girl here.

175
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,119
Could it be a love triangle?

176
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,759
Actually, I thought the same too.

177
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,119
But based on my observation,

178
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,480
Jiang Kele and Xu Nian

179
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
rarely come in contact.

180
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,720
Is it possible that Lu Xiao
caused Xu Nian

181
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
to have a mood swing?

182
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
What mood swing could there be?

183
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,840
Does Lu Xiao have a mood swing
because of Xu Nian?

184
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,319
I'll keep an eye on this.

185
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
It's time to remove the needle
for Lu Xiao anyway.

186
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,879
Go on.

187
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,600
Okay.

188
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,240
Hurry up.

189
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,199
I can't take it anymore. Slow down.

190
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,879
Hang in there. We'll get there soon.

191
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,040
Over there.

192
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:35,318
(Please do not follow
the dangerous activities.)

193
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,840
Are you okay?

194
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,840
Hang in there. We'll be there soon.

195
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,720
Lei Na.

196
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,439
This way, please.

197
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,679
Lu Xiao, are you feeling better?

198
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,920
I feel better now!

199
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,519
Lei Na.

200
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,559
Why are you here?

201
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,800
I didn't see you around earlier.

202
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,319
We were in the kitchen,

203
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,920
but we came back when we saw you.

204
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,639
You're here to remove the needle, right?

205
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,600
I already did.

206
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll pack up the things then.

207
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:51,759
It's fine.

208
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,319
I forgot to do it.
I'll take care of it now.

209
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
How do you feel?

210
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,999
I feel better now.

211
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,199
Your fever is gone.

212
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,679
Get some rest.

213
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,079
I'll be back later
to take your temperature.

214
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
-Okay.
-Lei Na, here.

215
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,480
Jiang Kele.

216
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,679
Look after him.

217
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,240
Lu Xiao.

218
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,119
Are you all right?

219
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,759
Could he be mad?

220
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:03,660
(Crush On Love)

221
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,639
Are you mad?

222
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,639
I'm not!

223
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,480
I just think you and Xu Guanghan
are the same!

224
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
You're absurd and full of sophistry!

225
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,679
Qianya!

226
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,679
Don't touch me! Enjoy your popcorn!

Yesterday, I saw the video

255
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,399
of the debate between you
and Mr. Xu on the Internet.

256
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,000
Does the game actually
have such a great influence?

257
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,880
You surfed the Internet?

258
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,799
Yes, I checked it on
the network terminal

259
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,760
with the card you gave me.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,319
I have watched

261
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,559
all your debate videos.

262
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,079
So you are against this game

263
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,199
because of your company?

264
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
In the beginning, yes.

265
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,679
But later on, I slowly discovered

266
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,439
the harm this game
brought to the society

267
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,600
was far greater

268
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,679
than the psychological comfort
it brought to some people.

269
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,439
So I'm going to fight Xu Guanghan
to the bitter end

270
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,360
even if my company will go bankrupt.

271
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:24,919
Do you want to know

272
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,840
how influential this game is?

273
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,679
Let me show you.

274
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,319
Okay.

275
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,880
Your fever has subsided.

276
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,319
I guess you'll recover tomorrow.

277
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
Well, I should get going.

278
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,240
Rest earlier.

279
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,079
Kele.

280
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,799
Could you stay and talk to me?

281
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,600
You must have been looking forward
to it.

282
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,360
That's right.

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
I've held in it

284
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,559
since we left the hospital.

285
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,679
I wanted to ask

286
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,120
what really happened between you

287
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,319
your mom and the teddy bear.

288
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,640
But I won't ask
if you don't want to talk about it.

289
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,079
Actually, she's not my mother.

290
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,439
What?

291
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
My mother died of dystocia

292
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,399
when I was born.

293
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
When I was five,

294
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,600
I begged my dad to take me
to the amusement park.

295
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,439
But there was a car accident

296
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,480
and my dad died.

297
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,880
Stay away! It's dangerous!

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,520
Dad!

299
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,360
It's dangerous.

300
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,199
My relatives wouldn't take me in.

301
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,240
They said I was a curse.

302
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,159
That I would cause the deaths
of many people.

303
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,520
So they sent me to the orphanage.

304
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,279
But the dean saw how lonely I was.

305
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,799
So she let her son, Cheng Jun,
play with me.

306
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
Cheng Jun, come!

307
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,000
Let me introduce you to someone.

308
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,199
This is Zhenyu.

309
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,640
From now on,

310
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,279
he's one of the family.

311
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,480
You're his elder brother,

312
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,559
and he's your younger brother.

313
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,240
Take care of your brother, all right?

314
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay.

315
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,279
Zhenyu, this teddy bear is for you.

316
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,880
Thank you.

317
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,159
Good boys.

318
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,199
We grew up together.

319
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,279
Just like real siblings.

320
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,679
These were probably the best years

321
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,960
as far as I could remember.

322
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:26,199
But...

323
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:30,720
The teddy bear is dirty.

324
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,079
Let's wash it.

325
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay. Let's go.

326
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,120
Hurry!

327
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,480
Cheng Jun, slow down!

328
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,319
Cheng Jun, wait up!

329
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,000
Cheng Jun, be careful!

330
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Cheng Jun!

331
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,279
Now you understand?

332
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
Yes.

333
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,600
That's why you wouldn't let me
touch the teddy bear.

334
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,039
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,559
So, from now on...

336
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
From now on,

337
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,159
there's no more secret between us.

338
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,840
We can be together now.

339
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,720
Right?

340
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,679
From now on,

341
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,919
you should stay away from me.

342
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,360
Why?

343
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,919
From the moment I was born,

344
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,279
I was destined to bring disasters

345
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,760
to people around me.

346
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,679
My dad, my mom,

347
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,840
Cheng Jun, the granny next door,

348
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,399
and even my dog.

349
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,399
Anyone who's close to me

350
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,079
is now gone.

351
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,840
If I hadn't shown up,

352
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,319
they might still be well and alive now.

353
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,640
That's why I never went back

354
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,640
after I left the orphanage.

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,760
Then, I met Xu Guanghan.

356
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,199
He took me in

357
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,799
and brought me to Bay House.

358
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,520
I've been living in guilt ever since.

359
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,079
I dare not get closer to others

360
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,360
because

361
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,399
I don't want them to get hurt.

362
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,919
I'm a curse.

363
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,199
Lu Xiao, have you been watching
too many dramas?

364
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,120
Curse?

365
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,799
You might as well say
you're the bane of all existence.

366
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,399
You're right.

367
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,640
It means the same.

368
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,399
You actually agreed with me?

369
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,520
I used to think

370
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,159
that the most naive person in Bay House

371
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,000
was Luo Ke.

372
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,039
But I never thought

373
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,679
you would be worse.

374
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Is this the reason why

375
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,159
you gave everyone the cold shoulder

376
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,079
so they would stay away from you?

377
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,159
Really? For such a petty reason?

378
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,439
It's not petty.

379
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,760
It's the fact. I can't help it.

380
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,840
So how do you explain

381
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,880
that for the past decade or so,

382
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,439
Mr. Xu, Lei Na, and Grandma Fushun

383
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,520
have been just fine?

384
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,279
And me.

385
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,799
Same goes for the three of them.

386
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,919
We're together all the time.

387
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,319
They seem perfectly fine.

388
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,279
After I met you,

389
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,439
I haven't fallen sick, not once.

390
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,919
The truth is

391
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,480
you're not a curse to begin with.

392
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,799
It was all an accident.
A mere coincidence.

393
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,000
So that's not the reason

394
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,120
you beat yourself up
and leave all of us.

395
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,919
Got it?

396
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Silly.

397
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,159
Look.

398
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,559
Only fools

399
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,240
would take all the blame

400
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,240
for everything that happened.

401
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,520
Only fools

402
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,120
would keep it to themselves

403
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,240
when they were hurt or misunderstood.

404
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,559
They swallow everything
no matter how upsetting it was

405
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,520
and tried to be the bad guy.

406
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,240
So

407
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,159
you young man

408
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,640
should stop overthinking everything.

409
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
From now on,

410
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,480
don't carry the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

411
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,279
Besides, you're not alone now.

412
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,360
You have me.

413
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,120
I'll always be by your side.

414
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,720
Having said that,
I'm not afraid of anything.

415
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm the perfect curse for bane.

416
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,199
So from now on,

417
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,399
no matter what happens,

418
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,399
let me shoulder it with you, okay?

419
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:35,919
I'm not going anywhere.

420
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
What are they doing?

421
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,159
They are queuing.

422
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,279
This is the flagship store
for Love Boys products.

423
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,720
All Love Boys products

424
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,159
are sold here.

425
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,439
And there are over 200 stores
across the country.

426
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,399
Every time there is a new product,

427
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,679
everyone queues overnight

428
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,960
to get their hands on it.

429
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
(Xu Nian)

430
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,620
(Su Lie)

431
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,919
That's just outrageous.

432
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,840
Anything?

433
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Pretty, are you here to join the queue?

434
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,360
The manager of the flagship store
is my friend.

435
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,559
I can take you in.

436
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,079
It's 5,000 yuan. How about that?

437
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:56,840
No, thank you.

438
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,919
You drive a nice car.

439
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,079
I bet this isn't much to you.

440
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,799
Really, no thanks.

441
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,640
The rich are more stingy.

442
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,640
Suit yourself and queue all night.

443
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,199
They have to queue all night?

444
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Actually, today
isn't the product launch date.

445
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,640
But in order to get
Love Boys limited-edition products,

446
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,799
they'd queue up here a night ahead.

447
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,439
Wait a second.

448
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:40,919
I bought you a phone.

449
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,159
That way, it's easier to reach you.

450
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,240
I happened to buy
a customized model of yours.

451
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,000
So the wallpaper and
the protective case is your picture.

452
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,039
Right.

453
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,439
(You have a new message.)

454
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
Well, it's your exclusive model.

455
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,679
So even the voice is yours.

456
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,360
It's quite awkward.

457
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,279
But what can I do? It can't be changed.

458
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:18,960
Thank you.

459
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,020
(Yao Inc.)

460
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,840
Why are you up so early today?

461
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,120
What is this? It smells so good.

462
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,360
This is the chicken soup for Lu Xiao.

463
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,840
Look.

464
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,319
I went to the market before dawn

465
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:54,319
and bought the best black chicken.

466
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,120
I've been simmering it
for over two hours.

467
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,919
But it's still not cooked to a turn.

468
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,319
What do you think? Not bad, right?

469
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,880
I'll come back later.

470
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,000
He's sleepwalking again.

471
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,199
What is that? It smells so good!

472
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,240
It's the chicken soup
I made for Lu Xiao.

473
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,840
Can I take a sip?

474
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,600
I haven't tried chicken soup before.

475
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,279
No way. There are plenty of things
that you haven't tried before.

476
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,760
Well, it's one off the lists
if I get to try it.

477
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,319
No way.

478
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,199
Why not?

479
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,840
I came here first. So I drink it first.

480
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,079
I made this, and it's my call.

481
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,039
Besides, Lu Xiao is sick.
He hasn't tasted it yet.

482
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,159
How about this?

483
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,159
If he can't finish it,

484
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,240
I'll save the rest for you.

485
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,360
But if he does finish it,

486
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,760
I'll cook for you next time, all right?

487
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,559
Well, add more water to it.

488
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,039
No way, chicken stock
is the most nutritious.

489
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,279
How can I add water to it?

490
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Make it less fragrant next time!

491
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,439
It ruined my sleep now.

492
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,919
It's quite fragrant.

493
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,480
Almost done.

494
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll bring it to the bed for Lu Xiao.
