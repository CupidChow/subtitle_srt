1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,159
-Liar! Liar!
-Liar! Liar!

2
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,560
-Liar! Liar!
-Liar! Liar!

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,479
-Liar! Liar!
-Liar! Liar!

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,560
Get down from there!

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
Guan Qianya, women's last hope

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,319
and the leader
of the opposition against Y4.

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,799
From the video,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,360
it's clear that Guan Qianya

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,879
is addicted to Love Boys,

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,280
isn't she?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,919
-Liar! Liar!
-Liar! Liar!

12
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,799
-Liar! Liar!
-Liar! Liar!

13
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,439
Liar! Liar!

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Mr. Cui...

15
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,080
What's going on?

16
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,880
What happened?

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,322
=Love Crossed=

18
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,330
=Episode 11=

19
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,000
Ms. Qianya,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,720
how long have you
been playing Love Boys?

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,680
Ms. Qianya,

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,879
could you express your opinion, please?

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Guan Qianya, you liar!

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,959
We trusted you!

25
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,000
Ms. Qianya, could I get a word
from you, please?

26
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,120
Guan Qianya, you liar!

27
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,080
Guan Qianya! Guan Qianya!

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,919
Guan Qianya, you liar!

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
Guan Qianya, you liar!

30
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,160
What an exciting episode.

31
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,559
Ms. Guan.

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,919
Am I the biggest joke of the year

33
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,800
in the entertainment world?

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,960
I thought

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,880
we'd come together
because we had the same goal.

36
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,399
We could let down our guard
before each other,

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,279
heart to heart, back to back.

38
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,399
But the reality?

39
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,199
I'm the only one who keeps giving,

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,520
you horrid woman!

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,600
You've been lying to me from the start.

42
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,039
I've never been hurt

43
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,639
by a woman like that

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,039
all my entire life!

45
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,759
Guan Qianya.

46
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,759
You gave me a stab to the gut.

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,559
As a partner,

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,119
I made

49
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,279
an unforgivable mistake.

50
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,199
I sincerely apologize.

51
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,960
But there's no need
for emotional blackmail, right?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,160
All right. Then, we'll settle this
as business partners.

53
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,679
It's stated black and white
on the agreement.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,720
You'd have to pay for breaking the
terms as you were addicted to the game.

55
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:20,839
How much?

56
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,000
10 million.

57
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,520
Ms. Guan, get in the car.

58
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,360
Ms. Guan,

59
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,839
we can't go back to the office.

60
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,880
All the supporters
have crowded the entrances.

61
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,160
The investors are waiting
for you in the office as well.

62
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,520
Why don't I send you back home first?

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,160
Why don't you turn off your phone

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,119
and get some rest for today,

65
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,960
okay?

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,880
Mr. Cui.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,519
Are we able to withdraw 10 million

68
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,320
from the company’s account right now?

69
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,839
How much? 10 million?

70
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,440
We can't even afford
one million right now,

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,880
much less than 10 million!

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,880
Why do you need so much money?

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
No way. Ms. Guan.

74
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,359
We only lost a debate.

75
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,320
There's no need for you to run away.

76
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,480
It's the compensation for breaching
the contract with Qi Chuan.

77
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,679
Why didn't you say so earlier?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,760
You don't need to use
company funds for this.

79
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,279
I'll pay for you!

80
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,279
There.

81
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,965
(Transaction details)

82
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,839
One thousand yuan?

83
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,799
Yes, one thousand yuan.

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Why's that?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,880
I've warned you

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,040
not to play Love Boys,
haven't I?

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,519
Because I worried

88
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,440
that you'd get addicted to it
like my ex-wife did.

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,359
Get to the point.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
So I went behind your back

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,079
and changed

92
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,880
the terms of the agreement.

93
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,200
I changed the amount
from 10 million to one thousand.

94
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,359
Qi Chuan

95
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,600
is a prideful man.

96
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,119
His manager

97
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,559
is careless as well.

98
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,079
None of them noticed.

99
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,720
Mr. Cui...

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,119
Don't thank me.

101
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,559
I did it for the sake of the company.

102
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,799
By the way, Ms. Guan,

103
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,480
there's something
I still don't understand.

104
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,079
I registered the account

105
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,480
you used for Love Boys.

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,559
But I've never told
anyone else about it!

107
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,920
So how did Xu Guanghan
find out about it?

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,519
Is it possible

109
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
that he got the data
from the back-end servers?

110
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,920
Impossible.

111
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,320
I asked the IT staff

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
before I registered the account.

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,760
Tens of thousands of users

114
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,440
could generate massive amounts

115
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
of real-time data per second.

116
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,200
Looking for an anonymous account

117
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,239
would be like looking
for a needle in the haystack.

118
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,279
So I think we need

119
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,279
to investigate and find out

120
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,679
who else besides the both of us

121
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,279
knew that you played the game.

122
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,040
(We were wrong about Guan Qianya.)

123
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,079
(She's actually one of us.)

124
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,839
(What sort of leader is she?)

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,839
(Guan Qianya is a two-faced woman.)

126
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,679
What in the world is going on?

127
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,799
How did they find out

128
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,119
about Qianya?

129
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,679
Is Kele really the one

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,279
who sold me out?

131
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,320
(She has been acting weird lately.)

132
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,480
(She didn't come back on some nights.)

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,320
(Unknown men were picking up her phone.)

134
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,679
Jiang Kele, where are you?

135
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,480
It's late.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,799
Xiaoya, I have a question for you.

137
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,799
Do you know where I'm working at?

138
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,880
(She brought up her job out of nowhere.)

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,359
Here. To pay you back
for lending me the medical fee.

140
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,359
Where did you get this much money?

141
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,359
I earned them

142
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,760
with my hands, legally.

143
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,600
Qianya!

144
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
Kele, I...

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't worry. I understand.

146
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Guan Qianya, did you steal my wallet?

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
No, I didn't.

148
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,119
Yes, you did!

149
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,119
Her wallet was still inside her drawer
when she left!

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
We were the only ones left in class.

151
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,959
Then I left and when she came back,

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,160
her wallet was gone!

153
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,839
Who else could have stolen it?

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,679
You took my pen as well, didn't you?

155
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,880
I said I didn't do it.

156
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,119
Search her!

157
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
What are you guys doing?

158
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,839
Let go of her!

159
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,799
What's going on here?

160
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,320
Are you all right?

161
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,359
She stole the wallet!

162
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,279
Who stole whose wallet?

163
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,320
All of you come to my office right now.

164
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,880
I'll contact Guan Qianya's parents.

165
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,840
Sir.

166
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,479
I think it's unfair for you to only
listen to their side of the story.

167
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
And... Could you please

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
not call Guan Qianya's parents?

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
Her father passed away
when she's young.

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,159
She doesn't have a good relationship
with her mother as well.

171
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm worried that if her mother
finds out about this,

172
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,039
she'll be beaten to death.

173
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,760
Jiang Kele,
you're the class representative.

174
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,200
How do you think we should handle this?

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
I don't know.

176
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,960
But I can vouch for her on my name

177
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,799
that Guan Qianya is not a thief.

178
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,799
And

179
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,080
you might have dropped
your pen somewhere.

180
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Could you have accidentally

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,159
left your wallet somewhere?

182
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,719
Maybe you forgot to take it.

183
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,239
Why don't you check again?

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,799
If you really can't find it,

185
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:07,960
I'll pay for your loss.

186
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,440
Please don't make things hard on her.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,599
(I'm sorry, Kele.)

188
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,760
(You trusted me.)

189
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
(But I doubted you.)

190
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,640
Qianya? You were home.

191
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,719
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

192
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,119
Qianya, are you all right?

193
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,080
Don't let those people get to you.

194
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Kele.

195
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,440
Do you remember
when I was accused of stealing

196
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,080
during our second year in high school?

197
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes.

198
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,679
I think we got
into a fight with them, too.

199
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,039
No, we didn't.

200
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,640
You popped their bike's tire.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
You lost your title
as the class representative

202
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,119
because of that too.

203
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,440
You ended up
becoming a labor committee member.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,880
Oh, that's right.

205
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,719
I wouldn't have remembered that

206
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,080
if you didn't bring it up.

207
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,599
I wasn't able to get into university

208
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,280
because of that incident, you know?

209
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,119
Finally, you're looking at me now.

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,919
I was just kidding.

211
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,960
But why did you bring that up
all of a sudden?

212
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,359
Why did you have
so much faith in me back then?

213
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,880
Because you're you.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
You're my Qianya.

215
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,200
But everyone in the class
and even the homeroom teacher

216
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
thought that I stole the wallet.

217
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,919
You were the only one
who believed in me.

218
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,919
You said you didn't do it.

219
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,080
If I didn't trust you,

220
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,559
who else was I going to trust?

221
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
(That's all it took)

222
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,799
(for her to believe in me.)

223
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,520
(But why can't I do the same?)

224
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,960
I did it.

225
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,080
What?

226
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,239
I stole the wallet.

227
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,200
I took the pen.

228
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,479
That's not funny at all...

229
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,599
It's true, Kele!

230
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,400
I lied, Kele!

231
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,559
I lied to you.

232
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,039
But you still trusted me.

233
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,119
Well... That happened a long time ago!

234
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,479
Even if you did it,

235
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm sure you had your reasons!

236
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,200
Qianya,

237
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,840
I grew up with you.

238
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,799
I know who you are.

239
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,760
You're not a bad person.

240
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,719
Kele!

241
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,919
Up until earlier, I suspected you.

242
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,520
I kept thinking that it was you

243
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
who told them
that I was playing the game.

244
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,880
Of... Of course, it wasn't me...

245
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I know that!

246
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,640
But you kept acting weird.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,719
You didn't come back on some nights.

248
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,799
You met some new guys,

249
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,960
and you suddenly had a lot of money!

250
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
And you were the only one

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,919
who saw me playing that game.

252
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,039
I know you're my only friend.

253
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,479
I shouldn't doubt you.

254
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,280
But I can't help it.

255
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,760
I can't trust you
as much as you trust me, Kele!

256
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:06,840
Qian...

258
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,640
(Last night,
I saw her dancing with Xu Nian.)

259
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,679
(And the news leaked out
just this morning.)

260
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,200
(Who else was she to suspect?)

261
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,119
If you want

262
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,200
to live the rest of your life in peace,

263
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,880
you'll keep everything
about the Bay House

264
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,559
a secret.

265
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,159
Surprise!

266
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,840
What... This is...

267
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,559
The undefeatable Xu Guanghan!

268
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,963
(The undefeatable Xu Guanghan)

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
I told you.

270
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,200
You don't have to do all these things.

271
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,719
It makes me feel

272
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,280
as if I'm a greeter or something.

273
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,719
Of course not.

274
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,559
I think it makes you
look like Xu Wenqiang.

275
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Really?

276
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,880
How are things on Guan Qianya's end?

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Surrounded on all sides.

278
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
All her supporters have turned on her.

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,640
Even Qi Chuan got into a fight with her.

280
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,000
I heard

281
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,559
that he demanded
a huge sum of compensation.

282
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,400
A thousand times
the amount of the original contract.

283
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,799
So she might be going bankrupt.

284
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,760
Yes.

285
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,840
All of Crush On Love's investors

286
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,119
have pulled out.

287
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,520
This is what happens
when one tries to compete against me.

288
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,239
Even if the whole world is against you,

289
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,359
I understand you.

290
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,280
I support you.

291
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll be waiting here for you.

292
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,000
Let us work together
for the future to come.

293
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,799
Those are the new lyrics
I wrote recently.

294
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,599
I think you'd better
stick to being a secretary.

295
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,239
Okay.

296
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,919
Qianya.

297
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Come in.

298
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,159
Qianya!

299
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,640
Did you sleep well?

300
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,119
I didn't sleep.

301
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,239
Me too! I couldn't sleep at all!

302
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,960
It's my first time losing sleep!

303
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,000
This is so annoying!

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,359
I finally understand you!

305
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,640
So you came here

306
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
early in the morning
just to tell me that you couldn't sleep?

307
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,080
No, I want to show you a place.

308
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,239
Don't bother washing your face
and putting on make-up.

309
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,039
Come with me right now!

310
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,599
Now?

311
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,159
Now!

312
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,200
I can't keep it a secret anymore!
Come on!

313
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,799
Where are you taking me?

314
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,000
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

315
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,170
(Binzhou Highway)

316
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,960
We have a car.

317
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,440
Why did you bring me
to a subway station?

318
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,119
Where on earth are you taking me?

319
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,840
All you have to do is trust me.

320
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:51,919
Go in.

321
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:06,199
(Please don't follow
the dangerous activities.)

322
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
The exit is straight ahead.

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,159
Mind your steps.

324
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,000
What the heck is this place?

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,799
Careful!

326
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,479
Slowly now.

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,760
Why are we peeking
into someone else's house?

328
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,400
It's not just anybody's house.

329
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,119
Look who that is.

330
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,159
No way.

331
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,719
That's...

332
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,919
Xu Nian?

333
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,719
Yes.

334
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,880
Is this what that's been

335
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,320
bothering you over the past few days?

336
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,440
This is the biggest secret I have.

337
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,559
I can relax

338
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,679
now that I've told you about it.

339
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,840
Is this where you work?

340
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,319
I don't use this door here.
I use the front door.

341
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,839
But security is tight at the front door.

342
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Strangers can't go in.

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,359
Has Xu Guanghan been keeping

344
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,359
the four of them here all this time?

345
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,479
Well, not exactly "keep"...

346
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,599
I think they signed
a contract or something.

347
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
So I actually saw "Xu Nian" just now?

348
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,199
Y4 actually exist...

349
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,040
Yes!

350
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,560
Oh, my...

351
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,959
So...

352
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,959
The Xu Nian I saw
wasn't just a virtual character...

353
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,079
It was the real him.

354
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,871
(Love Boys)

355
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,199
Surprised, Guan Qianya?

356
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,160
You're already one step
into bankruptcy.

357
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,680
And you're still playing the game?

358
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,319
In order to help you regain yourself,

359
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,839
I've blocked your account. Sorry.

360
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,520
Xu Guanghan!

361
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,839
The back-end has found that

362
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,319
Guan Qianya has failed to login in.

363
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,199
I think she has received your mockery.

364
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,079
That wasn't mockery.

365
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,800
I genuinely want to help her
get rid of her addiction to the game

366
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,040
so that she may rise again.

367
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,119
That is the greatest show of respect
to a worthy opponent.

368
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,199
Then why did you call for Xu Nian?

369
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,479
I have something important to tell him.

370
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,640
Mr. Xu, you asked to see me?

371
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,839
You completed your task well.

372
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,400
From today on,

373
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,160
you don't have to do the
one-on-one trial anymore.

374
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
Aren't you glad that you won't have

375
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
to see that silly woman anymore?

376
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,719
You've worked hard.

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
Let's get a few more skewers
of spicy chicken wings.

378
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,479
Granny! Why are you here?

379
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,040
Are you working part-time here?

380
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,640
How much did the boss pay you?

381
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,760
Or did you become a shareholder?

382
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:38,560
Young lady,

383
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,760
must you always talk

384
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
about money?

385
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,199
Well, what else is there

386
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,239
for us to talk about

387
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,640
besides money?

388
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
How tasteless.

389
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,839
I came to see you today

390
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,401
because I have a new job for you.

391
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,359
How much does it pay?

392
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,719
It's a charity event.

393
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm working two jobs right now,

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
I don't have time for charity.

395
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,839
You're too busy.

396
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,599
But I'm sure that Qiqi
from the cosmetic shop you work at

397
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,920
would have time.

398
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,640
Go look for her then.

399
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
But I have to warn you.

400
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,359
The more passionate and eager
a person is,

401
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,520
the more money-oriented they would be.

402
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,599
I know.

403
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,599
I've thought about it.

404
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,239
So I think

405
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,880
I'll give the pay I offered to you,
which is five times your salary

406
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,040
to her.

407
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm sure she'll come
running right away then.

408
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,239
Granny!

409
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,439
Are you threatening me?

410
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,400
No, no, no.

411
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,439
This is a fair trade.

412
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:43,040
Absolutely voluntary.

413
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,479
See. Like this. Voluntary.

414
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I'll consider it then.

415
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:05,119
"Jiang Kele knelt on the ground."

416
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,479
"Cleaning the pool. Good attitude."

417
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,239
"But clumsy."

418
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,479
You did a good job monitoring her.

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,479
You made detailed notes.

420
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,880
But your writing
is a little hard to recognize.

421
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,760
"Silly. Fell into the pool."

422
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,400
"Almost died. CPR."

423
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,959
"Saved her."

424
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,079
Very suspenseful.

425
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,479
Succinct

426
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,560
but leaves plenty of room
for imagination.

427
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
Well done.

428
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,319
"Fell into the pool."

429
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
So...

430
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,560
You saved her.

431
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,560
Yes.

432
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,239
How did you save her?
Did you use something?

433
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,640
You jumped into the pool

434
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,079
and pulled her out.

435
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,079
Yes.

436
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,760
Aren't you afraid of water?

437
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,640
Yes, but I'm even
more afraid of her drowning.

438
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,760
Because that way
I won't be able to complete my task.

439
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,680
So you became braver
and overcame your fears

440
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,680
for her sake.

441
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,280
I did it to better complete

442
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,599
the task you gave me, Mr. Xu.

443
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,119
So the CPR was
for the task as well, then?

444
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,000
It's your first time
giving CPR to a girl.

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
How did you feel?

446
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,319
Her lips

447
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,560
were soft...

448
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,160
I mean...

449
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,959
There was quite
some distance between our lips.

450
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,719
Lu Xiao, what's the matter with you?

451
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,079
You weren't this nervous

452
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,479
when you were caught
sneaking out last time.

453
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,119
But today,
you're fumbling over your words.

454
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,839
It's my first time
taking on such a task.

455
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,239
I'm still not used to it.

456
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,719
Understandable.

457
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,439
"Why isn't Jiang Kele here yet?"

458
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,280
"She didn't catch a cold because
she fell into the pool, did she?"

459
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,199
"But she dried her hair

460
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,000
before she left."

461
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,359
This is great.

462
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,640
Lu Xiao, you have a gift

463
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,839
for this sort of work.

464
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,199
You're even able
to give subjective reasoning

465
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,319
to your surveillance logs.

466
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
Wonderful.

467
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,119
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

468
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,560
Keep up the good work.

469
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,280
Yes, sir.

470
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,719
I don't understand.

471
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,520
It's just a surveillance log report.

472
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,920
Why did you have to hide?

473
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm worried I won't be able
to control my expressions.

474
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,800
Lu Xiao's a clever boy.

475
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,079
He'll see through me in an instant.

476
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,479
Didn't you just get a Botox?

477
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,839
Can you even show expressions?

478
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,119
Micro-expressions.

479
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,839
It looks like our plan
is coming along perfectly.

480
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,719
Lu Xiao's data is no longer

481
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,199
fluctuating like a roller coaster.

482
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,959
It's practically a bungee jump.

483
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,119
Only a genius mind like yours

484
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,319
could think of such a genius idea.

485
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Well, then. Get something
that nourishes the brain for me.

486
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,239
Oh, right.
Get a copybook for Lu Xiao too.

487
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,800
Okay.

488
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,520
(Jingxin Nursing Home, Room 0228)

489
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,880
223...

490
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,599
225...

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,479
224, 226...

492
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,000
227, 228...

493
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,520
Hello?

494
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,160
Is anyone here?

495
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,520
Hello?

496
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,400
Two bamboo.

497
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,760
Hello, Aunty... Could I...

498
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,680
Be quiet.

499
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,319
We're in the middle
of something important.

500
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,079
Red dragon.

501
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,040
Chow!

502
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,640
Can you chow a red dragon?

503
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,640
I'm just fooling you guys.

504
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,839
You are being too serious.

505
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,319
Pong.

506
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,359
So you're not going to chow.

507
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,319
And she's not going to pong.

508
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,359
I... Win...

509
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,800
Waiting for one of the pair to win,
a red dragon.

510
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,599
You take forever to deal your hand.

511
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,160
My goodness.

512
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,680
I've already won.

513
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,520
Well, you better show us
the red dragon tile you drew.

514
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,239
Here.

515
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh, I'm sorry. I drew the wrong tile.

516
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,280
How could you mistake
a one dot for a red dragon?

517
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,000
Let's start a new round. Sheesh.

518
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,239
You guys go ahead.

519
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:20,920
I need to take a drip. Excuse me.

520
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,880
Don't be a spoilsport!

521
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:24,760
She left already.

522
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,680
Um, Aunty...

523
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
If you're done, I'd like to...

524
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,479
Come here, young lady!

525
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,119
Take a seat!

526
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,199
Here, have a seat!

527
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,479
We're short of one. Join our game!

528
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,800
No, I... I don't know
how to play mahjong!

529
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,760
That doesn't matter.

530
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,400
If you can't win, you can still lose.

531
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,199
That's right!

532
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,839
Play few rounds with us,

533
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,760
and we'll answer all of your questions

534
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
later.

535
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,040
Come on, let's build the walls.

536
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,319
Let's build the walls.

537
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,439
Young lady.

538
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,640
They're right.

539
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,199
Right!

540
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,400
Right! Come on!

541
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,439
Come on!

542
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,800
Let's play! Move your hands!

543
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,359
Come on! Move your hands!

544
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,239
Build your walls now.

545
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,239
Three bamboo.

546
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,560
Does this mean I won?

547
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh my goodness.

548
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,199
A newbie, eh?

549
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,239
I hate people
who claim they don't know how to play.

550
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,800
You tricked us!

551
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,280
I'm done.

552
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,800
Right.

553
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,560
She won three rounds in a row
after she joined us.

554
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,719
Come on, let's get out of here.

555
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,160
Aunty,

556
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:28,535
could you please tell me

557
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,839
who is the aunty staying

558
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,040
in Room 0228 now?

559
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,479
The lady who stays in Room 0228?

560
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,800
The lady who went out first.

561
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:45,959
The lady who was sitting here earlier?

562
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,599
Hello.

563
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,239
Excuse me,

564
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,119
is she the lady staying in this room?

565
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,280
Yes. Are you here to visit her?

566
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,199
Is she ill?

567
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,760
She has a brain tumor.

568
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,199
Is it serious?

569
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,079
She might not have much time left.

570
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,160
Su Lie, will you dance with me?

571
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,520
This dance?

572
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,119
I only know how to dance the male part.

573
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,760
Perfect. I learned the female part.

574
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,359
Then I should be the one inviting you.

575
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
(From today on,)

576
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,719
(you don't have to do the
one-on-one trial anymore.)

577
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,700
("Existence and Void")

578
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,319
(If I can sign in
and meet Xu Nian again,)

579
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:31,839
(I'll know)

580
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,880
(if he's the real one
or virtual character.)

581
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:44,917
(Love Boys)

582
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,359
Guan Qianya, you don't give up, do you?

583
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,199
Let me tell you something.

584
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,359
It doesn't matter
if you use 100 different accounts.

585
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,319
Not unless you change your retina.

586
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,439
Missing Xu Nian, are you?

587
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,000
You won't get to see him anymore.

588
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:24,280
Enjoy spending the rest of your life
in loneliness in the real world!
