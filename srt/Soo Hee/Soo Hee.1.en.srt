1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,170
My mum once told me

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,632
that I was all she had left.

3
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:30,445
(Su Hee)

4
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:42,041
Hurry up, Su-Hee. We're running late.

5
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,273
Wear your shoes properly.

6
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,234
Your scarf - it's cold out.

7
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:15,835
All done. Let's go.

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,578
Pastor, Good morning.

9
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,355
Good morning, Sister.

10
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:33,795
Feel free to let me know if you need anything
for the upcoming revival meeting.

11
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,843
I am preparing in the midst of God's grace.

12
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,305
I'd appreciate it if you'd pray for me.

13
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,585
Why, of course. I'll pray for you.

14
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,268
Oh, gosh! Are you Han-na?

15
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,046
You've grown so much.

16
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,148
Yes, she's here on a short break
from her studies abroad.

17
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,093
Hello.

18
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,460
I've seen you before in the past.
You're all grown up now.

19
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,795
I heard Su-Hee's moving up
to the Youth Cell Group soon.

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,812
She sure is. It'd be nice
if you could look out for her.

21
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,789
Say hi, Su-Hee.

22
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,070
Hi.

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,726
Hello.

24
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:13,117
Han-Na's such a grown-up now.

25
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,515
Go wash your face or something.

26
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:29,703
Hurry.

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
(Mom)

28
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,921
Are you okay, Su-Hee?

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,433
Yes, I'm fine.

30
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:12,375
I'm sorry but, who are you?

31
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,023
Didn't we see each other just now?

32
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:23,828
Huh?

33
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,390
When?

34
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,919
Just right now...

35
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:35,460
Oh! What?

36
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,460
Do I really look that different?

37
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,781
I was wearing a wig just now
and this is my real hair.

38
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,765
I see.

39
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,835
Did you hurt your feet?

40
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,945
No, it's because my shoes are too small.

41
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,460
What's your shoe size?

42
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,406
240.

43
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,140
I'll lend you my slippers.

44
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:27,804
I reckon they'd be better.

45
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,210
Who is this?

46
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:43,070
Hi, I'm Su-Hee Park.

47
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:46,036
I came to return the slippers you lent me.

48
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,320
Oh, just a minute.

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,703
The slippers you lent me.

50
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,601
Thank you.

51
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,687
I left yours at home though.

52
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,726
Would you like to come up for just a bit?

53
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:28,476
I could just wait here.

54
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,218
It's so pretty.

55
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,179
What are you looking at?

56
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:48,031
This was taken at Montauk,
real pretty, isn't it?

57
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,796
Yes... it really is.

58
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,453
I'd like to go there too.

59
00:05:56,492 --> 00:06:01,195
It was so beautiful there;
all I did was stare.

60
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,437
The sun had risen before I knew it.

61
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:09,851
It had all happened so fast,

62
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,523
maybe that's why
it was even more memorable.

63
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,812
I have more photos.
Do you want to take a look?

64
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:41,187
You've changed your hair color a lot.

65
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,686
It puts me in a good mood.

66
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:01,639
Would you like to try dyeing your hair too?

67
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:04,053
Hair dye?

68
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,896
Yeah. I'll help you make it look subtle.

69
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,217
That's cold.

70
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,413
This feels weird.

71
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,514
Is this your first time dyeing your hair?

72
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,787
Yes. The smell's really strong.

73
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,252
Don't move now.
You might get hair dye everywhere.

74
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,678
Han-Na.

75
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,389
I think there's something on your face.

76
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,335
You're right.

77
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:05,443
Could you help me wipe it off, Su-Hee?
I've got my gloves on right now.

78
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:39,944
Mum, I'll go sit with my cell group.

79
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,889
Let us bow down our heads
and say our prayers.

80
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:05,389
We would like to give thanks to God
for bringing us all here today.

81
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:11,133
All we want is to devote our love for God
and follow Him in His path.

82
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,889
God has allowed us to recognise our sin
and has brought us out from living in the dark.

83
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:22,903
He has forgiven us through unconditional
love for we are now his flesh.

84
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:31,796
We pray for the courage to lead lives worthy
of our position as one of God's children.

85
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,592
Did you hear? I heard
Han-na dated a girl overseas.

86
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,006
Are you serious?

87
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:33,399
Hasn't she been hanging out
with Su-Hee a lot lately?

88
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,389
Exactly.

89
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:51,077
My mum used to brush my hair
a lot too when I was younger.

90
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,280
Really?

91
00:10:55,843 --> 00:11:01,257
Yeah. I like how the sound of brushing
hair is just like ocean waves.

92
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,983
All done.

93
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,303
I want to go see the beach.

94
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,280
Should we go?

95
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,241
Now?

96
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:47,921
Yeah. Right now.

97
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,639
But it's Sunday tomorrow.

98
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,014
It's just for a day.

99
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,733
But still...

100
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,647
Don't you want to visit the seaside?

101
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:05,936
Let's go together.

102
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,780
Say grace before eating.

103
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:30,983
Dear heavenly Father, thank You for the bread.
You bless us with every day.

104
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:37,001
We shalt live for Your heaven and glory.
Amen.

105
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,163
Amen.

106
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,269
Mum.

107
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:59,608
Can I go on a trip
with my friends next week?

108
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,407
When? On Sunday?

109
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,055
Yes.

110
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,710
My friend says she can only make it on the
weekend because she works during the week.

111
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,586
We've got to go to church.

112
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,955
Can't I go?

113
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,111
Eat your food.

114
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,114
Su-Hee.

115
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,848
Why do you hold your breath?

116
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,778
Umm...

117
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,567
I don't know.

118
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,058
You don't have to from now on.

119
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,561
It's OK for you to just live.

120
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,956
I'm back.

121
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,262
Where were you?

122
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,184
I...

123
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,304
With whom?

124
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,402
What do you think this is?

125
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,963
Do you know what I heard at church?

126
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:16,056
What? What are you talking about?

127
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,730
It's not true, right?

128
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,433
Huh?

129
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,370
You're grounded from tomorrow.

130
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:36,824
Where are your keys?

131
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:24,973
Let's pray.

132
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,825
Dear heavenly Father,

133
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,290
We thank You for Your grace.

134
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,235
There are young lambs
awaiting Your guidance.

135
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:46,940
How weak and foolish beings are we?

136
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,739
There have been some around us
forgetting about your love.

137
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:57,823
May You show these beings
what true love is

138
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:00,942
and cure them with Your precious love.

139
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,114
I desperately pray that You save us all...

140
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,423
What are you doing to my daughter?

141
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,811
What do you mean by that?

142
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,505
Su-Hee hasn't done anything wrong.

143
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,242
Don't you know this better than anyone else?

144
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,593
All because of Han-Na...

145
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:14,453
We are in the midst of a sacred worship time.

146
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:19,813
Everyone in church knows
what Han-Na did to Su-Hee.

147
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,047
Sister Kim.

148
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,393
You are being extremely
out of line right now.

149
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,126
Please exercuse caution.

150
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,319
You focus on raising your child right first.

151
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:30,776
Sister Jae-ran Kim.

152
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,813
Han-Na.

153
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,313
Su-Hee.

154
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:44,683
Let's break up.

155
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,305
Please don't go.

156
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,836
Take care.

157
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,339
This is all because of you,

158
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,446
I've lost face at church.

159
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:35,047
All because of you.

160
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,305
All because of you...

161
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,250
Let's repent, Su-Hee.

162
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,071
God will forgive everything.

163
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,654
Mum, please stop now.

164
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,430
No, no.

165
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,938
This is because Satan has possessed you.

166
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,828
You've been possessed by something, right?

167
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,867
Let's pray. Let's pray to God.

168
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:18,500
Our Father in heaven,

169
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:22,649
- hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,
- Just what did I do wrong, mum?

170
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,742
Why must we beg for forgiveness

171
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,461
- your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
- When I have done nothing wrong?

172
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,461
- Give us today our daily bread.
- Please stop.

173
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:34,093
Aren't you tired of this yet?

174
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,219
Forgive us our debts,

175
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:38,664
- as we also have forgiven our debtors.
- Please listen to me, mum.

176
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:39,961
Mum!

177
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:44,438
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

178
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:46,828
Fuck. Give me a break.

179
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:56,305
Please just stop it.

180
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:00,571
You have no sin.

181
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,774
It's because I've sinned too much.

182
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,782
Mum needs to repent.

183
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,758
Mum.

184
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,774
It's my fault, mum.

185
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,313
I won't do it again.

186
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,899
God will forgive you.

187
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,258
You weren't like that before.

188
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:07,133
God was just testing you.

189
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,039
God will save you.

190
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:25,398
My mum once told me

191
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:29,967
that I was all she had left.
