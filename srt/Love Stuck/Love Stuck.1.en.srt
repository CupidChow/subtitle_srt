1
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,625
Security!

2
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,541
Hey, why are you naked?

3
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,791
All right.

4
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,375
Now is the moment
we have been waiting for.

5
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,291
We're about to count down
to New Year together.

6
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,083
- Okay?
- Okay.

7
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,500
Ready?

8
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,291
Ten.

9
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,666
- Nine.
- Nine.

10
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
- Eight.
- Eight.

11
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,666
- Seven.
- Seven.

12
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,208
Let's celebrate the New Year
that never comes.

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,791
- Four.
- Four.

14
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,208
- Three.
- Three.

15
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,791
- Two.
- Two.

16
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,333
- One.
- One.

17
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,541
Thank you so much, everyone, for watching

18
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,916
my beautiful ass tonight.

19
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,791
Though it's a bit too small.

20
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,041
I promise you I'll do more squats.

21
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,458
You're annoying me, Rin!

22
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,708
Never loved anyone as much as Tim

23
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,250
Because Tim is the only one
who makes my heart flutter

24
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,791
There's only Tim in my heart

25
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,208
Never loved anyone as much as Tim

26
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,500
Wow, that was close.

27
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,708
Still need some practice, sis.

28
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,166
Not with the pens,

29
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,666
but whatever you're blowing.

30
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,875
Don't get on the stage. It's embarrassing.

31
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,041
- Be nice or shut up.
-"Be nice or shut up."

32
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,875
- Stop mocking me.
-"Stop mocking me."

33
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,125
- Like that.
-"Like that."

34
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,166
Off-tune.

35
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,958
- You suck.
- You suck more.

36
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,750
Asshole.

37
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,541
Whoa!

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,166
Nice catch.

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,250
Toy, you've been hired
to do the drawings on-site lately?

40
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
You're never home.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,708
I need your help with the decorations.
The opening is tomorrow.

42
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,291
Nobody wants burnt pork on bread, Dad.

43
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,875
What--

44
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,375
Shit!

45
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,541
Can't I be stuck on a day
the apple is good?

46
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,666
I'm sure everyone is looking forward

47
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,541
to the beginning of new year tonight.

48
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,708
Yes. So we both would like to say,

49
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,333
- How did you know?
-"How did you know?"

50
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,666
- 'Cause I'm sick.
- Toy, don't go yet. Taste my coffee.

51
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,875
How about your sis' show this evening?

52
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,541
Toy?

53
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,166
Whoa! Nice catch.

54
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,458
How about your sis' show tonight?

55
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,833
- Hey! Wanna come?
- Wat Phra Kaew.

56
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,458
Okay. I'll take you for free. Come on!

57
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,541
Whoa! Nice catch.

58
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,375
How about your sis' show tonight?

59
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,125
Why turn it off?

60
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,000
- Why turn it off?
- Why turn it off?

61
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,500
You're saying that you're stuck
on this day like a loop.

62
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,666
Every midnight be like...

63
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,625
Bam, resurrected at your desk everyday?

64
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,750
Yeah.

65
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:26,541
No offense. What the fuck?
You lost your mind, pal?

66
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,416
Screw you.

67
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,083
Tomorrow you'll forget
what I just told you.

68
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,708
Shoot to the left.

69
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,666
Bombs to the right. One behind the pillar.

70
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,541
- Fuck.
- Game over.

71
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,458
My life is exactly like your game.

72
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
Keeps coming back to the same spot.

73
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,041
Hey.

74
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
- Like Edge of Tomorrow?
-"Like Edge of Tomorrow?"

75
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,208
- You said it at the same time.
- Idiot. It sucks.

76
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,291
What sucks?

77
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,208
I think it's rad.

78
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,625
Your time is infinite.
You can do whatever you want.

79
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,708
I would walk naked at Siam Square
to get girls' attention.

80
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,708
It was fun at first.

81
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,541
But after doing things,
life comes back to the same spot.

82
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125
Nobody remembers what I say.

83
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
I really want to get out of this loop.

84
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,416
Like a bug?

85
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,625
What bug?

86
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,916
A bug.

87
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,166
In a game.

88
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,541
If there's a bug, just reboot it.
That's all.

89
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,208
So you can escape this damn scene.

90
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,041
Jack, where's my order?

91
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,625
Coming.

92
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,958
That's my bug.

93
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,916
See a shrink, pal.

94
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,541
I love you, buddy.

95
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
You stink.

96
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,375
Coming!

97
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,583
Don't play it.

98
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,583
Reboot?

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,166
Bug?

100
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,333
There's a bug?

101
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,000
Reboot it?

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Need a reboot?

103
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,833
Fuck, if it doesn't work,
I'll die for real.

104
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Fuck.

105
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,791
Shit.

106
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,666
Got to try it to find out.

107
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,833
Okay.

108
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,958
Hey. Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

109
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,208
Can you hear me?

110
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,166
Hey.

111
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,916
Hey. It's okay.

112
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,625
You'll be the same tomorrow.

113
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,708
Hey.

114
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,625
Shit!

115
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,458
It's okay.

116
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,041
You'll be the same tomorrow.

117
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,083
Shit.

118
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

119
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,250
Yo, kids!

120
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,625
I have a question for you.

121
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,375
Have you seen this lady?

122
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,666
Excuse me. Can you help me?

123
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,708
She has long hair.

124
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,666
About mid-back.

125
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,875
Looks familiar?

126
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,208
No, never seen her.

127
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,250
Yeah? Where did she go?

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This way?

129
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,875
Good, huh?

130
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,125
So, where did she go?

131
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,916
This way?

132
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,458
You don't get to eat.

133
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,833
Damn.

134
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,708
My dog. Why do I have to give her to you?

135
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,083
She's not your dog.

136
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,375
She looks like the lost dog.

137
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,625
Right, Sumo?

138
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,958
What Sumo? This is Jumbo.
I raised her since she was a puppy.

139
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,500
No. I called Sumo and she turned to me.

140
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,458
My dog turns to whatever someone calls.

141
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,541
Jumbo.

142
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,083
Sumo.

143
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,875
Jumbo.

144
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,291
See?

145
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,583
Where are you going?

146
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,458
- Let go.
- No.

147
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,541
Yes.

148
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,916
Who are you?

149
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,166
Please calm down. Excuse me.

150
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,000
If you say she's your dog, prove it.

151
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,666
Jumbo, show them.

152
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:56,791
Jumbo, wait.

153
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,875
Jumbo, stand.

154
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,000
Come.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,416
Good job.

156
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,875
- Jumbo.
- Jumbo.

157
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,583
Jumbo, down. Yes. Good girl.

158
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,000
Good job. Good job, Jumbo.

159
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,291
- Jumbo.
- Jumbo.

160
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,041
- Jumbo.
- There.

161
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,083
- Hey, good job. So cute.
- She's very cute.

162
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,625
- Hey.
- What's up with her?

163
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,125
- See you later.
- Goodbye. Jumbo. Jumbo.

164
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,750
Hey. You hit and killed me.
Don't want to talk a bit?

165
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,708
Okay.

166
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,958
The rocker from yesterday.

167
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,083
- Don't tell me...
- Yes.

168
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,666
I'm stuck in the loop like you.

169
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,041
Weird.

170
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,583
I thought I was the only one.

171
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,208
Wait. Don't go yet.

172
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,541
I have so many questions.

173
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,291
I don't have time. I'm busy.

174
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:19,875
Busy?

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,625
With what?

176
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,041
Looking for a dog?

177
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,000
What for? She'll be gone tomorrow.

178
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey.

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,791
I'm not interested in you.

180
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,916
So you shouldn't be
interested in me, okay?

181
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,416
Hey, wait. How can't I be?

182
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,375
You're the only one
whose clock ticks the same as mine.

183
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,791
So you should understand
that the world we're in,

184
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
it's like everybody is sleeping.

185
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,250
- Only we are awake.
- Exactly.

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,250
So?

187
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,500
"So?"

188
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,125
You hear that sound?

189
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,375
Why?

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,458
I have something to show you.

191
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,083
Come on.

192
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,833
I'm Toy, by the way.

193
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,291
You?

194
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,041
Vee.

195
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,291
You wanted me to see this?

196
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,333
This kind of incident

197
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,916
is only for us who are awake
to know that it's gonna happen.

198
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,958
Isn't that cool?

199
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,666
Yeah.

200
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,166
But also a waste of time.

201
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,958
Wait.

202
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,916
Being stuck in the loop,
how can you say it's a waste of time?

203
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,541
Small details like this
are things that keep us alive.

204
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,166
Good. So long.

205
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,000
Hey, wait.

206
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, I think,

207
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,458
since we're stuck on the same day,

208
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,875
I think it would be good
if we keep in touch.

209
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,666
Can I have your number?

210
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,666
Sure.

211
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,458
It'll disappear tomorrow.

212
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,750
If you remember it, we'll talk.

213
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,666
I'll definitely remember it.

214
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Bye-bye.

215
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,125
I believe he can do it.

216
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Come on. Well,

217
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,333
put him on three or four-month probation
or something.

218
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,083
Wait. I'll call you back.

219
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,833
Toy.

220
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,583
- I need to talk to you.
- ...7654.

221
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
- Toy.
- 081...

222
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,625
- Toy.
- ...938-765...

223
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,625
- 08...
- Toy.

224
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,916
9...8...7...4...

225
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,875
0...9...8...

226
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,625
You're annoying me, Rin!

227
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,916
Ten, nine...

228
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:55,000
0...9...8...7...4...

229
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,833
0...9...8...7...4...

230
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,916
0...9...8...7...4...

231
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,125
Do you want to meet today?
08:02

232
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm here
10:30

233
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,375
Hey, you're here.

234
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,583
Sorry.

235
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,333
I'll wait for you at the same place today
08:08

236
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,833
Excuse me.

237
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,791
- You look cool.
- Thank you.

238
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,625
You're really not going to come?
08:33

239
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,166
Sir.

240
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,375
Sir.

241
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,625
- Sir.
- Oops.

242
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,833
- Are you okay?
- Vee.

243
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,291
Are you all right?

244
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,750
Is there a lady coming here?

245
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,875
- No.
- Great.

246
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,333
What are you looking at?

247
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,958
Hey. Have a seat.

248
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,291
Thought I wouldn't get to see you.

249
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,291
How long have you been in the loop?

250
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,125
More than four days, for sure.

251
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,125
- Hey, so, you--
- Is how many days important?

252
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,166
Every day is today. Or do you count days?

253
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
I don't.

254
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,666
But I remember at first
it was fun to try many things

255
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,083
like cosplaying, boxing, diving,

256
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,208
walking naked.

257
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,541
What's the matter with you?

258
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Why?

259
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,791
- Everybody will forget about my ass.
- Gross.

260
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,083
Hey, move.

261
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,125
I'm sorry!

262
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,375
I'm really sorry!

263
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,375
Told you to move. You didn't.

264
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,125
Stubborn.

265
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,708
Funny?

266
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,291
What about you? What did you do?

267
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,000
I like to read.

268
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,416
Like what?

269
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,333
Astronomy, physics, things like that.

270
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,833
Astronomy, physics? Are they fun?

271
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,458
It's fun
if you understand matter and energy.

272
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:34,166
You'll understand how objects move
and natural phenomena. Things like that.

273
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,250
Wow. Interesting.

274
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:45,958
Great.

275
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,291
Physics and astronomy
are related to human beings

276
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,583
in a way most people don't know.

277
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Cool.

278
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,416
You have a good memory.

279
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,500
I have seen it many times.

280
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,166
It's fun.

281
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,916
As if we have a superpower.
Knowing the future.

282
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,041
Yeah?

283
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,416
Yeah.

284
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,708
Being stuck in the loop, you should try
something you've never done.

285
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,750
What are we doing here?

286
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,791
Wait here.

287
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,083
Okay.

288
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,541
Hello.

289
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,375
Okay.

290
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,416
Tom Yum Koong.

291
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,708
What?

292
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,666
- Tom Yum Koong.
- What?

293
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,791
Not tired of eating that everyday?
I think I'll have a crab omelet.

294
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,250
Fuck.

295
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,750
What is it?

296
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,375
Shit.

297
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,333
How did you get so rich?

298
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,375
Security!

299
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,833
Tom Yum Koong.

300
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,291
Help! This man has a gun.

301
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,250
- He forced me to rob.
- What?

302
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,375
- Freeze!
- Hey, calm down.

303
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,500
I have a gun. I'm robbing. No!
No robbing. No gun.

304
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,000
Hey.

305
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,791
Move.

306
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,625
I didn't know he would shoot you.

307
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,500
Told you to move. You didn't.

308
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,916
Stubborn.

309
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,583
I have died twice since I met you.

310
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:21,041
You told me to do what I've never done.

311
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:26,500
Okay. Sure.

312
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:35,875
You'll get me killed again!

313
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,833
Enough.

314
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,416
Have you ever thought about being stuck
on a day that's not New Year's Eve?

315
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,875
Any day is the same, I guess.

316
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,625
What about you?

317
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,041
If we can get out, what would you do?

318
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,000
Shit! Perfect.

319
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:36,750
Hey. You brought me to see this?

320
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,291
I feel like that fish sometimes.

321
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,625
Not sure what I'm doing.

322
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,416
What?

323
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,000
I've just figured it out.

324
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,625
Though we're in a world
where everybody's asleep,

325
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,958
we see good things that nobody sees today.

326
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,958
Like that bird.

327
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:23,875
Come on.

328
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,041
Let's go find perfect moments.

329
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,583
I can't.

330
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,833
I gotta go.

331
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,875
See you.

332
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
Hey, wait.

333
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,083
Well...

334
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,291
I want you to value time more.

335
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,208
Not for anyone else,
but maybe for yourself.

336
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,458
Where to?

337
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,541
Okay.

338
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,833
Stop, stop. Stop, please. I'm sorry.

339
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,333
- Please stop.
- What happened?

340
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,708
- Stop one moment.
- Come on.

341
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,166
I'm sorry.

342
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,291
Come on.

343
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,166
- Please stop. I'm sorry.
- Come on.

344
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,375
Stop, please. Give me a minute.

345
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,041
Thank you.

346
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:04,958
Cute?

347
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:08,833
Yeah.

348
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,833
Aren't you warm?

349
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,916
A bit overdressed there.

350
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:19,708
This one's good for sure.

351
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,041
What are you doing?

352
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:38,958
Good.

353
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,291
Why?

354
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,291
Look to the left.

355
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,750
Why are you smiling?

356
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,166
Nothing.

357
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,125
What a cute smile!

358
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:04,708
- Hello.
- Ms. Vee, can you come right now?

359
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,958
Oh, sure. I'll be there right now.

360
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,083
Who do you think created this loop

361
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,083
and made us stuck in it?

362
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,166
A god?

363
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Or an alien?

364
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,208
Hey, no.
I'm really curious what this loop is.

365
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,208
A parallel universe?

366
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,083
So?

367
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,375
Is it okay?

368
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,708
A parallel universe?

369
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,500
If we're really in it,

370
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,458
wouldn't our time move
concurrently with others'?

371
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,500
I have a more interesting theory.

372
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,416
What is it?

373
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,041
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah.

374
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,625
Look.

375
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,750
Suppose this cube is the third dimension

376
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,916
and this cube

377
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,750
is the fourth dimension.

378
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:24,750
And in fact,
both dimensions have some connections.

379
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,458
My hypothesis is,
I think the loop that we're in

380
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,750
is some kind of gap
between two dimensions.

381
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,125
Got it?

382
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,625
How would I get it? Hold on.

383
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,125
How could you come up with all this?

384
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,000
- You're still puzzled.
- Of course.

385
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,125
It's okay. Take your time.

386
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,083
- You'll heal from stupidity.
- Yeah...

387
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,250
Hey, you just called me stupid.

388
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,958
Are we looking for perfect moments here?

389
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,833
Not looking for anything.

390
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,583
I brought you here to see the Geminids.

391
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:37,625
Aren't you tired
of the universe and the stars?

392
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,583
No.

393
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,416
I think they are like people.

394
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,333
Each has its own character.

395
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,541
Could be more interesting than people.

396
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,500
But I don't think you're a star.

397
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,708
You're like a meteorite waiting
to crash into the Earth.

398
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:04,791
Funny much?

399
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,166
Nonsense.

400
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,291
If I'm a star, I think...

401
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,041
I'd be Pluto.

402
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,625
The forgotten planet in the solar system.

403
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,375
So are you.

404
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,458
Being dramatic?

405
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,916
- Come on. I'll show you around.
- Okay.

406
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,166
Follow me, bro.

407
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:55,000
Does every devil look like you?

408
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,375
Smile like you?

409
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,666
Feel like you?

410
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:12,291
'Cause there's nobody
in the world like you

411
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:17,541
They don't smile with their eyes like you

412
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:23,125
And if the darkness
is the way to get through

413
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:29,166
I will follow you

414
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,666
To anywhere you go...

415
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,958
Do you know the constellations?

416
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:40,125
Taurus, the Bull in the west,
Cancer, the Crab in the east,

417
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:45,416
Gemini, the Twins.

418
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,166
I like Gemini.

419
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,541
Are you listening?

420
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,583
Hey.

421
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,166
Yeah. I'm listening.

422
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,125
Really?

423
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,708
Uh-huh.

424
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,458
It's time. Let's go.

425
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,916
- Come on. We'll be late.
- Okay.

426
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,708
Okay.

427
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,791
Meteor or meteoroids

428
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,791
is a small streak of light
traveling across the sky in the night

429
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,666
when the night is clear.

430
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:37,041
It is a rocky body from outer space
that enters the earth's atmosphere

431
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,083
and becomes incandescent
by friction within seconds,

432
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,583
resulting in a light streak
that can be seen in the sky...

433
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,125
That's it?

434
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,291
We apologize.

435
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:41,708
There's a technical difficulty
and we have to end the show here.

436
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,666
Still upset?

437
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,583
You can talk to me.

438
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,166
Nah.

439
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,500
I knew that would happen.

440
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,166
It still got to me.

441
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,083
Forget it.

442
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Vee.

443
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:09,833
Excuse me.

444
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,958
May I take her for a dance?

445
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,541
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

446
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,083
Thank you.

447
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,625
Another song?

448
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:11,500
You two dance for me.

449
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,208
Fuck. Who did that?

450
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,541
Who did that?

451
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,583
Feel better?

452
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:17,208
Actually, getting to do
some crazy things is not bad.

453
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:21,833
It's something new.

454
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,416
It's the New Year.

455
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:31,958
Should we exchange gifts?

456
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,250
Now? I can't find a gift.

457
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,833
No need to overthink. Just...

458
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,500
something we have on us.

459
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:50,541
Something we have now?

460
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,083
Okay.

461
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,291
- Ready?
- Yup.

462
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,875
Three, two, one.

463
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,625
Are you giving me the finger?

464
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:20,916
No, I'm not.

465
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,416
You overthink.

466
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,833
Know what this is?

467
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,958
It's my treasure.

468
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,208
I think it suits you.

469
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,666
My mom bought me this.

470
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,458
I wear it all the time since she died.

471
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:32,958
Someone once told me

472
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,916
that when we died...

473
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:43,458
we might become a star up there...

474
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:49,541
and look back down
on the people we love on Earth.

475
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,458
Sometimes I want...

476
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,750
to be in this loop forever.

477
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,916
- Hello?
- Ms. Vee, can you come right now?

478
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,041
Yes, I'll be right there.

479
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,083
Sorry. I gotta go.

480
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,041
Thanks for today.

481
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:01,750
We just met but I think the world of you

482
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,291
I want to see you

483
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:09,625
And get to know you...

484
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:10,833
Your girlfriend?

485
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,625
Don't be nosy.

486
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,375
What do you want?

487
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,583
Go away.

488
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,625
She's cute. How long have you been dating?

489
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,041
We aren't dating.

490
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,666
Not dating? But you want to, huh?

491
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,000
Don't talk like you know me so well.

492
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,625
I do. I'm your sister.

493
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,291
It's a one-sided love, right?

494
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,416
It really is, huh?

495
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,458
Okay.

496
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,916
I have a crush on her.

497
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:54,500
I mean, she's weird,
but really charming and cute.

498
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,875
Sometimes I feel like she likes me a bit.

499
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,000
But then sometimes I feel she doesn't.

500
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,916
But deep down,
I also feel that maybe she has someone.

501
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:05,625
What should I do?
Should I keep going or just stop?

502
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,416
You can't keep it to yourself, huh?

503
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,666
I won't tell you next time.
Don't you need to practice?

504
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:16,666
- I have time to spare.
- Go to the competition. Go.

505
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,458
It's not time yet. Why should I go now?

506
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,875
Time to mind your own business.

507
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,166
By the way,

508
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,083
every girl has a soft spot.

509
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,208
Do you know what she likes?

510
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,916
Thank you, my beloved sis.

511
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,000
Jack!

512
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:48,583
Here he comes again.

513
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,666
I need your help.

514
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,916
- No.
- It's very important. Please.

515
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:54,625
- No, I'm about to pass this.
- You can't say no.

516
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:58,375
No!

517
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,333
Come on.

518
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,541
Where are we going?

519
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:05,708
I'm luring you to kill you.

520
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,166
If this perfect moment
is not truly awesome...

521
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:01,041
You drew our map?

522
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:10,250
I think there's a reason
for what happened.

523
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:12,541
One way or another.

524
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,541
But I don't know what it is.

525
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,750
Actually, it's a shame.

526
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,208
It'll be gone tomorrow.

527
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,083
It will go nowhere.

528
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,291
It'll just become a memory.

529
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,250
Thanks.

530
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,625
We're stuck in this loop together.

531
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:21,708
I think we...

532
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,458
I think we shouldn't risk it.

533
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:46,583
- Hello?
- Ms. Vee, can you come right now?

534
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:50,125
Yes, I'll be right there.

535
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,791
I...

536
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,083
gotta go.

537
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,750
Okay.

538
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,625
I believe he can do it. Please.

539
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,250
Yes. But your company
needs someone to fill in, right?

540
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,500
See? Perfect.

541
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:39,750
No. He didn't study business,
but he has a great personality.

542
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,416
He can talk--

543
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,958
Wait. I'll call you back.

544
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,625
Toy, I need to talk to you.

545
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,208
You want to talk about my future?

546
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:02,750
That there's something more stable
than a being a freelance artist.

547
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,000
Well, yes.

548
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,958
I mean, I'm worried about you.

549
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,125
Here's the thing, Dad.

550
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,041
I have no future.

551
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,041
I don't even have tomorrow.

552
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,833
So, I don't know
why I would make an effort.

553
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,833
I'm so fucking tired
of being stuck in this fucking world.

554
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,708
The world where nobody understands me.

555
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:38,000
No matter how hard I try,
everything will fall apart.

556
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,500
The world where...

557
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,083
there's only me left.

558
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,333
And I can never get out of it.

559
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,541
Toy, get a grip. It's not like that.

560
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:56,875
No one is alone. You're not alone.

561
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:01,583
I mean,
I might not understand you completely,

562
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,625
but I care about you.

563
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,625
I want you to have stability.

564
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:09,958
Stability?

565
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,250
Don't talk about stability.

566
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:20,416
You quit your 20-something-years job
to open some kind of coffee shop.

567
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,083
I never said a word.

568
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,250
You have even less future than me.

569
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,875
Rin, can you stop for a day?

570
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:56,541
Hey, Rin.

571
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:58,708
What's wrong?

572
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,041
It's nothing.

573
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,583
If you failed today,
there'll be a next time.

574
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,416
There's no next time.

575
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:15,833
I sucked.

576
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,875
I didn't get the scholarship.

577
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,458
You can attend a private college.

578
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,625
I don't want to burden Dad.

579
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,458
What burden?

580
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:35,333
If Dad didn't quit his job,
he wouldn't struggle like this.

581
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,916
I really don't get him.

582
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,500
He was laid off.

583
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
What?

584
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,833
He was laid off.

585
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,458
How come I didn't know?

586
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,000
How would you?

587
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,500
Have you ever cared about anybody?

588
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,666
Even now you only care about yourself.

589
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,208
I'm sorry.

590
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,625
EXCELLENT.

591
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,750
TALENTED

592
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,333
Tapoo - Your son's drawing?
Preecha Sukulworaphat - Yes.

593
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,500
Aw.

594
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,125
Dad cooked for him,
but he didn't stay to eat.

595
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,291
He said he wanted to eat.

596
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,833
That's fine. I'll make it again.

597
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:48,708
And this

598
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,375
- is not edible.
- Enough.

599
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,375
It's burnt.

600
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,583
That's enough, kiddo.

601
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,041
Hey, let's take a photo.

602
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,916
Today was amazing.

603
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,708
Let me see.

604
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Not edible.

605
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,000
- Yummy. Say "yummy."
- Yummy.

606
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,833
- Yummy.
- Not edible.

607
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:40,916
Yummy.

608
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,458
Rin.

609
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:34,750
Don't pressure yourself. You can do it.

610
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,041
Good luck.

611
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,958
It's okay, Dad. I'll clean it up.

612
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,250
Check on your bread.

613
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,666
Shit!

614
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,083
You'll get cut.

615
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,708
What?

616
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,500
No. Nothing.

617
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,291
Go sit down.

618
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,125
It tastes so bad.

619
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,416
Yeah. Really bad.

620
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:17,041
It's so burnt. How could you eat it?

621
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,833
Two more.

622
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,291
- What?
- Come on.

623
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,166
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

624
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:03,458
Next is the band
from Bentrachinuthit school.

625
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:08,541
They are the band to watch
for scholarship selection this year.

626
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,041
Let's give them some time to get ready.

627
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,708
It seems like they are ready to go now.

628
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:20,500
We'll get started then.

629
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:00,875
YOU CAN DO IT, SIS!

630
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,916
Yeah! She's very good, isn't she?

631
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,541
- You're the best.
- Good job.

632
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,416
- Good.
- Great job.

633
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,791
- You're still doing this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

634
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:19,958
Wow.

635
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:24,625
Didn't someone say
"Dad, order it. I'll eat it up"?

636
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,250
Here. One more. Go ahead.

637
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,875
We've been eating for a while. I'm full.

638
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,958
Here, Rin. Eat up.

639
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,666
Congrats on getting the scholarship!

640
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:36,333
Your hard work paid off.

641
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:42,708
- She's really great.
- Stop. You're embarrassing me.

642
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:47,541
How long are you going to watch it?
You've watched it since we started eating.

643
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,291
I'll keep watching it.

644
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:58,083
Hey, Toy.

645
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,583
Thanks for today.

646
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:12,666
Yeah.

647
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,541
He's about to cry.

648
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,416
What? No, I'm not.

649
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,916
Hey, I have something.

650
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,791
This is important.

651
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:27,375
So I need your support.

652
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,750
Put everything down.

653
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,041
Put your hands together
and think of holy spirits.

654
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,000
Repeat after me. Do it for our shop.

655
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,625
- Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...

656
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,916
You too. Everybody has to say it.

657
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:47,541
- All right? Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...

658
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,541
- ...is the New Year.
- ...is the New Year.

659
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:51,208
There'll be a new coffee shop.

660
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,916
- There'll be a new coffee shop.
- There'll be a new coffee shop.

661
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,583
We wish it fucking succeeds.

662
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:55,958
We wish it fucking...

663
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,541
Dad, no swearing.

664
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,333
Sorry.

665
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,458
We wish it success.

666
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,250
- We wish it success.
- We wish it success.

667
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,416
Hooray!

668
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,750
That's corny, Dad.

669
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,500
What should we say?

670
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,208
- Amen.
- Amen.

671
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:15,125
...to celebrate the New Year.

672
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,666
Now, for Asia,

673
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:21,166
Japan went into the New Year
two hours earlier.

674
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,125
For Thailand, in less than a minute,

675
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:27,416
we'll officially enter the New Year.

676
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:32,041
We have live broadcast
from the Sathorn Skywalk.

677
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,041
Come on.

678
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,125
Let's do this together. Come on.

679
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:44,500
All right. Now is the moment
we have been waiting for.

680
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:49,958
We're about to count down
to New Year together. Okay?

681
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,333
Okay.

682
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,750
- Okay?
- Okay.

683
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,500
Ready?

684
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,375
Ten.

685
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,791
- Nine.
- Nine.

686
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,041
- Eight.
- Eight.

687
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,208
- Seven.
- Seven.

688
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:08,041
- Six.
- Happy New Year!

689
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,083
- Four.
- Four.

690
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:11,875
- Three.
- Three.

691
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:13,875
- Two.
- Two.

692
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,541
- One.
- One.

693
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:23,375
You're stuck in this loop.

694
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:26,000
So you ask me, "Hey, how can I get out?"

695
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,208
I don't know.
Fuck, I've never been in a loop.

696
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,791
All I can say. A loop is about physics.

697
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,958
I suck at physics, math, everything.

698
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:34,833
Why did you ask me? Are you crazy?

699
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,708
You think I'm smart, motherfucker?

700
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,041
You got to ask someone
who knows physics...

701
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,708
You should ask Uncle Wit.

702
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,791
If you want to know physics,
ask my uncle Wit.

703
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,375
He used to work for NASA.

704
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,583
Uncle.

705
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,208
Hi.

706
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,375
Hello.

707
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,958
Help yourself to food and drinks.

708
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,750
- Toy?
- Yes.

709
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,375
Jack said you wanted to talk to me.

710
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,291
A lot.

711
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:17,541
Physics, Uncle Wit.

712
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:27,250
So, you're saying
there's something happening to time,

713
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:32,791
which is supposed to progress linearly.
Like this.

714
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:36,000
But no, it goes in circles

715
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,583
over and over again.

716
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,916
It goes around in the same loop.
Repeatedly and boringly.

717
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,083
Right?

718
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:45,708
Right.

719
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,458
It's called singularity.

720
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,958
What is singularity?

721
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,666
It's a state of indefinite density.

722
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,750
Often found at the center of a black hole.

723
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,166
It is surrounded by an event horizon.

724
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:02,666
It is singularity
that causes the overlapping of time.

725
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:09,958
And if we're stuck in there,
how can we escape?

726
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:16,083
Suppose this soup

727
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,541
is the time that is moving
around and around.

728
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,666
And this corn is an object

729
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:28,166
that travels with time.

730
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,458
Try to imagine this.

731
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:35,541
If this corn keeps moving
faster and faster,

732
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:38,750
faster, faster and faster.

733
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,250
Shit.

734
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,375
- Whoa!
- See what happened?

735
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,750
We may conclude that

736
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:52,000
if we can travel faster than time,
we can escape it.

737
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:57,625
Go ahead.

738
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,458
Fly. Fly high.

739
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Real high.

740
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:34,333
Well,

741
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,416
at first I was just glad
to find a friend in the loop.

742
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,750
But now that I have spent time with you,
got to know you,

743
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:49,458
you have something special
and I want to see you again.

744
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,333
Yeah.

745
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:07,708
Without you,

746
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,166
I wouldn't have gone out
to do those crazy things.

747
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,666
Actually, you're not Pluto.

748
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,416
You're the sun of my solar system.

749
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:45,375
I want to see you on other days,
not just today.

750
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:21,666
Today might be the last day
we're stuck in this loop.

751
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,666
I'll use the restroom.

752
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,833
All passengers,

753
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:05,958
to comply with the aviation rules
and air navigation safety,

754
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:09,208
please turn off your cell phones
and all electronic devices

755
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,958
during the takeoff and landing

756
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:14,083
because the signals can affect
the communication system

757
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,458
and the navigation system of the plane.

758
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:19,750
You may use the devices
in the in-flight mode after the takeoff.

759
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,250
Please take your seat, sir.

760
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,791
My friend is the restroom.

761
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:25,083
Nobody's in there.

762
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:27,041
- Really?
- Yes.

763
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:30,500
- Nobody's in there. Please sit down.
- Can I go take a look?

764
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,333
No, sir. You have to sit down.
We're about to take off.

765
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,166
Please take your seat.

766
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:37,083
Thank you.

767
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:50,166
Toy, I'm sorry.

768
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,791
I really can't go with you.

769
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,625
Good luck.

770
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:33,208
We're descending to land
at the Kansai International Airport.

771
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:37,375
The local time is 1:58 a.m.

772
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,333
The temperature is 3 degree Celsius.

773
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:44,166
Sumo!

774
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,208
Where have you been?

775
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,333
Missed you so much.

776
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,666
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

777
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,583
Sumo!

778
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,083
Where have you been?

779
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:01,458
Missed you so much.

780
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:06,416
Sumo!

781
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,208
Sumo, where have you been?

782
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,083
Missed you so much.

783
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,166
Sumo!

784
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,083
Thank you!

785
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,291
Sumo, how are you?

786
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,041
We may conclude that

787
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:12,583
if we can travel faster than time,
we can escape it.

788
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:17,625
Hey!

789
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,708
Toy!

790
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,208
Thank you for calling me, doctor.

791
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,583
No problem.

792
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:31,791
Vee.

793
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,875
- Vee.
- Yes, Mom?

794
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,291
Is something wrong?

795
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:45,541
No, nothing.

796
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,333
You can tell me.

797
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:53,208
I want to hear it.

798
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:01,583
Is this about a guy?

799
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:11,708
I met a guy recently.

800
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:21,625
He's a bit of a weirdo.

801
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,833
Talks a lot.

802
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,500
Makes lame jokes.

803
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:35,958
He asked me to do many things.

804
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,208
He made me realize...

805
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,166
that...

806
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,500
there are little things...

807
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,166
around us

808
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:54,875
that we might not notice.

809
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:00,541
But I was selfish.

810
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:04,583
I thought I did the right thing.

811
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:08,750
But I hurt his feelings.

812
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,916
Let's forget it.

813
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,875
It's over now.

814
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:22,458
Being with you makes me the happiest.

815
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,291
In our life, my dear,

816
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:32,666
pain is a part of growing up.

817
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:37,208
I don't have much time left.

818
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:39,750
But you

819
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:42,541
still have so much time.

820
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:48,000
Go live your life how you feel is right.

821
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:01,958
Don't worry about me.

822
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:07,458
I'm not going anywhere.

823
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:11,791
I will be here

824
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,708
with you always.

825
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,375
Damn it!

826
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,375
Hello.

827
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,333
Are you Toy's friend?

828
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,541
He never mentioned you.

829
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:29,625
He did, but you probably can't remember.

830
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:37,875
I'm stuck in the loop like him.

831
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:42,083
And he asked me to get out of the loop.

832
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:47,166
I agreed,
but then I left him on the plane.

833
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:50,666
If you were him, would you be mad?

834
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,541
Well, probably.

835
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,500
The building on the left.

836
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:12,208
Damn. Brutal.

837
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:14,250
Look. All dead.

838
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,416
Death is terrible, huh?

839
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,375
Losing someone is also...

840
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,333
terrible.

841
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:37,333
But if we don't face it,

842
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,500
we might lose ourselves along the way.

843
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,916
Are you talking about the game?

844
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,250
Sorry.

845
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:56,083
- Two enemies at 11 o'clock.
- What?

846
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:00,666
Shit, I passed.

847
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:05,625
Thank you so much.
I spent so much time on this level.

848
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:20,541
I have played it for so long,
but I didn't know there would be a map.

849
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,083
Right? A map?

850
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:25,625
See it?

851
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:28,583
There.

852
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,458
Yes.

853
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,416
Yes, a map.

854
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,333
- Yes.
- Yes, a map.

855
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:41,083
Thank you, Jack. I think I have to go.

856
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:45,291
- Can you watch Sumo?
- Okay.

857
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:48,916
Watch him for me.

858
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:53,250
Come over some time.

859
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,333
Your girlfriend?

860
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,541
She dumped me.

861
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,708
That's okay. She has bad taste.

862
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:17,458
Shit. How could she dump
my fucking brother?

863
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,541
Rin.

864
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,166
"My brother."

865
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:22,916
How could she dump my brother?

866
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,166
Hey, I'm sorry.

867
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:30,708
The shop opens tomorrow.

868
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:32,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

869
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:36,416
I'm Toy's friend.

870
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,458
I'm sorry.

871
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:59,791
I don't know if it's too late.

872
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,250
But I want you to know

873
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:07,041
that I'm ready now.

874
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:15,458
And I think I found a way
for us to get out of the loop.

875
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,083
If...

876
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:29,583
If you still want to come with me.

877
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,583
It's up to you.

878
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,208
I understand.

879
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:40,875
I...

880
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,083
I'll wait outside.

881
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:07,958
You said she dumped you.

882
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:11,875
She came to make it up.

883
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,000
I gotta go.

884
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,250
Where to?

885
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,500
To your future sister-in-law.

886
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:32,666
Wait.

887
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,250
Good luck today.

888
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:36,875
You can do it.

889
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:39,833
I'll leave her to you, Dad.

890
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,791
The map of perfect moments you drew.

891
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:53,041
I think it has a hidden pattern.

892
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,416
Pattern?

893
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:00,791
Hold this.

894
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,083
Hey, shit!

895
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,333
Thanks. Here.

896
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:10,125
Take a look.

897
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,250
It's like a video game.

898
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:20,583
You have to finish a quest
to go to the next quest. Right?

899
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:26,541
So, if we can find the hidden pattern
in the map,

900
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:31,125
we might find an important key
that can get us out of this loop.

901
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:36,208
Stop, please.

902
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,708
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

903
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:41,750
I'm sorry.

904
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,416
Stop for a moment, please.

905
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:52,958
The pattern of these perfect moments

906
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:56,875
might have some meaning and connections
as a map of the fourth dimension.

907
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:04,500
What we know is the locations.

908
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:07,833
What do you think we have to look for?

909
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,583
We see the rider at 1:34 p.m.

910
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,750
- So, time?
- Yes.

911
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:18,416
We have to look for the time
of all the perfect moments.

912
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,500
The first one should be here.

913
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:26,458
And next...

914
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:34,958
2:45 p.m.

915
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:38,166
If we connect these locations
according to their time,

916
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:40,166
this string represents time.

917
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:44,625
And each bead
represents the time it happens.

918
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:47,708
Is this it?

919
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,416
By doing this, we change an ordinary map

920
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:55,416
into this.

921
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:21,458
Theory of the fourth dimension.

922
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:28,708
Wait.

923
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,000
There's a missing spot.

924
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:42,250
The missing time is about 11 p.m.

925
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:47,000
And the location is...

926
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:37,583
When I knew my mom was dying...

927
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,041
DOCTOR GREAT

928
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,791
I couldn't take it.

929
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:47,583
- Hello.
- Ms. Vee, can you come right now?

930
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:50,291
Your mother's pulse continue to weaken.

931
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:55,041
Spend some quality time
with your mother in her last moments.

932
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:05,625
I could give up everything I have...

933
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:11,041
for her to be with me.

934
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,041
So I prayed.

935
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:22,125
And it became true.

936
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:25,750
Like magic.

937
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:28,791
Or a blessing from God.

938
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:33,250
But I didn't think...

939
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:41,083
it would make you stuck
in this loop as well.

940
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:51,958
I'm sorry.

941
01:40:56,708 --> 01:40:57,916
It's okay.

942
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,000
I wondered at first...

943
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:06,666
why you were stuck in the same loop.

944
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,750
But now I think I get it.

945
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:37,541
Vee.

946
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,166
Mom, this is my friend Toy.

947
01:43:00,666 --> 01:43:02,875
If we could be together longer,

948
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:07,375
it would be great.

949
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,333
What can we do?

950
01:43:13,166 --> 01:43:14,875
This is all the time I got.

951
01:43:22,333 --> 01:43:23,833
I have been very happy

952
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:27,000
all this time

953
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:29,958
because I have you.

954
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:38,125
And a great life is waiting for you.

955
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:42,166
Don't be sad, dear.

956
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:02,708
You are my happiness, Mom.

957
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:14,541
Next year...

958
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:18,791
if you go watch the meteor shower...

959
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,291
remember...

960
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:32,541
that I will also wait
to see it from up there.

961
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,541
Who knows?

962
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:48,333
The view up there

963
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:50,708
might be better

964
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:53,291
than down here.

965
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:01,833
Love you, Mom.

966
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:06,291
Very much.

967
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:13,833
See you then.

968
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,541
All right.

969
01:46:10,541 --> 01:46:13,416
Now is the moment
we have been waiting for.

970
01:46:14,083 --> 01:46:18,458
We're about to count down
to New Year together.

971
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:20,625
- Okay?
- Okay.

972
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:23,333
Vee.

973
01:46:53,416 --> 01:46:57,000
Thank you for giving us a chance to meet.

974
01:47:00,958 --> 01:47:02,208
Thank you too.

975
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:14,083
Ready?

976
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:15,833
Ten.

977
01:47:16,416 --> 01:47:18,583
What do you think will happen tomorrow?

978
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:21,958
- Let's watch the fireworks.
- Okay.

979
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:22,916
- Nine.
- Nine.

980
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,500
I don't know.

981
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:27,750
But it's the future.

982
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,833
- Eight.
- Eight.

983
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:31,791
Nobody knows what will happen.

984
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,041
We just have to...

985
01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:40,916
live life.

986
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:44,125
- Seven.
- Seven.

987
01:47:47,791 --> 01:47:48,958
- Six.
- Six.

988
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,458
- Why are you so naughty?
- Jumbo.

989
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:52,625
I'll take you to see the fireworks, Sumo.

990
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:56,750
- What a cutie.
- Yours too. Like a twin.

991
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,916
- Five.
- Five.

992
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:02,625
- Four.
- Four.

993
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:05,958
- Three.
- Three.

994
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:09,125
- Two.
- Two.

995
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:11,500
- One.
- One.

996
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:51,250
- Happy New Year, Dad!
- Happy New Year, kiddo!

997
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:03,166
I wish you all happiness.
