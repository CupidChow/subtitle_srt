1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,250
Sorry we don't have a shirt
that fits you.

2
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,917
You really hurt yourself.

3
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,583
Make sure
you apply the medicine thoroughly.

4
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,458
Dinner will be ready soon.
We'll call you, then.

5
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,708
Apply this one, right?

6
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,250
Put it on your back as well.

7
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,750
I've noticed some wounds on your back.

8
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,750
Actually,
I can't quite reach my hand at my back

9
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,167
May I?

10
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,417
Does it hurt?

11
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,375
No. I can take it.

12
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,375
How are you feeling now?

13
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,333
I've bought and brought some food
and drinks from the town.

14
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,917
Let's have another round of drinks.
It's a beautiful night.

15
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,292
Thank you.

16
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,375
My big cousin Inpyo.

17
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,708
Dongsu, you are the first
since the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup.

18
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,833
We haven't had any visitor for a while.

19
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,750
Ain't I right, Inpyo?

20
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:58,792
We are so in the middle of nowhere.

21
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,958
For real?　-Sure.

22
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
He likes to exaggerate.

23
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,417
Just saying that I am that much lonely.

24
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:17,458
Unless you have a family here,
who the heck would ever come this way?

25
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,375
Thus, I'm stuck with my big cousin.

26
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:26,750
There is absolutely nothing to do here
other than farming.

27
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,792
Cheers.

28
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Let me reiterate.
There is no one to meet here.

29
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,708
You hear me, right?　-Yes.

30
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,917
You got that, right?　-Yes.

31
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,125
It's just me and my cousin here...

32
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,292
No need to say more.

33
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,542
I will not complain any more.

34
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,625
Inpyo has been living in Seoul
all these years with God-only-knows-who.

35
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,708
You returned home
only after your mom had passed away.

36
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,125
I've been here all by myself,
taking care of the family business.

37
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,250
I feel so alone. Lonely.

38
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,792
Where is my future wife?　-Sangbae

39
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:09,833
That's enough. Let's call it a night.

40
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,750
What?

41
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,417
Already?

42
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,417
Oh~! If so,

43
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,292
Is brother breaking up with me?

44
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,958
Hey, stop the nonsense.

45
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,667
How did that sound?

46
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,125
Hey,
let's all have another round of drinks.

47
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,333
You see,
working in a farm has a few perks.

48
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,208
You can party late.

49
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,500
You are the boss of your own life.

50
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Hey, I said that's enough.
You've been drinking too much.

51
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,042
Little boy, am I keeping you up?

52
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,750
No, not at all.
I can have a few more drinks.

53
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,583
Inpyo.

54
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,625
See. He says he's all right.

55
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,125
Hey, where are you going?

56
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,708
Hey, let's have another drink.

57
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,542
Hey you! Come back.

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,667
Ahh,

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,292
You are jealous
of me and Dongsu getting close.

60
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,042
We still have some snacks left.
Don't wrap up the party yet.

61
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,042
We've made your bed in the other room.

62
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,708
You've found your way here all right.

63
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,458
I've followed your way. It wasn't hard.

64
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,542
How was your sleep?

65
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,875
I slept fine.

66
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,750
I am really sorry about
going through your things last night.

67
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,292
It was a mistake.

68
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,500
It's Okay.

69
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,875
I suspect that you've become curious
of what they are.

70
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,500
I...

71
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,167
The things in the box.

72
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,542
Actually, I know what exactly they are.

73
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,958
I knew you would.

74
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,083
They are pretty.

75
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,167
You think so, too?

76
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,542
The fruits like it
when we think of them that way.

77
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,417
Pardon?

78
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,917
Are you saying these trees
can actually feel?

79
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,292
Of course, they do.

80
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:07,417
They are all living beings like us.

81
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,000
By the way,
do you know the name for these apples?

82
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,042
No.

83
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,708
As we, humans,
are of many different kinds,

84
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,083
these apples can also be of many kinds.

85
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,417
This particular one is called "hwahong."

86
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,875
It still needs more time for it
to become fully ripe.

87
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,042
When it does,
it will taste very sweet and delicious.

88
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,458
Until now,
I've thought all apples are the same.

89
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,917
It's all right.

90
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,167
City people even wrongly think that
rice comes from a tree.

91
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,250
Hwahong.

92
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,417
What a lovely name for the lovely fruit.

93
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:01,708
I...want to help.
Can you teach me how to do it?

94
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,583
Shall I?

95
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,208
Oh, no!

96
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,542
Are you all right?

97
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,000
Sorry.

98
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,500
I let a little insect get the best of me.
It's back was red.

99
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,083
Spotted lanternfly.

100
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,208
It's kind of new.

101
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,250
A little scary-looking, huh?

102
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,917
Up and doing it already?

103
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,792
Hey,

104
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,583
How did you get to work so early?

105
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,458
you two lovebirds.

106
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,458
Looking kind of intimate.
What are you up to?

107
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,375
He is never up this early.

108
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,208
Hey, you are up early.
Are the pigs finally flying?

109
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,250
Hey you all, come play in the river.

110
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:17,208
You are so dead.

111
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,500
You, too, Dongsu. Join us.

112
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,750
Please, come. Quick.

113
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,000
What are you doing? Come on.

114
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:41,083
Wait. Go get the unicorn float. Hurry.

115
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:48,500
Everyone,
finish up their own watermelon!

116
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,500
Ripe to its perfection.

117
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,625
Tastes good.

118
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,417
By the way,

119
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,875
isn't someone coming today
to deliver the hay to our ranch?

120
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,917
Yes, you got that right.

121
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,750
But we are all out here.

122
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,292
You should go take care of it.　-What?

123
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,500
Why me?

124
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
What about you?

125
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,042
It doesn't need all two of us.

126
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,625
Wait a minute!

127
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,458
So you, two, will continue having fun
while I go and work?

128
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,583
Have you ever seen me
being slacking at my job?

129
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,792
Let me be this time.

130
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,667
Okay, okay.

131
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,750
I'll go take care of it. You owe me.

132
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:02,917
Ah.

133
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,875
About your phone.

134
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,250
It's working fine again.

135
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,875
It never dies.

136
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,083
By the way, you don't need
to be so formal with me.

137
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,542
Okay, I'll stop.

138
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,875
How are the wounds?
Are they healing nicely?

139
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,583
I think so.

140
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,833
I'm young.

141
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,833
Are you all right?

142
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,000
I am, Inpyo.

143
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,500
For real?

144
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It is Okay. Inpyo,

145
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,625
you can kiss me.

146
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,000
My dog Samsoon.

147
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,833
Inpyo,

148
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,625
if you are finished feeding the cows,
please give me a hand.

149
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,083
Samsoon, let's go.

150
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,542
I wish...

151
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,708
the time could stand still.

152
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:32,000
With just you and me

153
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,292
like this.

154
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,625
Sorry.

155
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,333
Inpyo. Where would you be happier?

156
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,292
Here?

157
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,167
Or in the city?

158
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,458
Dongsu.

159
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,625
Wait.

160
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,042
Inpyo.

161
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:27,708
What?

162
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,458
Come out and have this drink with me.

163
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,708
You gotta give your body a break
from time to time.

164
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,667
Inpyo!

165
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,958
Hey, cut it out.
