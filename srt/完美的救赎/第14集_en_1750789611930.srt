00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Congratulations to Wang Ya

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
on winning the prize for contribution

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,400
It's over

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,920
Isn't it strange?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,560
I just feel like my daughter is kicking me

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,880
How do you know it's a girl?

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,560
Besides, it's only been two months

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,720
The child's legs haven't grown yet

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,240
Of course I know

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Today is his first Children's Day

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
He is happy

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Rong Xia

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,480
I have a good news

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,920
If nothing happens

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,840
I will be promoted next month

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,040
Then let me ask

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
What is the accident?

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,640
Let me think

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,160
For example

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
Alien invades the earth

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Otherwise, you don't love me

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Then you still hope

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,040
Aliens invade the earth

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,600
This is more realistic

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,640
Okay, I won't tell you

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm going home now

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
See you later

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,160
OK, then you slow down on the road

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,960
Bye bye

31
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,160
The King of Blaze

32
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,360
Dajun

33
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,360
Is there any news about Liao Boyan?

34
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Liao Boyan never went out of the building

35
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Go

36
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,360
You're out

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,200
I think I went to throw away a garbage

38
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
Then I went back

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
I went upstairs

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
How about Comrade Ma?

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
Can you still hold on?

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,760
I can hold on

43
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,920
I have to hold on

44
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,920
Then have a coffee

45
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Dr. Liao

46
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
Have you seen the news?

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
Zhao Qian was arrested

48
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
What will I do next?

49
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
How are you going to stuff her belly

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
I will certification

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,880
Be a woman

52
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
You have nothing to control

53
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,960
Remember

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
You have Liao Yifan

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,280
Then you still have nowhere to run

56
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,960
Money

57
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,160
My girl

58
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,000
I laugh, I laugh

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,760
You've been transparent

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,120
Everything we see

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
is arranged by you

62
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,940
For example

63
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,080
the theme logo at the amusement park

64
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,000
captures A'xing

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
and shows you

66
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,080
what kind of little guys

67
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,800
You gave me the surveillance camera

68
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,760
and the passcode for the police.

69
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
And

70
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
the diary of your mother

71
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,320
was also given to me by you, right?

72
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
Dr. Liao,

73
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,120
I came to see you today

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
because I felt

75
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,560
that

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,080
we don't have many chances

77
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,160
to get along like this.

78
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
The next time we meet,

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,920
it may be an occasion

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
that we don't want to face.

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
You want to arrest me?

82
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm not a police.

83
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't have the qualification.

84
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Besides,

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,400
arresting people is about evidence.

86
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,600
You have perfect proof that you're not there.

87
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm not a police.

88
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm not a police.

89
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm not a police.

90
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm not a police.

91
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm not a police.

92
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm not a police.

93
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm not a police.

94
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm not a police.

95
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm not a police.

96
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm not a police.

97
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm not a police.

98
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm not a police.

99
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm not a police.

100
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm not a police.

101
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm not a police.

102
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm not a police.

103
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I'm not a police.

104
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm not a police.

105
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm not a police.

106
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm not a police.

107
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm not a police.

108
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm not a police.

109
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm not a police.

110
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm not a police.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm not a police.

112
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm not a police.

113
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm not a police.

114
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm not a police.

115
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
I'm not a police.

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm not a police.

117
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm not a police.

118
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I'm not a police.

119
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm not a police.

120
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I'm not a police.

121
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm not a police.

122
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm not a police.

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm not a police.

124
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm not a police.

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm not a police.

126
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm not a police.

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm not a police.

128
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I'm not a police.

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm not a police.

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I'm not a police.

131
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm not a police.

132
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I'm not a police.

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I'm not a police.

134
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm not a police.

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm not a police.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640

I'm not a police.

138
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm not a police.

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm not a police.

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm not a police.

141
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm not a police.

142
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I'm not a police.

143
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I'm not a police.

144
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm not a police.

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm not a police.

146
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm not a police.

147
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm not a police.

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
I'm not a police.

149
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I'm not a police.

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm not a police.

151
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
I'm not a police.

152
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I'm not a police.

153
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
I'm not a police.

154
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm not a police.

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
I'm not a police.

156
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm not a police.

157
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
I'm not a police.

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
I'm not a police.

159
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm not a police.

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I'm not a police.

161
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm not a police.

162
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm not a police.

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I'm not a police.

164
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I'm not a police.

165
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm not a police.

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm not a police.

167
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm not a police.

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm not a police.

169
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
There's someone there.

170
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
It must be some handsome guy.

171
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,720
It couldn't have been the police.

172
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Let's go inside.

173
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,400
Welcome!

174
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,980
그냥Out Withyou

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,560
Eat first. There's nothing more important than eating at the restaurant.

176
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm thinking,

177
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Liao Boyan definitely has a accomplice.

178
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,060
When that mother diary was sent to the law firm,

179
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,560
Liao Boyan was sitting right across from me.

180
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Who could be the accomplice?

181
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
You eat, and it's not easy to eat you.

182
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
You ordered three dishes and you didn't open your mouth. What do you mean?

183
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,060
Say it.

184
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Okay, I know.

185
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,060
You found the medicine in the medicine bottle in the small room in the warehouse.

186
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,060
The result came out.

187
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,560
It's a kind of anti-inflammatory medicine that was taken after the organ transplant.

188
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Anti-inflammatory medicine?

189
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,060
Liu Zixuan doesn't need this kind of medicine.

190
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,560
Could it be that the kidnapper did a organ transplant?

191
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Anti-inflammatory medicine can't be broken.

192
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,060
Go to the hospital and the pharmacy to check the relevant prescription records within half a year.

193
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
There should be a profit.

194
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,060
The anti-inflammatory medicine materials you want are all here.

195
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
You go check it first.

196
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Doctor, I have something to ask you.

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Is there any problem with the organ transplant in our hospital?

198
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,060
There is.

199
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Fake prescription?

200
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,560
It was three months ago. We reported it to the police.

201
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,060
The surveillance footage during that time is all here.

202
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Okay, thank you. You can go back to work.

203
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,060
Hello, help me get the anti-inflammatory medicine.

204
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Okay.

205
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
Thank you.

206
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Thank you.

207
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Thank you.

208
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Thank you.

209
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Stop.

210
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,060
This is the car that hit Zhao Qian.

211
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,060
So the person who killed the murderer and kidnapped Liu Zixuan are the same person?

212
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Hello?

213
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,060
Someone is in a group of patients with the same organ transplant.

214
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
We want to ask them to transfer some anti-methyl drugs to him.

215
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
The time and location of the transaction has been decided.

216
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
It's tonight.

217
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Okay, I got it.

218
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
Let's go.

219
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Okay.

220
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Okay.

221
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
Don't move!

222
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Don't move!

223
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Police, don't move.

224
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Police

225
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Xiao Ma

226
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Yes

227
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Manager Nie

228
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Coming

229
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Police

230
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,060
Ke Ran, look at the hairpin that these women used.

231
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Yes

232
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
Put it in.

233
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Be careful. There's a hair in it.

234
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
What's your name?

235
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Wang Yan

236
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Is this car yours?

237
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Yes

238
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,060
We found Liu Zixuan's fingerprint in your car.

239
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Yes

240
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,060
I took him away.

241
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Took him away? Or kidnapped him?

242
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,060
I didn't kidnap him.

243
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,060
I just wanted to be his mother.

244
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,060
His family members were not good to him.

245
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
I was good to him.

246
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Okay, continue.

247
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
Police, don't laugh.

248
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
I have no guilt.

249
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,060
I took him away from the fire.

250
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Where did you take him?

251
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,060
I don't know.

252
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,060
He ran away.

253
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
I'll go to the car.

254
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,060
Okay

255
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
I'll go to the car.

256
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,060
When I first met Zixuan,

257
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,060
I thought he looked like my daughter.

258
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,060
So I brought him to cultivate love like his own daughter.

259
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Cultivate love?

260
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Did you lock him in the dark room to cultivate love?

261
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
That's not a dark room.

262
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
We investigated.

263
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,060
You don't have a daughter.

264
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
I do.

265
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
I do.

266
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
I really do.

267
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Why did you drive to meet Zhao Qian?

268
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Who is Zhao Qian?

269
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Zhao Qian.

270
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
That woman.

271
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
She was an accident.

272
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
I stepped on a brake,

273
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
stepped on the throttle,

274
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
and the car was out of control.

275
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
What a coincidence.

276
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,060
You stepped on the throttle when you saw Zhao Qian.

277
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
What do you want from me?

278
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,060
I just want to make some money.

279
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Liao Boyan.

280
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Do you know her?

281
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
No.

282
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
I don't know her.

283
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Hello, who are you?

284
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Why did you pick flowers for my daughter?

285
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Hello, who are you?

286
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,060
Why did you pick flowers for my daughter?

287
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Who are you?

288
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Why did you pick flowers for my daughter?

289
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,060
You know my daughter, Yifan?

290
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Yes, it's me.

291
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,060
I pretended to be your daughter.

292
00:20:48,060 --> 00:21:09,500
You used to

293
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
You killed my brother.

294
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You killed my family.

295
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
You deserve to die.

296
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I don't know what else I can do.

297
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
You can go.

298
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Don't let me see you again.

299
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Since you're not afraid of death,

302
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
do me a favor.

303
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I have a plan.

304
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I'll find a helper

305
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
who doesn't consider the consequences.

306
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
If you agree, we'll talk.

307
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
If you don't,

308
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
we'll get off at the traffic light.

309
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
You killed my daughter once.

310
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
You deserve to save my daughter once.

311
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Go.

312
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
You killed my daughter.

314
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
You deserve to die.

315
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I'll get off at the traffic light.

318
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
You deserve to die.

319
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
I'll get off at the traffic light.

322
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
You deserve to be the culprit.

323
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
If you're not afraid of death,

324
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
then I won't get off now.

325
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
If you don't,

326
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
we'll talk.

327
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
If you don't,

328
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
we'll talk.

329
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
You can't afford to raise me if you don't care.

330
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,700
If you change your diet, you can afford it.

331
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,900
Wang Ya has been posting a lot of posts online.

332
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
But it seems like he hasn't posted for a long time.

333
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
How long has it been?

334
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,300
Five years.

335
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,300
Tomorrow, sort out everything that Wang Ya wrote online.

336
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
See if you can find anything wrong.

337
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,700
Okay.

338
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Wang Ya definitely won't tell us the truth.

339
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Including Liu Zi Xuan's situation, he must have hidden something.

340
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,900
So we have to increase our strength and search for Liu Zi Xuan.

341
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,300
We have already sent more people.

342
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,700
We also asked our team to help find Liu Zi Xuan.

343
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Wang Ya and Liao Boyan must have a connection.

344
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,100
As long as we figure out this connection, we can find all the secrets.

345
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,900
But he didn't tell us the truth.

346
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,300
Chief, what do you think?

347
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
It's a coincidence.

348
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,500
If you have contact, you will leave a trace.

349
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,700
I find that you two are getting more and more tacit.

350
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,300
Come on, let's drink tea instead of wine.

351
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Cheers!

352
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Thank you.

353
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Drink tea.

354
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,900
Did I cause you trouble?

355
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,300
No.

356
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,700
The Bureau Committee already told me.

357
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,500
Police officer, because you guys are coming,

358
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,100
I especially asked my wife and child to return to their mother's home.

359
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,500
Because I don't want to make any trouble in front of them.

360
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I don't want to make any trouble in front of them.

361
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I don't want to make any trouble in front of them.

362
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I don't want to make any trouble in front of them.

363
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
So...

364
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Don't worry.

365
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
Our investigation won't be public.

366
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,900
Okay.

367
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,300
What do you want to ask?

368
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,900
It's like this. We want to know more about Wang Ya's situation.

369
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,100
We will say whatever we want.

370
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,300
We especially want to know more about him.

371
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,900
To be honest,

372
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I feel that I don't know him enough.

373
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,900
We have been dating for 5 years and married for 3 years.

374
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,100
I originally thought that I knew him.

375
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,700
Wang Ya is very smart.

376
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,900
He has been good since he was little.

377
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,500
After he entered the company and worked there,

378
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
he was also a company's business shareholder.

379
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,900
But, until today, I still don't understand

380
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,900
how he changed one person in one night.

381
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
How he changed one person in one night.

382
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
In one night?

383
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Yes, in one night.

384
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,500
That day, he just took the end of the share prize.

385
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,100
We agreed to celebrate it at home.

386
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,500
But he came back very late.

387
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,700
He didn't answer my calls.

388
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,300
After he came back,

389
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,700
he was like a lost soul.

390
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,500
I didn't say anything to him.

391
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,300
He was angry with me after asking too much.

392
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,500
What's wrong?

393
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,300
What's wrong?

394
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,700
The red dress! Girl!

395
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Nothing.

396
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Nothing.

397
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
Xiao Tai Yun.

398
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Ya Ya.

399
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Don't come near me.

400
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Tell me what's wrong with you.

401
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,900
Xiao Tai Yun.

402
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Can you see?

403
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,300
Nothing.

404
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
You don't believe me?

405
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,300
What's wrong with you?

406
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
It's Xiao Tai Yun.

407
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,060
Okay.

408
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,700
After that day,

409
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,900
our relationship became very bad.

410
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,100
I even suspected,

411
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
I suspected that he's been with someone out there for a while,

412
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,500
then I had to why?

413
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,100
Why did he turn out so?

414
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,900
He left without telling me anything.

415
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,100
Then

416
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Our child is also in labor.

417
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
The project he's in charge of

418
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
also had a problem.

419
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
He was accused.

420
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Then he started to demand.

421
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Then he was like a stranger.

422
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I tried to get back this marriage, but

423
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I got divorced.

424
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Five years ago,

425
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
which day exactly?

426
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Can you remember?

427
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
June 1st.

428
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,100
I remember very clearly.

429
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Because that day was Children's Day.

430
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Wang Ya called me

431
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
and said that the child was in the belly.

432
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
It seems to know that it is Children's Day.

433
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
I kicked him hard.

434
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
I'm sorry.

435
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
These are Wang Ya's personal belongings.

436
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I want to return it to him.

437
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
He didn't answer my call, so I put it here.

438
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
This hard disk is also Wang Ya's?

439
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Yes.

440
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
He uses all the computers in the house.

441
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
After I took it apart,

442
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
I thought that if there was no privacy in it,

443
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I would stay.

444
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Look at these things.

445
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Can we take it back?

446
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Yes.

447
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Thank you.

448
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
You're welcome.

449
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Wang Ya has been under a lot of pressure since he was a child.

450
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
It's all pressure from his parents.

451
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
It's the kind of life expectation that can only be taken.

452
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Look at how extreme this sentence is.

453
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
You can't take a wrong step.

454
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Once you take the wrong step,

455
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
it's a dead end.

456
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Five years ago,

457
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
he must have taken the wrong step.

458
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
It's possible.

459
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Then this internet date is the end date.

460
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
It's June 1st five years ago.

461
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
The last piece.

462
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
These are the award-winning photos of him.

463
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
And a sentence.

464
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
The new beginning of life.

465
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Wang Ya started to change at that time.

466
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,100
How do you feel like it's the turning point of life?

467
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Master, Brother Jiu, look at this.

468
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
The End of the World

469
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Zhong Gu.

470
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
I'm going to talk.

471
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
I know.

472
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Brother Jiu checked the internet information of Wang Ya for the past half year.

473
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
One of the consumer data shows

474
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,100
that he bought a pair of Kanaxin in the shop in the park.

475
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Are we going to see Liao Yifan?

476
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Liao Yifan likes this kind of wild flowers.

477
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Do you know what Kanaxin means?

478
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Emotion,

479
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
glory,

480
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
regret.

481
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
That's right.

482
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
It's regret.

483
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Wang Ya is

484
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
the one who killed Liao Yifan.

485
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Wang Ya.

486
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Five years ago,

487
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
on June 1st,

488
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
what happened?

489
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Do you remember?

490
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
It's been too long.

491
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I don't remember.

492
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Let me remind you.

493
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
You were driving to the Taoyi branch.

494
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
You bumped into a girl.

495
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Her name is Liao Yifan.

496
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Don't you remember?

497
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I just said

498
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
it's been too long.

499
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I don't remember.

500
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
I don't remember.

501
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Such a big thing

502
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
happened to anyone.

503
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
It's a big turning point in life.

504
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
You can't help but remember.

505
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Wang Ya.

506
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
I think you should be a kind person.

507
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
You should be strong.

508
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You should be a good person.

509
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
You should be a good person.

510
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
You should be a kind person.

511
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
A strong sense of guilt

512
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
makes you feel like

513
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
you're always in a fantasy.

514
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
A little girl in a red dress.

515
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Look at this photo.

516
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
When Liao Yifan was killed by you,

517
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
she was wearing a red dress.

518
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
This is the picture of Wuxian Tai.

519
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,100
I think you should wear it as a kidnapping picture.

520
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Sorry to bother you.

521
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I just took a photo of her when Liao Yifan was lost.

522
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
I gave the hug.

523
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
You N~)

524
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
You real good?

525
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Thank you.

526
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,100
This speech of yours

527
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
was so difficult.

528
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,700
You've been lying.

529
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,900
From your attitude,

530
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,500
I know who you want to protect.

531
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,100
Have you thought about it?

532
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,900
What will happen to the person who needs this medicine

533
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,500
and hasn't been able to take it for so long?

534
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,700
One more day, there will be another danger.

535
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,300
Don't expect Liao Boyan.

536
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,100
The police will closely watch his every move.

537
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,700
Wang Ya.

538
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,900
Five years ago, you already made a huge mistake.

539
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I hope you won't repeat the same mistake.

540
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,100
Tell us the truth, okay?

541
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,700
Here.

542
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,300
Here?

543
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,300
Dong Zai.

544
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,100
Dong Zai.

545
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,300
Where is the light? Don't touch it.

546
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,700
Where is the item?

547
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,300
On the second floor of the closet.

548
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,300
It's black.

549
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,700
Liao Boyan wrote this?

550
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,700
She's afraid that one day, she'll forget.

551
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,500
So when I call her,

552
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,300
I'll read it to her.

553
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,900
Dong Zai.

554
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,700
Dong Zai.

555
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,300
You still haven't found anything?

556
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,900
This isn't Liao Boyan's house.

557
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,100
The room in front is the most suspicious.

558
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,500
There's no tenant registration.

559
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,700
But every month,

560
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,100
there will be a small amount of electricity bills

561
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,700
deducted from the reserve.

562
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,500
The money will be deducted from the reserve.

563
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,100
The system has been reset. There's nothing in here.

564
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,100
This is Liao Boyan's real home.

565
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,700
�서

566
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Liao Boyan, look.

567
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,460
Do you know these things?

568
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,700
Do you know them?

569
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,180
And that house that you bought in the name of someone else.

570
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,260
Do you need me to help you remember what happened?

571
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,700
Stop pretending to be crazy.

572
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,100
You think you can escape from the punishment by not saying anything?

573
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,100
Is he sick again?

574
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,700
He seems to not care about anything.

575
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,300
What does he not care about?

576
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,900
He doesn't care about what Zheng Gang asked him.

577
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,500
He doesn't care about what evidence the police have found him with.

578
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,700
He's too relaxed.

579
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,300
Director Cao received Liao Boyan's ex-wife Tan Qing.

580
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,500
She came back to China yesterday.

581
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,700
I don't know what news she has from him.

582
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,700
She's the one who witnessed Liao Boyan's change.

583
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,100
Call her.

584
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,700
Okay.

585
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,500
Hello.

586
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,300
You are Tan Qing?

587
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,700
Miss Tan.

588
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,300
This is my ID.

589
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,300
We are from the Nanying Police Division's Police Police.

590
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Thank you for your cooperation in our investigation.

591
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,500
I don't want to cooperate with your investigation.

592
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
I just don't want to cause trouble for myself.

593
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,500
Then I'll just be straightforward.

594
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,700
You and Liao Boyan

595
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,300
divorced three months ago, right?

596
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,100
Why did you divorce?

597
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,700
Miss Tan, Liao Boyan has a serious criminal suspicion.

598
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,100
We want to know his motive through the past details.

599
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,100
We hope you can cooperate with the police investigation.

600
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,100
I don't get along with him.

601
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,500
Can you tell us more about it?

602
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,300
Miss Tan, Liao Boyan has a second-degree hemorrhage.

603
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
Do you know about it?

604
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,500
Who? What?

605
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,900
Liao Boyan.

606
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,500
She has a second-degree hemorrhage. Do you know about it?

607
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,300
I don't know.

608
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,100
I already divorced her.

609
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,900
You don't even know about her illness?

610
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,700
Why should I know?

611
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,100
Why should I know?

612
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,300
I hate her! I hate Liao Boyan!

613
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,900
Ke'ran.

614
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Miss Tan, look.

615
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,500
Do you know these people?

616
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,100
You know them?

617
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,900
This is Liao Boyan's hairpin.

618
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,700
How did you do it?

619
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
On the bed.

620
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,500
Hairpin?

621
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Impossible.

622
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,700
You're still young. Drink milk.

623
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,300
What kind of motive and purpose

624
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,100
can make Liao Boyan

625
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,700
work with the person who killed his daughter?

626
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,100
Kidnapping case.

627
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,700
A sexual assault case.

628
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,900
Did we miss something?

629
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,500
Do you remember it?

630
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,100
Yes.

631
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,300
ius.

632
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,000
Miss Little Princess Kenyan presenting Erwuplis.

633
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,700
I have an important thing.

634
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,500
burnt because my child drove me crazy.

635
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,020
When I think about it,

636
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,820
you have to care about the men in this case.

637
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,080
That's why all these years,

638
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,340
I have never had any conjecture exhibition.

639
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,940
Even if I had a litigative disease,

640
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,160
things like that shouldn'tبي done again.

641
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,500
Okay?

642
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,620
Where is Liu Ziqun?

643
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,020
Chief?

644
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,300
Can you call it Qin Hao pin, please?

645
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,540
I'll go now.

646
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,180
After that, they will return with the second horse.

647
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,140
With this carriage,

648
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,620
these sisters happy

649
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,420
can be replied.

650
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,560
Don't stop anymore.

651
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,500
That's what I'd rest assured about.

652
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,460
I say

653
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,800
to follow this carriage

654
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,560
and probably was able to get a seat belt

655
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,800
when he was completely free.

656
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,800
Liu Zixuan got into the car voluntarily?

657
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
The Stork-Elmo effect?

658
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
I was just pretending to be Wang Ya.

659
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
What secret must be between them?

660
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,800
He refused to tell us, so we had to continue our search.

661
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
From the little princess' rainbow,

662
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
and from those kids.

663
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,400
Windy City

664
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,320
Da Jun!

665
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,300
Submit everyone over.

666
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,800
You have to find

667
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,400
the possible connections

668
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,200
between kids and adults today.

669
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,800
Go into more details.

670
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,680
Okay.

671
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Day and night. Day and night again.

672
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,240
I hate the day and night anymore.

673
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,200
Your skin is quite good, right?

674
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,640
You know how to put on makeup. How pretty is it?

675
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,040
I don't have makeup on. I don't have makeup on.

676
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,640
You put on this, what is it called? Eye shadow.

677
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,480
Eye shadow? Where is the eye shadow?

678
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,480
Here.

679
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,280
No, are you stupid? This is a dark circle.

680
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,640
Who would put on eye shadow underneath?

681
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,520
Get back to work.

682
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,160
I'll be responsible for the reception.

683
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,640
Look, what you want to eat. Order whatever you want.

684
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,000
This is what you said. Don't be sad.

685
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,720
Come.

686
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,440
You want to order takeout again?

687
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,920
Master, Director Zhang.

688
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,760
Hello, Director.

689
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,880
Your master is ready.

690
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,400
This is for you.

691
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,000
Thank you, Master. Thank you, Master.

692
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,800
Thank you, Master.

693
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,200
Thank you, Director Zhang.

694
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,560
Your master said that after this case is solved,

695
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,280
we will make a big meal to entertain everyone.

696
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,120
Good!

697
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,480
Thank you, Master.

698
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,000
Yes.

699
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,720
Can I order something more expensive?

700
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,680
This heart-warming dinner is the best.

701
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,880
I won't order it. Today, I'll save some for you.

702
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,520
Superb.

703
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,560
Everyone, look at this.

704
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,960
Liu Zi Xuan and Yang Yan?

705
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
These two kids are making a deal.

706
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,760
It's like they're making a secret agreement.

707
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,760
Look. Is this Xie Xiao Hua?

708
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,960
Is this Xie Wu Qiang's death?

709
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,160
Is there any hidden agenda?

710
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,760
Xie Xiao Hua had a kidney transplant.

711
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,160
Will this have anything to do with those anti-inflammatory drugs?

712
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,960
We indeed missed out on one thing.

713
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,760
The child.

714
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,760
Xiao Hua, they're here.

715
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Thank you.

716
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,560
You're welcome.

717
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,360
When can I see my mother?

718
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,960
Mom will be back in a while.

719
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,160
She misses you a lot, so she asked us to visit you.

720
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,760
Xiao Hua.

721
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,360
Your mom can't reach you on the phone.

722
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,160
It's not convenient to call you on the phone,

723
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,760
but she wrote you a letter.

724
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,360
Look.

725
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,360
During this time, you must be stronger and braver.

726
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,960
Listen to the doctor's advice. Eat your medicine and eat on time.

727
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,960
When I see you, you must grow taller and stronger.

728
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,560
The two uncles who wrote you a letter, they're good people.

729
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,360
They're the police.

730
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,360
They've helped me and will take care of you.

731
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,960
You must believe them and listen to them.

732
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,760
Xiao Hua, I'll be fine.

733
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,960
When I come back, I'll make you delicious food every day.

734
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,960
I'll grow up with you.

735
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,960
Please grow up with me.

736
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,160
I love you, mom.

737
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,960
Thank you.

738
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,360
You're welcome.

739
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,760
Xiao Hua, your mom is very brave.

740
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,760
In order to protect you, she did her best.

741
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,560
Take care of yourself.

742
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,560
When she's recovered and is discharged, you must protect her.

743
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,160
I want to ask you something.

744
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,760
Do you know Yang Yan?

745
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

746
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,360
I know you know him.

747
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,560
Tell me.

748
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,360
How did you two meet?

749
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,960
I couldn't find it. This broken computer.

750
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,760
Don't keep staring at the computer. The medical records of the paper are all here.

751
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
Come and check with me, okay?

752
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,360
Yes.

753
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,360
We're here to help.

754
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,760
Hurry up.

755
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,560
I haven't checked this pile. Put it here.

756
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,360
Okay.

757
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,560
I found it.

758
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,360
Liao Yifan's heart was returned to Yang Yan.

759
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,760
The light is shining on the cold, silent wall of people.

760
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,560
There are no place to hide in this corner.

761
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:18,160
A bitter taste, a distant feeling.

762
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,160
The night, the black color of the night, the silence of the disguise.

763
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,960
The dim eyes, the whisper of the wind.

764
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,560
It's despair, it's madness.

765
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:39,560
The night, the black color of the night, the silence of the disguise.

766
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:47,560
It's despair, it's madness.

767
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,760
In the dark night, the sound of the drum.

768
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,360
There are two people singing.

769
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,160
The blue flame is lighting the way.

770
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,560
The night is smiling, the night is looking at me.

771
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,160
The broken wall, the bright star.

772
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,760
The past is gone, the future is unknown.

773
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,560
The wings that are flying, the wings that are flying.

774
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:21,360
The hero that is in the city, the hero that is in the dream.

775
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,560
The night, the black color of the night, the silence of the disguise.

776
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,360
The dim eyes, the whisper of the wind.

777
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,960
It's despair, it's madness.

778
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:44,160
The night, the black color of the night, the silence of the disguise.

779
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:50,960
It's despair, it's madness.

780
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,760
In the dark night, the sound of the drum.

781
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,160
There are two people singing.

782
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,960
The blue flame is lighting the way.

783
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,360
The night is smiling, the night is looking at me.

784
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,960
The broken wall, the bright star.

785
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,560
The past is gone, the future is unknown.

786
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,360
The wings that are flying, the wings that are flying.

787
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,760
The hero that is in the city, the hero that is in the dream.

788
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,760
The night, the black color of the night, the white star.

789
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,960
The dim eyes, the white color of the night, the white star.

790
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,760
The bright star, the white star.

791
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,760
The bright star, the white star.

792
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,760
The bright star, the white star.

793
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,760
The bright star, the white star.

794
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,760
The bright star, the white star.

795
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,760
The bright star, the white star.
