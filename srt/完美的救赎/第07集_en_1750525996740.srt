1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,040
Honey,

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,600
this watch

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
and daughter are all the gifts I gave you.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,560
I hope you can think of me and my daughter

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,560
when you look at the time in the future.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,760
I know you are a police officer.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,400
You have to fight and take risks.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
I understand.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,520
But I also hope

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,240
you can take care of yourself.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,880
You can take care of him in the future.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,080
Because you are already a father.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,360
How about it?

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,080
Do you like it?

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Nelson!!!

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Does Xiao Dade often pack upania here?

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,800
No.

19
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
Fei Zai usually eats at a restaurant.

20
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,520
He can't bear to take more money from the food.

21
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
It was that night.

22
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,920
The dishes are here.

23
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,000
Boss, give me a small piece of meat.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
Okay, find a place to sit.

25
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
Pack it up.

26
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Okay.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
That night, he was suddenly panicking.

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
Why was he panicking?

29
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,280
I don't know.

30
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,960
I was busy with business.

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Did he have any other problems?

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
He did.

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,960
He went to the washroom during the day.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,920
What does he look like?

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm not sure.

36
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm busy with other things.

37
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,600
Okay.

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,920
Don't bother.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Look.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
The big dish that Jiao Daze said was the big one

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
should be this one.

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
This sauce

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
is very surprising.

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,400
I can't say too much about this sauce.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,840
I can only tell you a little bit.

47
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
This sauce

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,960
is directed at the famous

49
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,240
person in charge of the medicine in Hong Kong.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,520
The princess of beauty, wisdom, and medicine.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,600
Hello.

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
I saw it.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,280
Recently, the princess is very popular.

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
But you guessed it.

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
I didn't lose.

56
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,640
I won't lose until the day I reveal it.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,440
Don't guess it, okay?

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
You came to see me

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,080
as a lawyer

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
or as a consultant?

61
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
It's all me.

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
That's different.

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,520
There are some things

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
I want to say to lawyer Zhong.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,920
So fine.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm not being 온ат pushed to my head.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,560
I want to know

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
if handling a case is important

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,720
or not.

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,640
I want to talk to you more.

71
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
By car.

72
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,280
By LD.

73
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,760
With battery.

74
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,480
As one.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,020
Can you

76
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,120
be more realistic?

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Not so same.

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm not surprised.

79
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm not surprised.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
You mean

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I shouldn't be surprised?

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Logically,

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
it's been a very unusual period of time.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I wish I could avoid trouble.

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
But trouble always comes to me.

86
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
The dirty water always

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
pours on me and Lv Yun.

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Don't you think it's weird?

89
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Ms. Zhao,

90
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
do you know

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
a girl named Liao Yifan?

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Who?

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Five years ago,

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
she was hit by a car

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
that was running away from the city.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I don't want to answer

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
your weird questions.

98
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
You have to answer.

99
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You're not allowed to answer.

100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I don't want to answer.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Then,

102
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I will answer it.

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm Zhao Qian.

105
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
I want to know

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
whether your adviser

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
can be investigated

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Yes.

109
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
He's sitting right in front of me.

110
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Till the last breath.

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,340
Boss Zhao.

112
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,680
Boss Zhao,

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,020
you are very familiar with the whole process

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,640
Sorry to bother you.

115
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,180
We will meet again.

116
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,160
Sir.

117
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
Why are you here so soon?

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
Why are you here alone to find Zhao Qian?

119
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm just here to talk with the police.

120
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
Stop being so cocky.

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,960
You can get a certificate of attorney

122
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,760
and go to the police to find trouble.

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Zhong Ning, I'm asking you. It's illegal to do this alone.

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,160
Do you know that? Are you a police?

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,960
You've already stolen your police uniform!

126
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,360
Chief Cao even called the mayor.

127
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
He asked why the police sent his attorney to find him.

128
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,560
I can help you with this.

129
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm willing to help you.

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Let me tell you, I can't stand

131
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
you being so unruly and selfish.

132
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Didn't you do it to get people to blame?

133
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Which time? Tell me if you have the guts!

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Seven years ago!

135
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,560
Did I say it clearly? Seven years ago!

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,560
I don't understand.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Why did the teacher ask you to come back?

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,560
Tell the teacher to fire me now.

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll fire you now!

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
Do you think I'm willing to be with you?

141
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,160
Do you think I'm willing to face you?

142
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm willing to face you.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Zhong Ning!

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm willing to face you!

145
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
By the way, you guys, come back and fight me.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
What's the matter with you?

147
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
How long do you want to fight?

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,760
Fight for another seven years?

149
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Get in the car.

150
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
You get in the car too.

151
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,160
I told you to get in the car!

152
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,760
Where are you going?

153
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,160
You'll know when you get there.

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
You're going to the hospital?

155
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm going to the hospital.

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,560
I'll call you when I get there.

157
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll call you when I get there.

158
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Stop.

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm not going to the hospital.

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
I'm going to the hospital.

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm going to the hospital.

162
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm going to the hospital.

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm going to the hospital.

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
I'm going to the hospital.

165
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm going to the hospital.

166
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm going to the hospital.

167
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,160
The pageant has long since ended.

168
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm afraid it still exists in your heart.

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,560
You can't escape, but you can't go back.

170
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,960
I dare to say that you may not have been here

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,240
for the past seven years.

172
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
Can you escape for the rest of your lives?

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Is it worth it?

174
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Say something!

175
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm working overtime to make PPT.

176
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
There's soup in the fridge.

177
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,680
Remember to warm it up.

178
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
Sir, please wash your hands.

179
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
You're quite handsome.

180
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,240
Here.

181
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
Here's a small cup for you.

182
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,480
It's quite luxurious.

183
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
You're quite a character.

184
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,800
How is it?

185
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
There's a problem with the detention.

186
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
We'll send it back after it's done.

187
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,680
We'll have to wait for five minutes.

188
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,160
We've already sent the people away.

189
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Sir, let's go!

190
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,160

229
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
What are you doing?

230
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Don't move!

231
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't move!

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Don't go there!

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Don't go there, brother!

235
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Don't move!

236
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't move!

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Master.

238
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,880
Wenjing said

239
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
she likes to see me in a suit.

240
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,880
She thinks I'm very handsome.

241
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,480
I want her

242
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,080
to see me in a suit at last.

243
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Then I won't see you again.

244
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
What are you doing?

245
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
From tomorrow on,

246
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,080
I won't be a police.

247
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,480
What do you mean?

248
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Master.

249
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,480
People need to be taken care of.

250
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,480
Her illness

251
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
will cost a lot of money.

252
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
Wenjing

253
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,680
is not the same as I thought.

254
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
In the next life,

255
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
I only have one thing.

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,080
I need to take good care of Ren Xi.

257
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
I need to cure her illness.

258
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,880
I need to let her grow up healthy.

259
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Brother.

260
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,280
You want to punish yourself?

261
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
I deserve it.

262
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Five minutes.

263
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Just five more minutes.

264
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Shut up!

265
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,080
I always treat you as my children.

266
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,280
You two are brothers.

267
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,280
Now I need some space to find you a wife.

268
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Take it easy.

269
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
I really want to kill you.

270
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,600
I would do anything in the world to fight for democracy,

271
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,960
to hold you back.

272
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
Allen.

273
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't let Wenjing down.

274
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,080
Seven years have passed.

275
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,680
Look at you in a police uniform.

276
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
The police station

277
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Zhong Ning

278
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Please tell me where you are.

279
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
I'm in the network.

280
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Where are you from?

281
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
I'm from Hainan.

282
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Stop.

283
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Be careful.

284
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Zhong Ning

285
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
It's good to have an ideal.

286
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Promise me.

287
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Don't lie.

288
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Zhong Ning

289
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I promise you.

290
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I will not change.

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
I will not change.

I promise you.

296
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
I will not change.

297
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
I promise you.

298
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
I will not change.

299
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I promise you.

300
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
I will not change.

I promise you.

302
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
I will not change.

303
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
I promise you.

304
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
I will not change.

305
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I promise you.

306
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I will not change.

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I promise you.

308
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
I will not change.

309
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
I promise you.

310
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
I will not change.

311
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
I promise you.

312
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
I promise you.

313
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
I promise you.

314
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I promise you.

315
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I promise you.

316
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
I promise you.

317
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
I promise you.

318
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
I promise you.

319
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
You shouldn't let her go.

320
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Let her go?

321
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
To where?

322
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
To Icuniticus.

323
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Go?

324
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,720
I greeny will find

325
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
Icuniticus.

326
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Go.

327
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Go.

328
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Go.

329
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Go.

330
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
I am going.

331
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I am going to take money from you.

332
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Bye.

333
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Bye.

334
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Bye.

335
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Good luck.

336
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Uncle YU

337
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,960
Only you...

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,320
Don't do it.

339
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
When we were doing the fam-

340
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,520
We to be active enough to project our advantage

341
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,760
Right?

342
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,960
You could have touched curse me.

343
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,320
But

344
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
because of my glasses,

345
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,640
I was able to trace your memories.

346
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,760
what are you doing

347
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Yesterday you said that you didn't have any evidence,

348
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,120
today you want evidence

349
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,320
I've been taking many deadly damage to Hongzhifei's brother Wanna

350
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,820
But Czyli doesn'tな

351
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,720
My friend tirelessly

352
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,880
The other bidder, my brother

353
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,560
With a girl

354
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,880
Have you come home?

355
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,720
Yes

356
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,620
Then you look beautiful

357
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,760
What business

358
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,120
So quietly

359
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
What kind of behavior

360
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,840
You honor thoseta

361
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,800
I feel

362
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm not sure.

363
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Chief Zao.

364
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,200
I killed someone for you.

365
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
You're not feeling safe.

366
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,600
I need to find something to release.

367
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Right?

368
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,800
You've

369
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
taken it.

370
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Brother Kai.

371
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Aren't we on the same boat?

372
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Of course.

373
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,000
I really want to be like Chief Zao.

374
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Walk to the main island and see the light.

375
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
What's so good about seeing the light?

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's very good.

377
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
Especially someone like me who stays in the dark.

378
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
I really want to see the light.

379
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
What do you mean?

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
I want to return that dog to you.

381
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,400
Hey, you community leader.

382
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:54,900
Tuo Jianyyuan

383
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
Do you still remember this dog?

384
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,900
Nine years ago,

385
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You're a dog.

386
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Now he has returned his original owner.

387
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,260
The dog you raised

388
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,900
is biting people now.

389
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,100
You're fierce.

390
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,580
How dare you?

391
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,380
You want to bite me too?

392
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,300
Did you see that?

393
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
It's useless.

394
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,100
You should learn from him

395
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
to keep your teeth well.

396
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,420
Where are you going?

397
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,980
I'll change your owner.

398
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Don't be nervous.

399
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,380
I carefully designed these for you.

400
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,180
I selected 102 photos

401
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,580
of different mothers.

402
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,780
Not only these,

403
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
there are more.

404
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,580
Every night in the future,

405
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,780
I'll be with you in the water.

406
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
Good night.

407
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,180
He went abroad?

408
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,380
Yes.

409
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,180
Five years ago,

410
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,380
when Liao Yifan had a car accident,

411
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,380
he wasn't in China.

412
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,380
So he couldn't have been

413
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,980
the one who killed Liao Yifan.

414
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,380
So the previous

415
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,980
reasoning didn't work?

416
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,980
Did I make a mistake?

417
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Actually,

418
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,380
I believe in your intuition.

419
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,780
If it was really Liao Boyan,

420
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,180
I would have found out the truth.

421
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,380
I saved Ren Xi.

422
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,780
I even saved you.

423
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Why are you so angry in the daytime?

424
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
I'm having a happy time.

425
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,180
I want to hug my son.

426
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,380
Where is my son?

427
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,580
Didn't you ask Mr. Zhao

428
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,780
to come to the company?

429
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,780
Which Mr. Zhao?

430
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,580
Which Mr. Zhao?

431
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Zhao Qian.

432
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,380
When did I ask him to come?

433
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,180
Why didn't you ask me?

434
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm not your son.

435
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
I'm your son.

436
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
I'm your son.

437
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
I'm your son.

438
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,580
Why didn't you ask me?

439
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Mr. Zhao said you had arranged it.

440
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,180
He's Zhao Qian.

441
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,380
How dare I ask so much?

442
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
Isn't he your partner in the company?

443
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,980
I didn't think you were so stupid.

444
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,980
What are you doing?

445
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Zhao Qian.

446
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,780
Mr. Liu.

447
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,980
Mr. Liu.

448
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,980
Mr. Zhao.

449
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,180
You came to me.

450
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Don't touch my son.

451
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,780
It's not that serious.

452
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,180
Your son is a good boy.

453
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,180
He gave me a toy.

454
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,380
Mr. Zhao.

455
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,580
Do you need a security guard?

456
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,580
No.

457
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,380
Before Brother Kai,

458
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,580
he was a security guard for my dad here.

459
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,380
Right, Brother Kai?

460
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,780
Yes.

461
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,980
You can go out.

462
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Close the door.

463
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,580
Okay.

464
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,780
The toy is good.

465
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,580
At least it won't bite.

466
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,580
You want a son?

467
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Your son knows to give me a gift.

468
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,580
Shouldn't you show your gratitude?

469
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,580
This one, right?

470
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,980
How do I know?

471
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
Do you have a backup?

472
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,980
I really don't have one.

473
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,980
It doesn't matter.

474
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,180
Brother Kai.

475
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Listen carefully to what I say.

476
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,980
Evidence can be used as backup.

477
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,380
But people can't.

478
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,180
Someone sent Abao back.

479
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

480
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,180
That's right.

481
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,580
I told you.

482
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,380
It's no good to see the light.

483
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,180
Just like your son.

484
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,780
You don't dare to see the light again, right?

485
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,780
If there's another time,

486
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
it won't be like this.

487
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,380
I don't know what to do.

488
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,700
Even outstretched state

489
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
can't know anything.

490
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,580
How much is it?

491
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
I asked for 2.5 million.

492
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,340
So why organization Southeast Main Street

493
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,580
at the Mister LOL's place is recharge available?

494
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,620
Trans introduce us.

495
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,580
It will be sold by the continuance.

496
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,780
He said

497
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,220
that a representative from the digital era

498
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Chief Zhao, don't worry.

499
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,540
Your father had a headshot.

500
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,220
We'll leave after a few shots.

501
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,020
I've been dreaming of the future these past few days.

502
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,020
I feel like he's not leaving. We'll leave after a few shots.

503
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,420
He fell down on his own. What's wrong with that?

504
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,820
Mo Yuan. Mo Yuan.

505
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,620
Dongdong. Dongdong. Dongdong.

506
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,220
Go over there. Close your eyes.

507
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,820
Cover your ears.

508
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,020
It's okay. Go over there.

509
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,820
Go. Go.

510
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
Mom!

511
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,420
Close your eyes. Cover your ears.

512
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,020
Don't come to the green room anymore.

513
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm sorry.

514
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,020
Husband, where are you going?

515
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,420
I won't go anywhere until I make it clear.

516
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,020
Move.

517
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,820
You're going to find that fox, right?

518
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,820
I'm going to protect my son.

519
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,220
Can you give me a son?

520
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,820
I should say, can you still give birth?

521
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,820
Liu Rui Kai!

522
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Are you talking about me?

523
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,820
Ah Xing. Yes, I can't give birth now.

524
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,020
That's because of the illness your daughter had.

525
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,820
I'll die!

526
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,420
I want a son!

527
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,020
You bastard!

528
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,420
Liu Rui Kai!

529
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Liu Rui Kai! Liu Rui Kai, come back!

530
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Mom, don't.

531
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,020
Mom.

532
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,020
Little girl, which one do you want?

533
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
This one.

534
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,420
Okay, radish.

535
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,020
40.

536
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Okay.

537
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,620
Okay, thank you.

538
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,420
Thank you.

539
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,220
Master, did you see my son?

540
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,620
Which class is your child in? What's his name?

541
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,020
Class 27, Qian Dong.

542
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,620
Qian Dong. Don't worry, I'll ask.

543
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,020
No, he's gone.

544
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,620
Gone?

545
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,420
The teacher said Qian Dong has left.

546
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,020
Gone?

547
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes, he's gone.

548
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,220
Qian Dong!

549
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,620
Hello, teacher, did you see this child?

550
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,220
Class 27, Qian Dong.

551
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,020
No.

552
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,620
Hello, did you see this child?

553
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,420
No.

554
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,220
Class 27, Qian Dong!

555
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
Hello, did you see this child?

556
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,620
Class 27, Qian Dong.

557
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
No, I didn't see him.

558
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,820
Zuo Zuo!

559
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,420
Zuo Zuo!

560
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,220
Zuo Zuo!

561
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,020
Zuo Zuo!

562
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,620
Zuo Zuo!

563
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,220
Zuo Zuo!

564
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,820
Mom!

565
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,420
Zuo Zuo!

566
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,820
Where did you go?

567
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,620
Mom!

568
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,220
Where did you go?

569
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,420
You scared me to death!

570
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,820
When I came home,

571
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,420
someone pulled me into a car.

572
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,820
Who?

573
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,620
I don't know.

574
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,220
I heard a voice.

575
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,620
Zuo Zuo.

576
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,420
Mom, I'm scared.

577
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,620
Weisheng.

578
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,020
Weisheng, don't be scared.

579
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
How did you come back?

580
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,820
Your uncle brought me back.

581
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,620
Uncle?

582
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,020
Be careful.

583
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,820
Why does it smell like gasoline?

584
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
It's all gasoline!

585
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,020
Mom, I'm scared.

586
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,220
It's okay.

587
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
It's okay, don't be scared.

588
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Mom will protect you.

589
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,220
Is he really going to kill me?

590
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
Thank you.

591
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
You're welcome.

592
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,620
I know you.

593
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,020
Your name is Fang Qin Chun.

594
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,420
Your husband Qian Cheng is a senior in the green medicine department.

595
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,620
He committed suicide a year ago.

596
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,020
How did you know about my family?

597
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,620
I also know that Qian Cheng didn't commit suicide.

598
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,820
Yes.

599
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,420
He didn't commit suicide.

600
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,420
My husband must have been killed by Zhao Qian.

601
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,020
When he was a new member of the family,

602
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,020
I asked four detectives to investigate Zhao Qian.

603
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,220
But they didn't find anything.

604
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,020
Four detectives?

605
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,220
Later, when he died,

606
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,420
no one believed me.

607
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,220
They all said he was a suicide.

608
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,620
Zhao Qian,

609
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,420
they even threatened me to shut up.

610
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,820
But for the sake of the child,

611
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
I know...

612
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Qian Cheng did commit suicide.

613
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,420
But he hung his rope on his neck.

614
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,620
But there was no one else.

615
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I know.

616
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,820
But there was no evidence.

617
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,220
This is Zhao Qian's power.

618
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,620
He never did it himself.

619
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,420
He was forced to control himself.

620
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,020
That's how Qian Cheng died.

621
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,620
Mom.

622
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,820
It's okay.

623
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,220
Your son is very sensible.

624
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,220
I hope he's not that sensible.

625
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,620
He's a young child.

626
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,820
Zhao Qian can be cruel.

627
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,020
I must kill him.

628
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,020
If you really think so,

629
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,220
I can help you.

630
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,020
If Zhao Qian doesn't die,

631
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,220
more people will suffer.

632
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,820
Not just you two.

633
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,820
I won't do anything about the murder.

634
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,220
You don't need to do anything.

635
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,020
You just need to call Zhao Qian

636
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,620
and ask him to meet you.

637
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,020
He won't come out.

638
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,220
He will.

639
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,420
Why?

640
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,420
Because he's guilty.

641
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,220
We've introduced all kinds of advanced

642
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,420
automated devices and information systems.

643
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,620
The whole process of the factory's

644
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,220
production and production of products

645
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,220
is managed by AI.

646
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,420
Now, through the glass,

647
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,620
we can see the products

648
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,220
being filled and sealed

649
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,620
on different production lines.

650
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,820
I'll answer the phone.

651
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,620
Who is it?

652
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,620
I'm the wife of Qian Cheng,

653
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,820
the one who sells beef.

654
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,620
Mrs. Feng?

655
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,620
What is it?

656
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,620
I'm sure today

657
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,020
that Qian Cheng was really killed by you.

658
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,620
Sure?

659
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,020
What do you mean?

660
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,620
If you want people to not know,

661
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,020
you must do something.

662
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,620
Fortunately, Qian Cheng was left with one hand.

663
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Otherwise, he would have died.

664
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
What do you mean?

665
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,620
Zhao Qian, you're done for.

666
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,620
What do you want?

667
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,020
At eight tonight,

668
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,220
I'll wait for you in Xinggao Park.

669
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,620
You must come alone.

670
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
You'll know when it's time.

671
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,220
I'll wait for you in Xinggao Park.
