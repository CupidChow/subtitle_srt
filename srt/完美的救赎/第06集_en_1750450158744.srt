1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Simba

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,600
Mom

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,420
Soup

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,820
Bro

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,400
Come inside

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,420
Come inside

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,840
Slow down.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
Okay.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,060
Okay.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,880
I just hide

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
in the corner of the melted salt.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,640
After this,

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,480
he always Wirelessly

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,840
forget the time.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
That's too much.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,320
I'll let Bai Zui go.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,800
I didn't expect that.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,280
It's all your fault.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,960
It's all your fault.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,240
If it weren't for Zhao Qian,

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,960
this accident

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,800
wouldn't have happened.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,280
It's all your fault.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
If it weren't for her,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
she would have given me a death sentence.

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
I understand.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,440
You still can't let her go.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,920
It's all my fault.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,800
I shouldn't have bothered you.

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm the victim of Zhao Qian's accident.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,680
He even gave me a death sentence.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
It's just a secret.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
I'll break the human's room

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,080
if it's a secret.

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,160
You know

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm just a secret.

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
It's all your fault.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,840
I don't know what happened.

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,040
Your fault.

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,520
I don't know what happened.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
Your fault.

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
I don't know what happened.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
It's all your fault.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,320
It's all your fault.

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,480
It's all your fault.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
It's all your fault.

49
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,140
That's so weird.

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
All my hair will be gone.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,760
Never mind.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,520
Try it again.

53
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,720
Here.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
Wen him now?

55
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,640
Er MSG.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
Why didn't you answer me?

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
Go on.

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,440
I never ate the food那个

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,020
It should be meals were interrupted

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,820
Guard 有搏兜痕迹

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,980
Look forward to thean

62
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,160
Sub jeżeli

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Bones with wounds

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,380
In this fight it should be used a職 tool

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,640
Bones have phas or symptoms

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,260
It was just combined

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
What were you looking at?

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,080
I saw him a few days ago.

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
And today,

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
when I saw him die,

71
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,880
I was afraid that I would be implicated.

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
So I was looking at him.

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Afraid of being implicated?

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,080
What are you doing?

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
Nothing.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
What else do you want to do?

77
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
When was the last time you saw Xia Dade?

78
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
Just a few days ago.

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
He said he didn't have a live broadcast.

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
And he wanted to sell the equipment.

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Just pick whatever you want.

82
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
Pick whatever you want.

83
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
But we are so close.

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Don't give me money.

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Why didn't you broadcast it?

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
I was so mad.

87
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I said I couldn't speak.

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I was so mad.

89
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,280
If you want me to say it,

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
you can go to the office.

91
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
You can send the number.

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Send it back.

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
He has money and business.

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
I am a little chief.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
I don't have any reason to say it.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Who is this?

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Who?

98
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
The one who killed my cousin.

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,080
This camera is good.

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Can it be used?

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
You don't want it?

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,280
Camera?

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
I don't sell it.

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
What's the name of the bag?

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,880
What?

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Hurry up.

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Give me the number.

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,480
Hurry up.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,080
What?

110
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
The door is going to open.

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
I have a big deal for you.

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
It's going to open again.

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
And then...

114
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
And then...

115
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
I don't know.

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
The camera.

117
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
The report is out.

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
It's a live broadcast again.

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
The third one.

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,680
A live broadcast of the second person.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
The time of death.

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
The time of death

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,280
calculated by the analysis of the poison.

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
It's about 10 o'clock in the evening.

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
There is a pharmacy nearby.

126
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
We went so far to buy it.

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,480
There is a big meeting over there.

128
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,480
You became a rich man.

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
You forgot how ordinary people live.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,080
Hello.

131
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
Give me four points.

132
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Keep the report.

133
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,880
Stop.

134
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
10 o'clock and 55 o'clock.

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,280
The time of death of Li Xiao Da is almost

136
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,280
the same as the time of death of Li Xiao Da.

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
The time of death is almost the same as the time of death of Li Xiao Da.

138
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
The time of death of Li Xiao Da is almost

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
25 minutes.

140
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,080
You want to play?

141
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
I and Zheng's team, you two team.

142
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,080
They all went in from that alley.

143
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,080
If it's now the road to the wedding case in the evening,

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
avoid surveillance,

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
and then we will meet in Xiao Da De

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
and go out to the house.

147
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Remember to calculate the time.

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Remember me.

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
Use normal steps.

150
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,880
Go.

151
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
Go.

152
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,080
Go.

153
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,080
Go.

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,480
The time of death is 25 minutes.

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Come back to 50 minutes.

156
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
There is enough time to do the case.

157
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Liao Boyan is very suspicious.

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,480
The surveillance and surveillance of this generation

159
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
if it is him,

160
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
it will be shorter than the time

161
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,080
we are more familiar with.

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
26 minutes.

163
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,680
Go.

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Let's go.

165
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
You come back to life.

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
I will.

167
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,680
Go.

168
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,480
Liao Boyan.

169
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
The South Eagle Public Security Bureau is in line.

170
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
Do you know why we came to you?

171
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,080
Please come back to take the investigation.

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
Why are you playing again?

173
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,680
You are playing again?

174
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,080
You are playing again?

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
You are playing again?

176
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
What are you doing?

177
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,280
I am not.

178
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
You are playing again?

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
You are playing again?

180
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,080
Go.

181
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,480
What are you doing?

182
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Let go of me.

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Liao Boyan.

184
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Liao Boyan.

185
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,480
Xi Xi.

186
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
Can you open the door?

187
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
No.

188
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,880
Why do you want to catch him?

189
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
Why do you want to catch him?

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,280
Why do you want to catch him?

191
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,480
Why do you want to catch him?

192
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,480
Liao Boyan is the oldest in the world.

193
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,680
He is my favorite hero.

194
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,080
Do you want to know

195
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
why I came back to take the investigation?

196
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,680
I don't want to know.

197
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,280
I should tell you the reason.

198
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,080
The missing girl, Yang Yan.

199
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,680
I know her.

200
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
She is in the same school as you.

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,080
You are in the primary school.

202
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,280
She is in the middle school.

203
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Uncle.

204
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Are you looking for something?

205
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,680
Yes.

206
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,480
Look at this.

207
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,880
Yes.

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Thank you.

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,680
It's great.

210
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,480
It's okay.

211
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I thought no one wanted it.

212
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,680
This watch is important to uncle.

213
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,880
Thank you.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
It's okay.

215
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
The rainbow of the princess.

216
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,680
But why is the rainbow black?

217
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
Yang Yan gave me a painting.

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
It's the one you put in the room.

219
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
ark

220
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,080
Yang NianYOA told me that

221
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,040
It was black.

222
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,880
Then it disappeared.

223
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
Now it's alive and dead.

224
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,600
It's painted black and rainbow.

225
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,760
It must be in the dark.

226
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,040
I want to know

227
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,200
what it has been caused.

228
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,440
Xi Xi.

229
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,880
Uncle Liao has also caused

230
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,120
a lot of bad things.

231
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,480
I don't want to catch him.

232
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,240
I want to know the truth.

233
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,040
I want to find Yan Yin.

234
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,880
I hope he is alive.

235
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,840
Dad used to be a police officer.

236
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,280
I want to help them.

237
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
So,

238
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
please believe me.

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Okay?

240
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
I can find out the truth.

241
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,840
Mr. Lu.

242
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,880
I want to see Yan Yin.

243
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,360
She's young.

244
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,960
She's young and thin.

245
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
So Although she is older,

246
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:52,900
**Watching

247
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,620
Okay.

248
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,360
Are you in?

249
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,060
No, I don't want to go on 好,好,好.

250
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,900

Who is it?

259
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,660
I don't know.

260
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,960
Our family member Clan Leader's brother.

261
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,120
She's��

We still want to take you to Immortal Hall to establish a High Mittag Once More.

264
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,020
Good Lord.

265
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,480
If you wanna be like this,

266
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,820
takeroom the factory moniner.

267
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,800
But it's...

268
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,700
I said the pink is very pretty.

269
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,940
Does it look pretty?

270
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,060
It's...

271
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,240
There's something very interesting that's coming to mind.

272
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,380
Try mad.

273
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,700
Me?

274
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,180
He's the Haga Master of Gun.

275
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Warrior står!

276
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,960
Commander Zhang

277
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,640
I found a witness who said he saw the suspect.

278
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,160
Speak out loud.

279
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,760
I found a witness who said he saw the suspect.

280
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,960
I usually come back early.

281
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,760
That day, I came back late because of something.

282
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,960
He is from the neighborhood of Xiao Dade.

283
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Hello.

284
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,760
Hello.

285
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Tell me the details you saw.

286
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,960
That night, I came back.

287
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,760
I saw someone come out of Xiao Dade's room.

288
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
I didn't care much.

289
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm still afraid to think about it.

290
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
You know what? If I followed her,

291
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
I would have seen more of her.

292
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,360
Maybe I would have been caught too.

293
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,960
Did you see her face?

294
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
No.

295
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,160
Did that person have something different from the usual?

296
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,360
It's a special evidence.

297
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,160
Yes. His figure is very easy to recognize.

298
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
His figure?

299
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,760
Don't worry. Look carefully.

300
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,560
Is it him?

301
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,960
Xiao Dade. Did you kill him?

302
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,560
No.

303
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,760
No?

304
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,360
Are you sure?

305
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
Yes.

306
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
That person is very fat.

307
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,760
He is completely different from the person in the room.

308
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,360
If he can see it anywhere, he must be fine.

309
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,560
The plan is useless.

310
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
The plan is useless.

311
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,160
No need to cut it.

312
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Dr. Liao.

313
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,760
The wife of Xie Wuchang said that he killed the person.

314
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Do you believe that he killed the murderer?

315
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,760
Do you know how many kilometers from the Wu Pin House at the crime scene?

316
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,160
Let me tell you.

317
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,160
Xie Wuchang's real death was not a left-handed iron hammer.

318
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,360
It was a pure control of the machine.

319
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Look at these two people.

320
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,160
Yang Youmu, Xie Wuchang.

321
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm very clear about telling you that the person who killed them

322
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,160
was the same murderer.

323
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,160
He was also the murderer who killed Xiao Dade.

324
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,360
Who was the murderer?

325
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,560
What do you want to say?

326
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,760
I want to go to the toilet.

327
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Dr. Liao, you misunderstood.

328
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
How bold you are.

329
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
This way, please.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,360
What are you doing here?

331
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,560
I'm trying. The machine doesn't have a button.

332
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
I have a question.

333
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,960
Are you looking at me that I'm not good at acting?

334
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
No.

335
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Lie.

336
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,760
So I said that the machine is not bad, but your brain is bad.

337
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,160
Do you know that you found the witness?

338
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,960
Xiao Dade's neighbor said that he saw the criminal.

339
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,560
That body is not good at acting.

340
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Very fat?

341
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,560
Director, Captain Zheng, you're out.

342
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,960
I've taken the skin organization from Xiao Dade's mouth.

343
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,360
The biological information and Dr. Liao are not good at acting.

344
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,960
Dr. Liao said that you've been harassing him for a while.

345
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Is that right?

346
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,560
Teacher, listen to me.

347
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,160
Some people are a burden to the body.

348
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,160
If you don't want to be burdened, just stay away from him.

349
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Unless you go back to the police and attack Zheng Gang,

350
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
it's impossible.

351
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,760
This is fun.

352
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,160
Qin Chi, recover him.

353
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,400
Yiming College

354
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Let me see

355
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,080
Here

356
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,800
You transfer to me

357
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Why

358
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
Then I'll just come with you

359
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Come together

360
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,600
What the hell

361
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,680
Don't you want to getabor

362
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,440
Go, you can't go with me.

363
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,260
case without injuries,

364
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,280
OK?

365
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,020
Nope.

366
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,080
Let me keep an eye on the convincing file.

367
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,840
This is a file.

368
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
You first take a look,

369
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
and regret what you did with me.

370
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,800
First,

371
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
you have to listen to what I said.

372
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,720
When you were unprotected,

373
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
you could have planned for this day.

374
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,720
Then you should have followedhan slain border.

375
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,340
I saw that you're stillâm

376
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,960
immediately after the2015 contest.

377
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,320
I forgot where I am.

378
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,720
Go and take care of her.

379
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,440
Are you the manager here?

380
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,280
Yes.

381
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,440
The manager.

382
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,240
Liao Yifan's tomb can take me there.

383
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Why are you always following me?

384
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
What are you doing?

385
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,760
Go away.

386
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,000
Go away.

387
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,560
Doctor, don't be so excited.

388
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,800
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

389
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,960
I forgot.

390
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,400
I forgot.

391
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I forgot.

392
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Where is my daughter?

393
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
Where is my daughter?

394
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Yifan.

395
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Doctor Liao.

396
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Where is she?

397
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Doctor Liao.

398
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Doctor Liao.

399
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
I know where Liao Yifan's tomb is.

400
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'll take you there.

401
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
The manager said she was like this in the last one.

402
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I forgot Liao Yifan's tomb.

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Director Hao.

404
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you think it's too much to suspect her?

405
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Mr. Yifan, where did Liao Yifan go?

406
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Call the ambulance.

407
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
He wouldn't want to drive my car.

408
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Who is he?

409
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Who are you?

410
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Who are you?

411
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I want your son.

412
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Stay here.

413
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
You should leave.

414
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
What did you hit me?

415
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
The speed you sold to me

416
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
is so fast.

417
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
We played a game.

418
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
If we win, we live.

419
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
If we lose, we die.

420
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
The hospital here is only 1.5 kilometers.

421
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
From now on,

422
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
you can't breathe for 10 minutes.

423
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
The hospital is over there.

424
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Don't lose it like Yang You Mo.

425
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,400
The End

426
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Episode 1

427
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm very grateful to the family for their support and understanding.

428
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
My signal is 100,000 fans.

429
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I'll give you a big deal.

430
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
The required data

431
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
can say that the dead

432
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
are the doctors from lettercz Ground

433
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
The immediate educational system

434
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
is a new rank

435
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
they can speak of.

436
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
You may excuse me more,

437
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
as the patient...

438
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,720
LeЫ

439
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,380
patient

440
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,380
What are you doing?

441
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
I'm just doing my job.

442
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,380
Boss, pay the bill.

443
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,380
Okay.

444
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
Don't move!

445
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
If I don't pay the bill, all the materials will be exposed!

446
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm here to help you.

447
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Help me?

448
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Give me the money.

449
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
I'll let you take the biggest part.

450
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
What do you want to do?

451
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,380
You know it's getting less and less safe.

452
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Then why should I believe you?

453
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,380
This is Luo Li's diary.

454
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
There's a real reason why he committed suicide.

455
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
It has nothing to do with Zhao Qian.

456
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Give me the money. I'll handle it.

457
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
I can find you.

458
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
The person who finds Qian can find you.

459
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,380
You have to be careful.

460
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
Don't come here again.

461
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,380
Think about it. I'll come to you again.

462
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
Don't come here again.

463
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
The dishes are ready.

464
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
Boss, give me a small fried pork.

465
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
Okay. Sit down.

466
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
I'll pack it up.

467
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Okay.

468
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,380
I'm here to help you.

469
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
I'll take care of you.

470
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,380
I'll take care of you.

471
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I'll take care of you.

472
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
I'll take care of you.

473
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
I'll take care of you.

474
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
I'll take care of you.

475
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
I'll take care of you.

476
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
I'll take care of you.

477
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
I'll take care of you.

478
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,380
I'll take care of you.

479
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
I'll take care of you.

480
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
I'll take care of you.

481
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
I'll take care of you.

482
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
I'll take care of you.

483
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,120
The restaurant known for its howling in咬

484
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,360
The police are here to save Zhao Chun pair.

485
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,060
The next team Memory Who Are You is here

486
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,120
Qu Yuan

487
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,240
Gu Xun

488
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,680
I really hope you will have a safe journey.

489
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,040
I am very happy to see you.

490
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,480
Wu Xun

491
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,960
Listen to me

492
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,600
�

493
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,800
Gu Xun

494
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,920
You can run to traveled,

495
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,080
if you won't run to

496
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,600
You've done a live broadcast of mine, right?

497
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Xiao Dade.

498
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,640
You've watched it.

499
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
Why do you have my phone number?

500
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
Your friend's power is very strong.

501
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Someone will know your old age.

502
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Mr. Xiao,

503
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
it's a legal society now.

504
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,880
The consequences of the harassment are very serious.

505
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,880
You should have taught him.

506
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
You don't have a memory.

507
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
But if I have evidence,

508
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,240
it's not a harassment, right?

509
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,120
How about it?

510
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,960
Do you want to see

511
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
how much money you can keep?

512
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,520
No.

513
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,560
What?

514
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,720
I hate being threatened the most.

515
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,200
What are you doing?

516
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,680
Take it out.

517
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,200
What is it?

518
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,280
The most valuable thing.

519
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,600
Watch out!

520
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,280
Take that thing.

521
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,080
There's nothing wrong with it.

522
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,120
They have their revenge.

523
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,740
You're dead.

524
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,600
🎶

525
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,220
🎶

526
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,440
That's for the madam.

527
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
My son is dead.

528
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
He said it was an accident.

529
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Do you know that if it wasn't for Zhao Qian,

530
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,440
this accident wouldn't have happened at all.

531
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I was the old friend of Zhao Qian.

532
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,440
If it wasn't for him,

533
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
how could I have killed him?

534
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Did it go well?

535
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Yes.

536
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Did you get the stuff?

537
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
No.

538
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
No.

539
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Xiao Da's hand is not in good condition.

540
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
He just wants to knock you down.

541
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Then you say it went well.

542
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Chuchu,

543
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
if there's no evidence,

544
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
I'll be the best.

545
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
How did you deal with him?

546
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
You taught me a lesson.

547
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Don't you give the camera to Zhao Qian?

548
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
You have enough money.

549
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
What do you want the most?

550
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Nonsense.

551
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Then do you know that Xiao Dongyong has enough money?

552
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
President, it's late.

553
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
You should go to bed.

554
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Aunt Shen,

555
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
go to bed.

556
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Dad,

557
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
do you still remember this dance?

558
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,440
When you were dancing,

559
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,440
you had to control the stage.

560
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,440
You had to be the model of dance.

561
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,440
I'm a master now.

562
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
Right?

563
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
It feels good to control people.

564
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Dad,

565
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
I'm in a good mood now.

566
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
I really want to dance with you.

567
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
But you can't stand up.

568
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
What should I do?

569
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
It's okay.

570
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
You can dance

571
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
if you can't stand up.

572
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
You can feel the feeling of being disqualified.

573
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
It feels like amusic from a baby girl

574
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,440
But you can hear línea collaborative songs slowly

575
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,440
because you can dance selectively quickly.

577
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
When you get into love,

578
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,440
keep your distance and keep being cute.

579
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,240
Hey,

580
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,240
You look at the wings of the wind

581
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,240
When you become a smile, you become a true love

582
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,240
The night is dark, the silence is silent

583
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

584
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

585
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,240
You look at the wings of the wind

586
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:22,240
When you become a smile, you become a true love

587
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,240
The night is dark, the silence is silent

588
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

589
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

590
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
The night is dark, the silence is silent

591
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

592
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,240
The wind blows in the eyes, the wind blows in the eyes

593
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,240
You look at the wings of the wind

594
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,240
When you become a smile, you become a true love
