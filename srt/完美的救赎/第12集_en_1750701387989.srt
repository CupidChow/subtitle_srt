1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Miss走了

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Don't worry

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,600
He can't see you.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,760
You need to confirm if he's the one who went to your house.

5
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,560
Please help me. Zhao Qian doesn't answer my calls.

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
Brother Kai is usually very careful with his safety.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
If something happens to him, he can't just die.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,560
Money?

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,520
Does Zhao Qian need money?

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,200
Besides, how much money can I give him?

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,040
Director Wang, I remember now.

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,520
Brother Kai seems to have hidden something at home before.

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,560
When he mentioned it to A'Long, he said that he wouldn't let Zhao Qian know.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,520
If I give something to Zhao Qian, will he help me get him?

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,720
Okay. Then help me contact him.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
Director Wang.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,360
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,360
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,560
Epery

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
The doctor said

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
we may not see again.

61
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,380
Back then,

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Wenjing introduced to me

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,940
that she liked me.

64
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
He thinks I'm his sister,

65
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,940
and he thinks I'm worthy of his life.

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,940
I know that.

67
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,940
Master,

68
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Liu Renkai's gun

69
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,940
was meant to hit me.

70
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Chenggang did it to save me.

71
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,940
Don't think too much.

72
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
You're comrades.

73
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
You save him, he saves you.

74
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,940
It's all part of the plan.

75
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Of course.

76
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Speaking of which,

77
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
I have to thank you

78
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
for being a divorce lawyer for so many years.

79
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,940
Otherwise, you wouldn't have the money

80
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,940
to buy a beautiful cigarette box

81
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,940
that can be used as a bullet.

82
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Actually,

83
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,940
I'm happy that you joined the special case team.

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Because only by working with you

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
can you solve the mystery of this case,

86
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,940
and save the murderer behind it,

87
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
and the black hand behind the murderer.

88
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
What do you think?

89
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
Captain Zheng is awake.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Boss,

91
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
we're here to see you,

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,940
and have a talk.

93
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I'm here to see you,

95
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
and have a talk.

96
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,940
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Did anyone catch him?

105
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Captain Zheng, you should rest assured.

106
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Did he catch him?

107
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Yes.

108
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
Dajing is right.

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
You should lie down for a few days.

110
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,940
The doctor said

111
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,940
you were unconscious

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,940
because of the concussion.

113
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
I'm just saying.

114
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
He's just dizzy.

115
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
He's got no other problems.

116
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
Master, I'm telling you, it's because of him.

117
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,940
If it wasn't for him,

118
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I wouldn't let him hit you.

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
Stop bragging.

120
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
If it wasn't for my smoke box,

121
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
you wouldn't be a concussion now.

122
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,940
You're a concussion.

123
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Is that how they usually are?

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
That's their nature.

125
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
The more they fight,

126
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
the better their relationship is.

127
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Zhuge Liang,

128
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,500
as a matter of open question,

129
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
in my heart,

130
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
I'll wait for you to wt fragrance.

131
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Don't worry, it's alright.

132
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Stand together.

133
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
Have the proposal MSP.

134
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I believe in you.

135
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Liu Zhenkang,

136
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
do you know this gun?

137
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Yes.

138
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Where's it from?

139
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,780
I forgot.

140
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
It was my birthday.

141
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,940
A group of people gave me a gift.

142
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,940
I was drunk that day.

143
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,580
When I woke up,

144
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,660
I saw this wall.

145
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,700
Which year's birthday?

146
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,140
Who went there?

147
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,100
Tell me the names one by one.

148
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,980
I really forgot.

149
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,940
I didn't forget what happened last night.

150
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,940
You called Zhou Qian.

151
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,980
What did you say on the phone?

152
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,420
You borrowed money from me.

153
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,860
You want to run away.

154
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,780
What?

155
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,340
One million?

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,340
I can't help you with this.

157
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,380
I borrowed money from him.

158
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,580
I want to run away.

159
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,420
He didn't dare to borrow me.

160
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
At this time,

161
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,260
you still want to hide it.

162
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,380
Why don't you tell the truth?

163
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,260
What I said is the truth.

164
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,060
Why did you go to the Liao Bo Yan's house with Long?

165
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,140
Because someone drove a car to rob money.

166
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,580
Because someone drove a car to rob money.

167
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,460
Zhao Qian said that Liao Bo Yan

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,620
was a witness.

169
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,460
So Zhao Qian asked you to go.

170
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,820
I want to go myself.

171
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,660
You have to be my dog.

172
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,620
I want to be a good person.

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,060
Dr. Liao.

174
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,180
To be honest, I was just about to look for you.

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,620
What do you want to see me for?

176
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,660
I should ask you this first.

177
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,860
Why did you come to the police?

178
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,300
My house is in a mess.

179
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,620
The door lock is broken.

180
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,260
I want to know why.

181
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,100
You really don't know why?

182
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
I don't know.

183
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,460
I just want to know.

184
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,700
I just want to know.

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,860
I just want to know.

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,140
I can't remember.

187
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to you.

188
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,060
Do you know the person who drove Zhao Qian?

189
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,180
No.

190
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,860
I remember last time

191
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,660
when I went to your house,

192
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,780
I didn't find any surveillance cameras.

193
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Why did you suddenly

194
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,700
have a surveillance camera when Liu Renkai went there?

195
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
I always forget things.

196
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,700
I just forgot

197
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,900
what I did at home.

198
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,140
So I installed a surveillance camera.

199
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,300
I can take it as

200
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,580
another important document.

201
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,340
I have to thank you.

202
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,500
Because of your surveillance camera,

203
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,660
I helped the police catch the suspect.

204
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,980
Really?

205
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,620
Dr. Liang.

206
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,620
Maybe you can't remember

207
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,620
many things.

208
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,620
Do you want me to help you recall them?

209
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,620
Okay.

210
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,900
Xiang has taught Qi You in Fang Qingshun's house.

211
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,900
But it was A'long's order.

212
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,060
How many times?

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,460
How many times?

214
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,820
How many times have you taught Qi You

215
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,300
in Fang Qingshun's house?

216
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,860
Actually, you have been dealing with Zhao Qian.

217
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,820
Five years ago, your daughter had a car accident.

218
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,660
But because of the problem

219
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,140
of the rescue car medical equipment

220
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,220
that Lv Yun donated,

221
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,460
your daughter missed the best time to be saved.

222
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,140
So you hate her.

223
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,700
You used Fang Qingshun

224
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,060
to reveal the truth of the whole thing.

225
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,940
The purpose is to

226
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,820
draw out Zhao Qian who hid the most.

227
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,900
You even poured Qi You into his house

228
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,940
to help Fang Qingshun.

229
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,900
If I hadn't followed Zhao Qian

230
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,460
with Zheng Hang that night,

231
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,700
you might have succeeded by now.

232
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,100
I don't understand what you said.

233
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,100
It doesn't matter.

234
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,660
I will understand.

235
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,980
I will understand.

236
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,940
I didn't kill Xiao Dazhe.

237
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,700
Who did?

238
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,780
The man behind you?

239
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,220
Who is the man behind me?

240
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,380
You just said

241
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
your master

242
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,660
is loyal or afraid?

243
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,340
You are not loyal.

244
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,140
You are afraid.

245
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,980
You don't care about your wife.

246
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,460
You don't care about Liu Zixuan.

247
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,060
You are a man and a woman.

248
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,060
What you care about is

249
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,500
the son that

250
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,780
your father-in-law Xulina gave you.

251
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,100
This is your weakness.

252
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,780
You don't dare to tell the truth.

253
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,300
Liu Renkai,

254
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,100
you know it very well.

255
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,260
As long as the master

256
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,900
who is behind you escapes from the law,

257
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,180
the person you care about

258
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,580
will be in danger.

259
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,700
You can't escape from the law.

260
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,820
But only by being honest

261
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,780
can you really protect the person you care about.

262
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Do you understand?

263
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,740
You can't just plan it.

264
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,660
You have to figure out

265
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,140
what the real master

266
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,060
really is.

267
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,260
You have to, too.

268
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,820
Success.

269
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,360
Are you confident?

270
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,640
Wait for a moment.

271
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,000
Leave it to me.

272
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Whoever you are...

273
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,760
Leave it!

274
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,220
He's just taken a bath!

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:06,420
Thank you.

276
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,900
racial slurs

277
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,780
Please come in, sir.

278
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,900
Here's some Gendered Sphere.

279
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,020
However, I am not going to make the decision proudly

280
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,060
which lead me to my English county

281
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,260
and use it to educate students

282
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,660
bu Remember

283
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,380
we are greatly flattered

284
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,100
by such a humble teacher

285
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,360
who erases suchфф

286
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,580
My sons Realm

287
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,020
were all with the others

288
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,660
But do you know

289
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
She can't be with me.

290
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm here to be with her.

291
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,020
She wants to make her wife be in trouble.

292
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,580
She wants to make Yang Lian in trouble.

293
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,980
In trouble.

294
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,260
She wants to make him fall in love.

295
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,380
To be continued in the next episode.

296
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Who are you to be the ghost?

297
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,300
Who are you to be the ghost?

298
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,560
About你

299
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,900
Tell me

300
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,460
give or give not

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,900
That's it

302
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,600
My god

303
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,040
system

304
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,000
You

305
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
who is

306
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,720
The Long Ballad

307
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Episode 16

308
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Chief.

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Liu Zhentai may be worried that Zhao Qian

310
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
will harm his son's safety.

311
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
So he didn't dare to say it.

312
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
You have to find Xueli Namu as soon as possible

313
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
to eliminate Liu Renkai's concern.

314
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Yes.

315
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Chief.

316
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Before nine o'clock in the evening,

317
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
we have to send Liu Renkai to the guardhouse.

318
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
So you have to hurry up and ask him.

319
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I understand.

320
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Go.

321
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Yes.

322
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Zhong Ning.

323
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Master.

324
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I thought about it.

325
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Before Liao Boyan

326
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
gets the real evidence,

327
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
don't take it to heart.

328
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Yes.

329
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Master.

330
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Look at this.

331
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
This should be

332
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
the most familiar thing

333
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Liao Boyan has sent.

334
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
He just passed by

335
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
twenty minutes ago.

336
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
I set it up many times.

337
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
The password is not Liao Yifan's birthday.

338
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
What about the date?

339
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Right.

340
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
First, I want to make it clear.

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
This is not a joke.

342
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Mom, he's laughing at me again.

343
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
What are you laughing at?

344
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I just think he wants to laugh.

345
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
He's still laughing.

346
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Don't laugh.

347
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't laugh.

348
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
First, I want to make it clear.

349
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
This is not a joke.

350
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
This is a true story.

351
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
There are really

352
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
rainbow existences in the world.

353
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Rainbow really has seven colors.

354
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
There are really

355
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
rainbow in children's world.

356
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
What's wrong?

357
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I was heard.

358
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
That's how I am now.

369
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm watched by all eyes.

370
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I wish I could stay in place.

371
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Dad.

372
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I can understand

373
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
your feelings now.

374
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
I can escape from these eyes.

375
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,800
As long as the light is off,

376
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
the door is off,

377
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,520
the eyes are dead,

378
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
but the person is alive.

379
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,120
By then, all the doubts

380
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
will stay in this small room.

381
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Outside the room

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,920
is my Sunshine World.

383
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Because I didn't do anything.

388
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Think about it.

389
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,720
The future is in the air.

390
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Lu Li Juan jumped off the building.

391
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
What does it have to do with me?

392
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
Does it have anything to do with me?

393
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Right.

394
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
And that drowned Yang Yan.

395
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,720
That's even more wonderful.

396
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,720
That natural disaster

397
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,520
that belongs to the unbreakable.

398
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Right?

399
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm relieved, Li Zheng.

400
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm relieved, Li Zheng.

401
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Who are you?

402
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
How did you get in?

403
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
What are you doing here?

404
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Picking up garbage.

405
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
There's no garbage here for you to pick up.

406
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Can you hear me?

407
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
This is not the place you should stay.

414
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
Go home.

415
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Old lady.

416
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Let's go.

417
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Go.

418
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Let's go, old lady.

419
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's go.

420
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,120
You can't do that.

421
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,120
I can't do what?

422
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Kill Zhao Qian.

423
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Who are you?

424
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Get in the car.

425
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
I'll tell you who I am.

426
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Are you afraid of me?

427
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
No.

428
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I'm afraid of you.

429
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I'm afraid of you.

430
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm afraid of you.

431
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
I'm afraid of you.

432
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I'm not afraid of death.

433
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
This is the reason why I'm not afraid of death.

434
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Now,

435
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,320
I just want to fight with Zhao Qian.

436
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,320
I'll give this to the media.

437
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,520
Let them tell the whole truth.

438
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Then everyone will know

439
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,320
the real face of Zhao Qian.

440
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
They will also know

441
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
that I gave birth to a child.

442
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
No.

443
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Yang You Mo's confession

444
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,920
can only explain one thing.

445
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,120
He killed his wife and child.

446
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
But Zhao Qian?

447
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,520
He may lose his reputation for the time being.

448
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,320
But in the end, he has no choice.

449
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,920
It's not because the law is unfair,

450
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,520
the police don't stop him,

451
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,120
but Zhao Qian has lost his humanity.

452
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
It's too hard.

453
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,920
Lu Yun Group's public relations ability

454
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,120
is not what you can imagine.

455
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
What should I do?

456
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,320
Give me this.

457
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
After Liu Ren Kai is arrested,

458
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,320
all the leaders

459
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,920
will point to Zhao Qian.

460
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
This thing

461
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,920
can be the last straw to press him to death.

462
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Didn't you say

463
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Zhao Qian will only lose his reputation?

464
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,720
This evidence is in the law.

465
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,920
It's true that it can't be convicted for Zhao Qian's crime.

466
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
But if

467
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,920
he admitted that what Yang You Mo said was true,

468
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
it would be different.

469
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
What should I do?

470
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,520
It's either death or murder.

471
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,320
What should I do?

472
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I'll tell you later.

473
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
What are you thinking about?

474
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Your brain is closed.

475
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Nothing.

476
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,920
I haven't been with you for a long time.

477
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,720
You don't know how to handle it, do you?

478
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,920
A little.

479
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,920
I just miss the past.

480
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
We were so taciturn back then.

481
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,520
No matter who the other party is,

482
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,920
we can handle it easily.

483
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,920
Of course.

484
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Officer.

485
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,120
Mr. Zhao is waiting for you in the office.

486
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

487
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,520
Mr. Zhao.

488
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
Director Zhang.

489
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,120
Mr. Zhao.

490
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,520
Tell me what's wrong.

491
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
I'll talk to the bureau.

492
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,320
Why do you come here?

493
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,520
I didn't want to come.

494
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,920
He said he had something to ask.

495
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm afraid he's in trouble.

496
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
So I came to supervise him.

497
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
Mr. Zhao, sorry to bother you.

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,920
I have a few questions for you.

499
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,320
You can ask whatever you want.

500
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
Don't ask anything you shouldn't.

501
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
Mr. Zhao is a precious person.

502
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,720
I understand.

503
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,920
Lin Mei, go make tea for the officers.

504
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,520
Okay.

505
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,120
By the way, Mr. Zhao.

506
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
The tea last time was good.

507
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,720
Is there any more?

508
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,520
Yes.

509
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
Just ask Lin Mei to make it for you.

510
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm professional in making tea.

511
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,120
Let's go.

512
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,120
Okay.

513
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Sit down, Mr. Zhong.

514
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Don't use this water.

515
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
The water is not hot enough.

516
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,920
It's a pity to burn the tea leaves.

517
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
I'll make a new one.

518
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,320
Okay.

519
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,320
How long have you been in the company?

520
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
How's the treatment?

521
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,120
Not bad.

522
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Mr. Zhao treats us well.

523
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,920
Just like family.

524
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
Like family.

525
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,120
Well.

526
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Is he the same to Liu Renkai?

527
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,520
Liu Renkai called you

528
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,520
for the last time.

529
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
What did you talk about?

530
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
He borrowed money from me.

531
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,720
How much?

532
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,120
One million.

533
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,120
One million?

534
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
Did he tell you

535
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
the purpose of the money?

536
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,520
I didn't ask him.

537
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
You didn't ask him

538
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,320
the purpose of the money?

539
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,320
What purpose could he have?

540
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
So I refused him.

541
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
You seem to know him well.

542
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,720
Did he borrow money from you before?

543
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
It's the first time.

544
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,320
Do you think

545
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,120
Liu Renkai would borrow money from Mr. Zhao?

546
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
No.

547
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,120
People like Mr. Liu

548
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,920
are always in need of money.

549
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,520
You seem to know each other well.

550
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
Does he often come to the company?

551
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,120
He didn't come here before.

552
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
But now he does.

553
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,520
Did Mr. Zhao

554
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,120
arrange something for him?

555
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,720
I don't know.

556
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Tell me.

557
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,520
The thing that oh,

558
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
researcher understanding

559
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
of China's development

560
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
would be better for you.

561
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
I didn't give him the money.

562
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,480
But I remember

563
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,360
he offered me

564
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,720
the way.

565
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Sometimes I asked about

566
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:24,220
the

567
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
company Tar interns who took over

568
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,320
I'm not worried about anything.

569
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
Do you have any other questions?

570
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Yes.

571
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,400
Do you know Liao Boyan?

572
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Do you know Liao Boyan?

573
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
I remember.

574
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,200
The super hero of my film

575
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,720
written by your daughter

576
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,720
is Liao Boyan, right?

577
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,840
Yes.

578
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,800
Why did you

579
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,280
let Liu Renkai go to Liao Boyan's house?

580
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
What if Liu Renkai

581
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,120
was his personal behavior?

582
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
Personal behavior?

583
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,960
How do you understand?

584
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
After the accident,

585
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I sent someone to check

586
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,040
if there were any witnesses

587
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,800
to protect myself.

588
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,880
Who would have thought that he went to someone's house

589
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,320
and made them like that?

590
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,080
That means you don't know

591
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
his behavior at all, right?

592
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,360
Yes.

593
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,920
I have another question.

594
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,840
I asked you before.

595
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,680
Do you know

596
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,080
a little girl named Liao Yifan?

597
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,520
I'll answer you again.

598
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,600
I don't know.

599
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,800
Master.

600
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,760
Are you done?

601
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
I just made tea.

602
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
I said I'd show you two tricks.

603
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,360
You mean tea art?

604
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,120
You think so?

605
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,760
I'm busy.

606
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,680
Thank you.

607
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,360
Look.

608
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
This trip

609
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,600
has its cost us money.

610
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,160
I still need it for・

611
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,800
Mr. Zhao.

612
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,280
Mr. Zhao.

613
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Telephone.

614
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,320
Hello?

615
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,600
Zhao Qian.

616
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm Zhang Qiao Yun.

617
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,120
How did you know

618
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,200
my phone number?

619
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,400
I also know

620
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
Yang You Mo loves you

621
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,080
and has been praising you.

622
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
What did he praise me for?

623
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,560
He praised you

624
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,640
for being the princess of the fairy tale world.

625
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,560
He also said

626
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
you were the princess of the fairy tale world.

627
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,080
He also praised you for not being afraid of ghosts.

628
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,920
Wherever you go,

629
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,560
the sun will follow you.

630
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,680
How did I know?

631
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Right?

632
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Go ask Liu Ren Kai.

633
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,640
He even left me this?

634
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Zhao Qian.

635
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,880
I want to see you tonight.

636
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
You can see me.

637
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,480
But you have to be at the place I set.

638
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,600
Tell me.

639
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,200
Where?

640
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,960
What's up?

641
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,240
He's here.

642
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,640
He's the only one.

643
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,680
Did you see it clearly?

644
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,200
Yes.

645
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,360
Only him.

646
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,800
Don't move.

647
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,320
Go.

648
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,880
You really dare to come alone?

649
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,840
I have no one in my heart.

650
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,960
What's there to be afraid of?

651
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,120
You're afraid of me?

652
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,120
I'm about to die.

653
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,240
What are you afraid of?

654
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
There must be an end to it.

655
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,200
Okay.

656
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,560
End.

657
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,480
What evidence do you have?

658
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,240
Show me.

659
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,720
The things in here

660
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,640
are enough to make you lose your reputation.

661
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,760
The illegal stuff

662
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,440
is threatened by that thing.

663
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,800
You know

664
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,600
whether it's possible or not.

665
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,600
Kneel down and kowtow.

666
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,640
I'll give it to you.

667
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,120
What?

668
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,280
I'll let you kneel down

669
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,800
and kowtow to my child.

670
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,160
Why did you do that?

671
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Why did you control Yang You Mo to kill him?

672
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,480
You turned my son into a ghost.

673
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,400
You're so mad.

674
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,880
You're even more stupid than that woman.

675
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,120
I'm not afraid of any evidence.

676
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,040
What can you do to me?

677
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,800
What?

678
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What?

679
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,360
I have another evidence for you.

680
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,280
Another?

681
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
In front of you,

682
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,200
I'm the evidence.

683
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,400
I want everyone to know

684
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,880
whether you're a ghost or a human.

685
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,200
I want everyone to know

686
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,120
that your medicine is for killing people.

687
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,920
Do you think you can do it?

688
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,920
I don't even want to live.

689
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
What else can I do?

690
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,600
As long as I'm alive,

691
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,240
I'll stay by your side and never leave.

692
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,680
I'll curse you

693
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
so that you can't die well

694
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
and go to hell

695
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,560
to kowtow to my child and my grandfather.

696
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay.

697
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
I'll give you more evidence.

698
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
Thank you, Your Grace.

699
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Luo Lijuan...

700
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
I asked Yang You Mo to kill him.

701
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,440
And your grandson, Tong Tong.

702
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,620
He's just a bad luck.

703
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,940
Oh, right.

704
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,600
And that Yang Yan guy,

705
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,120
whom I did the first impression

706
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,520
on Xie Hong...

707
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,180
was also Tach quizzed.

708
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Why would I control Yang You Mo to kill someone?

709
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,180
Because your son is a ghost!

710
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
You're right.

711
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
The key to the Green Cloud is to kill someone.

712
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Or else, how do you think Yang You Mo would have died?

713
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
What are you doing?

714
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,180
I told you, I am Zhang Ju.

715
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
What do you want to say?

716
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Your life is Zhang Ju.

717
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,180
I'mley.

718
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
This Wind Bo on here and wants to die with us.

719
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
Hurry!

720
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,340
There was a call from the police.

721
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,180
Zhang Qiaoyun might have been attacked.

722
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,660
He's being rescued now.

723
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,660
How did he get attacked?

724
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,700
It's a mystery.

725
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,020
Have you checked this ward?

726
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,580
Then check the other ones.

727
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,780
Aunt Zhang,

728
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,300
how is it?

729
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,340
Zhao Qianyao killed me.

730
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,900
I have evidence.

731
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,060
The evidence Zhang Qiaoyun provided

732
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,220
can be brought back

733
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,020
for further investigation.

734
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,620
Mr. Zhao, they're here again.

735
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,940
Mr. Zhao,

736
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,540
come with us.

737
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,300
Gao Ying.

738
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,600
Let's go.

739
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,180
It's said that being crazy is despair and madness

740
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Love is the name, meaning is the heart

741
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Love is the name, meaning is the gentleness

742
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,180
In love, the growth of the heart

743
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
Foaming rose-like song

744
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,180
Blue flame is focused on love

745
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Pitiful ofchair,?.

746
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,180
The wall is shattered, clear is the sun

747
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,980
Now all the ripples are on the back

748
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,500
In the direction of stars 2600

749
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,180
Trial hits all the points

750
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,180
The song of the moon

751
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
The song of the moon

752
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
The song of the moon

753
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
The song of the moon

754
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
The song of the moon

755
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,180
The song of the moon

756
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,180
The song of the moon

757
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,180
The song of the moon

758
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,180
The song of the moon

759
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
The song of the moon

760
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,180
The song of the moon

761
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,180
The song of the moon

762
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
