And then put it on the front table

You can see 154 photos

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,720
If you don't do this, I'll die now!

12

Ten�, she got caught!

Previously...

14
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,920
My wife died.

15
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
My son and daughter died.

16
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm so mad.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm so mad!

18
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Don't kill me!

19
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Don't kill me!

20
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Don't kill me!

21
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Don't kill me!

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Don't kill me!

23
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Don't kill me!

24
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Don't kill me!

25
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Episode -...

26
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,360
I went��� clean up.

27
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,940

33
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,220
Okay

34
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,920
Really

35
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,900
Меня

36
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,620
No matter

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,980
Ieni

38
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,000
Li Zhenyu

39
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,580
I will take care of your business

40
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,520
Becauseowing salaried

41
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,020
And jiori

42
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,780

43
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:26,480
Or of course

44
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
I bet he's broke by charging the bombs

45
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Pack your luggage

46
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Put your luggage in the promotion room

47
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Wear it

48
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,320
Not yet

49
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Similarly

50
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,480
organisations can go and think about

51
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
including China

52
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
But you can't show off

53
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
in Secondary FinnขO

54
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes.

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,400
Let's start.

56
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,000
The victim is Yang Yongmeng.

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
He is 36 years old.

58
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
He is a painter named Xiao Yong.

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
His family lives in the Yanguang Waterland.

60
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
The family of Yang's family is in Xinjiang.

61
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
They can say it's a street project.

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Eight months ago, his wife jumped into the building.

63
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
The son of the sixth son died of an accident.

64
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
The second daughter, Yang Yan,

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
let the water tank leak and run away.

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Now Yang Yongmeng is dead.

67
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
This family is so cruel.

68
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
He is so scary.

69
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
He is so scary.

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
He is so stupid.

71
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
He is so stupid.

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
He is so stupid.

73
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,200
That's because he was controlled by Yuan Cheng.

74
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Nonsense.

75
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
You are better than the police.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can explain it.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't pretend.

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
I think it's a family-based scheme.

79
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
When will the autopsy report come out?

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
It will come out tomorrow.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But according to the current taboo and the current observation,

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
the court can make a judgment.

83
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,600
Yang Yongmeng is dead.

84
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
He was shot by a excessive amount of body speed.

85
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
What would be the cause of excessive body speed?

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
Heart rate is long, heart rate is low.

87
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,600
And there will be a change in the state of death.

88
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
This kind of medical operation is very similar to the death of Jin Xia.

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
First, Yang Yongmeng doesn't want to jump into the building.

90
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
Because he doesn't need to climb the building.

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There is a building next to him.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Just go up and jump.

93
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
In addition, he didn't choose to jump into the elevator.

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
It means that he didn't climb the building.

95
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
And his purpose is to climb the building.

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
And he must be high.

97
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
You can understand that.

98
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Yang Yongmeng was killed by the medical operation.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,200
And the death of the weapon is called high-density machine.

100
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
It seems to make sense.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
If the building doesn't jump, it will fall off.

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
This is clear.

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
What is the purpose of falling off?

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes.

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
You look at it from the side.

106
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Because the fallout is too high.

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,600
The height is the middle of the game.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Yang Yongmeng is at a high level.

109
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
The game is over.

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Yang Yongmeng is wearing a high-density machine in the first place.

111
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
After the change.

112
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
There is a hidden injection head inside.

113
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
And he also added a piece of control chip.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The technical department also needs some time to analyze the injection head.

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
And the last five calls he received.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,400
All of them are from the black card of the illegal virtual operation.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,800
If it's me, I will buy a virtual operation black card first.

118
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Use this card to raise the order of the Moxia.

119
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
This is really a big shot.

120
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Even this kind of details are taken.

121
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,200
You are the high-ranking master of the crime scene, right?

122
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm sure.

123
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
This is really a big shot.

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
You have been trying to fool me.

125
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,000
I suggest you to check it.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not like a play.

127
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Captain Zhou.

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Someone is talking on the Internet.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
It's like a murderer is solving the book.

130
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Captain, look at this.

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Yang Yongmeng is the character I control.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
This game is me to control him.

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
He is to resist my control.

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Far away control.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Black card, command and height.

136
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
This is the same as we analyzed.

137
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
This is actually a game that controls the opponent of the character.

138
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
I will win if the character dies.

139
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
The position is locked.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Locked.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,200
Let's go.

142
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Two on the left.

143
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,560
Detective, please?

144
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I'm sorry, a police officer.

145
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
That's okay.

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello?

147
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Hello, hello.

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
There's someone working at the bus stop.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Are you a policeman?

150
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
It's your man again.

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,560
So I...

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm a suspect.

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
Why did you bring me handcuffs?

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm the one you're looking for.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
You said that already.

156
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Tell me.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Why do you know so well about Yan Yongmu's case?

158
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I guessed it.

159
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,400
And I also guessed that you'll be scolded later.

160
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,600
You're always so serious.

161
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm not serious.

162
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm not serious.

163
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
And I also guessed that you'll be scolded later.

164
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Be honest.

165
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Who's relying on him?

166
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,800
Xiao Ni.

167
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,960
Don't remind me.

168
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,840
So Groan.

169
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
Okay.

170
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
I know you and your sister.

171
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,880
Alright.

172
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
My pleasure.

173
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,080
Who is it?

174
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,160
Zhong Ning and the police is a�defying force.

175
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,420
You before?

176
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,480
Show yourself before the scene.

177
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Zhong Ning,

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,360
in the future,

179
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,600
we need to find you,

180
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,720
or I'll never get your name certificate.

181
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,840
My boyfriend has no reason to piece with my name.

182
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,840
Look, you.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,680
This is too sa...

184
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,560
Should I?

185
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,240
Zhong Ning.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,480
Good day.

187
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
All from great institutional history.

188
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:24,100
Dark culture wears

189
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,740
the perfect temple.

190
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,440
Drink it.

191
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,040
Okay.

192
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,360
I don't want to play with you.

193
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,600
Qiqi.

194
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,600
Who's the one who's laughing at you?

195
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
You're not going home today.

196
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,760
Auntie is leaving.

197
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,440
Qiqi.

198
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
Grandpa Zhang.

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
Look who else is here.

200
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
Why are you still not sleeping?

201
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
You have to go to school tomorrow.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,080
Go to bed early.

203
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,840
Qiqi.

204
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,360
Why are you crying?

205
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,400
You two fight at the same time.

206
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,240
I didn't fight.

207
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I didn't fight this time.

208
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,960
You look like you're fighting.

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,640
Yes.

210
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,760
Then what did you go to find him?

211
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,120
Your dad apologized to me.

212
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Can you forgive him?

213
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
Forgive?

214
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,000
Why not forgive?

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,720
Uncle.

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,160
Let my dad find you.

217
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
He'll come back anytime.

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,920
Bye.

219
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Bye.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,520
You can't always be together.

221
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,440
You're his dad.

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
You're his uncle.

223
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
Xie Yuan is in love with him.

224
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
He's not like a child.

225
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,880
Master.

226
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,600
Yang You Mo is controlled by people.

227
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,200
Don't tell me the truth.

228
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,160
I know the rules.

229
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm a murderer.

230
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,080
If I want to control a person

231
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
who's willing to play the game of death,

232
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,640
I'll hold on to something more important than his life.

233
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,560
Or

234
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
someone more important than his life.

235
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Put it on Yang You Mo.

236
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,440
This kind of thing or this person

237
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,200
will be more important than his wife who jumped into the building.

238
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,040
More important than his 5-month-old child.

239
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,800
More important than his life

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
and death.

241
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,400
You've been following Yang You Mo's case since the beginning.

242
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,840
Why?

243
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,320
Xi Xi is waiting for me at home.

244
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm leaving.

245
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes.

246
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you doing?

247
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Go home before noon,

248
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,240
don't bother me.

249
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,720
Don't you know how accompany me?

250
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,040
I told you.

251
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,920
This is not about marriage.

252
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,440
Then there's no such thing as right now.

253
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,000
Your daughter

254
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
enemies you.

255
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,240
Don't say you'll come with a blind date.

256
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,960
I definitely won't.

257
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,080
Let's just say that my inner personality

258
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,480
doesn't need to be said.

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,240
Just my appearance,

260
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,840
am I the person who needs a blind date?

261
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,040
I think we should find a person

262
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,960
who can live a normal life.

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,800
Okay, okay, okay, stop it.

264
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
I won't eat it. Eat it yourself.

265
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,320
Maybe the person who comes later will be with you.

266
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,240
Although she is

267
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
the woman who comes later

268
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
should ask someone to eats.

269
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,160
You are right.

270
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,360
She asked for me later.

271
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,200
Don't try to say more.

272
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,620
He.

273
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Almost there!

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,120
Zhou Ying!

275
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,920
Lookpatty handsome!

276
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
this is Hong Zhuo Zheng's comment.

277
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,840
Zhang Xingte is the best motivation for him to be an actor.

278
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,840
It's nothing personal.

279
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,240
I really like my work,

280
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,160
and I ask others to do more good deeds.

281
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,160
Overall,

282
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,280
taking a lot of action to get the best results

283
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
is presounding and inspiring,

284
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
driving everything out.

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,880
It's the movement ofقدang High Schoolista and Los Mu,

286
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
the Ring School's executive ہے.

287
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
and the case is solved.

288
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
After that, we have a justice.

289
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
We will make the people of Xinjiang feel safe.

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Please show your attitude.

291
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
If you are here,

292
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I guarantee you that you will complete the task.

293
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
That is to say, if you are in trouble,

294
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I will help you to get the job.

295
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Thank you, Chief.

296
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Work.

297
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Yes.

298
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Yes.

299
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Mrs. Zhang.

300
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Is your son, Yang Yongmou,

301
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
a friend of yours?

302
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Mrs. Zhang.

303
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
I hope you can cooperate with our police investigation.

304
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,560
This way, you can help us find the murderer as soon as possible.

305
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
I will cooperate with the police.

306
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Did your son, Yang Yongmou,

307
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
tell you anything before he died?

308
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I know who killed my son.

309
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Did he hurt his family?

310
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
No.

311
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
I am sorry.

312
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I am afraid that he is in trouble.

313
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Please, you must find him.

314
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Captain Zheng.

315
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
We just received the report that Zhao Qian is missing.

316
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Zhao Qian is missing?

317
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Yes.

318
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
She is the mother of Zhao Qian.

319
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Is she his mother?

320
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
What's the situation?

321
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
It's like this.

322
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Our boss Zhao is very busy with work.

323
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
He is busy with work.

324
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
He can't contact us often.

325
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
But he never saved us.

326
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
This way, please.

327
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Who are you...?

328
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Who are you?

329
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Can't tell you anything.

330
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Who's that guy?

331
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I think it's his voice.

332
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Teresa.

333
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Why are you here?

334
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Sorry to trouble you.

335
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Is he there?

336
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Yes.

337
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

338
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,560
This symbol is the fixed speed patrol.

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
He's shooting 154 speed.

340
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560
92 154.

341
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
What's the relationship between these two numbers?

342
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
The technical department has also restored the target.

343
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
It sounds strange.

344
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Don't shoot.

345
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Don't shoot.

346
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Don't shoot.

347
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Don't shoot.

348
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Yang Yongmu should be trying to hang up the phone

349
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
but he misplaced the intercom.

350
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
It caused the sound in the phone to be released

351
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
and the monitoring equipment was cut off.

352
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
But the sound was too small and disturbed the sound.

353
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,560
The technical department did it after special treatment.

354
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Can the technical department be used for this music?

355
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
The characteristics are too vague.

356
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
They can't use the sound quality to make a arrangement.

357
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,560
This music should be put on the music by Yang Yongmu on purpose.

358
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Yang Yongmu climbed the platform

359
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
and received the phone.

360
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
How long was it?

361
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Nine seconds.

362
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
The phone didn't ring.

363
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
The phone rang.

364
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,560
So the person who called Yang Yongmu

365
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,560
could accurately grasp the movement of Yang Yongmu on the tower.

366
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
He must ensure Yang Yongmu

367
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
reached the platform and answered the phone

368
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
and then heard the music.

369
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
The observation point of the tower.

370
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
The person who called Yang Yongmu

371
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
was the person who called Yang Yongmu

372
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
and the person who called Yang Yongmu

373
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
was the person who called Yang Yongmu.

374
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
The person who called Yang Yongmu

375
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,560
was the person who called Yang Yongmu

376
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
and the person who called Yang Yongmu

377
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
was the person who called Yang Yongmu.

378
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,560
The person who called Yang Yongmu

379
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,560
was the person who called Yang Yongmu.

380
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
The car we're driving

381
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
will be on the floor with me.

382
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Two people will be downstairs.

383
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Yes.

384
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Don't come in.

385
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay.

386
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Flaming Lookout

387
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
The man in phases may be the toptener in 357.

388
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
He's made good use of technology.

389
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,780
比較好東西

390
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,980
We are almost there

391
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,000
比較會做車比沒關係

392
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,760
我就嚇死他

393
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
不會

394
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,380
他就 generation nation

395
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:44,020
跟現在房的呢

396
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,740
剛剛是不是沒有載了

397
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,980
他是金自宅的

398
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,560
當代是因為你有那麼多的

399
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,420
那我就把你帶回來

400
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,080
昨日沒有載呢

401
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Why are you so fast?

402
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,680
I want to know too.

403
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
It's her again.

404
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Is Zhong Ning in the room?

405
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
This crazy girl.

406
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Zhong Ning!

407
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Zhong Ning!

408
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Zhong Ning!

409
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Go, go to her room and wait for her.

410
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,480
What are you doing?

411
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,480
I have to go up to find her. It's too dangerous.

412
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Go up?

413
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
You go up, you are also dangerous. Don't be afraid.

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
This crazy girl.

415
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,880
If she falls down and dies, I will lead her.

416
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Go and wait for her.

417
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
You...

418
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Are you going to climb up?

419
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
You didn't go up?

420
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I didn't go up.

421
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
I didn't go up.

422
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I didn't go up.

423
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I didn't go up.

424
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
You didn't go up?

425
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
There is a elevator here.

426
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I will go up first.

427
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
You wait for me to make an elevator.

428
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
I will go up first.

429
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
You go up slowly.

430
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You go up.

431
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
Why did you climb so high?

432
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
What happened?

433
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,920
You know I'm not a suspect.

434
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,040
You're looking for me.

435
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
Why do you care about this case?

436
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
What does it have to do with you?

437
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,240
First, my mother died.

438
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,920
Then, both children died.

439
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,120
Finally,

440
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,160
even my father died.

441
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
It's so miserable and so ridiculous.

442
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,760
Anyone who doesn't like to be involved

443
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
will pay attention to it.

444
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,720
Besides,

445
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,840
what do you want me to pay attention to?

446
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,120
Captain.

447
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,240
You've met the master.

448
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,760
I want to see the police.

449
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
You didn't see your father.

450
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
You are so react.

451
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,640
Secondly,

452
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,160
you must not let your action

453
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,320
tamper with your hogyun.

454
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,520
Set rehearsals.

455
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,720
We'll take out all the company.

456
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,000
Or just

457
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

458
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

459
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

460
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

461
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

462
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

463
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

464
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

465
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm afraid I'll be able to escape

466
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
In the love, there is a sound of the wind

467
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
There is a light, light is in the song

468
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
The light is in the fire, the light is in the fire

469
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
The night is in the dark, there is a light in the dark

470
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,400
The light is in the fire, the light is in the fire

471
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,400
The heart is burning, the memories are not worth knowing

472
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
You look at the wings of the sword

473
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,400
When you become a hero, you will find the truth

474
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
The heart is burning, the night is dark

475
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
The silence is silent, the night is silent

476
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
The eyes are said to be crazy

477
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Who is to despair?

478
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,400
It's crazy

479
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,400
The night is in the fire, the night is dark

480
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:03,400
The heart is burning, the night is in the fire

481
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,400
The night is in the fire, the night is in the fire

482
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
The night is in the fire, the night is in the fire
