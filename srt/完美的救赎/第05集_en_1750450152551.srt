The

00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,440
Xiu

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,180
This

00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,180
Go

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,520
I'm coming

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,080
Screen caducei

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:42,500
The

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Do you know

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,040
Yang You Chan, Xien Wuchang

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,560
He was killed by this medicine

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,900
prostu

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,160
will kill you and me

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,800
When I gave you the clue

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,220
he was killed first

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,060
Why?

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,060
Liu Ren Kai,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,980
you killed him, right?

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,300
Don't be nervous.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,420
It's not a joke.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,020
If you still want to eat meat here,

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,100
then take your power,

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,220
and find the prey for me.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,260
Dad.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,260
I can do it.

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,020
Look.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,020
How old are you?

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,620
Hello, aunt.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,460
I'm 11 years old.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
You're 11 years old.

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,100
You're still so young.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,900
Go home.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,620
I'm so tired.

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,220
No food을 will help.

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,940
I don't Vaccinate him.

35
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,460
I'm not like the kid.

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,180
How many years have you took ribs for?

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,820
Almost nine years.

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Nine years.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,180
Paint bird can't get anything.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,820
It shut his mouth.

41
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,780
Is it 500 sentry?

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
You have to treat him well.

43
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Long,

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,780
why did your father give me this dog?

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,780
I don't know.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,780
He's reminding me that Liu Ren Kai

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
was raised by their family.

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
You're so unhappy to see him.

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,780
I can't take care of him.

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
No need.

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I like him.

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
He's more loyal than anyone.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
More importantly,

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
he reminds me that

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm just a dog.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,780
Mom, I finally got it.

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Mom, look.

58
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Why?

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Why didn't you tell me?

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
Why?

61
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Why?

62
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Why?

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,780
Why?

64
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
Mom, look.

65
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Mom, look.

66
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Episode 1

67
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Yes, master.

68
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,780
Xie Wuxiang's all-time relatives signed the contract.

69
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,780
He's going to give his son Xie Xiaohua his funeral.

70
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Will it affect the safety of the town?

71
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
No.

72
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
Our legal doctor is in hospital.

73
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Master,

74
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,780
the time of the death of the victim's wife is very tight.

75
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
You have to take the photo.

76
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
I take the photo?

77
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
I can't take the photo.

78
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
You're so stubborn.

79
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
Can you take the photo?

80
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
My personal opinion.

81
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
The child's life is the most important.

82
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,780
I can't take it.

83
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
I'll take care of the matter.

84
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
Okay.

85
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Okay.

86
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
Let's go.

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
Okay, I got it.

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
The leader is already in a special position.

89
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Save the child first.

90
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
He's just sitting here waiting.

91
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Xie Wuxiang.

92
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,780
Xie Wuxiang.

93
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Don't worry.

94
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Get up and sit down.

95
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Sit down.

96
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Why do you like it?

97
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
I don't know.

98
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Zhang Juge, you've worked hard.

99
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
You've put the burden on your head.

100
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
It hurts me.

101
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Why don't you carry it?

102
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
I'm the one who's the head.

103
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
You're not stubborn.

104
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
You're the most sensible.

105
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Doctor.

106
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Doctor.

107
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Doctor.

108
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
Doctor, are you trying to kill me?

109
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Doctor.

110
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Doctor.

111
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Doctor.

112
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Please.

113
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Please.

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Doctor.

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Please.

116
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Please.

117
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Doctor.

118
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Doctor.

119
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
I still need to do a further analysis of the poison.

120
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
But we can now confirm that

121
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,780
Xie Wuxiang's death is the same as Yang Yongmu's.

122
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,780
It's all because of the high-quality

123
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
blood pressure.

124
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,780
The pressure is just right.

125
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
And from this video,

126
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
Xie Wuxiang may have

127
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,780
a new illusion

128
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
like Yang Yongmu's death.

129
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Xie Wuxiang's social relationship

130
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,780
has been changed.

131
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
This person's life is very bad.

132
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
He's offended many people.

133
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
At home, he's exposed to his wife Wu Ping

134
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
and son Xie Xiaohua.

135
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
So after he died,

136
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
his parents didn't leave

137
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
any traces of his death.

138
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
The surveillance area.

139
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
It's a drama.

140
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
There's no surveillance.

141
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,780
No lights.

142
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
The murderer likes this place the most.

143
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,780
It's just that

144
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,780
he lost all his search Fast and furious.

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
In the whole place

146
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,780
is attracted by your 230 yuan.

147
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Don't worry.

148
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,920
That alone doesn't

149
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,180
even make a weak-mind Cobba.

150
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Okay, all right.

151
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
No problem.

152
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
No no.

153
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,780
I am very happy about your Korean delicious delicious meal.

154
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
I like��니다.

155
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,780
He hasn't been to the neighborhood before he came home last night.

156
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
I know.

157
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
Liu Ren Kai and his neighborhood will cooperate.

158
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Do you think anyone who would kill Qian Zi Xian in the house?

159
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Wait a minute.

160
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Here's the order.

161
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Here.

162
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Comrade Police Officer.

163
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,780
My husband is innocent. You know he's a human.

164
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,780
He's been with me these days.

165
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Yes.

166
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,780
We're investigating the case of illegal transmission.

167
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
He's innocent.

168
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Don't worry. We'll find out.

169
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Don't worry. What happened to your hand?

170
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Did you get hurt?

171
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I was playing in the building two days ago.

172
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
I was being careful.

173
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
It's okay, baby.

174
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
I'll get you some more medicine later.

175
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Here.

176
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Sun Tian.

177
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Thank you for cooperating with the police.

178
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
We should go back.

179
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
We're late.

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Thank you.

181
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Let's go.

182
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
Officer.

183
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
I've told you.

184
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
My wife and I were at home that night.

185
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Are you sure?

186
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Yes.

187
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Liu Ren Kai.

188
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
You think the police are fine?

189
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,780
You're here to talk to you?

190
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Qin Kun.

191
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
I have two families.

192
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
One is the same.

193
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Don't come to the society with us.

194
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
What family?

195
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
That's called a couple.

196
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
I'm serious.

197
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
I'm serious.

198
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
I was trying to get a hold of Xie Wuxiang that day.

199
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
He owed me a big debt.

200
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
I've been looking for him for several times.

201
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
But he didn't find it.

202
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Du Zhai.

203
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
No, Du Zhai.

204
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,780
I don't know why he took money from me.

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
He took advantage of the debt.

206
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
He killed Ren Kai.

207
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,780
Why did I kill him?

208
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
He died because of me.

209
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,780
So the world doesn't want him to die.

210
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
That's the rule.

211
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Take a good look.

212
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
Do you know that game card?

213
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,780
I have some game cards.

214
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,300
What's wrong?

215
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
It has your 어� Gedanken,

216
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,780
and it appeared near the scene where Xie Wuxiang was killed.

217
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,880
Explain your sieg.

218
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
I gave this to him.

219
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Sometimes, he just blabbered and used this.

220
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Who lost the dinner, it's illegal.

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
At least, I have some blood.

222
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
Why?

223
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Someone framed me.

224
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Tell me who framed you.

225
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
You know it all.

226
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Hello.

227
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,780
General, hello.

228
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Tell me.

229
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Master, he's not at the scene.

230
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,780
He and Qin Fu had dinner with the criminal.

231
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
He left very late.

232
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
He didn't have time to do the crime.

233
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,780
General, I didn't find the opponent.

234
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Someone gave me the letter.

235
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Liu Ren Kai must be in trouble.

236
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,780
There's a problem with the couple.

237
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,780
How did you find out?

238
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
The bed is half-sleep.

239
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
The other half is almost gone.

240
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
It means Liu Ren Kai is not coming back often.

241
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,780
And Sun Tian is not good to the child.

242
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,780
He must have put the blame on the couple.

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,780
You should prove it before you divorce.

244
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Go to the Wuqiang family.

245
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
We can only hope for Wu Ping.

246
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
Hope we can find the breakthrough.

247
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I can't be so strong.

248
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Then what I can do is fight in the bush?

249
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
当然.

250
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,780
I don't think there's anything to do.

251
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
You?

252
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Has Xie Wuxiang went through any routine stupidity lately?

253
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,780
He went through it every day.

254
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,380
The only reason he won't spend the money

255
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,780
is to buy those gas masks for him.

256
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,900
If I say so,

257
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,540
he will beat me and Xiao Huahua.

258
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,020
Wu Bin,

259
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,300
Xiguxiang is so bad to his own son.

260
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,820
Then why would he

261
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,180
go to the hospital for his son?

262
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
He's lying.

263
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,820
He's a liar, Comrade.

264
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,540
He took the money

265
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,660
he earned from the money.

266
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
He went to the gambling house.

267
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,340
I didn't see him at all.

268
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,060
Really.

269
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,620
You can go and check.

270
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,740
Xiguxiang was killed that night.

271
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,660
Where are you?

272
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm at work.

273
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,300
After work,

274
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,300
I'll go home to cook for Xiao Huahua.

275
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,220
After work, you'll go home directly?

276
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,060
I...

277
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,020
I...

278
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,380
I bought something outside the neighborhood.

279
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,980
What?

280
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,820
Soy sauce.

281
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,180
We found a person

282
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,460
who sold his body to the public

283
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,620
in Xie Wuqiang's chat.

284
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,180
According to his statement,

285
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,900
Xie Wuqiang and his family

286
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,740
often provided the agreement of Yanjiao-Mu.

287
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,420
Xie Wuqiang would

288
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,860
immediately take the money

289
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,980
from Xie Xiao-Hua's Yanjiao-Mu

290
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,700
to exchange the money.

291
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,780
That means

292
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,620
Xie Wuqiang is the person

293
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,180
who betrayed Xie Xiao-Hua the most.

294
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,260
Please.

295
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,780
What do you mean?

296
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,540
So shall we

297
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,340
catch a coroner

298
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,020
if theogic is found again?

299
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,980
We can find Yanjiao-Mu

300
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:17,220
to transfer his الأ-广 to Hong Kong's

301
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,580
who is very prepared.

302
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,940
Would a person like him

303
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
use his steam to

304
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,020
attack the rear of the Xie Wuxiang?

305
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,580
Would he use such a method?

306
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,780
We need to go to another Wu Pin's house.

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,100
Did you see

308
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,620
the agreement signed by the Xie Wuxiang?

309
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,020
I haven't.

310
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,780
Think about it.

311
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,100
I haven't.

312
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,980
Wu Pin.

313
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,380
That agreement

314
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,420
may be related to

315
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,900
the safety of Xie Xiaohua.

316
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Why?

317
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
Comrade A,

318
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,860
such an agreement is illegal.

319
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,780
Do you know?

320
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,180
You must find out.

321
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,740
Xiaohua has been successful.

322
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,900
She's recovered.

323
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,380
Don't make any more excuses.

324
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,260
You can't do that.

325
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,220
You must find out.

326
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,860
I...

327
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,580
It's about the problem of the verification of the falsehood.

328
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,940
You've seen it, right?

329
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
I smelled

330
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,700
a little burnt paper

331
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
in the kitchen.

332
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
You burned that agreement, right?

333
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,900
Because it's to support you

334
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,820
to kill the key motive of the Xie Wuxiang.

335
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,900
äng

336
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,580
Then...

337
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,420
I'll take good care of that heart.

338
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,260
Why are you lording my brother?

339
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,340
I'll tell you the truth.

340
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm the best to you.

341
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Do you understand?

342
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,340
I...

343
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
I killed him.

344
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I...

345
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I killed Xie Wujiang.

346
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
I...

347
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
I saw that light.

348
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
It's so dark.

349
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
If I don't kill him,

350
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
our Xiao Hua will die.

351
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
I killed him.

352
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I killed him.

353
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
I killed him.

354
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
I killed him.

355
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
How did you kill Xie Wujiang?

356
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
I was so scared.

357
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
You mean...

358
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
you were scared after you killed him.

359
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
So you don't remember anything.

360
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Yes.

361
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Why do you remember

362
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
the gun that you can't use

363
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,340
to buy a bottle of it?

364
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Why?

365
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Tell me.

366
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
Okay.

367
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
You and the Chinese

368
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
will talk about it later.

369
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
I got it.

370
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Thank you.

371
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
Wu Pin, I want to ask you again.

372
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Did you kill Xie Wujiang?

373
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
No.

374
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
The law passed the poison analysis.

375
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
It calculated that Xie Wujiang

376
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
was killed by the drug.

377
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
That time was

378
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
when you were

379
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
in the convenience store

380
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
and controlled the time to buy soy sauce.

381
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
And it took about 15 minutes

382
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
from the convenience store to the crime scene.

383
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Tell me.

384
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
How did you

385
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
kill Xie Wujiang

386
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
while buying soy sauce?

387
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Why did you lie?

388
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Why did you

389
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
cover up

390
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
the person who really killed Xie Wujiang?

391
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Did you lie?

392
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,340
I wanted to see your son.

393
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
He said so, too.

394
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
Who is he?

395
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
I don't know.

396
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
That day,

397
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
I wanted to kill this bastard.

398
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
I...

399
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,340
I want to see your son.

400
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
He suddenly appeared.

401
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
He stopped me.

402
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
That man

403
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
killed Xie Wujiang.

404
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
The wound on his body

405
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
is old and new.

406
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Xie Wujiang

407
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
killed the old wound.

408
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
The new wound

409
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
was caused by the day

410
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
when he was

411
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,340
in the convenience store

412
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
and was in the convenience store.

413
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Isn't it?

414
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
Isn't it the same

415
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
person who taught you?

416
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
Yes.

417
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,340
The hammer is still there.

418
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
You should go.

419
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
He wore a hat and a mask.

420
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
I was very nervous at that time.

421
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,340
I didn't see

422
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
his face clearly.

423
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
There is only 15 minutes

424
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
left

425
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,340
in the four kilometers of the convenience store.

426
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Remember,

427
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
you must return to your home

428
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
within 15 minutes.

429
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Until the time

430
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
when you are not at the factory.

431
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Find the shortcut

432
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
and go home.

433
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
Find a long-term shop

434
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,340
and buy something long-term.

435
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
So late.

436
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,340
You must think of a way

437
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
to remind the shop people

438
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
that time

439
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
you went to that place.

440
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Sorry.

441
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
I... I... I'll accompany you.

442
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
Why did you

443
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
cover him up?

444
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Because...

445
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Because he saved Xiao Hua.

446
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Officer.

447
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Can I

448
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
give Xiao Hua to me again?

449
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Do you want to cook?

450
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
As long as he sees

451
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
the meal I gave him,

452
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
he will know

453
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
that mom will go to see him tomorrow.

454
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Give it to me.

455
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
I promise to let Xiao Hua

456
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
see the meal

457
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,340
until mom comes to see him.

458
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
I promise.

459
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
I promise.

460
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Until mom comes to see him.

461
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Thank you.

462
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
You have a hope in your heart.

463
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
I know the best

464
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
new lawyer in the whole Xinjiang.

465
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I will ask them to help you.

466
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
You don't need to spend money.

467
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
When the judge is in a good mood,

468
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
he will consider

469
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
the fact that you and your child

470
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
are tortured

471
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
and tortured for a long time.

472
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Why... Why didn't you help me?

473
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
Because you are a good mother.

474
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Thank you.

475
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Let's go.

476
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Mr. Tan Cai,

477
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
don't say anything.

478
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
You can't say anything.

479
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
No.

480
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Please.

481
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Ji Xin, I'm coming in.

482
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
You are working?

483
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
What's wrong?

484
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Dad,

485
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
how is Uncle Liao doing recently?

486
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
You won't forget him, right?

487
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
How can I forget him?

488
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Why did you suddenly mention him?

489
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
I always don't know how to finish it.

490
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I'm a super hero.

491
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
I think Uncle Liao is doing well.

492
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
But I don't know

493
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,340
how is Uncle Liao doing recently.

494
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
He must be still in the hospital.

495
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Did he save many patients?

496
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
He has a serious psychological disorder.

497
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
He is now in a serious condition.

498
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Not everyone

499
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
is willing to face the past.

500
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
I can't hate him now.

501
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
I will go to the hospital.

502
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Come on.

503
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Let's go.

504
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Director Zheng,

505
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
the technical department has found out that

506
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
the monitoring of the salt ink painting room

507
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
has been covered.

508
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
It's hard to restore,

509
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
but we still have a way

510
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
to get some content.

511
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Is it him?

512
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Let's go.

513
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Let's go.

514
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Let's go.

515
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Let's go.

516
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Uncle Liao,

517
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
do you know him?

518
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Do you know him?

519
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Of course.

520
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Can you explain to us

521
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
how you two got into a relationship?

522
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
He is a bastard.

523
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
I asked him to sell the painting

524
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
and he didn't have the ability to do it.

525
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
He even burned my painting.

526
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
That's my most valuable thing.

527
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
The painting.

528
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
Doctor Liao.

529
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Where do you say we are?

530
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
In that cabinet.

531
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Where do I come from?

532
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Doctor Liao.

533
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
It's the night of November 3.

534
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Where are you?

535
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
What are you doing?

536
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I can't remember.

537
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Think about it.

538
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
I think I'll fall asleep

539
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
after drinking.

540
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Okay.

541
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Excuse me.

542
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,620
셨offsale

543
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,980
Remember

544
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,600
what I said

545
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,340
I know

546
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,700
you know

547
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,720
there a great kid

548
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,700
The blasted

549
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,500
is the god of drift

550
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,340
Those people

551
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,300
are scared

552
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,820
of the situation

553
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,860
I didn't know

554
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,660
They to use fresh air

555
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,180
protect you

556
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,180
The top brain engineer in the world,

557
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
the savior of human life,

558
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
how could he have a problem with his brain?

559
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
The boss didn't give me the money.

560
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
It's a small matter.

561
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
Forget it.

562
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,940
That thing,

563
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,180
is very big.

564
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,180
It's very important to be sure,

565
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,180
it will have form in the future.

566
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,420
I'll pay the doctor later.

567
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,700
And...

568
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,080
Right now,

569
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,380
I'd like you to drive the car forward

570
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,120
and join in the camping field.

571
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,200
Are you ready?

572
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,960
Asking for relief.

573
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
You adore spirit?

574
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,080
I think his death has something to do with his pulse.

575
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
The murderer just controlled the time of death.

576
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
This murderer is a very experienced person.

577
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,680
The murderers and the people who kidnapped Zhao Qian are very accurate.

578
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,280
They aren't the people who were killed by Huang Yuan's son.

579
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
There is no good in killing Zhao Qian.

580
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,880
You killed him. You killed him.

581
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,680
Zhang Qiaoying can't kill his own son.

582
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,280
I didn't expect that you could kill the heroine.

583
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,480
Is it Zhao Qian from the Yun Group?

584
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,280
Zhao Qian's enemy?

585
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,080
One year ago, Zhao Qian drove a red light and hit someone.

586
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
Zhao Qian wasn't the first one to hit him.

587
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
He was punished by the police five years ago.

588
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,480
Five years ago, Liao Yifan was also a car fire.

589
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,880
His daughter Liao Yifan was hit by a car in front of the police station.

590
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,680
The driver ran away.

591
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,280
He hasn't been caught for five years.

592
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,680
Liao Yifan, Zhao Qian.

593
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,280
Why is the murderer so perverted?

594
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
First, Yang Youmuo played the death game.

595
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,280
The one who drove Zhao Qian to the trash can must be the one who is in deep sorrow.

596
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,080
That's why he was so complicated to kill the criminal.

597
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,480
He was trying to kill the victim.

598
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
He is in deep sorrow.

599
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I think it's just a thought.

600
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,680
If he was hit by a car, it's Zhao Qian.

601
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Liao Boyan.

602
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,280
Dr. Liao.

603
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Can you stop bothering me?

604
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
What do you want to do?

605
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,480
What do you want to see? Look.

606
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,480
There is a pharmacy nearby. Why did you go so far?

607
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
There is a big misunderstanding.

608
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
You became a rich man.

609
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You forgot how ordinary people live.

610
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
You forgot?

611
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,480
I didn't forget. I didn't dare to forget either.

612
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,280
Dr. Liao.

613
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,480
There is a problem that I feel very uncomfortable about.

614
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,480
Did you find the murderer who killed your daughter five years ago?

615
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
The murderer?

616
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
The murderer?

617
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Dr. Zhang.

618
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Do you have any clue?

619
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Tell me.

620
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
I thank you for my daughter.

621
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
I'm not a police officer.

622
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
I don't have any clue.

623
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I understand your feelings.

624
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,480
But I hope you know what to do and what not to do.

625
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
What should I do?

626
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,480
You asked me to drink with you.

627
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,480
You said you could understand me.

628
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
If your daughter goes to the ice-cream shop

629
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
and sells ice-cream after she goes to school,

630
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,480
she will be caught by the car.

631
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Don't use Zhong Renshi as a shelter.

632
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
I think

633
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
she is Zhong Renshi.

634
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
It's been five years.

635
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Zhong Renshi has been burned to ashes.

636
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Your life is over.

637
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Someone came to tell you

638
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,480
that Zhong Renshi is a real killer.

639
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I said don't use Zhong Renshi as a shelter.

640
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You are angry. Take it.

641
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Your daughter's birthday

642
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
and her parents' wedding

643
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
and her childhood.

644
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
You can live well every day.

645
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
You can only live alone.

646
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,480
You can only imagine the sky.

647
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
You suddenly think of a thunderbolt.

648
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
You are so fierce.

649
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
No one calls you dad anymore.

650
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
You are a

651
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,480
unprotected, arrogant and ungrateful person.

652
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Do you understand me?

653
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Tell me what to do and what not to do.

654
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
You can't understand me.

655
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Let go of me.

656
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,480
If you can understand me,

657
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,480
then I'll definitely understand you.

658
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
So,

659
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
don't blame me.

660
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Zhong Renshi.

661
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I'm so jealous of you.

662
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I'm so jealous of you.

663
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm waiting for you to go home.

664
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm so jealous of you.

665
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
I'm so jealous of you.

666
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
I'm so jealous of you.

667
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,680
I have a daughter waiting for you to go back.

668
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Tell me what I should do and what she shouldn't do.

669
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
You can't understand me.

670
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I will definitely give her this life.

671
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,680
I will definitely give her this life.

672
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I will definitely give her this life.

673
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I will definitely give her this life.

674
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I will definitely give her this life.

675
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,680
I will definitely give her this life.

676
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,080
What are you doing? How many times have I called you?

677
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,480
She is about to cry at school.

678
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Why?

679
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
You forgot?

680
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,080
Hurry up! Hurry up!

681
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,480
What are you doing?

682
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,680
What am I doing? I'm already here.

683
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,880
I said her uncle can't go back to the parent's meeting. Hurry up!

684
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,480
Next, let's welcome Zhou Ren Xi to share with us

685
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,280
the words she got from A-Class. My Super Hero.

686
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,880
My Super Hero.

687
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Super Hero is not only for you to be the main actress.

688
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,280
There is also a real existence in real life.

689
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,680
When I was four, I had a bad thing in my head.

690
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
My parents took me to many hospitals.

691
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
They took many doctors.

692
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,280
But no one dared to give me surgery.

693
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,880
They all said that there were a lot of people.

694
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,580
Later, I met my Super Hero.

695
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,280
Liao Boyan and Liao Bo Bo.

696
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,280
He is the first Super Hero in the world.

697
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,480
He personally gave me a surgery to go back to the village.

698
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,280
He removed the bad things that I saw in my head.

699
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
I know.

700
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
I know.

701
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,880
He took the big door and healthy window.

702
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,280
It's so good to hear that.

703
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,880
Right.

704
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,480
What's wrong?

705
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Xiao Da De is dead.

706
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,680
Xiao Da De.

707
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,680
Xiao Da De.

708
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,680
Xiao Da De.
