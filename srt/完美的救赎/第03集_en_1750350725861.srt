1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
The Butterfly'

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,880
in her music

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,080
Why did you

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,960
started drawing this?

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,760
I don't understand

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,960
You don't need to understand

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,840
So

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,600
This symbol with twist

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,280
But I think

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,080
It's more like another weapon

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,520
ä beats

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Yes.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,120
Then the trap he fell into

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
is most likely Ai He.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Yang You Mo.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,640
Zhao Qian.

17
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,040
ESSP.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,340
PRINCESS LIU BEI.

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,200
EP16

20
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Officer Zheng,

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
do you think I'm being

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
spilt water so easily?

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to take revenge on each other?

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
If that's the case,

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,720
I'll tell you

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
if I have a problem.

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
If you have a problem,

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,720
we'll talk about it with evidence and facts.

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Mr. Zhao,

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,040
Zhang Qiao Yun said

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,040
you were the one who ruined their family.

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
That's because

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,920
I had a relationship

34
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
with Yang You Mo.

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
I admit that I lied to the police.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
I said I was just a friend.

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,000
But I was afraid

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
it would affect

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,320
the reputation of our company.

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
The first time we met

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,800
was at his art exhibition.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
After that,

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,240
he started a strong pursuit for me.

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,640
Our relationship

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,600
started to warm up.

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
But I soon found out

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
that he lied to me.

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
What did he lie to you about?

49
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,840
He's a family member.

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,400
For your smile,

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
we should have a drink.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,040
Sure.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Over there,

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
Yang You Mo and I tried hard

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
to maintain our distance.

56
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,320
But we ended up

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
being released wasn't fast.

58
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
While Mr. Zhang

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
misunderstood me

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,360
and thought it was me who seduced his son.

61
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,120
How should we

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
manage to take revenge.

63
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
Were we angered by the news

64
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
about our relationship?

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Why would I care about him?

66
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
I think I'm the reason

67
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
for their family's collapse.

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,440
I don't have much contact with You Mo.

69
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,120
I heard that he had an accident.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
So I came to see my family

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,520
when my classmates came.

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Your family?

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
Then...

74
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,220
My family are no longer

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,560
dead.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Ms. Zhang,

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,580
don't get интrigued.

78
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,760
Where is

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
You Mo?

80
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
The lover of You Mo, Lu Li Juan,

81
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,840
is now married again.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
and I have a hidden faith.

83
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,520
They are a good couple.

84
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,840
They even gave me a grandson, Tongtong.

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,040
Tongtong.

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
Tongtong, look at me.

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
Look at me.

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
My grandson is so handsome.

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Look at me, Tongtong.

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,200
Who would have thought

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,000
that Luo Li would jump off a building?

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
Hello there.

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
There are groups of people

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,560
who were forced to i bushes

95
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,080
into their rapper's house.

96
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Wo días virtual?

97
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,640
Mr.Zhang.

98
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Tongtong

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,240
would die.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,000
When he introduced...

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,280
Tongtong five months later.

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,680
And

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
And Yang Yan.

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
This child is like his mother.

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
All of this...

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
is because you met that woman.

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I don't want to see it. The more I see it, the more I get confused.

108
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Each one of them is clearly a murder case.

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
And they are saying that it's a family business.

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
How can I say something?

111
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
That is called a family business that can't be broken easily.

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Our evidence is still good.

113
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
There is no family business at all.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Who can have such a big grudge with them?

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
They won't let Hao Hao die.

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
How about we find an outsider to help us?

117
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Sometimes it's easier to see the problem from an outsider's perspective.

118
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
An outsider? Who?

119
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Zhong Ning's analyst.

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Do you know where he lives?

121
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
If you find him, you'll be done for.

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll go.

123
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
This is a good thing.

124
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Think about it.

125
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
You said it.

126
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
You've already made a decision.

127
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Why are you still discussing with me?

128
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Anyway, I'll make a statement in advance.

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I'll follow the organization.

130
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
But I personally...

131
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Okay, the team has said it.

132
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Follow the organization.

133
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,680
We all have to learn from the team's intellectual awareness.

134
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Applause!

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Come.

136
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Why are you giving me this?

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
You give it to Zhong Ning.

138
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Why should I give it to her?

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Follow the organization.

140
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I'll go.

141
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll take it.

142
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
You don't know her?

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Uncle!

144
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Uncle, have you really eaten?

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I've eaten.

146
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Look.

147
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Thank you.

148
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
I bought you a book.

149
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Thank you, Uncle.

150
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
And your favorite color,

151
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
a stationery.

152
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Thank you, Uncle.

153
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I like to play the game.

154
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I promised I'd never touch your face.

155
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
You're so mean.

156
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I'm not.

157
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm not.

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
I'll kill you.

159
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
What are you doing here?

160
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Qiqi.

161
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Your father is going to the police team

162
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
to be a consultant.

163
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Do you know that?

164
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
Really?

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I tell you.

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
If he really goes to the police team

167
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
to be a consultant,

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
he'll be very, very busy.

169
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
He was also very busy in the police station.

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
He doesn't even have time to eat with you.

171
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Then I don't have to cook for him.

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Dad.

173
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
You're sacrificing your time in the police station

174
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
to be a consultant.

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I'll pay for it.

176
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
No money.

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
No money.

178
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
You don't even care about the food.

179
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Where are you going?

180
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I'll pay you.

181
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Dad,

182
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
go help Tongtong and Yang Yan.

183
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
How do you know?

184
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
I saw you writing behind the board.

185
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
You're peeking at my stuff again.

186
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Dad.

187
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Okay, eat.

188
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I don't want your money.

189
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Can you go to him?

190
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Okay.

191
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Eat.

192
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Eat meat.

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Yang Yongmo's missing stepdaughter Yang Yan

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
is Xi Xi's schoolmate.

195
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Is this the reason you're following Yang Yongmo?

196
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
I've told my teacher about this.

197
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm not following the organization.

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
That's my personal objection.

199
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Your consultant certificate.

200
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Tell me, Mr. Zhong.

201
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
What did you find out from Zhang Xiaoyun today?

202
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
You want to know?

203
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Tell me first.

204
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
What's going on with Zhao Qian?

205
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Zhao Qian's statement is true and false.

206
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Are you and Yang Yongmo

207
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
just friends?

208
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Yes.

209
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm just friends with Yang Yongmo.

210
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
What's going on?

211
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
What's going on?

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
What's going on?

213
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
What's going on?

214
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Are you and Yang Yongmo just friends?

215
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Yes.

216
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I had a relationship with Yang Yongmo.

217
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
He lied to me about his family affairs.

218
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
I know who killed my son.

219
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Zhao Qian, who are you?

220
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Yang Yan.

221
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Fang Qinchun's husband is called Qian.

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Don't bother.

223
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
My husband is dead.

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
He almost killed my husband.

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Mr. Zhong, I thought

226
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Mr. Zhao was going to seduce my husband.

227
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
He used Li Yunzhi's magic.

228
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Mr. Zhong, let's start.

229
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
This man's surname is Zhong.

230
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
He's Zhang Qi's consultant.

231
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
What can we do to help him?

232
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Zhong Ning, we've met each other.

233
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Now, Yang Yongmo's case is very influential.

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
We must find him as soon as possible.

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
After consulting,

236
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
the city bureau leader approved him

237
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
to assist our police investigation

238
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
as an expert consultant.

239
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Come on.

240
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Let's welcome Zhong's consultant.

241
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,580
Mr. Zhong

242
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,680
who just turned 90.

243
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Sheng準備好了?

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Mr. Zhong.

245
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
This is not your crew.

246
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
First, you faked it.

247
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Shenggang,

248
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I gave it to you.

249
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Take care, sir.

250
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
같아요

251
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
The killer kidnapped Zhao Qian

252
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,440
to threaten Yang Yongmo.

253
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
He will kill Zhao Qian in the future.

254
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,720
Zhao Qian has a skin problem.

255
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
So he will sell it in the garbage factory.

256
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,120
The murderer is aware of the sense of ritual.

257
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
But Yang Yongmo killed more than 954 people.

258
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,840
There must be a reason.

259
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,200
Such a precise number.

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
What does it mean?

261
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,200
Before Yang Yongmo died, the whole family died.

262
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Tongtong and Yang Yan were accident.

263
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,280
Only Luo Lijun was killed.

264
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Did Luo Lijun really kill himself because of feelings?

265
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Is Tongtong and Yang Yan's death really an accident?

266
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I don't know.

267
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,880
I want to see Yang Yongmo's house.

268
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,600
Tongtong, the son of Yang Yongmo,

269
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
died in this room.

270
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
He was killed by accident in this bed.

271
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,760
His hands and feet were moving.

272
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,280
His head was wrapped by the blanket.

273
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,480
This position was facing the baby's monitoring device.

274
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,280
So it can be judged

275
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
that the child was an accident

276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,280
ten minutes after Luo Lijun jumped off the building.

277
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
This is Yang Yan's room.

278
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,120
These are all painted by Yang Yan.

279
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
He is very good at painting.

280
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,680
He painted the rainbow of this little princess.

281
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
He even published it.

282
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,400
The rainbow of the little princess?

283
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
Where did Luo Lijun jump off the building?

284
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,320
Just at the position of the captain.

285
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,680
The wind is 154 km per hour.

286
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
The altitude is 92 km per hour.

287
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,680
That's not right.

288
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
It's the opposite.

289
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
It should be the altitude that determines the speed.

290
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
Check how high Yang Yongmo's house is.

291
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
I have an idea.

292
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,820
More goedernie God.

293
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,220
Save spiritual power well.

294
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,000
92 meters.

295
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,760
I see.

296
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,040
Computer.

297
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,000
The frequency of the speed V is equal to 2GH.

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,400
The acceleration of gravity is 10. The height H is 92.

299
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
The starting number is multiplied by 3.6 and converted to 10.

300
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
154.4.

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
This is why the perpetrator let the devil

302
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,560
open the window of the car when he was speeding.

303
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,560
Using the feeling of the death of Luo Li Juan

304
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,160
to torture Yang Yonghuo.

305
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,760
To put a stolen photo

306
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,200
into the trash can.

307
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,920
How much hatred

308
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,760
does the perpetrator have with them?

309
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,440
This analysis

310
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,720
is to avenge Luo Li Juan.

311
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,160
You are right.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,960
Luo Li Juan is the cause of the case.

313
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
And the child.

314
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,960
Go to the military science lab and check

315
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
where Luo Li Juan often goes.

316
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
And see who he has met.

317
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,560
This should be a new breakthrough.

318
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Li Juan is very excited about the birth of the child.

319
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,160
He will attend every episode of the breast cancer class.

320
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,760
He is very serious.

321
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,360
And he also writes notes.

322
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,160
He writes notes?

323
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,960
What kind of notes?

324
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,360
Let me see.

325
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
Exactly the same as this one.

326
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,960
Ke Ran.

327
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Are there any such notebooks in that case?

328
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,360
No.

329
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
How did you know?

330
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,960
Because I checked all the cases of Luo Li Juan last night.

331
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,560
When did Luo Li Juan's mental state

332
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
start to change?

333
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
I don't know.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
Since Tongtong was born,

335
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,240
she hasn't come to me for a long time.

336
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
But one time, she was strange.

337
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
She walked over and told me

338
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
someone was following her.

339
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,480
What's wrong?

340
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,600
Someone is following me.

341
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,720
Don't be afraid.

342
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
At that time, her condition...

343
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,760
I think she had postpartum depression.

344
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,440
This kind of disease will make the patient

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
think too much.

346
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
So I advised her to go to the doctor.

347
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,080
No.

348
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,440
I went to the next store to see the surveillance footage.

349
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,640
I didn't find anyone following her.

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,120
How are Luo Lijuan and Yang Youmo's relationship?

351
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,520
Relationship?

352
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,840
It's a matter of husband and wife.

353
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,360
I'm an outsider. I'm not good at judging.

354
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
I can only say

355
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
Lijuan loves Yang Youmo.

356
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,880
But Yang Youmo may not love Lijuan so much.

357
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,120
At least, he won't be like what others see.

358
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Of course,

359
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,080
this is just my intuition as a woman.

360
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
What song is this?

361
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,320
It's a mystery.

362
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,520
By the way, Lijuan told me

363
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,040
that her children like this song very much.

364
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,080
They like it?

365
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,880
Yes.

366
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,440
Except Tongtong,

367
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,680
she also likes Yang Yan.

368
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,160
When Yang Yan was walking,

369
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,920
she liked to play this song with Lijuan.

370
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,760
Please play it again.

371
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,880
Okay.

372
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,240
Okay. Thank you.

373
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
Okay.

374
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
Both children who had an accident

375
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,680
like to listen to this song.

376
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,360
Yang Youmo died listening to this song.

377
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,040
And he was scared to death.

378
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,880
It sounds a bit kind.

379
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,240
Behind this song,

380
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,160
someone is playing hide-and-seek with me.

381
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
Here,

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
can't you find it?

383
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,560
You can come and hide it.

384
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
I can hide it.

385
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,000
I can never find it.

386
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,440
Let's play hide-and-seek together.

387
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
You can hide it.

388
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,520
I can hide it.

389
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,800
I can find a place to hide it.

390
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,800
I can hide it.

391
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,880
Morning, Captain Zheng.

392
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,040
Morning, Captain Zhao.

393
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,440
What do you mean?

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,280
Morning, Brother Cao.

395
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,480
Morning, Brother Cao.

396
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,480
Dajun.

397
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,440
How's the research on the source of the medicine?

398
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,840
Captain Zheng,

399
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
you have to understand me.

400
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
The whole city's hospital clinic

401
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,120
is so crowded.

402
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
I've been understanding you for days.

403
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Don't tell me you want the evidence to understand you.

404
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
Of course not.

405
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,200
It's not necessary.

406
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,040
The hospital and clinic

407
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,960
have completed their purchase and prescription records.

408
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,800
There's no medical history report.

409
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,200
Next, I'm going to start from the black market

410
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,360
to find out the source of the body-damaging acid

411
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
and anesthetic.

412
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm telling you,

413
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,880
you can't just check the light of the sword.

414
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,280
You have to check the light of the sword.

415
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
If you do this, we'll split up.

416
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,160
You discuss with them.

417
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,280
You go check the black market.

418
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Okay.

419
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Ke Ran,

420
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,240
we two

421
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,880
are the family-owned consultants.

422
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Let's go to Liyun Group

423
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,280
and talk to them.

424
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,120
Okay.

425
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
Sir, Zhao Qian is back in Liyun.

426
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,280
Good tea.

427
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
Is it good?

428
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,600
Is there a difference

429
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
between this tea

430
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,480
and our team's 50-yuan tea?

431
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,520
Get two catties for the team later.

432
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,000
It tastes exactly the same.

433
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,560
Lucky me.

434
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm afraid that I'll buy you two catties of tea

435
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
and then set a new standard.

436
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Mr. Zhong,

437
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
aren't you a divorce lawyer

438
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,680
who knows a lot about women?

439
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,680
So you're a police officer.

440
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,720
I think

441
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,800
I'm indeed a divorce lawyer.

442
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,520
Under the invitation of the political team,

443
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm currently a consultant

444
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,680
to the new police team temporarily.

445
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
This is my business card.

446
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,280
And

447
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,320
I really know a lot about women.

448
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
If your friend

449
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,400
needs anything,

450
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
you can always find me.

451
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,120
You can use my business card to call me.

452
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
Interesting.

453
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,920
Mr. Zhong,

454
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,280
I also want to say something interesting.

455
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,720
You and Yang Yongmou's case

456
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,040
involves two drugs.

457
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,040
One of them

458
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
is a national drug.

459
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,520
Ordinary people can't get it.

460
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,840
We're currently

461
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,400
investigating the source of these two drugs.

462
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Coincidentally,

463
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,520
these two drugs

464
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
are the main products

465
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,000
of your Lv Yun Group.

466
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Isn't it interesting?

467
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
You mean

468
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,360
the murderer deliberately used

469
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,320
the drugs made by Lv Yun to commit a crime

470
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,840
to blackmail our Lv Yun?

471
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
Did I say that?

472
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,680
Mr. Zhao is reminding us

473
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,040
that there's another way to handle the case.

474
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,720
Here's the thing.

475
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
I hope you can

476
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,040
show us the production and shipment records

477
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,520
of the drugs

478
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,800
and the drug

479
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
that are used to make drug crimes

480
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,000
within six months.

481
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,000
Is there a problem?

482
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,960
The political team didn't go after the murderer

483
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,520
but came to investigate Lv Yun.

484
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
That's not right.

485
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,040
Mr. Zhao,

486
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,200
Mr. Zhao,

490
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,360
we're doing this

491
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,400
to keep you safe.

492
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,440
If we don't find

493
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,160
the source of the drugs,

494
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,680
we can't catch the murderer.

495
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,240
The source of the drugs

496
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
should be found in Lv Yun.

497
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,440
All right.

498
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,880
We'll stop production and shipment for one day

499
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,520
and cooperate with your investigation.

500
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,680
In that case,

501
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
it's best to be a man.

502
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Thank you for your cooperation.

503
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,280
It's a bit troublesome.

504
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
You're not going

505
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,840
to be a middle consultant?

506
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,360
Mr. Zhao,

507
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,280
it's not easy to be a consultant.

508
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I understand.

509
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,640
All right.

510
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,760
I understand.

511
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
I have to inform them

512
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,120
to stop Lv Yun's

513
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,320
huge drug-taking machine.

514
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
I'll make a call.

515
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,080
Wait a minute.

516
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,820
Lv Yun

517
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,800
Manager's Office

518
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,920
Dang Er Bao

519
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,680
How's it going with Xiao者?

520
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,560
He's fine.

521
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,560
One, two.

522
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
We've looked everywhere.

523
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,320
Who offended Mr. Dou?

524
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Stand properly.

525
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,640
You don't know the rules.

526
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,520
Can you investigate Liyun Group?

527
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,040
You've delayed the production of Liyun Group.

528
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,960
You've delayed the economic development of Hong Kong.

529
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,960
Do you understand?

530
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,440
I rushed here

531
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
when the leader called.

532
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,400
I was afraid you'd cause more trouble.

533
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm sorry.

534
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,160
Luckily, Liyun and Mr. Zhao

535
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
don't give you a lot of knowledge.

536
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,040
Right, Mr. Zhao?

537
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,680
Of course.

538
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,320
What are you investigating?

539
00:28:51,680 --> 00:29:06,520
The source of the

540
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:37,640
aquarium's

541
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,700
I won't let unnie be doing this.

542
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,320
Call the police and send them a letter.

543
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,340
Who am we to do so?

544
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,100
Developer Chef okay?

545
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm done making broken

546
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,820
Are you all right?

547
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,600
Hope all goes well

548
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,040
When Qian Cheng died,

549
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Qian Qian.

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Behave yourself.

551
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Because of that portrait.

552
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,040
You're drunk.

553
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
Just wait for the hell to come down with me.

554
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Are you sad?

555
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
Qian Cheng's wife, Fang Qin Chun,

556
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,960
often misses you.

557
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,160
She said you often...

558
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,880
I know there are many rumors about me recently.

559
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
You know,

560
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
a rich

561
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,160
and beautiful woman

562
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,480
can get the most...

563
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,560
rumors.

564
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,680
Chief is the chief.

565
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,480
You're getting old.

566
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
Don't try to fool me.

567
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
You're holding me in front of me.

568
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,720
You're hurting me behind my back.

569
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,400
Who's hurting you behind your back?

570
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,880
You're talking like an old lady, right?

571
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,120
Who dares to say that?

572
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
What does that mean?

573
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
What are you laughing at?

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
You're not a good bird.

575
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Take care, sir.

576
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Take care, sir.

577
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,320
I've investigated Fang Qin Chun.

578
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,600
She's had a hard life.

579
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Qian Cheng has dragged her into the company.

580
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
She's owed a lot of debts.

581
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,240
But this woman is admirable.

582
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,480
She fell from the rich and beautiful.

583
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,520
She can even sell cattle to make a living.

584
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,880
Because she has a son.

585
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
She's a mother.

586
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
She's a mother.

587
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

588
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,120
I'll give you a clue.

589
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,040
The police are investigating

590
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
the source of the clues

591
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
and anesthetic drugs.

592
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Is this related to Yang You Mo's case?

593
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,960
Yes.

594
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,880
It's related to Yang You Mo.

595
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Kai Ge, five.

596
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Two.

597
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,120
One.

598
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Play.

599
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Nice.

600
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Come on.

601
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Ninety.

602
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Play.

603
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Can you do it?

604
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Take it.

605
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Kai Ge.

606
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
What's the use of gambling?

607
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Knowledge is power.

608
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I see.

609
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Yes, Kai Ge.

610
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Hello.

611
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Hello.

612
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Who's selling

613
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
anesthetic drugs

614
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
and the source of the clues?

615
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
There's one.

616
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Our acquaintance.

617
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Who?

618
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Xie Wu Qiang.

619
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
I don't think I'll survive.

620
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,320
But you must call back

621
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
before you do.

622
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Got it?

623
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
You're really at home.

624
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Got it.

625
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Got it.

626
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
I'm here to do the real thing today.

627
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I'll let you go.

628
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Thank you, Kai Ge.

629
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
Thank you, Kai Ge.

630
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,280
But you must pay me back.

631
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
I must.

632
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I must.

633
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
You're back.

634
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I've been waiting for you all night.

635
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Your hotel

636
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
has given me a small sum of money.

637
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
How did you know?

638
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
I didn't know.

639
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
I didn't know.

640
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
I didn't know.

641
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I didn't know.

642
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
I saw

643
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
the circle of friends

644
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
someone sent.

645
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Let me see.

646
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
This is for Xiaohua.

647
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Let me see.

648
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
This is for Xiaohua.

649
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Let me see.

650
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I'll show you.

651
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
This is for Xiaohua.

652
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
What's this?

653
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
You can't touch it.

654
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
He hit you.

655
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Xia Yongqiang,

656
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
are you still human?

657
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Your son only has half a life left.

658
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
You hurt him.

659
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
I asked him to rent a goods company.

660
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
He couldn't even get the money back.

661
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Shouldn't he hit me?

662
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Your hotel is shameless.

663
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
So many people

664
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
donated thousands of dollars.

665
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Give me the money.

666
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
This is for the child.

667
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Let go of me.

668
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
You can't do this.

669
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Didn't you say

670
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
he only has half a life left?

671
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
This money can save his half a life.

672
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm leaving.

673
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
If you keep going,

674
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
you'll get a new life.

675
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I'm leaving.

676
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Let go of me.

677
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Xiaohua.

678
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Let me in.

679
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Let me in.

680
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Let me go.

681
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Xiaohua.

682
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Xiaohua.

683
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Xiaohua, hide.

684
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Xiaohua.

685
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
You've been sleeping for days.

686
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Who are you?

687
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm here.

688
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
You can't get out.

689
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Who is it?

690
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Xiaohua.

691
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Brother Long.

692
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Son.

693
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Brother Kai.

694
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Can you give me two more days?

695
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I'm not asking you for money.

696
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I'm asking you for someone.

697
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Do you know

698
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
who they are?

699
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
I don't know.

700
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I just want you to know.

701
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
You can't be a coward.

702
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I can't be a coward.

703
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I know.

704
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I know.

705
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
I know.

706
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I know.

707
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
Why do you want to buy medicine?

708
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I've been...

709
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
I've been not...

710
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Think about it.

711
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
There are many people who want to buy this or that.

712
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Brother Kai, give me some hints.

713
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
All right.

714
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Before November 3rd,

715
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
if anyone asks you to buy some anesthetic,

716
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
tell it to me.

717
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
November 3rd.

718
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
November 3rd.

719
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
No.

720
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,000
The day Yang Yang died on the bridge.

721
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,200
You want to know something, right?

722
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,120
No, no, no.

723
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,480
Brother Kai, I'm just saying.

724
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,200
This matter is big news in the whole of Hong Kong.

725
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,120
Of course I...

726
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
Don't say that out there.

727
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,800
I'm so sick of it.

728
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,600
No, no.

729
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I'll go back and investigate.

730
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,680
I'll go back and investigate.

731
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,400
Hello, Mr. Tan.

732
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Thank you, Brother Kai.

733
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Thank you, Brother Kai.

734
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,560
Hurry up, please.

735
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
Okay, I'm coming.

736
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
This photo.

737
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,960
I felt weird when I first saw it.

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Look at Luo Li Juan's expression.

739
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,160
He's smiling so hard.

740
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,720
The owner of the shop said

741
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,360
Luo Li Juan was looking forward to this child's birth.

742
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,800
But look at his expression.

743
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,840
How can there be the kind of happiness

744
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,760
after the mother gave birth to the child?

745
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
Look at the time.

746
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,600
This date.

747
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,800
This is the second day after Tong Tong's birth.

748
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
I was thinking

749
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,320
why there was no photo of the first day of birth.

750
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,040
Then I found this.

751
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,080
This photo of Zhang Qiaoyun

752
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,560
is the first day after Tong Tong's birth.

753
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,320
At this time,

754
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,600
Yang You Mo was with Zhao Xian.

755
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,320
And it was the whole day.

756
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
The exhibition in the daytime,

757
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
and the dinner party at night.

758
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,440
Yang You Mo

759
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,560
put this photo in the car and in the house.

760
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The purpose is to let the people who saw this photo

761
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,800
know that he is a good husband.

762
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Do you understand?

763
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
There's a saying that goes like this.

764
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,600
The jade is covered with the jade.

765
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,760
I mean the jade is covered with the jade.

766
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,600
That's what I mean.

767
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,320
It's all vegetarian.

768
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,240
Eat less meat.

769
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,320
Eat more vegetarian.

770
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Boss.

771
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,720
20 skewers of meat skewers.

772
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Okay.

773
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Yummy.

774
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,360
Okay.

775
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
Enjoy.

776
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,840
Let's go.

777
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm not going to kill you.

778
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,200
Are you?

779
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,360
I... I think so.

780
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
What do you mean?

781
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
It's dark.

782
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,840
I forgot.

783
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,560
You forgot? You're staring at me.

784
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,040
Listen.

785
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,160
If you see a box that looks like this,

786
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
just tell me.

787
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Listen.

788
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,320
If you can't find that person,

789
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,640
I'll beat you to death.

790
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll never do anything wrong.

791
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,640
General.

792
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,220
My car is on the way.

793
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,740
Is that him?

794
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,300
You're useless!

795
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,940
I got it.

796
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
You killed Yang You Mo?

797
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
You're still pretending?

798
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,240
My son recognized you?

799
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,800
That day, you took the medicine from the street.

800
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,960
He followed you all the way.

801
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,360
He followed you all the way to your house.

802
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,680
You didn't expect that, right?

803
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,080
I asked my son to follow him once every time I had a class.

804
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,000
Otherwise, how would he know you live here?

805
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,680
Hey.

806
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,880
Hey.

807
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
You're just a cop.

808
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm not a cop.

809
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,560
What are you afraid of?

810
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,320
I'm here to make a double-win deal with you.

811
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,600
Hey.

812
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,240
Hey.

813
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,240
Babies don't wait for love.

814
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,840
The patient is fimed forever,

815
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,000
if I can provide him Tschrenoa medicine.

816
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,960
You womanizer.

817
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,480
I'm afraid that this man will use wild Freshman at Nrockville.

818
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,600
He said that you two have a match.

819
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,320
You went easy on him.

820
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,680
Bro.

821
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,280
What if he forgets to pay?

822
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,480
At least he can prove it.

823
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
Old man, eat your food.
