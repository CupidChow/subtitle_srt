The King's Avatar

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
That day, I saw you

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
kowtowing to Zhao Qian

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,280
in the alley.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,160
I was sad for you

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,440
and ran to your house

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,240
to kowtow to Zhao Qian

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
in the bed.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,560
Dongdong was kidnapped?

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
It was also a play I played.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,920
Why?

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,040
Because I wanted to

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
put you in a dead end

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,360
and make you

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,560
resist Zhao Qian.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,400
If I do it again,

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
I will do it again.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,800
Because I

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,200
don't have a chance.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,600
You said you don't have a chance.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Is this worth it?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,200
You broke my stuff.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
I m no longer a crybaby.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm thinking

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
what I would do

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,640
if I was going into dead-end.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,040
I am forgetting

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,200
why I made Tu tearing Zhao Qian.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,680
But you don't forget

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
that Zhao Qian killed your husband

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Do you have confidence in your plan?

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Yes. We can show everyone

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,400
the true face of Zhao Quan.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
But you must tell me

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
what Qian Cheng left for you.

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Except for the bitter fate,

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
nothing was left.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Think about it.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Any details, including abnormal reactions,

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
are strange.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Strange?

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
It's strange to have a key.

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
But it should be

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
something left by a wild woman.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
What key?

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
The key plate is on the back,

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
with 026 printed.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
The key plate is on the back,

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
with 026 printed.

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
The key plate is on the back,

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
with 026 printed.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,400
The Long Ballad

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Episode 18

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Hurry up.

56
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
We are not moving.

57
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,400
We are not moving.

58
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Hurry up.

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Hurry up.

60
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Hurry up.

61
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Hurry up.

62
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
0202 is not right.

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Lin Wo.

64
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Uncle Liang, it's me.

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm Zhou Ren Xi.

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I know you are here.

67
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
If you don't open the door, we won't leave.

68
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Uncle Liang, open the door.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Uncle Liang.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Uncle Liang.

71
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
What are you doing?

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Uncle Liang.

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Uncle Liang, do you remember me?

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I remember.

75
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
It's okay, I'll help you remember.

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I know you are sick.

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
From today,

78
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
we will come here every day

79
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
to help you do chores

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
and go out to buy groceries.

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Our class is the most poor and the most poor.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
We have read Zhou Ren Xi's work.

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Of course it's you.

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Uncle Liang, this is my work.

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
It's your story.

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
You can also win a prize.

87
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I want to share it with you.

88
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Look.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I'll read it to you.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
My superhero.

91
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Superheroes are not only in movies.

92
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
In real life, you really exist.

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
When I was four years old, my head...

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
The Liao Boyan you knew is dead.

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
He is a man, I am a ghost.

96
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Do you understand?

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Uncle Liao.

98
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Uncle Liao.

99
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Get out!

100
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Uncle Liao.

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Uncle Liao, I...

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I just want you to be better with Zhou Wu

103
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
and become a good sister.

104
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Uncle Liao, my father said

105
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
he was wrong about you.

106
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
You are a good person.

107
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Uncle Liao.

108
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Should I go out and beat you up?

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
That'sOK.

110
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Pull.

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
But re-weight each,

112
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,680
drink,

113
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,320
it's the core you do when you drink.

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Help yourself to the medicine,

115
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:13,620
there's nothing

116
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,160
left to drink.

117
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,820
It's me.

118
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,300
Give me some tea,

119
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm having a baby.

120
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,160
Yes.

121
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm Xiao Zhu.

123
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Don't blame me.

124
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Zhong Ruixi

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,560
is a good kid.

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,680
You're a good person.

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
You too.

128
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
Sometimes,

129
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I forget who I am.

130
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
It's okay.

131
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,840
I'll help you.

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,560
Don't bother me.

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,880
You're helping me.

134
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,560
If not,

135
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,920
Zhong Ruixi and I

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
owe you a great debt of gratitude.

137
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,880
We must pay it back.

138
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,000
Wu Ri,

139
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,800
it's just falsely accused.

140
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,400
You don't have to give me advice.

141
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll give you a solid proof

142
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,320
no matter how garlic-paste it is.

143
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
Zhou nós sadly

144
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
does not pester you.

145
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
Yes, I won't.

146
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Oil Oelexia

147
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,740
is ill-f seventh

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,140
and does not respect

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,420
enty,

150
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,300
then others promote it

151
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,320
as you think I canあ

152
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,520
and handed the company to his daughter Zhao Qian.

153
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,120
Afterwards, he was at home all the time.

154
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
If you have any questions or ideas, tell us.

155
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,520
How did Zhao Yinghong

156
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
get involved with Fang Qingchun?

157
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,120
Also, he is Zhao Qian's father.

158
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Will he really be the murderer of Sheng Shangxing's case?

159
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,120
Will a father treat his daughter like that?

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
So many things need to be done by Zhao Yinghong himself.

161
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
But his actions are not changeable.

162
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,320
And if he finds her like this, will it affect him too much?

163
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,720
You see, then he should go to his home and ask.

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Please come in.

165
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,480
The

166
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,320
Captain Zheng, do you think this room is very familiar?

167
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Every photo of Zhao

168
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,920
looks like someone who is staring at the room.

169
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,320
You mean this is the bedroom of your Chairman Zhao?

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Yes, it is Chairman Zhao's bedroom.

171
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,120
He sleeps here every day?

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
He sleeps here every day.

173
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Who arranged it?

174
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
It was Chairman Zhao.

175
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Chairman Zhao arranged it?

176
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Yes.

177
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,920
Go to Fang Qingchun's house again.

178
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
You must find what Zhao Qian wants.

179
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,720
I will go.

180
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Be gentle, okay?

181
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Miss, is our dead di Agent Bai losing his consciousness?

182
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,320
bevor weour will do scrambled2 get someone?

183
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,720
I don't think so.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,020
Can you do this clean?

185
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,520
What do you mean clean?

186
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,120
I want the whole clock!!!

187
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I left a note in the front of the warehouse.

188
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I ran home quietly.

189
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
How could this child do this?

190
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Running around everywhere.

191
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Don't worry.

192
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
I guess Dong Dong just wanted to go back

193
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
to play with the neighbor's goods.

194
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
That's why he went back.

195
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
And he knew that he left you a note.

196
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm afraid something bad will happen to him.

197
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
You clean up later.

198
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll send you to the place

199
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
where the army arranged.

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
You'll be safe.

201
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Hurry up.

202
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Help me.

203
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
The water is coming.

204
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Get up.

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
It's too big.

206
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Hurry up.

207
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Be careful.

208
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Dong Dong.

209
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Dong Dong.

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Dong Dong.

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Dong Dong.

212
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Dong Dong.

213
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Dong Dong.

214
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Dong Dong.

215
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Don't go in.

216
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Dong Dong.

217
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Don't go in.

218
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Dong Dong.

219
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Dong Dong.

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Mom.

221
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Mom.

222
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Where did you go?

223
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I said don't come here.

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Where did you go?

225
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
There was someone just now.

226
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
He said...

227
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'll tell you later.

228
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
If you say it again,

229
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
you'll see him.

230
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Do you hear me?

231
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
One, two, three, go.

232
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
gers.

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Go.

234
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Get up.

235
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Okay.

236
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Come on, go.

237
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Go.

238
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Come on.

239
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
Where did he go?

240
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Run!

241
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Run!

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
What's going on?

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay.

244
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,200
Ms. Fang.

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm not Ms. Fang.

246
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm just a woman who sells beef.

247
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,840
I beg you not to come to me again.

248
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,960
I just want to raise the child safely.

249
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't want to cause trouble again.

250
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,120
I can't afford it either.

251
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,120
Are you afraid of ghosts?

252
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,400
There are no ghosts in the world.

253
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
I mean the kind of ghosts

254
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,600
who can stand under the sun.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
Fang Qin's family is an old community.

256
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,840
There are some shortcomings in the surveillance.

257
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,760
And there are large numbers of people.

258
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,080
And it's complicated.

259
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,600
It's difficult to find a person

260
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,280
who has no characteristics.

261
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,400
You said you didn't see the witness for a long time, right?

262
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,720
It's too dark.

263
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,880
I asked a few neighbors who found the fire first.

264
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
They all said they didn't see anyone.

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,280
By the way,

266
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Ms. Zhong found a suspicious person.

267
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
But the environment is complicated.

268
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,240
She didn't see the person's face clearly.

269
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
We can only

270
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,040
hedge the idea from the material evidence.

271
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
She sees a person and thought it was suspicious.

272
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Yes.

273
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,840
The túnation of the gun died down.

274
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
You two search together.

275
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,720
Okay.

276
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,760
It doesn't thin at all.

277
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,680
Xiaodong...

278
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
Weren't they very tired?

279
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Turn off the computer, and prepare to lead the dream for!

280
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
Power is dead!

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,240
Turn off the computer, and prepare to lead the dream for!

282
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,080
Dear!

283
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
Eat some fruits!

284
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
I only have one woman I care for.

285
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
I've gotten used to seeing him.

286
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,300
It's okay when I'm with him.

287
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
There's no need to worry.

288
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
Because with Xiang Tong and that Chen Mingjia Omad

289
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,720
I won't have to spend besides myself.

290
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
How is it going?

291
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,280
Is it comfortable staying at your own place?

292
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,560
Not comfortable?

293
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
You should be happy.

294
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,240
Because what I said is true.

295
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,760
In this world,

296
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,560
there are a few men who are willing to tell their wives the truth.

297
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
Right?

298
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,760
Bruce, A-Seo,

299
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,560
guess what I found.

300
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
You two.

301
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
A-Seo.

302
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,960
Xiao Xu.

303
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
Do you want to go back to your room?

304
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

305
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,560
Okay.

306
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Bruce, look.

307
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,560
The wind is so strong, why do you have to go to the top to release the fire?

308
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
The top is like a spring.

309
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,360
We just release the fire first and then tell her the truth.

310
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,960
In order to put out the fire,

311
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,760
she has to agree to whatever we say.

312
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Brother Jun.

313
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Brother Jun.

314
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Brother Jun.

315
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,560
Let me see.

316
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

317
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
Don't move.

318
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,160
Miss Fang, I'm Zhong Ning.

319
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,360
What else are you looking for?

320
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm holding something.

321
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,560
It's not convenient outside. Let me go in and talk.

322
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
for you.

323
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
After this time,

324
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
you can carry the new book

325
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,120
and go to school.

326
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Thank you, uncle.

327
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,920
Open it and see.

328
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,200
There's a surprise inside.

329
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,680
Surprise?

330
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,240
So many snacks.

331
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,480
Do you like it?

332
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,480
Yes.

333
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,520
Dongdong.

334
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,520
Go out with the police

335
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,320
for a while.

336
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
Let's chat with mom,

337
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,560
okay?

338
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Go.

339
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay.

340
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,720
Good boy.

341
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,400
Go.

342
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,400
Go.

343
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,960
Have some sugar.

344
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,600
Okay.

345
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,280
Are you used to living here?

346
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,000
It's much better than my place.

347
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
No power outage.

348
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,400
There's hot water 24 hours a day.

349
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
Every day at the restaurant,

350
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,960
the police next door

351
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,120
will send the food to the door.

352
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,800
It's good.

353
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
I haven't had the feeling

354
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,760
of living a day-to-day life for a long time.

355
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,240
I feel better.

356
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,480
Mr. Zhong,

357
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
what's the matter?

358
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,080
At the fire scene,

359
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,560
we found a photo frame.

360
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Judging from the back,

361
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,120
there should be a key here.

362
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Do you remember it?

363
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,640
There was a key in the past.

364
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,680
I carried it every day

365
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,880
and hid it.

366
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
I always thought

367
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,840
it was the key to the house of a wild woman.

368
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
But it was gone.

369
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,080
I looked for it.

370
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,440
But I never found the key again.

371
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,520
It was hidden behind the photo frame.

372
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,720
Do you remember the key's specific features?

373
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
There's a dial

374
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,760
on the back of the key.

375
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,280
There are some patterns on it.

376
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,040
What patterns?

377
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,320
Is the key so important?

378
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,320
It's important.

379
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,680
It may be an important clue

380
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,200
for the police to find the victim.

381
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,480
So please recall it.

382
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
All right.

383
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,000
Basically,

384
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,400
my parents

385
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,040
worked becomes Frados preventively,

386
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,000
which is the best evidence toMy father.

387
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,120
She showed us

388
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,480
T könntung

389
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,180
OK...

390
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,300
What's the changing word?

391
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,140
I will fall for your plan matter.

392
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,960
Zhou Ruiqi, they said that the old man you knew

393
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,120
tore your work and even admitted that he was a ghost.

394
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,920
You also said that he was your superhero. Get lost!

395
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Later, I met my superhero and became a ghost old man.

396
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,920
Let me see.

397
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Uncle Diao.

398
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,520
Has your father brought you here?

399
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I don't think so.

400
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Wow, it's back.

401
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Uncle Diao!

402
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Okay, let's go.

403
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
Help me get a bag.

404
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,120
Okay.

405
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,320
Zhang An, come here.

406
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,120
Take it.

407
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,320
Let's go.

408
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
I checked.

409
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,120
The security key in the bank

410
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,320
doesn't have a specific number.

411
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,520
Dajun, keep checking.

412
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
There are some places that have a long-term rental cabinet

413
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,520
in the gymnasium and golf courses.

414
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Okay, I'll go.

415
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
Please go to school, Luo Menghe.

416
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,320
Dr. Liao.

417
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,120
He didn't go after class.

418
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
We went to the playground this afternoon.

419
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,720
Uncle Diao, you said it.

420
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,120
This is our secret.

421
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,320
Please take the bag.

422
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Okay.

423
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I forgot.

424
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,320
Xi Xi, get in the car.

425
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,520
I'll talk to Uncle Liao.

426
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,720
Bye, Uncle Liao.

427
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
Bye.

428
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,720
It's all thanks to Xi Xi's teacher

429
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
that I became his superhero.

430
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to take you out.

431
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
Dr. Liao,

432
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Why did you suddenly come to Zhong Renxi?

433
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,320
You just remembered that

434
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
his name is Zhong Renxi?

435
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
I took a piece of his seat

436
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
to apologize to him.

437
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,600
My super hero

438
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,400
was you.

439
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,720
Do you think

440
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,920
there are super heroes in this world?

441
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,280
There must be in the child's heart.

442
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,200
Dr. Liao,

443
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,160
last time we were in the car,

444
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
we talked about children.

445
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,320
When I was just diagnosed with this disease,

446
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,880
I was very lucky

447
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,960
because I could forget about the past.

448
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
But I forgot

449
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,400
when I could still remember.

450
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,320
Then the pain

451
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,520
would be a hundred times more

452
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,840
than before.

453
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,880
Mr. Zhang,

454
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,480
if I hadn't cured Zhong Renxi's disease seven years ago,

455
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,520
what would you have lived on?

456
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,480
I insist on visiting everyone.

457
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,200
I personally attended today's case analysis meeting.

458
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,840
Because the investigation of the murder case

459
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,280
of the victim is already very important.

460
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,720
Comrades,

461
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,440
no matter how much pressure there is,

462
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,600
I don't need to say it.

463
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,400
How many people are watching us

464
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,800
in the case of the provincial capital?

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,920
This case is not broken for a day.

466
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,400
It's a difficult case.

467
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,920
Zhenggang,

468
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
report the latest situation.

469
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,720
Okay.

470
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
We interrogated Zhao Yinghong.

471
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
From the current situation we have,

472
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Zhao Yinghong's physical condition

473
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
is not capable of committing crimes.

474
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
And he didn't commit any crimes.

475
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,920
Zhao Yinghong's nanny's reaction

476
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,520
is that she hasn't left the community

477
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,640
for at least three months.

478
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,720
And there are few visitors.

479
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,040
But although Zhao Yinghong

480
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,680
doesn't have the ability to commit crimes,

481
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,880
during the time when he was in power,

482
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,440
he has cultivated a lot of new friends.

483
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,800
After we learned

484
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,560
that there is a man named Liu Renkai,

485
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,920
from Zhao Qian and Zhao Yinghong's

486
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
contrasting relationship,

487
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,960
we can't completely rule out

488
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,360
Liu Renkai's motive for the crime.

489
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,560
Ke Ran, the photo.

490
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,680
Her name is Du Hong.

491
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,400
She is Zhao Yinghong's wife.

492
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Twenty-one years ago,

493
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
she committed suicide in the old house of the Zhao family.

494
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,080
The first person who saw her

495
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,840
was Zhao Qian.

496
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,160
Did Zhao Qian find her corpse

497
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
or saw her mother's suicide?

498
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,960
We found Zhao Qian's

499
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,240
written statement.

500
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,800
She was too young

501
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,840
and was shocked.

502
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,280
So we couldn't tell.

503
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
This kind of incident

504
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,040
will definitely cause

505
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,560
a huge life injury.

506
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm bold to guess

507
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,640
that Zhao Qian put Du Hong's photo

508
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
in the room

509
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,000
and let Zhao Yinghong live in it.

510
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
It's a revenge.

511
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,320
She is torturing Zhao Yinghong

512
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,280
in this way.

513
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,520
We visited the old employee

514
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
who was fired by Lv Yingzhi.

515
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,720
They said

516
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,400
Zhao Yinghong was in power

517
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,240
and he was merciless

518
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,320
to Zhao Qian many times.

519
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
Zhao Yinghong

520
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,000
is being rude.

521
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,120
But Zhao Qian didn't think so.

522
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,760
Because after he took power,

523
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,400
he fired

524
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Zhao Yinghong's men very quickly.

525
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,000
The old employees we visited

526
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,640
were forced to

527
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
leave Lv Yingzhi.

528
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,720
When?

529
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,800
A year ago.

530
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,800
Zhao Yinghong also went to the Zhao family

531
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,440
and was in a big trouble.

532
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,280
Another thing

533
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,440
happened a year ago.

534
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,800
Qian Cheng committed suicide.

535
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
One of the old employees

536
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,320
who was fired

537
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,640
was Zhao Yinghong's driver.

538
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,800
He told us

539
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
about this.

540
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,080
Chairman.

541
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,360
I have something to tell you.

542
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,440
I regret

543
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
about the fire truck that year.

544
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,000
I admit that I was being too much.

545
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,600
But for the sake of

546
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,760
the many years I've been in Lv Ying,

547
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
can you

548
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,120
make up for it?

549
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,400
Qian Tong.

550
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,920
People who are greedy

551
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,640
will make mistakes.

552
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
But you made such a low-level mistake

553
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,440
in Lv Ying.

554
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
You must pay for it.

555
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
No one can help you.

556
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,560
Chairman.

557
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,760
There must be a reason.

558
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
Do it well.

559
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,760
It's Zhao Qian.

560
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,960
He tried to pull me down.

561
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,880
Chairman.

562
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,320
I'm telling the truth.

563
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,720
Chairman.

564
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,800
I have evidence.

565
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,480
The ambulance?

566
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,440
Five years ago,

567
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,360
Lv Yingzhi donated a batch of ambulance

568
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,120
to the hospital.

569
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
But the car

570
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
had problems

571
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,840
in terms of quality.

572
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
Especially the emergency equipment

573
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,000
and many other things.

574
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
The person who bought the ambulance

575
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,160
was Qian Cheng.

576
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,520
Then why did Zhao Qian get involved?

577
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,840
We found that

578
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,520
many things that Qian Cheng did in Lv Ying

579
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,560
were probably

580
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,640
ordered by Zhao Qian.

581
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,560
If that's the case,

582
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,600
Qian Cheng

583
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,800
is Zhao Qian's scapegoat.

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Scapegoat.

585
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,920
It reminds me of Yang You Mo.

586
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes.

587
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,400
Are there any clues?

588
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,520
That's actually

589
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,080
the case that we encountered this time.

590
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
The clues are too complex

591
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,920
and involve many people.

592
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,240
But we've

593
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,960
been working on it every day.

594
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,880
Comrades.

595
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
The pressure is great.

596
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,840
But we must be more motivated.

597
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Think about these innocent victims.

598
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Think about the people of the whole of Hong Kong.

599
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
This is not a scene.

600
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
This is the duty of our police.

601
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Understood.

602
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Yes.

603
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
The police came to you today.

604
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
What did they ask?

605
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
What did they ask you?

606
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Say something!

607
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Let him come alone.

608
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Get out!

609
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Get out!

610
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Dad.

611
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
You taught me this.

612
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
What do you want?

613
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
You have to fight for it yourself.

614
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
The cause of the ambulance accident is now basically known.

615
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,840
The ambulance was donated by the famous company in Hong Kong, Lv Yun Zhi.

616
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,840
The ambulance must race with the dead god to save the lives of the patients.

617
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,840
If something goes wrong, the patient is not safe.

618
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,840
He is thousands of miles away and is in a coma.

619
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Who is responsible for this safety issue?

620
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,840
One or a group of people?

621
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Zhao Qian.

622
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
This reporter will continue to pay attention.

623
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Zhao Qian.

624
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Zhao Qian!

625
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Tell me.

626
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
What's wrong with the ambulance?

627
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Qian Cheng said it had something to do with you.

628
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Take the drugs.

629
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Qian Qian.

630
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
If you lie to me,

631
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
you will be punished.

632
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Good.

633
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Give Qian Cheng here.

634
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I will push him to the side.

635
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm afraid you won't see him.

636
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
What do you mean?

637
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
At this time,

638
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,840
he should almost kill himself.

639
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Since things can't be hidden,

640
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,840
he is only worthy of being a little rabbit.

641
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
You give him to me.

642
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I'm not afraid of him.

643
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Dad.

644
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Qian Cheng killed himself.

645
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
You taught me this.

646
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
You should be strong.

647
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Give me the drugs.

648
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Give me the drugs.

649
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Yes.

650
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Yes.

651
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Do you want this?

652
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
What do you want?

653
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
You want to fight for it yourself.

654
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,840
This is what you taught me when I was a kid.

655
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,840
I should turn around.

656
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
I'm sorry.

657
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
I'm sorry.

658
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
I'm sorry.

659
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
I'm sorry.

660
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm sorry.

661
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm sorry.

662
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
I'm sorry.

665
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I'm sorry.

669
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I'm sorry.

670
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm sorry.

671
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I'm sorry.

672
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm sorry.

673
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm sorry.

674
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
I'm sorry.

675
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm sorry.

676
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I'm sorry.

679
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm sorry.

680
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
I'm sorry.

681
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
I'm sorry.

686
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
I'm sorry.
