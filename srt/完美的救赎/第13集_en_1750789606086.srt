1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Kin

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,660
Excluding these parties

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,000
ors are Lv Renkai, the deputy manager

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,540
whoolan enforcement demands

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,040
the investigation of vanished car and window cases

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,440
Liu Rikai is involved in several major criminal cases.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,880
Currently, the police are investigating

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,040
and searching for the missing person who brought the case.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
Go.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,040
We have already got the evidence of Zhao Qian's crime.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,640
You can continue to remain silent.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Once Zhao Qian enters the guardhouse,

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
he will surely take care of everything first.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,440
And he will push everything towards you.

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,040
You know Zhao Qian better than we do.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,240
Whether he will do this or not, you know it better than anyone else.

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
I can also tell you

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
that we have already caught Long.

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,240
You think that

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,240
you can escape from the crime of killing and setting fire to people?

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
You think we can't do anything about you, right?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Proof of evidence, evidence of false evidence,

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
and also Long's testimony.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
What testimony?

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,240
You want to know what he said.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Think about what you have done.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,840
Liu Rikai, I'm telling you, you don't have many chances.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,240
If you can find out a minute earlier,

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,240
we can find a minute earlier to ensure their safety.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
It's Zhao Qian.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Everything

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
was done by him.

33
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Zhao Qian.

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Zhao Qian.

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Zhao Qian.

36
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Zhao Qian.

37
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Zhao Qian.

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Zhao Qian.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Zhao Qian.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Zhao Qian.

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Zhao Qian.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Zhao Qian.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Zhao Qian.

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Zhao Qian.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Zhao Qian.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Zhao Qian.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Zhao Qian.

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Ms. Zhao,

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
to see you, I'm still going inside the hospital.

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
I'm going to ask the surgeon to give me a heavy Product Launch metaphotti.

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,980
I will be a witness to Li Donen.

52
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,280
Kill him.

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,420
Kill him.

54
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,020
Where is Liu Zeyu?

55
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,760
It's not roasted pork.

56
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,080
It's chopped evo.

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,120
Are you afraid that I will get her like this?

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,560
Would she be responsible?

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,020
Tortured me

60
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,680
for torturing Lv Yun

61
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,400
for torturing Xinggang Lu...

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:00,360
do you have to be faithful to

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
my husband?

64
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
You didn't read it,

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
did you?

66
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,180
It actually depends.

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,680
But really,

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,320
I can't let you go.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,280
I won't let you go.

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,480
I won't let you go.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm drunk.

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm drunk.

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,480
Can this be used as evidence?

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,080
Will the judge believe it after he goes to court?

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
He knows the law.

76
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Knowing the law is a good thing.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,080
He's afraid that he'll be a nag.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,080
You're right.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,280
This video can't be used as evidence.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
But with the fact that you admitted it,

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,480
it's different.

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Luo Li Juan,

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I made Yang You Mo die.

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,080
And your grandson Tong Tong.

85
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,680
It's his own bad luck.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh, right.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,880
And Yang Yan.

88
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,680
I chose the place beforehand.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,080
I taught him to use the Xun Xun and make a copy.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Play it again.

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,480
He forced me to say it.

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I said it in anger.

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
You can't count it.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,280
If you say you can't count it, then you can't count it.

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Taoyuan Mountain Resort.

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,280
And that mother's diary.

97
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,680
We've investigated it.

98
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,680
Can you sit here just with a recording?

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,880
It's all you've done.

100
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,280
There are traces that can't be erased in this world.

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Tragedy.

102
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,080
You want to frame me, right?

103
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,480
You want to destroy me and Lv Yun.

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
I won't talk to you.

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,480
I want to see a lawyer.

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,880
Li Xiang has confessed.

107
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,080
That day in Fang Qin Chun's house,

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,280
you set the fire.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes.

110
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,880
The key that was hidden behind the frame,

111
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
you found it too.

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,680
Then you sent Ah Xiang to the storage of the amusement park

113
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,080
to take away what was left in the front.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
Is that it?

115
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,880
Where is it?

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
Sorry, I don't know.

117
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,480
That thing

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,280
was kept by Qian Chen with a new eye.

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
It's all evidence of Zhao Qian's crime.

120
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,280
What evidence?

121
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Where is the thing?

122
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
You want to know?

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Liu Ren Kai, you better be honest.

124
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm honest.

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Tonight,

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,880
I want to ask you to help me.

127
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,480
Say it.

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,080
I want to see Xu Li Na and my son.

129
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
Ah Long said

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,280
she hid Xu Li Na and your son

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
in her hometown.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
But later, Xu Li Na was so scared

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,280
that she took your son and don't know where she hid him.

134
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,080
I want to see my son.

135
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Before I see my son,

136
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,280
I won't say anything.

137
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Liu Ren Kai,

138
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,280
you have to be content.

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
You have to thank me for my body.

140
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,480
If you really kill me,

141
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,480
you won't see your son again.

142
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,280
So give yourself a chance.

143
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,680
If you have a big contribution,

144
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
you can handle it.

145
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
I want to see my son.

146
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Are you okay?

147
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,480
No need to help me.

148
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
What's the matter?

149
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
What are you saying?

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
If you fall again,

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,080
it's not our team that will be dragged.

152
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Your team?

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
You are the captain?

154
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Your captain.

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Your captain, Si Ya's captain.

156
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
Let's talk about business.

157
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,080
It's the same as what Master said before.

158
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
The final result is still Liu Ren Kai's case.

159
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm still happy.

160
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,480
We are on Liu Ren Kai's heart.

161
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
We have to find Xu Li Na's mother as soon as possible.

162
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Not only for the evidence,

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,080
but also for the safety of their mother.

164
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,680
Will the evidence be hidden in Xu Li Na's place?

165
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,480
If that's the case, we have to hurry up.

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,280
Because it's possible that we won't be the only ones looking for it.

167
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Yes.

168
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,480
And Zhao Qian, you have to send her to the infirmary as soon as possible.

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay.

170
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
I don't care what you do.

171
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
No matter how much it costs,

172
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
get me out of here.

173
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,480
Mr. Zhao, listen to me.

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
Calm down first.

175
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Please tell me first

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,080
if you have ever been involved in this.

177
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,680
I have never been involved in anything.

178
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
It's all their fault.

179
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
It's all planned.

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
I'll say it again.

181
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,280
Get me out of here.

182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
I don't want to be involved in anything.

183
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I don't want to be involved in anything.

184
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I don't want to be involved in anything.

185
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I don't want to be involved in anything.

186
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,480
Get me out of here.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
This kind of place is not for people like me to stay.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,280
Do you understand?

189
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Okay, I understand.

190
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,280
Mr. Zhao said that it's better to die than to live in there.

191
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,680
Chairman, you have to do something.

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
Even if you don't consider Mr. Zhao,

193
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
but Lv Yun can't stand this kind of torture.

194
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
If this continues,

195
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
it will collapse.

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,280
You have to be the backbone of Lv Yun.

197
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Chairman, I just got asked by the police.

198
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
There is something...

199
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,080
Shen Yi, take Mr. Wang to avoid it.

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Okay.

201
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
Chairman, I'll go first.

202
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
I have something to do.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,480
There is a container in theorgan poi.

204
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,680
It's used to squandering people's property.

205
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,280
I hope they don't take it,

206
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,680
don't resid it or barricade anything.

207
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
Why aren't they spatulaing the container off the sink?

208
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,080
Maybe they know that the container is here.

209
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
This container is called moneyah.

210
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Is there anything in this container?

211
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Get out!

212
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,680
By the way, Mr. Zhao said

213
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,080
we must find Liu Renkai's father and son.

214
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Could it be that they have the thing?

215
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,680
Liu Renkai hid the father and son.

216
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,280
Is he just a man?

217
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
There must be something more important.

218
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Mr. Zhao must think so.

219
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
What did you say?

222
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Chairman.

223
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
You don't hate Mr. Zhao at all?

224
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
I'm sorry, Chairman.

225
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,480
I'm the one who is wrong.

226
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Captain Zheng.

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,280
We found their hiding place.

229
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Okay.

230
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Bring them to the police station.

231
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Roger.

232
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Bye.

233
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
How is it?

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
I asked the neighbor.

235
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
That woman and her child took a car and left.

236
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,240
How long?

237
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Just left.

238
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
Do you know who this is?

239
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,400
Mr. Zhao's father.

240
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Mr. Zhao Yinghong, the chairman of Weiyun.

241
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Chairman.

242
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
Why are you looking for me?

243
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't be afraid.

244
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Chairman knows that Liu Renkai left something for you.

245
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,240
That thing is more harmful than you.

246
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
He?

247
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,680
He didn't leave anything for me.

248
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Tell me.

249
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,520
How much do you want?

250
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
He didn't give me anything.

251
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I don't know.

252
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,520
It's useless no matter how much you give me.

253
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,000
Xu Li Na, don't you understand?

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Your back is down.

255
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,840
If you tell the truth,

256
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,400
I think I can be your back.

257
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,680
As long as you tell me where Liu Renkai left the thing,

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
I can make you rich.

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,680
Not yet?

260
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Less than two months.

261
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,080
You said you wouldn't take the car.

262
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
There's a police car.

263
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:17,680
She wasn't going to do anything

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,480
No, I got into the car on my own.

265
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,640
I want to ask them to help me save Liu Ren Kai.

266
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,280
We need you to come with us to receive the investigation.

267
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

268
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,920
Liu Ren Kai, do you recognize us?

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Who are they?

270
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
What? Why are you so arrogant when you're here?

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,560
We're the broken-down people in your casino.

272
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,600
They said you made the fish.

273
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,800
The broken-down people in the casino?

274
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Do you want me to make the fish?

275
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
Is Mr. Zhao sleeping well?

276
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,000
Nonsense.

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Go to the headquarters and try it.

278
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,000
This is the condition of the police station.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,760
You have to get used to it.

280
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,720
From now on...

281
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,760
Explain Zhang Xiaoyun's situation.

282
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,280
Again?

283
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
I'll say it again.

284
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800
He framed me.

285
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
The place is yours.

286
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,080
Zhang Xiaoyun only recognized you.

287
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,960
Tell me how he framed you.

288
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,360
He framed me.

289
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,040
Do you understand?

290
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,960
I don't recognize him.

291
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
Say it.

292
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
Okay.

293
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,120
What happened?

294
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,240
Zhao Qian and Zhang Xiaoyun.

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,840
The position of the witness was a surveillance camera.

296
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
There's a car beside it.

297
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,360
The car's traffic record.

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,440
They recorded the whole process.

299
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,040
Zhao Qian didn't lie.

300
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,080
He didn't kill Zhang Xiaoyun.

301
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
It's not that Zhao Qian wants to kill you.

302
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
It's not that Zhao Qian wants to kill you.

303
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
He's not the one who killed you.

304
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,520
It's not that Zhao Qian wants to kill you.

305
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,560
You want to die, right?

306
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,880
Tell me.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,960
What's the point of me living?

308
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Sheng Chuyao and You Mo are animals.

309
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,040
Is it okay to be scolded

310
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,240
and beaten up?

311
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
If I die,

312
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,960
I'll be a proof that the bad guys are being punished.

313
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,520
It's worth it.

314
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,160
Mrs. Zhang.

315
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,480
Who taught you

316
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,760
these things?

317
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,440
No one.

318
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,760
It's me.

319
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,120
How did you use that kind of hidden earmuffs

320
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,400
and installed a remote recording device at home?

321
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
Xiao Dadao did live streaming.

322
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,840
He taught me.

323
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,000
Mrs. Zhang, to be honest,

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
there must be someone behind me.

325
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
There's someone behind Wang Qingsheng too.

326
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
And the target is Zhao Qian.

327
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
Evidence.

328
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,160
What we need most now is useful evidence.

329
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Liu Renkai was beaten up at the police station.

330
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Xu Li Na...

331
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Xu Li Na said Liu Renkai didn't leave any evidence for her.

332
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,560
When she found Xu Li Na,

333
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,360
she was in Zhao Yinghong's car.

334
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
Right.

335
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,160
Zhejiang Police Station

336
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,560
Chairman.

337
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,960
You sent them to pick you up.

338
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,160
Today's director of the Liyun Group needs you to meet them.

339
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
They only know about the money.

340
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,160
You must take care of yourself too.

341
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Hello, Chairman.

342
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,560
I've checked the documents.

343
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,560
We came to see you today

344
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
to confirm something with you.

345
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,960
You brought someone to find Xu Li Na.

346
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
What do you want?

347
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
Is this question funny?

348
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,360
You asked her?

349
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
Ask her.

350
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,160
She got in your Liyun Chairman's car.

351
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
What would she say?

352
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
What would she say?

353
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,160
But we know what you want.

354
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Because of what Qian Cheng left behind, right?

355
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
Chairman Zhao,

356
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,760
you know what Zhao Qian did.

357
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,360
You can't save her.

358
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Actually,

359
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,160
you raised her like this.

360
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
I asked her classmates and teachers.

361
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
Before her mother died...

362
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,960
Get lost.

363
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,560
What kind of soil and seeds

364
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,160
will be exposed?

365
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,960
What happened in the Zhao family's ancestral house

366
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
is the soil you gave Zhao Qian.

367
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,360
And the seeds

368
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
are you.

369
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,360
If you still want to use illegal means to help Zhao Qian,

370
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
you will only make Zhao Qian the best.

371
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
In the end,

372
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
even you can't have a family.

373
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Why are you here?

374
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
What's wrong?

375
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Qin Chuning,

376
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,560
Who gave him the necklace?

377
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,720
When did he change it?

378
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,400
Liu Renkai

379
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
Did Liu Renkai come here recently?

380
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
I guess

381
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,120
this is the evidence left by Qian Cheng.

382
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,080
Liu Renkai

383
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,600
How did you find it?

384
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
You changed the necklace.

385
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,360
I have good memory.

386
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,400
Good.

387
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,640
The dog you raised in the casino

388
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
is the old dog, right?

389
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,880
Yes.

390
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,920
Zhao Yinghong sent it back.

391
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,160
What do you think?

392
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,680
You hid the evidence in the necklace of the dog?

393
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,360
Because they always

394
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
treat me as a dog.

395
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,720
When I was hiding the evidence, I thought

396
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
if one day

397
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,640
something that would kill me would be exposed,

398
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,840
the dog that would be his

399
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
would be the most obedient dog around him.

400
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,720
Sister,

401
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,480
this is Zhao Qian's life.

402
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,560
I will make you

403
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,080
never be able to move again.

404
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,920
You are using your power by your own will, right?

405
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,080
You made me and 20 women

406
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,680
sleep in the hall every day.

407
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,920
Zhang Qiaoyun's case has been investigated.

408
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,120
Why didn't you let me go?

409
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
Look at this.

410
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,800
How did I know?

411
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
This SD card

412
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,240
has a lot of content.

413
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Look.

414
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,400
This is part of the content.

415
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,040
Internal bribery,

416
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,320
manipulation of equity,

417
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,360
and

418
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,280
the problem rescue car

419
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,160
that came to sell it.

420
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
I don't know what you are talking about.

421
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,840
If you don't know, let me remind you.

422
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,480
Liu Renkai

423
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,560
is the one who threatened you with these contents.

424
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,920
Do you know now?

425
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,080
Can you believe what he said?

426
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,600
It's a fake.

427
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,760
I don't admit it.

428
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
You can deny everything.

429
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
But let me tell you.

430
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
The complete evidence chain

431
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,560
will reveal everything

432
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
that Zhao Qian did.

433
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Before Qian Chun committed suicide,

434
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
he went to your office to drink.

435
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm not afraid.

436
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I'll reveal the past.

437
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,120
Corruption, internal bribery.

438
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,760
You did all these.

439
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,760
You designed me.

440
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,480
I'm just protecting myself.

441
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,240
Just based on these photos?

442
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,560
Zhao Qian.

443
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,760
If these things are exposed,

444
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,920
you'll be in trouble.

445
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,360
Just wait for the day when I die.

446
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
While controlling Qian Cheng,

447
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,840
you used the same method

448
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,440
to control Yang Youmu.

449
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
We are in a normal relationship.

450
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
There's nothing to control.

451
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,520
Normal relationship?

452
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,240
He killed his wife and child

453
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,200
because of your so-called normal relationship.

454
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,960
Isn't that your wish?

455
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,920
Zhao Qian.

456
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,440
This is Luo Lijuan's diary.

457
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The last page of this diary was torn.

458
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,720
But we used technical means

459
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,120
to restore the last page.

460
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,960
It's confirmed that

461
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,560
this is Luo Lijuan's handwriting.

462
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,680
This is the last page of the diary

463
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
that Luo Lijuan wrote when he was awake.

464
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,560
He said in the diary

465
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,400
that you and Yang Youmu

466
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
wanted to kill him.

467
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,640
Why do you think

468
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,280
what he wrote was true?

469
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,800
In order to investigate Qian Cheng,

470
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,400
Fang Qingchun found a private detective to follow you.

471
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,760
He recorded a scene

472
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
where you and Yang Youmu

473
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,840
forced Luo Lijuan to make a video.

474
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,040
This video

475
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,160
proves that

476
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,600
the diary is real.

477
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
From the beginning,

478
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,000
you knew that Yang Youmu had a wife.

479
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,040
He had a happy family.

480
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
Thank you for coming.

481
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,040
Thank you for your attention.

482
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,880
I also want to thank someone

483
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,680
who is my wife.

484
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,520
She is the most important person to me.

485
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,560
You have never experienced

486
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
the happiness of Yang Youmu's family.

487
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,560
You will think that Yang Youmu's love is fake.

488
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,000
So you want to expose him.

489
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,920
Because in your world,

490
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
everything can be controlled.

491
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,400
And you

492
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,760
especially enjoy the pleasure of controlling others' fate.

493
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,320
You use the resources around you

494
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,160
to realize Yang Youmu's will.

495
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
Step by step,

496
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,640
step by step,

497
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,840
you will make him lose

498
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,680
the power you created for him.

499
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,560
I hope you can support him to run the art exhibition.

500
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,760
Hello.

501
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,720
Hello.

502
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,560
So you will control Yang Youmu step by step

503
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,640
until he is completely in control of the palm.

504
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,600
Then you gradually sort him out

505
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,600
and let him change his ways.

506
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
You make him think that

507
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,760
Luo Lijuan and Yang Yan

508
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,600
are obstacles between you.

509
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,600
In the end,

510
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,280
you seduce Yang Youmu

511
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,720
and kill his wife and child.

512
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
I just took the original skin off him.

513
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh.

514
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,920
What kind of skin?

515
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,040
Guess.

516
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,520
Since he is living in such a painful life,

517
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,320
why don't you go and free him?

518
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,680
Actually, I always care about him.

519
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,880
His mother is gone.

520
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,040
Sometimes, when I look at him,

521
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,160
I feel like I'm his mother.

522
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,920
But I can't raise a child.

523
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,880
Youmu.

524
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,320
Do I look like

525
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,560
someone who can raise a child?

526
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,600
Look.

527
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,840
Does Yang Yan look like a rabbit?

528
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
Does he?

529
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,640
Do you want to raise a rabbit?

530
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,800
Yes.

531
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,880
Do you want to raise a rabbit?

532
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,080
Are you happy?

533
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,120
Are you happy?

534
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:59,240
Saying those words

535
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,800
is quite life-threatening.

536
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,640
Please don't think

537
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,520
that it's something to be afraid of.

538
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,000
You're good at making up stories.

539
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,280
Why do you have to make up stories?

540
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,560
Is it because of your imagination?

541
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,880
I can see

542
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,000
what you said to Xiao Da.

543
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,200
If he didn't give me a hint

544
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,400
that only Luo Li Juan, Tong Tong and Yang Ye

545
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,120
would never marry me

546
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,400
as long as they were here,

547
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
if he didn't say that,

548
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,800
how could I have done it?

549
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,440
How could I have done it?

550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,440
Xiao Da wanted to make a profit by using the video.

551
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,160
But he didn't expect

552
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,040
to risk his life.

553
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,040
Liu Ren Kai has confessed.

554
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,400
It was you who told Liu Ren Kai

555
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,160
to kill Xiao Da.

556
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,000
That was Liu Ren Kai's words.

557
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,760
In order to get rid of himself,

558
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
he could have said anything.

559
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,040
I could have said it.

560
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,480
Do you believe it?

561
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Zhao Qian.

562
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,600
Your only way out

563
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,040
is to confess

564
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,400
and try to make it bigger.

565
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,920
What do I have to confess?

566
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
I've said

567
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
everything I should.

568
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,360
There's no point in arguing.

569
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,560
The law will give you a fair conclusion.

570
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,640
But

571
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,960
before the verdict comes out,

572
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
you need to change your mind.

573
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,200
The police

574
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,520
won't let you down.

575
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,760
Since you've got your reason,

576
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
you'll have to change your mind.

577
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,480
I end my slip of the tongue.

578
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,040
Please don't blame me.

579
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,240
I won't blame you anymore.

580
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
I won't blame you.

581
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,680
I won't.

582
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,980
I won't.

583
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
Seriously...

584
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,760
I won't blame you anymore.

585
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,960
I dare not go.

586
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,280
Let me see Mr. Zhao.

587
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,840
You can choose not to wait.

588
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
You ask me out?

589
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,480
Of course I have time.

590
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,000
Mr. Zhao.

591
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,360
Mr. Zhao.

592
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
I'm Liu Zhenkai from Security Department.

593
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,840
I was working under Mr. Zhao.

594
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,640
The chairman is in the hospital.

595
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
Go to the hospital to accompany him.

596
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm going. They won't let me see him.

597
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,600
They?

598
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,120
Who are they?

599
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,760
I don't know.

600
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,840
Mr. Zhao.

601
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,600
This is the prescription I asked Mr. Zhao for.

602
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,640
It's said that it's too small for the stroke.

603
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,360
The prescription you gave my dad?

604
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,800
You came to cure the disease

605
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,760
and give him the prescription?

606
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,000
You want to split me into two?

607
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
Xiaochun.

608
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,680
I fly with my mouth.

609
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
ГMON

610
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,280
Why did you say yes?

611
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,240
Such an old thing is useless.

612
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,800
It should be throwed away.

613
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm not talking.

614
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Worrying about something?

615
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,720
Can you afford to worry about it?

616
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,920
If you still want to eat meat here,

617
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
then be a good dog hunter.

618
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,840
Find me the prey.

619
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,840
It's better to be a toy.

620
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
At least it won't bite people.

621
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,920
Evidence can be divided.

622
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,240
People don't want to...

623
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'll be waiting for you.

624
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
I'll be waiting for you.

625
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
I'll be waiting for you.

626
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,560
You missed us so soon?

627
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
What's up?

628
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,560
I killed someone.

629
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Qian Cheng.

630
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
Wei Qi Wei.

631
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
I'm not anyone's dream.

632
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,080
But now I realize...

633
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
I'm no different from a dream.

634
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,280
Killing Qian Cheng...

635
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,080
was Zhao Xin's doing.

636
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,280
I have evidence.

637
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Where is the evidence?

638
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
It's in Ju Yina's house.

639
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,480
So you ran away to her house...

640
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,680
to get the evidence?

641
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I'm not a ghost.

642
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
I'm a ghost.

643
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
This evidence...

644
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
is the poison I and Zhao Qian...

645
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
used to kill Yu Jing.

646
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I said I'd come.

647
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
Zhao Qian couldn't run away.

648
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
I killed another person.

649
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm still a dead man.

650
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
I don't care.

651
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
Then...

652
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
you suddenly realized.

653
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
My son...

654
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I hope my son is safe.

655
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
But Zhao Qian is not.

656
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,080
My son is in danger.

657
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,680
This is the only thing I can do for my son.

658
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
As long as Li Da greenhouse is opened...

659
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
in this room...

660
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,360
today for Asakura to be able toUP too.

661
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,000
So?

662
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
I think this is it.

663
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:30,000
We have asked you before how Qian Cheng died.

664
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You told us that he committed suicide.

665
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Right? I'll ask you again.

666
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Did Qian Cheng commit suicide?

667
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes.

668
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes.

669
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,200
Last time I saw you, I thought you were a real man.

670
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500
Director Zhao, I'm also dead.

671
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,200
Really?

672
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,000
Then give me a life-saving shot. Let me see.

673
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,000
Director Zhao, can you stop killing people?

674
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,100
Killing people is illegal.

675
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,600
But what if you don't get caught?

676
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,300
Do you think someone like Qian Cheng

677
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,000
could commit suicide?

678
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,400
Suicide?

679
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,000
Anyone who is forced to do anything

680
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and find his weakness, and try to force him

681
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,700
to commit suicide, is it hard?

682
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,800
It's not hard.

683
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,200
Then will Qian Cheng commit suicide tomorrow night?

684
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,800
Yes.

685
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,600
Director Zhao, get in.

686
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,000
Where are you going?

687
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,000
Because that woman is scared to death,

688
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
she will never go back to hell.

689
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,900
And I wanted to say that

690
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,200
Qian Cheng will die if she doesn't go back to hell.

691
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,440
I don't want to hear from you anymore.

692
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
forced Qian Chen to hang himself.

693
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
He told you?

694
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
My hands are clean.

695
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
I didn't do anything.

696
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
My hands

697
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
didn't have any blood on them.

698
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
You can't treat me like this.

699
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
I didn't do anything.

700
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
You can't treat me like this.

701
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
You can't treat me like this.

702
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
You can't treat me like this.

703
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
I don't want to see you.

704
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I don't want to see you.

705
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Zhong Ning.

706
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
I want to make a deal with you.

707
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
What deal?

708
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
You've been investigating for so long.

709
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
You've been investigating for so long.

710
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
You've been investigating for so long.

711
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
You destroyed this.

712
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I'll tell you his name.

713
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Liao Boyan.

714
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
You know everything?

715
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I know why you didn't catch him.

716
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Why did you catch me?

717
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Why did you catch me?

718
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
You're playing with me.

719
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
No.

720
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
You said you'd show me some respect.

721
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I know that

722
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
you want to cover Liao Boyan

723
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
because he saved your daughter's life.

724
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I've seen how Zhong Ren Xi wrote his work.

725
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
He's a superhero.

726
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
He's our compatriot.

727
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
He's our compatriot.

728
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,760
Kenshi!

729
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,280
All just wanna play did you?

730
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,200
I have a request.

732
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,880
Can you

733
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,840
change the environment for me?

734
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,920
I don't want to eat at the police station anymore.

735
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,240
I don't want to sleep in the same bed with 20 other women.

736
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,240
Because I'm Zhao Qian.

737
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,120
Qian.

738
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,720
Zhao Qian.

739
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,800
Compared to what you've done,

740
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,760
what you've been through

741
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,160
is not a punishment.

742
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Episode 16

743
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,080
Did you think about

744
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,400
the person behind the scenes

745
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,760
and not find the other target?

746
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,680
Mr. Zhong.

747
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,360
I've checked according to what you said.

748
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,560
Liao Yifan's death

749
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,160
has nothing to do with that ambulance.

750
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,920
Tell me more.

751
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,040
I've found the person

752
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
who was in that ambulance.

753
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,440
It proves that the car Liao Yifan was in

754
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,080
was not donated by Liyun Group.

755
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,280
Because that's an old car.

756
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,160
And

757
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,280
Liao Yifan didn't die in the ambulance.

758
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,920
He died in the operating room.

759
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,600
So

760
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,560
Liao Boyan didn't kill Zhao Qian.

761
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,040
Did we make a mistake?

762
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,840
Liao Boyan has nothing to do with the kidney-related case.

763
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,800
And he has Alzheimer's disease.

764
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,680
In this case,

765
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,080
it isobyclear.

766
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,640
Does it really matter?

767
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm sorry.

768
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
I'm sorry.

769
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
I'm sorry.

770
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
I'm sorry.

771
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
I'm sorry.

772
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
I'm sorry.

773
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,040
I'm sorry.

774
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
I'm sorry.

775
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
I'm sorry.

776
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
I'm sorry.

777
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
I'm sorry.

778
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
I'm sorry.

779
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,040
I'm sorry.

780
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
I'm sorry.

781
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,040
I'm sorry.

782
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,040
I'm sorry.

783
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,040
I'm sorry.

784
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm sorry.

785
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
I'm sorry.

786
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
I'm sorry.

787
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
I'm sorry.

788
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
I'm sorry.

789
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,040
I'm sorry.

790
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,040

I'm sorry.

792
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
I'm sorry.

793
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,040

I'm sorry.

795
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
