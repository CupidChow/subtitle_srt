00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
cesarean

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hurry up!

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

4
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
What are you doing?

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,800
What are you doing? My car is dirty!

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
This is very expensive. Take me home.

7
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up! Go!

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Take me home! Hurry up and drive!

9
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
The Legend of Chusen

10
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Episode 18

11
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Tidy up the clues and get ready for the meeting.

12
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Yes.

13
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,400
Tidy up the clues and get ready for the meeting.

14
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes.

15
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Hurry up and get ready for the meeting.

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Yes.

17
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Brother.

18
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What did you two say just now?

19
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,520
Have you finished asking him on the phone?

20
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
Where am I going?

21
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,440
Master, phone.

22
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Someone is calling Yang Mo.

23
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Hush. Be quiet.

24
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,360
Don't answer. Hurry and find the location.

25
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,640
Don't make a sound. Call him.

26
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
Hello?

27
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Is the location locked?

28
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,040
Locked.

29
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,600
The location shows that he entered this Li Pan's mansion.

30
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,840
Zhao Qian's house?

31
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Open the door! Open the door!

32
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
Director Zhao.

33
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,160
Police.

34
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
Let's go.

35
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
Ask her to come out.

36
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,600
Zhao Qian! We are police officers. Please wear your clothes and come out.

37
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,660
Have a seat.

38
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,660
I eventually decided toade Big symmetric kid

39
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,480
to set us as tra accountants

40
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:46,620
and give him easy-put-up

41
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm not a friend of Yan You Mo.

42
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,620
What's your relationship with Yan You Mo?

43
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,020
Just an ordinary friend.

44
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Jing Chu,

45
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,420
I was kidnapped.

46
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,220
Someone wants to kill me.

47
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,020
Tell us about the incident.

48
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
That day,

49
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,220
I went fishing with a big client of Lv Yun.

50
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,220
Then the client left.

51
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,820
When I was about to leave,

52
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,020
someone attacked me from behind.

53
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,820
When I woke up,

54
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,220
I was kidnapped.

55
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,020
Something was covering my eyes.

56
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,220
I didn't know where I was.

57
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,820
Then why did you know Yan You Mo

58
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,620
when we mentioned the murder?

59
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,220
Because I was the one

60
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
who called him that day.

61
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,420
Who are you?

62
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Why did you help me?

63
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,420
Who are you?

64
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Where am I?

65
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,620
The man who helped me

66
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,820
forced me to call Yan You Mo.

67
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
If he calls the police

68
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,220
or doesn't listen to his orders,

69
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
I will die.

70
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,020
Tell us.

71
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,620
Yan You Mo,

72
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
listen to me.

73
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,820
I'm going to give you the first order.

74
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,820
Drive the car to the highway.

75
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,420
Then drive the window down.

76
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Drive to 154 kilometers.

77
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,420
Then take a picture of it

78
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
on the display.

79
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,020
Take a picture of 154?

80
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,820
I will die.

81
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,020
If you don't do that,

82
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,620
I will die now.

83
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,420
Hello, I got it.

84
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,220
Tell him to delete the photo.

85
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,820
You are the one who did it.

86
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Delete it.

87
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,420
Delete this photo now.

88
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
Delete it?

89
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
He forced me to take it.

90
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,820
I almost died for the photo.

91
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,620
Who is he?

92
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,420
I will kill him.

93
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,020
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,620
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,020
I shouldn't have been angry.

96
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,420
You Mo, listen to me.

97
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,620
Okay.

98
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,620
Now is the second order.

99
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
The construction site and the trash can.

100
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
There is a red plastic bag.

101
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,220
There is a high-level machine inside.

102
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,220
You put it on your hand.

103
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,820
Then...

104
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Then climb to the tower.

105
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,220
Climb to 92 meters.

106
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Why is it 92 meters?

107
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,220
I don't know.

108
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,820
Yang You Mo

109
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
also asked me the same question.

110
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,620
Why is it 92 meters?

111
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,020
Why?

112
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,220
Because climbing to 92 meters

113
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,820
will end the game.

114
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,420
I don't know what will happen next.

115
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Because he injected me with medicine.

116
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,820
I was unconscious again.

117
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,220
When I woke up,

118
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,820
I was already in the trash field.

119
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,220
About the body and cat characteristics of the person who did the crime,

120
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
do you have anything

121
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,620
to provide us with information?

122
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,820
No.

123
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,420
After you got out of the case,

124
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,020
why didn't you call the police immediately?

125
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,620
I want to go back.

126
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
I want to be willing to kill myself.

127
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,020
I want to wash myself clean.

128
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Because you can't experience

129
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,820
a person who climbed out of a rotten,

130
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,620
rotten, and smelly garbage pile.

131
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,420
For a person with a disability,

132
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,020
what does it mean?

133
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,220
Do you think why the criminal

134
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,020
mentioned 154 kilometers to Yang You Mo

135
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,020
and 92 meters?

136
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,420
I don't know.

137
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,420
I'll say whatever he wants me to say.

138
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,020
I really don't know

139
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,820
if he will die after climbing up.

140
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Zhao Qian.

141
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Calm down.

142
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,420
The question I want to ask you is very important.

143
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,820
It's about

144
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,220
whether we can find the suspect as soon as possible.

145
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,220
Did you ever offend anyone before?

146
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,620
Or

147
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,420
did you have any problems with anyone?

148
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,820
No.

149
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
No?

150
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
No.

151
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Then,

152
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,420
where is Yang You Mo?

153
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,220
I don't know.

154
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,420
Are you and Yang You Mo

155
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
just friends?

156
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
Yes.

157
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,020
I don't even have the right to go to your office

158
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,020
and have a cup of tea.

159
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,820
I've been very busy lately, Master.

160
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Busy?

161
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,820
Busy with online virtual killers?

162
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Busy with private investigations to cause trouble for Zheng Gang?

163
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
Tell me.

164
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,220
Why are you so concerned about Yang You Mo's case?

165
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,820
I have no time to give you a hard time.

166
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,820
The case has made a major breakthrough.

167
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,220
Zheng Gang is recording a statement.

168
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,220
I didn't expect

169
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,420
that he would even get involved in this.

170
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Thisâ¦

171
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,580
That

172
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
woman

173
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,880
left me here forever.

174
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
What are you talking about?

175
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,220
What do you mean?

176
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,900
Go ahead seeing if I can believe your words.

177
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,740
The person you've mentioned

178
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,540
is him?

179
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,580
dazzling.

180
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,940
Zhao Jian from Moonä»éº¼æåæ¯Who LinApplause is including?

181
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,340
Joseph, I know that my wife doesn't like you.

182
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,840
I have always been PLAYING WITH YOU!

183
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,600
How dare you JOOP ON ME.

184
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,720
Do you want to make a drama orTsundere thing?

185
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,360
Judging from the medical report,

186
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,160
Zhao Qian really was kidnapped.

187
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,920
There's a truth and a lie.

188
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,560
Yang You Mo even gave up his life for her.

189
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,560
Is this something that a normal friend would do?

190
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,120
Ke Ran, you and Xiao Man

191
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,520
strengthen the social relations investigation of Yang You Mo.

192
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,120
Okay.

193
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,640
Okay.

194
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm afraid that we two

195
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,520
need to get closer to this big person.

196
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
She still has suspicions.

197
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,120
Do you think that if the criminal doesn't succeed,

198
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
you'll still find another chance to get close to her?

199
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,720
Such a big corporate company's general manager

200
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
has never had any problems with anyone before.

201
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,320
Zhao Qian.

202
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
We don't know her enough.

203
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
I think that Yang You Mo should be her lover.

204
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,720
They are professional bodyguards.

205
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,320
They are reliable.

206
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,720
From today onwards, they will be responsible for your safety.

207
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,120
This person is not something that they can handle.

208
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
In the past few days that I was away,

209
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
did anything happen to the company?

210
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
Due to some rumors,

211
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,320
the stock price has fallen.

212
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,320
You were supposed to attend a charity dance party tomorrow night.

213
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,120
How about...

214
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
The schedule is not changing.

215
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,920
If I don't show up,

216
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
they will think that I'm dead.

217
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,320
At this point,

218
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,920
if you still attend the dance party,

219
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,320
will it be dangerous?

220
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,720
No matter how dangerous it is, I have to show up.

221
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
The more dangerous it is,

222
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,520
the more I have to pretend that nothing happened.

223
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,520
Inform Liu Ren Kai to attend the dance party.

224
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
I'll do it immediately.

225
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Hello.

226
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,720
Yes, boss.

227
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Is it okay?

228
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
Or more?

229
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Do you want to talk?

230
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,920
It's almost done.

231
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,120
It can't be almost done.

232
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,720
You have to invite me to the charity dance party tomorrow night.

233
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,920
It must be very okay.

234
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,520
You...

235
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,720
You are not going to be able to do it?

236
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
You...

237
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,720
Okay.

238
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Boss Zhao is here. Hurry and go.

239
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,320
Boss Zhao.

240
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,920
Look over here.

241
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Boss Zhao, look over there.

242
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,520
Boss Zhao, look over there.

243
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
Boss Zhao, please.

244
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
Boss Zhao.

245
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,520
Boss Zhao.

246
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,120
What's going on?

247
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,520
Boss Zhao, can I invite you to the dance party?

248
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
Boss Zhao.

249
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
Boss Zhao.

250
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
Boss Zhao.

251
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,320
Zhong Wei Qing.

252
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Zhong Ming.

253
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Mr. Zhong?

254
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,920
Mr. Zhong's dance is not bad.

255
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,120
You are not a professional, right?

256
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
My hobby...

257
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,920
My job is a divorce lawyer.

258
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I opened a small law firm.

259
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,520
Divorce lawyer?

260
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
You must know a lot about women.

261
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Or how can I get a job?

262
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Actually, I know men well.

263
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Because I also do men's business.

264
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,320
If my friends need it,

265
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,920
I will definitely introduce them to a lawyer.

266
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zhao.

267
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,520
But I might be busy recently.

268
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,920
It's good to be busy.

269
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,120
The busier you are, the more people you have to help you get out of the sea of pain.

270
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,320
But I can't help you get out of the sea of pain.

271
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
What's there to be afraid of?

272
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Tonight's dance party,

273
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,320
the most painful person is you.

274
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
When I was dancing with you,

275
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
I felt that you were injured.

276
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
If that's the case,

277
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
you still have to force yourself to come to the dance party.

278
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,920
It's probably not because you like it, right?

279
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
You are in the top position.

280
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,920
You have your difficulties.

281
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,520
Yes.

282
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Lawyer Zhong,

283
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
it looks like you know me the best tonight.

284
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,120
It's my honor.

285
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
Excuse me.

286
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,160
You enjoy the 1800 hometown cut Tun guess

287
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,000
I think

288
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
Brother Kai

289
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,400
This is so dry

290
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,200
Boss

291
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,840
Don't flick the glass

292
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,700
I seem to have gained some strenght

293
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
You removed all your

294
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,140
â¦

295
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,100
Did Chao Ð²ÐºÑÑ it?

296
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,800
Then let's try Hero's

297
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Mr. Zhao.

299
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,880
I understand what you said.

300
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,520
I'll help you deal with your troubles.

301
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,800
I won't let you

302
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,880
make them uncomfortable.

303
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,240
I know what to do.

304
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
You can rest assured.

305
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
Can you dance?

306
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,880
I don't remember you have this skill.

307
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,080
Why don't you call Zhao Guoxi?

308
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,360
Why are you here?

309
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,040
You're not qualified to be involved in this case.

310
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,760
In Tango's dance,

311
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,200
the man has to play the role of lead.

312
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,120
But when I danced with him,

313
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,680
I thought he was the one who led the lead.

314
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
He has a strong desire to control.

315
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,600
I don't think I'm like his dance class.

316
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,360
I'm more like his

317
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
thousand-line puppet.

318
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
Can you go with me?

319
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,040
What can we do?

320
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,120
Are we done?

321
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,840
Yes.

322
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,480
You can go back.

323
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,440
Don't disturb the police investigation here.

324
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Murder.

325
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,040
She is not so autochromastic.

326
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
She is a murder.

327
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,240
She is a murderer who

328
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,320
killed my son.

329
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,200
Zhao Qian.

330
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
What's wrong with me?

331
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,160
What's wrong with me?

332
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,440
He's not a capitalist.

333
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,400
He's not a capitalist.

334
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
He's not a capitalist.

335
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,400
He's not a capitalist.

336
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,680
He caused my son to die.

337
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,480
Zhao Qian, you're a murderer.

338
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Zhao Qian, he's a murderer.

339
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,240
Stop shooting.

340
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,720
This way.

341
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
Come on.

342
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,280
Auntie,

343
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,800
have you been misunderstanding me?

344
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
Auntie,

345
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,280
say it out.

346
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Your family was killed.

347
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,520
Stop pretending to be innocent.

348
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,120
You're a human and a ghost.

349
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,680
I know it very well.

350
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
You're a ghost with a human nose.

351
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,960
You caused our family to die.

352
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,960
You're a murderer.

353
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,320
You're a murderer.

354
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,480
You're a capitalist.

355
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
We have to change the statement today.

356
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,080
You're a murderer.

357
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
Get up and tell us.

358
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
You're a capitalist.

359
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
You're a murderer.

360
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,520
Stop shooting.

361
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,760
You're a murderer.

362
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Stop shooting.

363
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,080
He's not a capitalist.

364
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,800
He's a murderer.

365
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,680
Auntie,

366
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,200
have you been misunderstanding me?

367
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,160
Auntie,

368
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
say it out.

369
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Your family was killed.

370
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,000
You're a human and a ghost.

371
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,160
You caused our family to die.

372
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,640
You're a murderer.

373
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,880
You're a murderer.

374
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,520
Ghost?

375
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
Murderer?

376
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Who did Zhao Qian kill?

377
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,000
Yang You Mo?

378
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,760
I don't think so.

379
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Tong Tong.

380
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Luo Li Jun.

381
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,400
It was an accident.

382
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,080
It's the result of the investigation

383
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
of the witness and evidence.

384
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Yang Yan.

385
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,840
It's even worse.

386
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,240
It was an accident.

387
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,240
What did Zhao Qian do?

388
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,080
I wish I could kill him.

389
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Ms. Fang.

390
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,640
Calm down.

391
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
Drink some water.

392
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,560
Calm down?

393
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,560
He almost killed my husband.

394
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,280
Yang Xiaoshan,

395
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,160
goodä¸ç®¡ what happens next,

396
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,240
I won't forgive you either.

397
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Ziqun.

398
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Zhao Qian.

399
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,640
Ghost?

400
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,160
The ghost at the!*

401
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,200
Why are you here suddenly?

402
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,840
What do you mean by suddenly?

403
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,400
I can't come here if I'm a lawmaker.

404
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,640
No.

405
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
Everyone is used to you not showing up.

406
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,880
Help me find a person named Fang Qingchun.

407
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,360
See where she lives now.

408
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,720
Send it to my phone later.

409
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,360
Which Fang Qingchun?

410
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,680
The one who came to me

411
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
must be the one who wants to divorce.

412
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,720
Ten yuan.

413
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,880
Thank you.

414
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,000
Thank you.

415
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,000
Boss, have a bowl of beef.

416
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,760
Ms. Fang.

417
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
It's no use to find me.

418
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
I have no money to pay.

419
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm not here to take the debt.

420
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm a divorce lawyer.

421
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,080
We've met before.

422
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
You came to my law firm

423
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,720
to consult about the divorce.

424
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,840
Do you remember?

425
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,080
You want to come to the lawyer's fee?

426
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,600
No need.

427
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
No need to divorce.

428
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,640
My husband is dead.

429
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm not here to take the debt.

430
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm here to help you.

431
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm not here to help you.

432
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm here to help you.

433
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I'm here to help you.

434
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,440
I'm here to help you.

435
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm here to help you.

436
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,600
My husband is dead.

437
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,240
Dead?

438
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
How?

439
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,040
Ms. Fang.

440
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,280
I want to ask you

441
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,440
about Zhao Qian.

442
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,560
Ms. Fang.

443
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,440
It was a misunderstanding.

444
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Misunderstanding?

445
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
I thought

446
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,440
Mr. Zhao seduced my husband.

447
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,400
But it's not.

448
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,160
I was wrong about him.

449
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,080
Mr. Zhao is a good man.

450
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,000
He always cares about us.

451
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
Sometimes, he even

452
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,560
comes to my business.

453
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,120
Misunderstanding.

454
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,160
Madam.

455
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,880
Fresh?

456
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,400
Yes.

457
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Give me a few.

458
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,080
Okay.

459
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,400
That's enough. Thank you.

460
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,360
Fang Qin Chun's husband is Qian Cheng.

461
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,520
He committed suicide a year ago.

462
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,280
Can you

463
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,560
finish the investigation

464
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,120
and finish it?

465
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,920
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

466
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,800
Okay.

467
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
It's my fault.

468
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,240
Ms. Cheng, I'm sorry.

469
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
What does Qian Cheng

470
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,840
do?

471
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,040
I don't know.

472
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
I don't know.

473
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,960
I don't know.

474
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't know.

475
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,520
What does he do?

476
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,320
A high-end drug for green clouds.

477
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,640
Why did he commit suicide?

478
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
It's said that he's a good man online.

479
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,080
Many people say

480
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,400
he used a high-end drug for green clouds.

481
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:39,120
Thanks vampire!

482
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,320
Boss, check please.

483
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,920
You can stop when you're buying the order.

484
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,320
You're really lucky to have me pay.

485
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
You came to find Zhang Xiaoyun.

486
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,720
Have you thought about your identity?

487
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,920
You're not a police anymore.

488
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,120
You have no right to investigate anyone.

489
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,720
Zhang Ayi!

490
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,520
Two people downstairs are being checked.

491
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,920
Let's split up.

492
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,920
Zhang Ayi!

493
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,920
Zhang Ayi!

494
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,520
Zhang Ayi!

495
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,520
Zhang Ayi!

496
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,920
Zhang Ayi!

497
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,120
Zhang Ayi!

498
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,920
You're stuck!

499
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,720
Come and help!

500
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,120
Help!

501
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Help!

502
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,920
Help!

503
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Help!

504
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Help him!

505
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Help!

506
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,720
Yima!

507
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,520
You're stuck!

508
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,120
Yima!

509
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
Don't be so stubborn!

510
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,920
You're stuck!

511
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,520
Let me go.

512
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,320
My family is gone.

513
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,920
You're a good person.

514
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,520
Thank you.

515
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,520
Be careful!

516
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,320
Don't let go!

517
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Hold on tight!

518
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,720
Director Qin.

519
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,520
Director Zhao.

520
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,520
Did you do the things that happened to Zhang Xiaoyun?

521
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,320
You promised me your help.

522
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,520
This method?

523
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,520
I can't work with the way make-up artist does it performedoon.

524
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,920
Liu Renkai.

525
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
Zha Zhong, you are...

527
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,200
What's wrong with me?

528
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
Now, the Lv Yun Group

529
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,000
is not the same as before.

530
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,840
I'm not my father either.

531
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
Do you understand?

532
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
Yes.

533
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,840
The reason I'm keeping you

534
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,920
is because I'm thinking of my father.

535
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
If you're so free,

536
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,520
please find the person

537
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,280
who kidnapped me.

538
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,040
Mr. aspects and sciences

539
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,400

543
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,040
is quite ÐºÐ°ÐºÑÑo.

544
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,400
Is that good?

545
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm not afraid of anything.

546
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840

00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm not afraid of anything.

565
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
