00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Mr. Right

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,460
Tiao Tiao, don't eat too much.

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,100
You'll get killed if you grow up.

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,160
What are you doing?

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,660
Sir.

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,200
Are you trying to name the little rabbit?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
If you name it,

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,080
it'll become your friend.

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,160
And you'll become a little rabbit sooner or later.

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
The world is weak and strong.

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you know what will happen

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,560
if you become a rabbit?

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
What is weak and strong?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
What magic powers!

15
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Throw the rabbit inside.

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,400
Throw it inside!

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,400
If you don't throw it away, I'll throw you in.

18
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,400
The Long Ballad

19
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Episode 16

20
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,400
The Long Ballad

21
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Did you smell it? It smells like gas.

22
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
It's like a powder.

23
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Hello, Boss.

24
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Fang Qingchuan is not at home.

25
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Don't alert him. Come back first.

26
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay.

27
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Go.

28
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
You really got me.

29
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,400
I had to be quick with Zhao Qian and the others.

30
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I had to be quick to catch them.

31
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
We can really catch them?

32
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Yes.

33
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I've been studying Zhao Qian for a long time.

34
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I found that he has a habit of forcing things like a robbery.

35
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Once there's a negative situation,

36
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
such as panic, suspicion,

37
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
he will go somewhere.

38
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,400
The Long Ballad

39
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Captain Zheng,

40
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
the security guards and Zhao Qian

41
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
are constantly moving.

42
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Yes.

43
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
The security is more tight.

44
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Something seems to be happening.

45
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Keep an eye on him. I'll be right over.

46
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,400
The Long Ballad

47
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
The Long Ballad

48
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
It's 8.15. Did you find Fang Qingchuan?

49
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
He didn't come.

50
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Didn't come?

51
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
He booked the time and location.

52
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Did he find you?

53
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
He can't find me.

54
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I arranged people at every exit of the square.

55
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm sure he didn't come.

56
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I'll be right over.

57
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Yes.

58
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,400
The Long Ballad

59
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
The big military said Zhao Qian went to his ancestral house.

60
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
He's not going there. We'll meet there.

61
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Don't follow me!

62
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,400

The Long Ballad

66
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Did you follow me?

67
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
What are you looking at?

68
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
What's wrong with him?

69
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Robbery.

70
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Robbery?

71
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,400
The Long Ballad

72
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Robbery!

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
There's footprints here.

The Long Ballad

77
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
He just left.

78
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
A face mask.

79
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Here.

80
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
There's footprints here.

81
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Don't bother to divorce him.

82
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
My husband is dead.

83
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
He just left.

84
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
This is Fang Qingchun's.

85
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,400
The Long Ballad

86
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Mr. Zhou.

87
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
You came here in the middle of the night to feed the dogs?

88
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Did someone ask you to come?

89
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You're thinking too much.

90
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
This is the old house of the Zhao family.

91
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I just want to come back today and walk around.

92
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
You came here in the middle of the night to feed the dogs?

93
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
You're willful when you have money and leisure.

94
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Yes.

95
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
You're willful when you have money and leisure.

96
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Do you miss your mother?

97
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,400
The Long Ballad

98
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Are you leaving?

99
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Don't force me to call your leader so late.

100
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Zhao Qian.

101
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You'd better tell us the truth.

102
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Otherwise, if you're in danger again,

103
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
no one can help you.

104
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Do you think I'm someone who needs help?

105
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You're not saying anything.

106
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Keep an eye on him.

107
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Take him as your son.

108
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
He'll definitely be a good son.

109
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
That bastard set me up.

110
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
He's not capable.

111
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Someone must have instigated him.

112
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Find him.

113
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
I understand.

114
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
What about when you find them?

115
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Find him.

116
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
He's a son.

117
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
He'll have a son.

118
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
He'll have a son.

119
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Hot۔

120
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
What rice can be used to make fried rice?

121
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I'll buy it.

122
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
The public health bill should be paid!

123
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,320
What about me?

124
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
What about my son?

125
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,080
I didn't expect the police to show up suddenly.

126
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,560
Get out.

127
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
I don't want to

128
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,120
have anything to do with you.

129
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,480
For your son,

130
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
you have to think about it.

131
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,680
Qian Cheng will never have a backer.

132
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,320
What did he leave you with?

133
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,160
Nothing.

134
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,480
Come with me.

135
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,400
Go.

136
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,520
Behave yourself.

137
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,040
Chences resemble humans.

138
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
Just be more gentle.

139
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm sorry.

140
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm sorry.

141
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm sorry.

142
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm sorry.

143
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm sorry.

144
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm sorry.

145
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
I'm sorry.

146
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm sorry.

147
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,600
I'm sorry.

148
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Dad, didn't you like this kind of dance a lot in the past?

149
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,100
You don't like it anymore?

150
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,100
Or are you afraid of it?

151
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I like it a lot.

152
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,800
I like it to the point of death.

153
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,100
I like it.

154
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,300
Dad, I don't dare to do it anymore.

155
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
What do you dare to do?

156
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
I dare not not listen to you.

157
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Dad, I'm sorry.

158
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
I'm sorry.

159
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
This is dancing.

160
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
You should smile.

161
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Be happy.

162
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,800
Smile happily.

163
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Smile.

164
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Be happy.

165
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
No way.

166
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,700
Are you insane?

167
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,600
Dad, mom!

168
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:26,160
Butt Buks of Ha chess

169
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,640
You know what he said to me before he died

170
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Stupid corresponds to Yu Zihong too!

171
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm Yeoise, a Grтор fighting Unity of China!

172
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Stupid!

173
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
You met such an indifferent new man,

174
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
yet you still escaped from this fate.

175
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,560
And his account form into a

176
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,700
letter bathroom of Youmu.

177
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
Understand?

178
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,700
Finally, that matches.

179
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Until one day,

180
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
I met a woman who wanted to jump off the building

181
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
after listening to my brother's song.

182
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,460
There's a cat under the window.

183
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,460
It's quietly in the corner.

184
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
The cat is hiding from me.

185
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm hiding from the cat.

186
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,460
We're hiding from the cat.

187
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,460
I finally understand.

188
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
In this world,

189
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,460
you once thought that the happiest and happiest thing

190
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,460
was that when you were desperate,

191
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,460
you would become a deadly knife.

192
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
But this knife

193
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,460
kills without seeing blood.

194
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Dad,

195
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Dad,

196
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
this knife

197
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,220
was handed over to me by you.

198
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,220
You were so great before.

199
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
We had to do

200
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
whatever you asked us to do.

201
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
I couldn't change it.

202
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,220
It was always a little rabbit.

203
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
So it died.

204
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
But I changed it.

205
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
I learned to be strong.

206
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,220
So I'm alive.

207
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Dad,

208
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,220
shouldn't you reward me?

209
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
I heard

210
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
you were asking about the past

211
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
with the previous governor.

212
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Dad,

213
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
you're like this.

214
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Just wait till you die.

215
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Why do you have to write so much?

216
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Besides,

217
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
now

218
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,220
I'm the master of Lv Yun.

219
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Get out.

220
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Why are you so fierce to me?

221
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
I was shocked.

222
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
You should be proud of me.

223
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
You should be proud of me.

224
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,220
You adjusted me like this.

225
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,220
I learned it from you.

226
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
You also told me,

227
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
Qianqian,

228
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,220
you're the princess.

229
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,220
And under the princess's feet

230
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,220
are the slaves.

231
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
You're so interesting.

232
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
You're so interesting.

233
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
How could you do that?

234
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
You're so interesting.

235
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I'll tell you a story.

236
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
A fairy tale

237
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
about the princess.

238
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Let me think about

239
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
where to start.

240
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,220
The fairy tale about the princess.

241
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
The fairy tale about the princess.

242
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Where should we start with this story?

243
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Long, long ago,

244
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
there was a childish girl.

245
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
How childish was she?

246
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,420
She was so childish that she thought that everyone in the world

247
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,420
was like her.

248
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
They liked little rabbits.

249
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,420
But the little girl had a strong father.

250
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,820
He forced her to tell her the truth about this world.

251
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,820
He said that this world is a world of weak and strong people.

252
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
There are many bad people.

253
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Only the strong can survive.

254
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,620
And rabbits are born to be eaten.

255
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Yes, that's right.

256
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,220
So the whole world is full of hostility towards the princess.

257
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,620
They all think of themselves as poor little rabbits.

258
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,820
But they think that the princess wants to eat the bad people.

259
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,620
You are a bitch.

260
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,420
Men are all dead.

261
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,020
Why do you have to steal from others?

262
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,420
Are you a murderer?

263
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,820
You are not a capitalist.

264
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Are you a murderer?

265
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Don't go.

266
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,220
I am willing to do anything for you.

267
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,920
For a biological child,

268
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,320
please be my wife.

269
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,320
Thought so.

270
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Come out,

271
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,820
and listen to my pew tills жUUONE CHUH CHUH

272
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,220
The Jin family was like a pig catcher due to the devil.

273
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,340
AGo too

274
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I made it up!

275
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Princess!

276
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
It's still that princess.

277
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
The rabbit is still that rabbit.

278
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
But the difference is

279
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,340
that in fairy tales, there is a dark side.

280
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Just like the princess group,

281
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
they are all red.

282
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
Only those with blood

283
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,340
deserve to be princesses.

284
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
This truth

285
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
was taught by you.

286
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
But I didn't teach you

287
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
to kill people.

288
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
What did you say?

289
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,340
I didn't teach you to kill people!

290
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm sorry.

291
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
I've been a little egotistical lately.

292
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
You didn't teach me anything.

293
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
But you taught me

294
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
that those rabbits

295
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
all deserve to die.

296
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Try to calm her down.

297
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Don't bother me anymore.

298
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Calm down.

299
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Old people

300
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
should

301
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
talk to them more.

302
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
Since she's living so painfully,

303
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,340
why don't you go and free her?

304
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Qian Qian, don't go.

305
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

306
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Really?

307
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Qian Qian, don't go.

308
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

309
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

310
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

311
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

312
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

313
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

314
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

315
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

316
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

317
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

318
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

319
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

320
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
I'm willing to do anything for you.

321
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Can you tell the truth?

322
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Look at you now.

323
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
By the way,

324
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
take a good look at your mother's photo.

325
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
I wish you well.

326
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Mom.

327
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
I'll go there alone.

328
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
I'm doing business with neighbors.

329
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
It's too noisy.

330
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,340
It's not easy to do business.

331
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Add some chili.

332
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Add some.

333
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Do you want it?

334
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Some chili.

335
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Wait a minute.

336
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Okay, twenty.

337
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Thank you.

338
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Ms. Fang.

339
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I don't want to do your business.

340
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,340
I've bought all the beef you have left.

341
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Let's close early today.

342
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,340
We suspect you are involved in a murder case.

343
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
You have to come with us.

344
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
I'll go with you.

345
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
What about my son?

346
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Don't worry.

347
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
Someone will pick him up.

348
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
We have confirmed

349
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,340
that you went to Zhao Qian's family's house last night.

350
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Is there anything you want to say?

351
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
What did you do secretly?

352
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
You went to the old house of the Zhao family.

353
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
You followed me.

354
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Only there is such a yellow mark.

355
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
You left a mark.

356
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,340
The police will come to you in a while.

357
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,340
What should I do now?

358
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Don't be afraid.

359
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
You should speak out.

360
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,340
When I teach you, remember.

361
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,340
This is the only chance for you to make your husband's wish come true.

362
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
You have a family and you don't go back.

363
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
You brought a child to school

364
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,340
and live in a hotel outside.

365
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Why?

366
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Fang Jingchun.

367
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,340
I hope you cooperate with the investigation of the police.

368
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,340
There are things you say and find out.

369
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
I am different.

370
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
I asked your neighbors.

371
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,340
You didn't go out yesterday.

372
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,340
They all think it's abnormal.

373
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,340
You and Zhao Qian

374
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,340
went to the old house of the Zhao family.

375
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
It's not a coincidence.

376
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
It's a trap.

377
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Am I right?

378
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Yes.

379
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,340
I did go to find Zhao Qian.

380
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,340
I want to deal with Zhao Qian.

381
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Continue.

382
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,340
More than a year ago,

383
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I found my husband having a ghost.

384
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
The target of the ghost

385
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
is Zhao Qian.

386
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Honey, I'm here.

387
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I'm here.

388
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I'm here.

389
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
I'm here.

390
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
I'm here.

391
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Honey, my husband

392
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
came back with a sigh of relief.

393
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,340
I'm sorry.

394
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
I'm sorry, honey.

395
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,340
He hugged me and said he was sorry.

396
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,340
I was surprised. I don't know why.

397
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,340
I don't know why he suddenly changed his mind.

398
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
But I didn't expect

399
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,340
he committed suicide in a few days.

400
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
The news reported that

401
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,340
he used the money of Liyin Group

402
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,340
to commit suicide.

403
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
So you think

404
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,340
your husband's death has something to do with him?

405
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Actually, at first, I just thought

406
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I just wanted to make a statement.

407
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
But he is Zhao Qian.

408
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
I don't care about my life.

409
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
But what about the child?

410
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
So I...

411
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I can only bear it.

412
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
But I really didn't expect he would

413
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,340
he would kill himself.

414
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
He ran to my house to vent his anger.

415
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,340
He wanted to burn us both to death.

416
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,340
From what you know about your husband,

417
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
do you think he would use the money?

418
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Captain Zheng,

419
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Fang Qin's house was flooded with gas.

420
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
This is probably the reason

421
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
he had to take the child to the hotel.

422
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
But it's a little strange.

423
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,340
The gas was only poured on the bed.

424
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Is there no other place?

425
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
No.

426
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
The other person poured very carefully.

427
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,340
It didn't exceed the range of the bed.

428
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
It's like the target is only the bed.

429
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
Okay, I got it.

430
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,340
He was so careful to set fire.

431
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
It's like Yixing is going to

432
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
take the child under control.

433
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Oh, no. I forgot something.

434
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
Go, go.

435
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Sorry. Thank you.

436
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Dad, how did you guess?

437
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
It's your uncle's fault.

438
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
Don't use him to block the gun every time.

439
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Okay, okay. I was wrong.

440
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
But you're always the same.

441
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Anyway, the role has nothing to do with me.

442
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
That's not necessarily.

443
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
The new student who has improved

444
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
is Class 42, Zhong Renxi.

445
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
He can speak Chinese.

446
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
He's my superhero.

447
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Now, let's welcome him on stage.

448
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
Dad, run!

449
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,340
Go, go.

450
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Yes, they must have made a mistake.

451
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
I didn't let him go.

452
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
What's wrong with this?

453
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
I...

454
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Go up.

455
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
No.

456
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
I didn't make a mistake.

457
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Please give a warm applause

458
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,340
to thank Aisin.

459
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Liyun Pharmaceuticals donated the library to our school.

460
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
And also set up Liyun scholarship.

461
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340
Please give a warm applause to thank Aisin.

462
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Come.

463
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Okay, three, two...

464
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
Are you happy?

465
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Yes.

466
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
Where did you get this peony?

467
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,340
I got it from my old house.

468
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
What flower is this?

469
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
This is a cooking herb.

470
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,340
They say children are the flowers of our country.

471
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
We must protect them with our hearts.

472
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Right?

473
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Let's go, Xi Xi.

474
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Dad.

475
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,340
Goodbye, Principal Ren.

476
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Goodbye.

477
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Goodbye.

478
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
I like him so much.

479
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,340
That sister is so beautiful.

480
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,340
Dad, do you know him?

481
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
What's wrong with you?

482
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
Today is the first time in my life

483
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
that I won an award.

484
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,340
You haven't said a word to me.

485
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Xi Xi.

486
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Can you give the prize to Dad?

487
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
I'll return it to that sister.

488
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Why?

489
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Pretend that we can't take it.

490
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
I got it with my own efforts.

491
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Why can't I take it?

492
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Just listen to me, okay?

493
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
I won't listen.

494
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
My super hero.

495
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,340
My super hero.

496
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Hello?

497
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Did you find him?

498
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,340
I found him but I didn't find Xiaoliu.

499
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
The world has changed.

500
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,340
Even a cow seller dares to fool me.

501
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,340
What did he say?

502
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Are you curious?

503
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,340
Hai, it's not good to be curious.

504
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
No matter what he has,

505
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,340
find it for me and destroy it.

506
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Mr. Zhu, Mr. Zhao is on his way back.

507
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,340
Please sit here and wait for him.

508
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
I have to go.

509
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
Okay, thank you.

510
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I'll go.

511
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Are you Mr. Zhao?

512
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm Zhao Qian's friend.

513
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,340
I've known your name for a long time.

514
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Sorry.

515
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,340
I've heard that you're an excellent entrepreneur.

516
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,340
You created Lv Yun.

517
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,340
More importantly,

518
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,340
you've trained a better daughter as your successor.

519
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,340
Zhao Qian is very good now.

520
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
He's in the New Hong Kong city.

521
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,340
He's a good man.

522
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Do you know

523
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Zhao Qian is the man you've trained?

524
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Mr. Zhong.

525
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Mr. Zhao, talk to your father.

526
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Mr. Zhou,

527
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
those girls have bad major.

528
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,340
You're a woman.

529
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I need no reason toいる about her.

530
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,340
I understand, mom.

531
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,340
Thanks a lot, Mr. Zhou.

532
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Come on please.

533
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,340
You can go back to your room today.

534
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
It's already too late.

535
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
She especially came at noon.

536
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,500
I think it's too strange.

537
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,020
I thank you for her.

538
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,740
Do you think

539
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,500
your daughter won the award

540
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,780
because of our relationship?

541
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,820
Mr. Zhong,

542
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,180
you're thinking too much.

543
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,180
Or,

544
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
you don't believe

545
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,620
your daughter has the ability.

546
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,180
I do believe my daughter.

547
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,060
She's excellent.

548
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,620
But, she has nothing to do with her grades.

549
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,020
It's like

550
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,860
her class and her character.

551
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,900
Your daughter is obviously ittual.

552
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,540
I now 12th.

553
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
Do I need a bus?

554
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,620
Can I tell you

555
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,020
it's a steady cruise charge?

556
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,420
I'm charging for it.

557
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,740
It's too painful.

558
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,580
You'll need a hospitality.

559
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,780
You're my bet.

560
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,140
Only when you're given some money

561
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,340
can you go to the hospital

562
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,620
for brutal treatment.

563
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,540
I can't.

564
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,300
Fang Qin Chun?

565
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,300
The one who sells beef?

566
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,380
Yes.

567
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,260
His family was just

568
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,220
sold to Qi You.

569
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,660
Qi You?

570
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,380
That's so mean.

571
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,580
It has nothing to do with me.

572
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,740
Does it?

573
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,060
He said it was you

574
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,540
who killed his husband, Qian Cheng.

575
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,140
If you put it that way,

576
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,220
then Qian Cheng's death

577
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,820
has something to do with me.

578
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,860
About two years ago,

579
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,860
I found out about Qian Cheng's corruption.

580
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
He tried to ask me to cover it up for him.

581
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,940
I didn't agree.

582
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,700
Then he told the company

583
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,460
about it.

584
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,420
After that,

585
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,020
he committed suicide.

586
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,060
So Ms. Fang

587
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,100
kept pestering me.

588
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,260
Who told you

589
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,700
to touch

590
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:54,660
an uneenthuling teenager

591
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,300
Don't act rashly.

592
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,420
Did you hear that?

593
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,020
Yes.

594
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,900
How is it?

595
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,220
I've checked the police station.

596
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,620
The bodyguards around Zhao Qian

597
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,740
haven't sent Fang Qin Chun yet.

598
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,700
It seems that Zhao Qian didn't lie.

599
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,740
He didn't do

600
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,140
the oil transfer.

601
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,180
If it wasn't for Zhao Qian, who else could it be?

602
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,180
Do you remember Wu Pin?

603
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,540
Is lying worth it?

604
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,980
Tell me about your son.

605
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,140
He also said the same thing.

606
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,420
Fang Qin Chun is like Wu Pin.

607
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,260
He's always been behind someone's back.

608
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,220
And he might be the same person.

609
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,860
Who is he?

610
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,260
Who can control two people at the same time?

611
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,900
We've checked it thoroughly.

612
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,980
You have nothing to do with the case.

613
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,380
Can I leave now?

614
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,460
But we have one more thing.

615
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,180
I hope

616
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,500
you can cooperate with the investigation.

617
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,980
What is it?

618
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,020
Who is the person who asked you

619
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,660
to ask Zhao Qian out?

620
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,260
I don't understand what you're talking about.

621
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,420
You know it clearly.

622
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,540
From yesterday to now,

623
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,980
all your actions

624
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,660
are under the guidance of someone behind you.

625
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,940
You might not know

626
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,660
who the person who asked you to ask

627
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,660
was.

628
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
He's a very dangerous person.

629
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,740
He's directly related to

630
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,340
the extreme murder case.

631
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,900
I hope you can cooperate with us

632
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,020
to find him.

633
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,140
You told us before

634
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,740
that Zhao Qian was a good person.

635
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,940
It's only been a few days.

636
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,940
It's only been a few days.

637
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,420
Isn't this too big a change?

638
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,940
It's Zhao Qian

639
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,820
who bullied me.

640
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,860
He's going to use the gas to intimidate me.

641
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,380
And actually,

642
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,740
I didn't do anything.

643
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,100
If Zhao Qian didn't do anything,

644
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,940
we've checked it thoroughly.

645
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,540
The person who spilled the gas in your house

646
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,940
has nothing to do with Zhao Qian.

647
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,140
The person who taught the gas

648
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,580
to that person behind you

649
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,500
was trying to

650
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
make you and Zhao Qian's relationship

651
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,180
go under the influence of you.

652
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,260
We can't let others be our weapons,

653
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,220
right?

654
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,060
Tell us

655
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,620
who that person is.

656
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,740
Zhao Qian.

657
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,540
Zhao Qian.

658
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,260
Zhao Qian.

659
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,940
Zhao Qian.

660
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,740
Zhao Qian.

661
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,540
Zhao Qian.

662
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,540
Zhao Qian.

663
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,340
Zhao Qian.

664
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Zhao Qian.

665
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,340
Zhao Qian.

666
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,340
Zhao Qian.

667
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,340
Zhao Qian.

668
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,340
Zhao Qian.

669
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Zhao Qian.

670
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,340
Zhao Qian.

671
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
Zhao Qian.

672
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,340
Zhao Qian.

673
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,340
Zhao Qian.

674
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,340
Zhao Qian.

675
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
Zhao Qian.

676
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,340
Zhao Qian.

677
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Zhao Qian.

678
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,340
Zhao Qian.

679
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Zhao Qian.

680
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,340
Zhao Qian.

681
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,340
Zhao Qian.

682
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,340
Zhao Qian.

683
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,340
Zhao Qian.

684
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,340
Zhao Qian.

685
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,340
Zhao Qian.

686
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,740
Zhao Qian.

687
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,740
Zhao Qian.

688
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,740
Zhao Qian.

689
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,740
Zhao Qian.

690
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,740
Zhao Qian.

691
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,740
Zhao Qian.

692
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,740
Zhao Qian.

693
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,740
Zhao Qian.

694
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,740
Zhao Qian.

695
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
Zhao Qian.

696
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,740
Zhao Qian.

697
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,740
Zhao Qian.

698
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,740
Zhao Qian.

699
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Zhao Qian.

700
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,740
Zhao Qian.

701
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,740
Zhao Qian.

702
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,740
Zhao Qian.

703
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,740
Zhao Qian.

704
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,740
Zhao Qian.

705
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,740
Zhao Qian.

706
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,740
Zhao Qian.

707
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
Zhao Qian.

708
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,740
Zhao Qian.

709
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,740
Zhao Qian.

710
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,740
Zhao Qian.

711
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,740

712
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,740

713
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740

714
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,740

715
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,740

716
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,740
