00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Bai Wei, the world's official partner of the world's drama cup.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Welcome to watch Perfect Saving.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
According to the description of the passenger at the time,

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
Yang Yan was the one who rushed out

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
from the river.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Where is Yang You Mo?

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm standing here,

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
writing Yang Yan's name.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
If Luo Li Juan and Yang Yan are not so-called accidents,

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,400
then what is the motive behind Yang You Mo?

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
The motive is in this photo.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,800
Zhao Qian? Where did you get this photo?

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,200
It was given to me by my high school teacher.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,400
Through my visit to Zhao Qian's teacher and classmate when I was young,

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,000
I learned that Zhao Qian's personality

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
has greatly changed since he was in the third grade of primary school.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,200
After he became an adult, he had a lot of interactions with his former classmate teacher.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,800
What's strange is that

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,600
he suddenly organized a class reunion

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
and stayed at Yang Yan's missing reservoir.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Where is the location?

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,800
There.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Tao Yuan Mountain Resort.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Everything was not an accident.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,200
I still remember you said that kind of feeling of being in a deep sleep.

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,000
What happened that day?

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,200
The King's Avatar

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Episode 2

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
When are you going to start smoking?

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm not smoking.

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm just preparing for those rich people who are going to get divorced.

34
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You're acting like a fool.

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
I'll give you a ride.

36
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
You're giving me a ride?

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Who is a western?

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Western?

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Qian Cheng, Yang You Mo,

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
are all Zhao Qian's students?

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll ask him to give me a lecture tonight.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
You?

43
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,400
The second old fox. I'm afraid that Zhao Qian should give you a lecture.

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Who is the first one?

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Master Zhang.

46
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Seriously, practice your skills.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Find something useful tonight.

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
You're so filial.

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,900
native Chinese sa長

55
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Look at me. Look at me.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,520
Y'all keep madre 치퓨 igual and mother like.

57
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,200
Please listen to me.

58
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Would you manipulator,

59
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,400
Franchise.

60
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Have you heard this song?

61
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Mr. Zhong,

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
what are you doing here at this hour?

63
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm just passing by.

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm here to do some care.

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Passing by?

66
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,400
To do some care?

67
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
This is the membership system.

68
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm a member.

69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,560
I just joined.

70
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,080
Then enjoy yourself.

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,640
I know Yang Yan.

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,520
He mentioned you to me.

73
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm just kidding.

74
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm just kidding.

75
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
You must like

76
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,680
the scenery at Tao Yanshan's place, right?

77
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
What do you want?

78
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,240
I said I'm just passing by.

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
I just happened to meet you.

80
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,560
Mr. Zhao,

81
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
if you don't have anything else,

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,760
you can sit down

83
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
and have a chat.

84
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Have some tea.

85
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
Tell me about Liu Renkai.

86
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll tell you about Yang Yan.

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
How about it?

88
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm busy.

89
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,920
Good night.

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
You can talk about Yang Youmo.

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't let him follow me.

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Why isn't the car here yet?

93
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,600
Right away.

94
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,920
Mr. Zhao, what are you doing?

95
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Don't touch me!

96
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,560
What are you doing?

97
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
Go away!

98
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
Go!

99
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
Are you crazy?

100
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,160
Dr. Liao.

101
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Come here.

102
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
If you're sick, go to the hospital.

103
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
You'll be mentally ill.

104
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,240
Why are you here?

105
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,800
Who is...

106
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,840
outline the anniversary.

107
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:30,220
All of them will be

108
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
included in this invitation.

109
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Go ahead.

110
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,280
Go ahead.

111
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Why did you go to the Spar and go back to the neighborhood last night?

112
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I can't remember.

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,080
I just wanted to take a walk.

114
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,600
I walked and walked and went over there.

115
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,880
You walked and walked and walked over there?

116
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,480
What a coincidence.

117
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,640
Officer Zhong, are you okay?

118
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,040
I think I remember that he got hurt.

119
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,240
He's fine. Don't be hurt.

120
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Did you see what the driver looked like when he drove past you?

121
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,440
We haven't found the car yet. The license plate is a set.

122
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,040
From the surveillance provided by the water supply company, it's hard to see the driver's appearance.

123
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
You just said that Zhao Qian saw the car accident?

124
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Zhao Qian thinks that Zhao Shi is after him.

125
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,640
But he's not sure if that person was the one who kidnapped him.

126
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
Liao Boyan went back, right?

127
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Liao Boyan suddenly appeared on the scene.

129
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,440
And this isn't the first time.

130
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
As long as it's related to the evidence,

131
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
he'll show up.

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,240
Captain Zheng, Dr. Zhong, Director Zhang is looking for you.

133
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
We received a report. A little girl disappeared.

134
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,240
Little girl?

135
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,040
Liu Zixuan.

136
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
How did you think it was her?

137
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
Master called us here because this little girl

138
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,840
has a social relationship with the person we're investigating.

139
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,840
My first reaction was that I thought of Liu Renkai's daughter.

140
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,440
That's right. It's Liu Zixuan.

141
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,240
A few people who were on the outskirts picked up Liu Zixuan's bag and things

142
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,440
and handed them to the police station.

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,440
The police immediately contacted Sun Ting.

144
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,440
But Sun Ting said that Liu Zixuan told her to go out and play.

145
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,240
Maybe she just dropped something by accident.

146
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,840
A day later, Sun Ting called the police and said that Liu Zixuan didn't go home.

147
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,040
The police found that the missing girl's father's name was Liu Renkai.

148
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,640
He had been under investigation for a murder case.

149
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,040
He then transferred the case.

150
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,840
People's Department of Criminal Investigation

151
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,440
It's him.

152
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,440
Director Dou, the person you saw that day was found. His name is Liao Boyan.

153
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,660
Who are staying at your place?

154
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,260
It's them.

155
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,100
Impossible.

156
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,440
Hello.

157
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,380
Excuse me.

158
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
I just got the surgery.

159
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I need to get it done.

160
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Boss.

162
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Look.

163
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Where is Xie Wuqiang's son?

164
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I heard that he was still in the hospital after the surgery.

165
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Why did you ask him?

166
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Xie Wuqiang's goods were all sent by his son.

167
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
If you ask his son,

168
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
you'll know if he's the one.

169
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Xie Xiaohua.

170
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
It seems to be over there.

171
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Xie Xiaohua.

172
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Do you like it?

173
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I'll give it to you.

174
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
You didn't tell me

175
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
not to let my mom meet strangers.

176
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm not a stranger.

177
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
You know my uncle.

178
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Who is your uncle?

179
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
This is my uncle.

180
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
He changed to an old man's belt.

181
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
The family is looking for him.

182
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
You know him.

183
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Don't worry.

184
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I'm a good man.

185
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I have to find him immediately.

186
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Otherwise,

187
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
he'll be in danger.

188
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Tell me if you know him.

189
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I don't know him.

190
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Children can't lie.

191
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I really haven't seen him.

192
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Who are you?

193
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
You can't come in here.

194
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Excuse me.

195
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
I've checked it very carefully.

196
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
That man shouldn't be Liao Boyan.

197
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
It's not him.

198
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Take a look.

199
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Alzheimer's.

200
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Yes.

201
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
You'd better say

202
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
he's an old man.

203
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
It doesn't matter.

204
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
You got it wrong.

205
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
I didn't.

206
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
I recognized his figure

207
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
at a glance.

208
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
When I almost got hit by a car yesterday,

209
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
he was right next to me.

210
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
I can't forget

211
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
his eyes.

212
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Why did he do that?

213
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I want to know why.

214
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Why do I need you to investigate?

215
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Let me show you something.

216
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
My daughter died in a car accident

217
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
five years ago.

218
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
It has nothing to do with you.

219
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Do you know a girl

220
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
named Liao Yifan?

221
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Who?

222
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Five years ago,

223
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
she was hit by a car

224
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
that was running away from the city.

225
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
It's her.

226
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
It must be her.

227
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
It must be her.

228
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
The police came here to investigate.

229
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
You really

230
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
hit your daughter to death.

231
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I know

232
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
whether I did it or not.

233
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
It doesn't matter

234
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
if her daughter is alive or not.

235
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
You're right.

236
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
It doesn't mean you're right.

237
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
You must have

238
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
caused Liao Boyan to die.

239
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
It's like Fang Qinchun

240
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
is bothering you

241
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
for the sake of her future.

242
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I've already told the police

243
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
about the situation yesterday.

244
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I didn't expect

245
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
you to come here

246
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
in person.

247
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Have some water.

248
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Thank you.

249
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
When was the last time

250
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
you saw Liu Zixuan?

251
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
It was the night before last.

252
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I came back after drinking.

253
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
I saw the child

254
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
in the room.

255
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
It seems like it.

256
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
It seems like it.

257
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
It seems like it.

258
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
It seems like it.

259
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
It seems like it.

260
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
It seems like it.

261
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Here's the thing.

262
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
I've been fighting with my husband

263
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
and I'm in a bad mood recently.

264
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
So,

265
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I drink so much every day.

266
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Where's Liu Renkai?

267
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
He's busy.

268
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
What's he busy with?

269
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
He's busy looking for the child.

270
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Did anything happen

271
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
before Liu Zixuan disappeared?

272
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Nothing happened.

273
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
What happened

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
to Liu Zixuan's wound?

275
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Maybe

276
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
the child was too naughty

277
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
and he was bullied

278
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
at school.

279
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Why is the child

280
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
always injured?

281
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
You're a mother.

282
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
You're so heartless.

283
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Last time,

284
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
he fell down by accident.

285
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
This time,

286
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
he was bullied at school.

287
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Was he bullied at school

288
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
or at home?

289
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
We asked him at school.

290
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
No one bullied him at school.

291
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
But you

292
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
have a good reputation.

293
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
At the end of the school,

294
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
you often spoke

295
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
about the importance of

296
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
family environment

297
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
to children's growth.

298
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Let me ask you again.

299
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
How did Liu Zixuan

300
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
get injured?

301
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
The Little Princess's Rainbow

302
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Yang Yan's painting

303
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Liu Zixuan's painting

304
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Auntie Zhang.

305
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Auntie Zhang.

306
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I have something to ask you.

307
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Tell me.

308
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
When did you

309
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
capture Zhao Qian?

310
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,320
Put it away

311
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,840
I don't want to see you again

312
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,400
Aunt Zhang

313
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,080
Is that Yang Yan's bag?

314
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,120
Aunt Zhang, these are

315
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
Zhao Xian threw Tong Tong and Yang Yan's things

316
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
I picked it up from the garbage bin

317
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,200
Why did she throw away the child's things?

318
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,560
I want to know why

319
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,600
Why did she do so many bad things

320
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,160
Still want to go abroad

321
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,400
Can i take a look

322
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
Can you give me these paintings?

323
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,320
I want to take it back

324
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,080
Make a professional comparison

325
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,040
People are gone

326
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,160
What's the use of doing these comparisons?

327
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,360
This can help us

328
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,080
Find out the truth behind Yang Yan's accident

329
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,480
Truth

330
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
What is the truth

331
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,120
I can't tell you now

332
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,560
Could it be that Yang Yan's disappearance

333
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
Also related to Zhao Qian

334
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,000
Aunt Zhang

335
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,480
Please believe us

336
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
We can definitely give you a truth

337
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,040
Brother Kai, this new anti-corruption lock

338
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,840
Can't open

339
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,800
A'long

340
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,240
A door

341
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
Brotherhen

342
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Take it out

343
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Attention please

344
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,880
Who would have thought, Zhao Qian and Liu Renkai

345
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
Could find me so easily

346
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
This means they are in a hurry.

347
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
They are in a hurry to cause trouble.

348
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
So where are you going now?

349
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Where else can I go?

350
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm afraid I won't have a chance in the future.

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Let's go there one last time.

352
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Okay.

353
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
The neighbors reported the police.

354
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I heard someone knocking on the door and locking the door.

355
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Pay attention.

356
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
There's blood on the door.

357
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Xiao Man.

358
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
When did the technical staff arrive?

359
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
They are on their way.

360
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Did the person who found Liu Buyan

361
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
have something to do with Zhao Qian's car accident?

362
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Master, the surveillance is a bit strange.

363
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
He brought that infrared sensor.

364
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Usually, the old man in the police station uses it to secure the house.

365
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
But the police officer is not here.

366
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
He's not here.

367
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Liu Buyan has Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's disease.

368
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
He's basically an old man.

369
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Da Jun.

370
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
When we first came here,

371
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
was the surveillance in that position?

372
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
This position definitely wasn't there.

373
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I'll take the surveillance material back to the team.

374
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
You'll have to report thatIt was novel.

375
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
There's the sameind one with that.

376
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
The seniors reported that

377
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
what Tu Xuechen revealed was a natural line in the noise.

378
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
But losing the excellent sense of place

379
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
and feel of time

380
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
What's the relationship between Liu Zixuan and Yang Yan?

381
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,800
Do you think

382
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
this painting is like a map?

383
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
If it's a map,

384
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,400
then there must be a end.

385
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,000
You mean...

386
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
This...

387
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
What do you mean?

388
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Didn't your team say

389
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
the truth is measured by the feet?

390
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Then let's go find this end for him.

391
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's go.

392
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
Measure it for him.

393
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
Go to the place where Liu Zixuan disappeared.

394
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,800
What?

395
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,800
Ma,

396
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,600
turn on the drone and look around.

397
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,400
Liu Zixuan's schoolbag was found here.

398
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
This is the tree drawn on the map.

399
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Here.

400
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Liu Zixuan

401
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
should have entered from here.

402
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Liu Zixuan

403
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Liu Zixuan

404
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Liu Zixuan

405
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Liu Zixuan

406
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,600
The water is warm.

407
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
We came a step late.

408
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's go.

409
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
Mr. Zhong,

410
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
there's a bottle of drug,

411
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
a drug for cancer.

412
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,800
This is not for treating cancer.

413
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
It's my fault.

414
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,000
I was careless.

415
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
According to Zhong Ning's ability,

416
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,600
he will find this sooner or later.

417
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Liu Zixuan knows Yang Yan?

418
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Maybe.

419
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
But this possibility

420
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
can make the disappearance case

421
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,000
and the mountain crime case

422
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
form a subtle connection.

423
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Everything has a prelude.

424
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
It's all cause and effect.

425
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,400
Okay.

426
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
No waste of time.

427
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
I'll go upstairs and talk to him.

428
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
I'll go upstairs and talk to him.

429
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Got it.

430
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,000
The bloodstain found in Liao Boyan's house

431
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
and the criminal suspect

432
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
who was brought up from Xiao Dao De's mouth

433
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
are completely compatible.

434
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
The murderer is Liu Renkai's horse boy,

435
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Changlong.

436
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,000
Chuo Hao is A'long.

437
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,800
And

438
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,800
the surveillance camera in Liao Boyan's house

439
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,600
has locked an old acquaintance for us.

440
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Who?

441
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Liu Renkai.

442
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,800
One year later

443
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,500
May I have your attention?

444
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,800
The environment is complex.

445
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
First, we have to ensure the safety of the innocent.

446
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
Take a look.

447
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,000
Sorry to disturb.

448
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Small arms need no mercy.

449
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Please.

450
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Thank you.

451
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm sorry.

452
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Are you full?

453
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Let's go.

454
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm full.

455
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Boss.

456
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't eat too much.

457
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Okay.

458
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Let's go.

459
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
A'Long is missing.

460
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Brother Zhou, the chute is missing.

461
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Get the gun.

462
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Go.

463
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Brother Zhou,

464
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
The police are on the chase.

465
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Hurry up and go.

466
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm sorry.

467
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,640
Mr. Zhao.

468
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,040
Something happened.

469
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I haven't heard you call me Mr. Zhao for a long time.

470
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
It seems that this is not a small matter.

471
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,640
Maybe our work has been exposed.

472
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
We?

473
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Brother Kai.

474
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,720
Some things

475
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,480
are not always beneficial to me.

476
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,560
You have a chance to survive

477
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,320
if you don't fall.

478
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,240
I'm here.

479
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,040
Your wife and son are taken care of.

480
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,120
Why are you talking about my son?

481
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
What does he mean?

482
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,240
You borrowed money from me

483
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
to run away.

484
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,720
What?

485
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
One million.

486
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,120
I can't help you with this.

487
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
Is the situation tense?

488
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,160
My question is

489
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:39,460
that is the

490
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,440
husband.

491
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
Is there a homity?

492
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,720
For the case,

493
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,140
you can just tell all of us.

494
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,120
OK.

495
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,760
The daughter...

496
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,160
is our daughter.

497
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,400
She said she would leave in half an hour.

498
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,320
Call Xiao Ma. Hurry.

499
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,760
Hello.

500
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Is your car behind me?

501
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,200
Sir, Dr. Zhong said Liu Ren Kai's phone is not working.

502
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,000
Continue.

503
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,120
Do you believe Liu Ren Kai will go home to find Sun Ting?

504
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,960
And then?

505
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,200
I think there's a more suspicious place.

506
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,560
Liu Ren Kai has another home.

507
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,280
Stop the car on the side. I'll come over and meet you.

508
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,520
Okay.

509
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Brother Yuan, why don't we stop the car on the side and wait for me?

510
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,560
Is this the community where Liu Ren Kai's wife lives?

511
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,760
Yes.

512
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,720
Stop.

513
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,600
Brother Ning, my master means

514
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,200
to stop the car on the side, not in the middle of the road.

515
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,080
Call Liu Ren Kai.

516
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,840
Liu Ren Kai.

517
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,200
Liu Ren Kai.

518
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,600
Let's go.

519
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
nosy

520
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,560
Brother Ning, wait there.

521
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,640
I'll send someone immediately.

522
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Don't shoot.

523
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,360
No.

524
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,600
Cops?

525
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
The car is so fast.

526
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Liu Rongcai is heading to Lu Xishan.

527
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
He wants to leave the city.

528
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
The highway is blocked. He can't leave.

529
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
The car is so fast.

530
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
He can't leave.

531
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
The highway is blocked.

532
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
He can't leave.

533
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
The highway is blocked.

534
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
The highway is blocked.

535
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
The highway is blocked.

536
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
The highway is blocked.

537
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
The highway is blocked.

538
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
The highway is blocked.

539
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
The highway is blocked.

540
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
The highway is blocked.

541
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
The highway is blocked.

542
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
The highway is blocked.

543
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
The highway is blocked.

544
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
The highway is blocked.

545
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
The highway is blocked.

546
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
The highway is blocked.

547
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
The highway is blocked.

548
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
The highway is blocked.

549
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
The highway is blocked.

550
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
The highway is blocked.

551
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
The highway is blocked.

552
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
The highway is blocked.

553
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
The highway is blocked.

554
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
The highway is blocked.

555
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
The highway is blocked.

556
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
The highway is blocked.

557
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
The highway is blocked.

558
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
The highway is blocked.

559
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Get off, the vaers!

560
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,680
Stir oil

561
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,280
Can't burn anything

562
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,360
No

563
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,740
Senior

564
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Tony

565
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,560
Master

566
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,780
The

567
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
The

568
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,780
