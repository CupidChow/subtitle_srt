00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,340
Your daughter's...

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,220
Level 4

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,520
The malignant level is high, the effect of the pre-opening is poor.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,020
And his position is very bad.

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,220
So the surgery is very difficult.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,620
Now, the last hope

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,820
is to talk to my student, Liao Boyan.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,420
He is an international top brain neurosurgeon.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,720
He has been working abroad.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,620
A few days ago, he went back to attend an academic conference.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,020
I already showed him your daughter's information.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,620
If he also isn't sure,

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,020
then...

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,020
Where did mom go?

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,220
Mom went on a business trip.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,820
When will he come back?

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,220
When we are all healed,

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,220
and we are discharged from the hospital,

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,220
mom will come back.

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,020
Okay?

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,420
Okay.

33
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,220
The End

34
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,020
Auntie Zhang, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,020
I lied to you that day.

36
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,220
But what I want to do is the same as what you want.

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,020
Find the truth and give your family justice.

38
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,420
Thank you for saving my life.

39
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,220
I want justice.

40
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,420
Auntie Zhang, don't worry.

41
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,220
Justice will come.

42
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,420
Oh, right. The picture that fell that day,

43
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,220
we fixed it for you and changed it to a photo frame.

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,820
Okay.

45
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,420
I'll put it here for you.

46
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,420
Auntie Zhang, do you remember the song,

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,820
The Lover?

48
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Yong Mo and Li Juan often play it for Tong Tong.

49
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,220
Is there anything strange about them playing this song?

50
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
What's strange about the song?

51
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,220
I read the question and answer report.

52
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,020
You told the police that Zhao Qian ruined Yang Yong Mo's family.

53
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,620
But there's one question that you never answered.

54
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,620
It's about what's Yang Yong Mo's attitude towards Zhao Qian.

55
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,020
Zhao Qian said that

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,820
Yang Yong Mo likes her on one hand.

57
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,820
Zhao Qian just treats her as an ordinary friend.

58
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,620
He's lying. He's lying.

59
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,220
It's not like that. He's lying.

60
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,620
It's not like that.

61
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,020
Don't be so agitated.

62
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,420
That's why we need you to tell us the truth.

63
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
The truth?

64
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,820
Don't be so shy.

65
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,020
Don't be so shy.

66
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,820
Since he's living so painfully,

67
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,420
why don't you go and free him?

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,220
Yang Yong Mo.

69
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,020
Li Juan!

70
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,220
Are you okay?

71
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,020
Li Juan.

72
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,300
Stop crying.

73
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Just say that, when Luo Li Juan was pregnant,

74
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,820
Zhao Qian.

75
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,340
They were

76
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,660
in a good relationship.

77
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,260
It's all because of Zhao Qian.

78
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,300
It's all because of Zhao Qian.

79
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,340
You're here to torture my aunt again, right?

80
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,340
Good.

81
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,980
You don't want her to live, right?

82
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,820
It's because of your misdeeds

83
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,900
that the murderer was released.

84
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,340
He's dying.

85
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,060
What are you doing?

86
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,900
I'm broadcasting the news

87
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,540
to the public.

88
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,620
The police

89
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,420
are investigating the case.

90
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Please don't interfere.

91
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,780
We have the right to know the facts.

92
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,900
We have to make it clear.

93
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,620
Please leave.

94
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,260
Please leave.

95
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,980
Say it here.

96
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,940
Don't make a scene.

97
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,820
Say it here.

98
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,700
Do you understand?

99
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,860
Fans, can't you see?

100
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,500
This is how the police do the case.

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,820
This is how they protect us.

102
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,860
You're not paying?

103
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
I've paid.

104
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,980
You haven't?

105
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,260
I paid just now.

106
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,220
What are you doing?

107
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,060
You haven't paid.

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,180
I've paid.

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,620
Why are you doing this?

110
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,140
Why are you always like this?

111
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,020
Pay me.

112
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,940
Pay me.

113
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Oh my god.

114
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,140
Are you sick?

115
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,060
You're crazy.

116
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,220
You still want to take it?

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,740
I have to pay for shopping.

118
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,340
I've paid.

119
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,060
Don't go.

120
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
I'm not paying.

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm not paying.

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,860
I'm not paying.

123
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm not paying.

124
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm not paying.

125
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,580
I'm not paying.

126
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm not paying.

127
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
I'll pay for her.

128
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Wu Shi.

129
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,540
Why did you call Wu 빨?

130
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,380
Wu Bri's not here right now.

131
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,220
I want to call him.

132
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,660
Tell him Tong Rong and Wu subscriber

133
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,140
paid the police first.

134
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,300
Todo Zwift didn't pay the police.

135
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,580
It's engraved in Wu's ear.

136
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Tell him...

137
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,900
Go, tell him Tong Rong paid the police.

138
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,780
Go, temperature him and ferret her.

139
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,260
He got her下來.

140
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,940
It's odd to playadaim.

141
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,460
Zhu Yan wanted to be the judge wings.

142
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,300
mentioning Zhong's identity in the newspaper club.

143
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,020
That boy...

144
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,220
A year ago,

145
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,340
you saved Ren Xi's life.

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,620
I don't remember.

147
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,780
Shoulder it.

148
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,740
What's up?

149
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
I...

150
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
You didn't lie to me, right?

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,420
How dare I lie to you?

152
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm really investigating that guy who bought the medicine.

153
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Did you wipe it?

154
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Almost.

155
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Almost.

156
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Three days.

157
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
I'll give you three days.

158
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Madam.

159
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
What's wrong with you?

160
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,620
I feel so bad.

161
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,420
You feel bad? I feel bad too.

162
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Hurry up and buy it.

163
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,220
Useless.

164
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,220
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
Where is the child's parents?

166
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Why did he faint?

167
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
You don't know him?

168
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
I don't know him.

169
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Call an ambulance.

170
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Wake up, kid. Wake up.

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
What's going on?

172
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Hello, is this 120?

173
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
He fainted.

174
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
I just fainted.

175
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Stop!

176
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
I'm here to thank you.

179
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,220
My wife told me that someone sent my son to the hospital

180
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
and charged him with medical fees.

181
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
You're so deep in it.

182
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,220
You don't look like a rich man.

183
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
It's so refreshing to get medical fees.

184
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Why don't you be more refreshing

185
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
and give me 70 million?

186
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Change my son's kidney.

187
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Thank you.

188
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
You're still not going to admit it?

189
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Don't force me to talk to you.

190
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Do you know Kai Ge and Liu Ren Kai?

191
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
He's not as easy to talk to as I am.

192
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
What do you want?

193
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,220
I want to help you hide a secret of a killer.

194
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
You killed him.

195
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
You killed him.

196
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
You killed him.

197
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
But it wasn't your plan.

198
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
They were kidding.

199
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
I didn't see anything.

200
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,540
I have to make sure he doesn't fall asleep at night.

201
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,900
I have to talk to his subordinate.

202
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

203
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,460
Director Cao, hello.

204
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,460
I'm Zhong Ming. Do you remember me?

205
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,620
Oh, Xiao Zhong?

206
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,780
I want to ask you about someone.

207
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,580
Liao Boyan, your student.

208
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,020
Seven years ago, she had a brain tumor surgery on my daughter.

209
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,620
What do you want to know? Hurry and ask.

210
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,820
You know Liao Boyan?

211
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,340
Do you know what's going on with Dr. Liao?

212
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,420
I think I know.

213
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Why did she become like this?

214
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,820
You know, she's been developing abroad.

215
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Five years ago, I was the one who persuaded her to return to China.

216
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,580
She was moved and agreed to bring her wife and daughter back.

217
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,620
At that time, several famous hospitals in China sent her invitations.

218
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I didn't expect it.

219
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,020
Her daughter, Liao Yifan, was hit by a car in front of her husband.

220
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,780
The driver ran away.

221
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,380
He hasn't been caught in five years.

222
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,380
After this incident, Liao Boyan's life was completely over.

223
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,100
She had severe psychological disorders.

224
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,020
Her wife got divorced.

225
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,020
She also had a son's cancer.

226
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,500
I was discharged from the hospital.

227
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,900
After the surgery, I started eating vegetarian food.

228
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,700
You made so many dishes. What do you want from me?

229
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,300
Let's just drink this first.

230
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,100
Everyone told me to drink less.

231
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,620
Only you told me to drink it all.

232
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,700
Because I treat you as a friend.

233
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,900
I know what you really want.

234
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,100
What?

235
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
You want to forget?

236
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,100
I already have Alzheimer's.

237
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Forgetting things doesn't require drinking.

238
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,900
But I want you to remember the past.

239
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
So what if I remember?

240
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm not a doctor anymore. I can't help you.

241
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,300
I'm not a police officer anymore.

242
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
But it won't affect my investigation.

243
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
There's a recent case.

244
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,100
The victim was shot and killed by excessive blood.

245
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,700
The murderer controlled the time of death very well.

246
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,300
This means that the murderer needs to accurately control the method and the measure.

247
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,900
That means that the murderer has a certain medical experience.

248
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,500
You can just find a doctor for this question.

249
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,900
Why do you want to find a useless person like me?

250
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,100
Dr. Liang, I hope that through this case,

251
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
you can get better and help more people.

252
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,900
You think I'm boring and want to help me find something to do?

253
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,500
You can also understand that.

254
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
Your name is Zhong Ning?

255
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,300
Officer Zhong, why are you so caring to me?

256
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,100
Because you helped me before.

257
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
I want to repay your kindness.

258
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,300
What is it?

259
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,500
His wife left two days ago due to an accident.

260
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Dr. Liang, what should we do?

261
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Those bottles are imported medicine. There aren't many left.

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,300
Several children are waiting to use them.

263
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,100
I checked them carefully when I came out of the key.

264
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
They disappeared when I got here.

265
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,100
You don't know if you're not working here.

266
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,900
This is not the first time.

267
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,300
You're a police officer. We need your help.

268
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
The hospital lost medicine.

269
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,100
A lot of children must use this medicine before surgery.

270
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Without this medicine, you can't save your daughter's life.

271
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,300
The medicine was in this row before. It's gone.

272
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,700
Did you see anyone suspicious go in?

273
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,300
No.

274
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm afraid from now on,

275
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,900
that's why I added this medicine here.

276
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,700
We still need to use them.

277
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
What's the result of the medicine?

278
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,300
I don't know if it is the result.

279
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Answer me.

280
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,500
I asked the nurse's office,

281
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I checked the medicine list.

282
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,940
I found that the lost medicines are all the same type.

283
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,180
But there are more valuable medicines on the cart.

284
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,500
But the thief didn't understand.

285
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,260
He probably doesn't understand.

286
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,820
No, he understands.

287
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,060
He is a medicine expert.

288
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,580
He can accurately and quickly

289
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,260
find the same type of medicine in a pile of medicines.

290
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Am I right?

291
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,220
You're asking me?

292
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,860
You can also ask that nurse.

293
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,260
She is your partner.

294
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,140
You are indeed a good policeman.

295
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,340
I am no longer a policeman.

296
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,940
You acted out a scene of the police catching thieves.

297
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,620
What do you want?

298
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,380
You want to trick me?

299
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,020
I'll find something to do for you.

300
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,420
Let your brain move.

301
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,820
I am familiar with the brain.

302
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,740
Some need surgery.

303
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,860
Some need medicines.

304
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,020
Some need to drink alcohol.

305
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,700
Let's start over, Zhong Nian.

306
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,820
Start over?

307
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
How?

308
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,580
My daughter might die at any moment.

309
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,820
They told me that she would die for the rest of her life.

310
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,700
I will definitely give her this life.

311
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,860
I will definitely give her this life.

312
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:37,900
After she is well, she will need a father who doesn't drink and is sober.

313
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,460
I can only trust you.

314
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,700
You not only saved my daughter,

315
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
but also saved me.

316
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,660
Not everyone is willing to face the past.

317
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,740
I can't wait to be more beautiful than you.

318
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,100
I want to be in your family.

319
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,820
Do you want to forget your daughter?

320
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,140
I can't drink with you in a cup.

321
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Dr. Liao, I understand your situation.

322
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,180
You let me live a good life before.

323
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,420
Now I also want you to live a good life.

324
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,740
If there is anything I can do, you must tell me.

325
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,740
I will try my best.

326
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,180
You understand me?

327
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,860
Why?

328
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,620
Because your daughter, Zhong Ren Xi, is sick.

329
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,940
She didn't really die.

330
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,020
When Zhong Ren Xi really died, you will understand me.

331
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,660
rebusiness

332
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,900
your drink.

333
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,540
Thank you.

334
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,140
Thank you.

335
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,340
I'll see you in my own place, then.

336
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,060
and i feel complicated

337
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:55,780
so..

338
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,660
Did you think about it?

339
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,900
What will you do now?

340
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,460
I have two ideas

341
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,100
and you want me to tell you

342
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,860
I remember

343
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,220
I will not think about it

344
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,260
Because

345
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,100
I have an idea

346
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,580
you want to learn one thing

347
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,140
And약

348
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,100
Ouch

349
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,520
Nanny

350
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Nanny

351
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,460
Nanny

352
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,980
Nanny

353
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,760
Actually I made a progress

354
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,780
But I never got the chance

355
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,580
You two

356
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,200
Go out for dinner

357
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,880
What are youupprPhased by

358
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,140
I just want to have something good for you

359
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
I'm in a good mood.

360
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,740
I'll sign this.

361
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,100
Good.

362
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,660
Actually, when your dad was a kid,

363
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,860
he only had a few exams.

364
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,820
If you had done this earlier,

365
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,780
I would have given you a heart attack.

366
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,020
Let's go eat something delicious.

367
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,940
Go.

368
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,740
Go.

369
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,780
Let's go eat delicious food.

370
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,540
Actually, let's go eat delicious food.

371
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,380
Let's go.

372
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Let's go.

373
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,140
Let's go.

374
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,820
Let's go.

375
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,660
Let's go.

376
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,300
Let's go.

377
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,980
Let's go.

378
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,620
Let's go.

379
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,820
Let's go eat.

380
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,860
The murderer and Zhao Qian and Yang You Mo

381
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,700
look like a group of secret agents.

382
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,020
Because the murderer had a plan.

383
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,580
I think it's revenge.

384
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,740
Why is the murderer so perverted?

385
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,140
He forced Yang You Mo to play a death game.

386
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,500
He threw the kidnapped Zhao Qian into the trash can.

387
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,340
It must be a deep grudge.

388
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,500
So he used such a complicated crime method

389
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,220
to commit crimes.

390
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,820
The purpose is to

391
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,620
give the victim a mental test.

392
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Ke Ran, please tell everyone

393
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,300
the social relations between Yang You Mo and Zhao Qian.

394
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,860
We've already investigated

395
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,820
both of them.

396
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,620
The opponent of the bidding,

397
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,700
the enemy of the business,

398
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,980
the businessman of the transportation office,

399
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,820
and the people who have a personal grudge like Fang Qing Chun.

400
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,220
It seems that no one is suspicious.

401
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,020
Wait.

402
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,420
What transportation office?

403
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,380
Zhao Qian hit a red light a year ago.

404
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,180
The person hit the road was a minor injury.

405
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,540
It is said that Zhao Qian's compensation is very good.

406
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,780
The matter did not grow later.

407
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,500
Zhao Qian did not hit a red light for the first time.

408
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,420
He was caught red-handed five years ago.

409
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,140
Zhong Tian.

410
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,380
What do you want to say?

411
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,180
Nothing.

412
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,020
You can continue.

413
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,780
Let me tell you

414
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,420
the situation of the black market.

415
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,820
We have found that there is a deal this afternoon.

416
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,620
The location is near the black market.

417
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,700
Dajun, you go to arrest him.

418
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,100
After arresting him,

419
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,020
give me the source of the medicine.

420
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,460
Police.

421
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,620
Take him back.

422
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,140
Go.

423
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,420
What's the good news?

424
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,220
This guy finally knows everything.

425
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,020
This person.

426
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,220
He has a lot of cash.

427
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,620
He bought the drug and the evidence.

428
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,660
Basically, he is looking for him.

429
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,580
The mouth is open.

430
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,460
Xie Wuqiang.

431
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,260
Go.

432
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,180
Attack.

433
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,860
Attack.

434
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,820
Brother.

435
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,300
Brother.

436
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,420
Win money again.

437
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,900
Brother.

438
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Tonight's phone is on.

439
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,620
Brother.

440
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,700
I am destined to have a rich life.

441
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,460
Brother.

442
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,100
What the hell?

443
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,140
Let's play a game.

444
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,900
Win or lose, we will die.

445
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,860
There is only 1.5 kilometers from the hospital.

446
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,740
From now on, you stop breathing for less than ten minutes.

447
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,940
Run.

448
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,020
Don't lose like Yang Youmo.

449
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,740
What are you doing?

450
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,020
Get out of the way.

451
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,420
Get the 400 rounds.

452
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,020
Get the 400 rounds.

453
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,740
Get out of the way.

454
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,380
What are you doing?

455
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,020
Get out of the way.

456
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,700
What are you doing?

457
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,980
You see him.

458
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,420
Get away.

459
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,620
Mhyuck.

460
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,740
Alright, get away.

461
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,700
What are you doing?

462
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Get out of the way.

463
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,980
Get out of the way.

464
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Move!

465
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
Move!

466
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Move!

467
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Move!

468
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
Move!

469
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Watch out!

470
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Be careful!

471
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
What are you doing?

472
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,300
Come on.

473
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Hurry up.

474
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,980
Are you blind?

475
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Move!

476
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Hurry up.

477
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
Doctor.

478
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
Doctor, save me.

479
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,940
Someone is trying to kill me.

480
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Doctor.

481
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Doctor.

482
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
Doctor.

483
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Save me.

484
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Doctor.

485
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
Wake up.

486
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
Wake up.

487
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
Kai.

488
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Kai.

489
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Long...

490
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Long.

491
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
You killed Yang You Mo.

492
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
You even acted with me.

493
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
Kai.

494
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
