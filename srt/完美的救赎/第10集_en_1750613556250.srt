Ode team

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
noises

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:30,960
Come on.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,240
Stop.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
You.

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Hello.

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,880
Bring my son downstairs.

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,800
Find Bei Bei's photos.

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,520
I will get his photos too...

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
He has this wish.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
You have to keep it.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Okay.

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Didn't he always treat us like dogs yesterday?

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I thought of a good place to hide this.

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
I almost died.

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I couldn't find this.

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520

I'm sorry.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
We went to the amusement park in the afternoon.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,660
Rate it big if it cheated him too soon.

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,240
Only a operates if it's real.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
But it was prisional then.

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,960
You alone took your personal personal grudges with you.

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,180
Did anyone 올라� her into your own done business?

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Nee.

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,440
You're quite a backwards person.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,100
That's because I got you to 모자� programmingbox.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,780
It's all good.

73
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,800
Waiting for you,

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,940
I might as well fucking leave.

75
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,700
Can't wait to find you.

76
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,340
That's me...

77
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,780
Waiting for you

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
for years at Tower Schim today.

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,580
I haven't told I'll be with you for a while.

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
No need to?

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,160
Good night.

82
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm Чет some stuff out.

83
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,740
I'll visit you later.

84
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,740
Enjoy yourself!

85
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,720
it's too early to ride or hike on anyone.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,280
We can join one and enjoy it in a practical way.

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,400
Hey.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Easy, easy.

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,740
Are you totally nuts?

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,580
You didn't know just now?

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,540
Your judge has failed you,

92
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,000
you and your rival is now partners.

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,160
What's wrong with you?

94
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,100
All gets screwed even that

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,140
the stabilized accommodation and the

96
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,640
money money

97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,700
and deals in weight should all collapse.

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,860
to tell the truth.

99
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,140
Are you helping Liu Renkai?

100
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,020
Sir,

101
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,620
Li Xiang's biological information

102
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,780
is not compatible with

103
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,460
the biological information

104
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,020
at the scene of Xiao Yade's death.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,180
It's a matter of expectation.

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,620
The witness said

107
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,860
the suspect was a fat man.

108
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,180
The witness only saw one suspect.

109
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,700
He can't exclude

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
other suspects.

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,500
And his accomplices.

112
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,220
Li Xiang

113
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,380
took the stuff hidden in the front bed.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,220
It must be related to him.

115
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,180
I understand what you mean.

116
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,460
A big fat man.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,580
But this guy

118
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,980
can only be considered a fat man.

119
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,060
A big fat man

120
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,980
is really a big deal.

121
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,180
Boss,

122
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,780
sister-in-law.

123
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,180
brush her hair and get a haircut again.

124
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,500
Which one do you get?

125
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:08,080
frankens

126
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,820
Honey, you're back.

127
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,940
I'm back.

128
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,980
Do I sound nice?

129
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,300
If you like me,

130
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,780
I'll stop talking to you, okay?

131
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,300
I'm just like the fox who gave you a son.

132
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,060
I can do that.

133
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,580
Where are you going?

134
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,300
Are you going to find that fox?

135
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,100
No problem.

136
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,580
No problem?

137
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,420
Didn't I say

138
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,300
you can find me if you want to find the fox?

139
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,940
I'll wake you up.

140
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,940
Where are you going?

141
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,420
No way.

142
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
You'reallyí?

143
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,740
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,100
I need to run.

145
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,220
How did you use the red envelope worth thousands of yuan?

146
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
How did you use it?

147
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,420
Speak!

148
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,820
My classmate's family is very poor and pitiful.

149
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,420
I gave him all my money.

150
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Zhang Zixuan, why are you so kind?

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,220
He's pitiful? Look at your mom, am I pitiful?

152
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
It hurts.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,020
It hurts?

154
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,820
It hurts here.

155
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,220
Come.

156
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Show my good daughter.

157
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,620
Look. Your dad raised a woman outside.

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,220
You gave him a son. He doesn't want us anymore.

159
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,020
We two are the only ones who are pitiful.

160
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Why aren't you a boy?

161
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Why do you have long hair?

162
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
My baby.

163
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Zhang Zixuan

164
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,820
Dr. Liao.

165
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,600
���따

166
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
When the fish interesting

167
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,360
Fool door

168
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,400
me

169
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,120
do

170
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,000
Is said

171
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,480
Let me sleep

172
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,840
that day you and Ren Xi

173
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200

My daughter had been there

177
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
She likes it there

178
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,920
You remembered it wrong.

179
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,520
You didn't take your daughter there.

180
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,720
This amusement park is less than two sides of the night market.

181
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
I didn't remember it wrong. I took my daughter there.

182
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Le Le, what is it?

183
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,120
Lawyer Zhou, a child sent you something to the law firm.

184
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
What is it?

185
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Let me see. It's called Mom's diary.

186
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,320
You mean the notebook that Luo Yijuan sent you

187
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
is exactly the same as this one?

188
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
Yes.

189
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Put it down. Don't move. I'll be right back.

190
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Lawyer, I have an emergency. I'll be leaving first.

191
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
Give me this.

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,720
What kind of child?

193
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,520
Just an ordinary child?

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,920
You know what a boy and a girl are, right?

195
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
You're not asking directly. It's just a boy.

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,120
What kind of boy?

197
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Just an ordinary boy.

198
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,520
Okay. Drink some water. Drink more.

199
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,320
How much is the salary on the front desk per month?

200
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Is it because the salary is too low and people have a bad temper?

201
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,320
I just need a little bit more.

202
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
You'll be able to read easily.

203
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
Leave it.

204
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Take a look over there later.

205
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
Okay.

206
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,420
I'm really living well this year.

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,220
and played her favorite hide-and-seek.

208
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,420
The sun was shining outside.

209
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,820
Only Tong Tong and I were left in tears.

210
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,020
I took her out for a walk.

211
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,820
Who knew that I would meet a ghost standing under the sun?

212
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,620
The ghost sang the hide-and-seek for us.

213
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,820
It made me and Tong Tong cry together.

214
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,420
I suddenly remembered what the ghost said.

215
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,020
Why must we live so painfully?

216
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,820
Why not be free?

217
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,620
Is this diary of your mother

218
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,820
really written in such a strange way

219
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,620
under the circumstances of Luo Li Juan?

220
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,020
It's torn, Master.

221
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,620
Too bad.

222
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,020
It's not my fault.

223
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,020
The good things you did for me

224
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,320
that I failed to��

225
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Yes.

226
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,420
I'm going out now.

227
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
The day Luo Lijuan committed suicide

228
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
March 20

229
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
What does it say?

230
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Who tore it?

231
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
I can't see it clearly

232
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
I can't see it clearly

233
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
I can't see it clearly

234
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
I can't see it clearly

235
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,020
If you know the answer, you know who the murderer is

236
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
I can't see it clearly

237
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Brother Kai, is this the position you should sit in?

238
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
It was not before

239
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
From now on

240
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,020
That's it

241
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Mr. Zhao

242
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
It's time

243
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
to prepare a good position

244
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
Enough

245
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
You go out first

246
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,020
Okay, Mr. Zhao

247
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Liu Renkai

248
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,020
You are so rude today

249
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,020
What do you want?

250
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I've done a dirty thing for you for so long

251
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,020
You should let me wipe my hands

252
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Are you clean?

253
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
Mr. Zhao, you can do it

254
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Liu Renkai can do it

255
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
I said

256
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
I want to stand under the sun

257
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
It's good to stand under the sun

258
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Then you should do what you should do

259
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
Do it for me

260
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
The person who wants to hurt me

261
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,020
You haven't found it yet

262
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,020
The person who hurt you hasn't found it yet

263
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,020
But I found one

264
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Something that can hurt you

265
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Sister

266
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
You've been late for four years

267
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Mr. Zhao is in the office

268
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
You are so rude

269
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
It's not your turn to talk to me

270
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
You go out first

271
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
You go out first

272
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
Qianqian

273
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
You should think about me

274
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Mr. Qian

275
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,020
You should be more serious

276
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Because of that portrait

277
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
What's good about it?

278
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,020
You are drunk

279
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
You are drunk

280
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
You want to get rid of me?

281
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
You are not afraid

282
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
I will tell you about the past

283
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
You are in the chairman's company

284
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Donate money to the paramedics

285
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
To the paramedics

286
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
The chairman knows about it

287
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
The chairman knows about it?

288
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
You are wrong

289
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Corruption

290
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Internal bribery

291
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
You did all these

292
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I didn't do it

293
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
You designed me

294
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
I'm just protecting myself

295
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Just with these photos?

296
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,020
Sister Zhao

297
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
If these things are exposed

298
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
It's none of your business

299
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Just wait for the end of the crisis

300
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Mr. Zhao

301
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Go get Liu Renkai

302
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Okay

303
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Brother Kai

304
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
You are threatening me

305
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Brother Kai

306
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Did you forget

307
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
How Qian Cheng

308
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
Killed himself?

309
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
How could I forget

310
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
The reason I didn't

311
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Give this to you

312
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
The reason I didn't

313
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Give this to the police

314
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,020
Is because

315
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
You are drunk

316
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
What do you want?

317
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm here

318
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Thank you very much

319
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Mr. Zhao

320
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
For giving us such a good platform

321
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Let us have a chance

322
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
For these sick children

323
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
To do our best

324
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Mr. Liu, congratulations

325
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Husband

326
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Your wife is here

327
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Wife

328
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
Zi Xuan

329
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Take a picture for us

330
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Let me introduce you

331
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
This is my good wife

332
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
This is my baby daughter

333
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Come on, smile

334
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Smile

335
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Okay

336
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
It's me

337
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Secretary

338
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
They are giving charity

339
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
What are you doing?

340
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
I'm watching

341
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
I'm watching

342
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
I'm watching

343
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
I'm watching

344
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
I'm watching

345
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
I'm watching

346
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Please

347
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
I'm watching

348
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Okay

349
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
This time, we are invited

350
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
To join the music festival

351
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Mom

352
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Can I go out with my girlfriend tomorrow?

353
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Don't bother me

354
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Director said

355
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
If you want to go to the airport

356
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
You have to go to the city

357
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:02,760
The

358
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,460
Passport in the first room.

359
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,460
You should be satisfied.

360
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,860
You have been chosen

361
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,980
for the office for an hour.

362
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,340
That's it?

363
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,620
Isn't it exactly as you wish?

364
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,220
Under the sun.

365
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
The sunset.

366
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,580
The sunset of the mountain.

367
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,740
You use the sunset to look after me.

368
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,100
Don't shout so loudly.

369
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,340
This is not your casino.

370
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,740
It's the green clouds of the Zhao family.

371
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,860
You killed me.

372
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,540
What can you gain from it?

373
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,980
Here.

374
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,820
Drink some water.

375
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,660
It'll help you calm down.

376
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,300
We've been

377
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,580
too nervous lately.

378
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,500
You could have won both.

379
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,940
I'm safe and sound.

380
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,980
You're rich and glorious.

381
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,340
Right, Kai?

382
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,820
You got it from the past.

383
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,340
It's not just a recording, right?

384
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,580
Speaking of the past,

385
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,860
it's quite a good experience.

386
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,260
The dirty deeds you've done

387
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,460
for him in the past few years,

388
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,540
the internal bribery,

389
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,500
the manipulation of the shares,

390
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,620
and the bribery behind the ambulance,

391
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,180
he left evidence behind.

392
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,780
Maybe one day,

393
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,780
he doesn't want to be your scapegoat.

394
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,020
I thought the wooden dolls controlled by Mr. Zhao

395
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,180
were all made by the same person.

396
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,500
There are exceptions.

397
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,220
Exception?

398
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,860
Are you talking about the future

399
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,260
or yourself?

400
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
I need to make it clear.

401
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,820
I've never been a model.

402
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,820
I'm a man of my word.

403
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,500
I'm doing business

404
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,740
under the sun.

405
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,620
It's good to do business.

406
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,060
You're rich and glorious.

407
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
I'm safe and sound.

408
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,380
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

409
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,020
Kai is a strong partner.

410
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,500
Mr. Zhong,

411
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,940
you're more and more like a police consultant.

412
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,740
Mr. Zhao is more and more like a philanthropist.

413
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,820
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

414
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,260
Do you know Li Xiang?

415
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,860
Yes.

416
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,980
He used to work for me.

417
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,060
He told me about some things that are related to you.

418
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,020
Please go back to the police station with us

419
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,900
and take the investigation.

420
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,940
Mr. Zhao,

421
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,540
I have something to talk to you about.

422
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,780
You may have a misunderstanding.

423
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,180
Liu Renkai can sit in that office

424
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,900
because it's Liyun's internal decision.

425
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,500
There's no threat.

426
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,940
There's no threat.

427
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,420
Besides, I'm a witness.

428
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,060
There's no threat.

429
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,860
Mr. Zhao, you must have forgotten

430
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,740
that someone wants to kill you.

431
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,220
Killing is illegal.

432
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,860
I'm relieved that you police

433
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,780
are protecting the police and arresting the murderer.

434
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,540
Mr. Zhao,

435
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,580
I need you for something important.

436
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,780
Can you do the investigation with Mr. Zhong?

437
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,340
Mr. Zhao, you should get back to your work.

438
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,860
The Bureau of Reconciliation

439
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,260
and the Bureau of Investigation have especially told me

440
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,980
that we can investigate

441
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,580
but we can't affect the production of Liyun.

442
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,700
The Bureau of Reconciliation?

443
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,540
The Bureau of Investigation?

444
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,780
The case is so serious that the government will take over the case.

445
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,540
The murderer can't escape

446
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,900
from such a situation.

447
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,420
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

448
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,060
Excuse me.

449
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,300
There are 3 cases beingazzled in this Bureau.

450
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,860
We've all got in touch with the Cabinet.

451
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Speaking of trap,

452
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,820
could it be about the case who did it?

453
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,340
Have you ever experienced a crime like this?

454
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,380
The next ash Tina

455
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,500
is certain to cutest to the mind.

456
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,740
She said that Li Fei is too Hot

457
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,120
of course they knew

458
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,600
It's enough

459
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,440
LiICiang is inата

460
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,300
Certain punishment

461
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,980
you

462
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,980
You knew it in advance, right?

463
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,680
This Ah Xiang, it's not the first time he's done this kind of thing.

464
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:38,660
Don't be so

465
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm going to let go of the fire today

466
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,260
It's also a big fire for the economy of Hong Kong

467
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,180
Let him burn endlessly

468
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,780
Liu Yun Kai

469
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,220
After Zhao Yinghong was paralyzed

470
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,740
You didn't pass by Liyun Group, did you?

471
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,860
So high-profile today

472
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Even Zhao Qian is a head lower than you

473
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,100
Great

474
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,900
That's because Zhao Yinghong is a love-hate

475
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,660
I don't believe

476
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,780
Zhao Qian, what kind of person

477
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,340
You and I don't know

478
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,980
Can do that to you

479
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,660
You kid must have something in your hand

480
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,140
What's the thing that's going to kill him, right?

481
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,260
In Qian Cheng's hand

482
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,380
Hid a pair of entertainment hall storage keys

483
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,220
Fang Qingchun's house was burned

484
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,700
Lost a pair of keys

485
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,620
We know Li Xiang is in the entertainment hall

486
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,580
In the storage cabinet

487
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Took something

488
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:46,940
That thing is in your hand

489
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,420
What is that thing

490
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,540
You should ask Ah Xiang

491
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,420
What is that thing

492
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:03,740
You should ask Ah Xiang

493
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,140
Let's talk about Qian Cheng

494
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,900
Didn't you ask before?

495
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,540
Fang Qingchun always thinks

496
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Qian Cheng's death has another secret

497
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,660
And you know what's going on

498
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,500
He's right

499
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,580
Qian Cheng's death

500
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,500
There is another reason

501
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,780
What's the reason

502
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,500
He's actually been pursuing me

503
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,860
But I have no feelings for him

504
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,620
He is a senior in the company and an old man

505
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,100
I don't want him to be embarrassed

506
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,380
I didn't expect him to misunderstand

507
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,620
Later, after he exposed the corruption

508
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,700
Rumors in the company

509
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
It has had a big impact on me

510
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,940
I had a temper with him

511
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,180
Let him stay away from me

512
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,060
I don't know if this is

513
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,580
Crush his last knife

514
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,900
Anyway, Fang Qingchun

515
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,100
I can't solve my misunderstanding

516
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,820
Who else knows about this?

517
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,300
Liu Renkai

518
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,420
We will ask Liu Renkai for evidence

519
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,860
OK

520
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,340
Xie Wuxiang was burned that night

521
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,500
You have no evidence

522
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,100
On November 17th

523
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,300
Around ten o'clock at night

524
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,980
Where are you

525
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,460
On November 17th

526
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,980
On November 17th

527
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,740
I took something from you

528
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,220
I destroyed it

529
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,460
I will kill you

530
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Why can't I remember

531
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,980
Can't remember

532
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,980
You don't want to say it, do you

533
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,420
I remember

534
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,500
I was with Mr. Zhao

535
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,020
We will go to confirm with Zhao Jian

536
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,380
OK

537
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,060
OK

538
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,380
I won't see you off

539
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,860
Thank you for your cooperation in the police investigation

540
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,140
It's my duty

541
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,740
This reporter reported

542
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,900
It is reported that the famous medicine company in Xinjiang

543
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,940
Green Cloud Pharmaceutical has recently had a new personnel change

544
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,300
General Manager Zhao Qian

545
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,660
Mr. Liu Renkai

546
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,740
As the vice general manager

547
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,620
After Mr. Liu Renkai's trip

548
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Will be in charge of leading and managing

549
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,460
Daily operation and business development of Green Cloud Pharmaceutical

550
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,780
It's too dark

551
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,820
Hello

552
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,980
I want the feeling of sunshine

553
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,660
music

554
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
music

555
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,540
Aren't you afraid of that what

556
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,500
Talking nonsense inside

557
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,420
My brothers will disappear

558
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
Not to mention

559
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,100
His people are inside

560
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
His parents are still outside

561
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,420
Do you think it's possible to talk nonsense

562
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,740
With me

563
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,140
I keep you safe

564
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,580
The person who wants to get you

565
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,180
I will solve it for you

566
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,320
Sight

567
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,420
What are you doing

568
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,620
I don't let him go

569
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,380
The magic power

570
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
nothing

571
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Come on

572
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Let the magic power be

573
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,700
here

574
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,380
You can don't go

575
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,280
Come back

576
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:01,900
our

577
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,500
amos

578
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,600
hosts

579
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,980
Ju Zijun

580
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,020
Tell us

581
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,300
you are delicious

582
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,700
Please

583
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,980
It can't be used by that stupid factory.

584
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,180
It's not using the material you collected on the bedspread to work on it.

585
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,240
But I can't accept that.

586
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,340
You should obviously open the door first

587
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,940
while I come look for that file.

588
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,280
Yes.

589
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,060
You can meet your rehearsal

590
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,720
during the main stage of our rehearsal.

591
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,760
Okay.

592
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
Let that go to you!

593
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,560
My okie okie你的無罪

594
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,440
I'm coming now!

595
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,260
Normally, almost all problem people are good at.

596
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,560
But you admit mistakes with people.

597
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:59,160
I

598
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,960
Please take a look.

599
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
You're really a big concern.

600
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
You're always staring at the computer. What can you see?

601
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,960
It's like you're using your feet to measure it. Don't you know?

602
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Do you know how much pressure Master is putting on us?

603
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Xiao Man, where's my food?

604
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
I'm coming, Uncle.

605
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,960
You don't even have any evidence of your stinky face.

606
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
I found it.

607
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
The little boy who sent his mother's diary is living nearby.

608
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
But he's only six years old.

609
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I can't explain all the details.

610
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,960
I just know that someone asked him to help send something.

611
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Even if that person is a man or a woman, he can't explain it.

612
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,960
How can a man and a woman not be able to explain it?

613
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I don't understand.

614
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Did you not ask him clearly or did he not understand?

615
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
How can you not understand these things?

616
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
That girl from the front desk is still a college student.

617
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Can't you explain it clearly?

618
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Xiao Man, where's my food?

619
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Did that A-Xiang confess?

620
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
No.

621
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
I can't find out.

622
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Isn't this Feng Qing Chun's house?

623
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Hello?

624
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Hello?

625
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
Is this Detective Wang?

626
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
I made a mistake.

627
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Wait a minute.

628
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Wait a minute.

629
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Old Wang, you didn't save my call.

630
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Who?

631
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Zhong Ning.

632
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay.

633
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Wait for me. I'll go over there.

634
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
She?

635
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
The relationship between them is quite complicated.

636
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
It's a divorce lawyer.

637
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Why didn't you go to the national security office and bring the police here?

638
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
Don't worry.

639
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I'm not going to bother you.

640
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Just that little thing.

641
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
Everyone is too lazy to catch you.

642
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Don't worry.

643
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
I'm not going to bother you.

644
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I, Wang Mao Ren, am a man of justice.

645
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm not afraid of trouble.

646
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,960
Zhong's big brother is also my big brother.

647
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
You can come, but you can't avoid the harm.

648
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,960
This is a letter from my little brother.

649
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I hope you can accept it.

650
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Okay.

651
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
You've received the letter.

652
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
You're going to draw it yourself.

653
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
It's not a moth.

654
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Detective Wang, you're quite bold.

655
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
You opened such a big company.

656
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
You're so bold.

657
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Why did you hang up on me as soon as you answered the phone?

658
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Big brother.

659
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,960
These past few years have been too difficult.

660
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
To be able to persist and live,

661
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
to open this company,

662
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
it's already not easy.

663
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960
There are so many small problems outside.

664
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,960
I'm not even afraid of money.

665
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
Are you done?

666
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Okay, okay, don't cry.

667
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
I came to ask you about something.

668
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Sit down.

669
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Brother, you sit down.

670
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,960
More than a year ago,

671
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
did someone called Fang Qin Chun come to see you?

672
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I did.

673
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
You don't even think about it.

674
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
You have a good memory.

675
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Big brother, if I'm not mistaken,

676
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,960
you should be Zheng Gang, right?

677
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
What's wrong?

678
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Since the day you were promoted,

679
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,960
our case has become too good.

680
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,960
We live and work in peace, and we don't have to protect each other.

681
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
There are almost no people who are ghosting.

682
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,960
I have only two or three people to entrust in more than a year.

683
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,960
I can't forget it.

684
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,960
What did he ask you for?

685
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Investigate the evidence of his husband's ghosting.

686
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
I have a lot to say.

687
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,960
It's not like this.

688
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Don't think I have any power over the girl.

689
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,960
You can say that there is absolute core competitiveness in the industry.

690
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
If my big brother will have such a big business in the future,

691
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
it's too difficult,

692
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
okay, okay.

693
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
Or I would have changed this stool.

694
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,960
It needs my orders at any time.

695
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
It is better to go up the mountain and go down the ocean.

696
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,960
Is your core competitiveness legal?

697
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,960
Big brother,

698
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,680
Mr. Zhong knows me so well.

699
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,800
I've been

700
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,280
talking to him for years.

701
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,800
Right?

702
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,400
He just said a few words to me.

703
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,680
It's almost the New Year.

704
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,000
I'll give the baby a red envelope.

705
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,920
The baby...

706
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,040
It's useless.

707
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,520
Just show us what you've got.

708
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,400
We're in a hurry.

709
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,360
Zhao Qian and Fang Qingchun

710
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,200
didn't get the video

711
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,080
of their husband cheating.

712
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,240
They...

713
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,000
Can I have a look?

714
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,440
Excuse me, be careful.

715
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,680
I've been following them for days.

716
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,000
But I only got

717
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,680
these.

718
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,360
Please have a look.

719
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,440
Thanks for saving my life.

720
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,840
apple

721
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:51,740
But don't

722
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,800
repeat it again.

723
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,040
It's rare for me

724
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,080
to have you in the same house.

725
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,600
You've got me].

726
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,560
Thanks.

727
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,040
Yin Xiaolun.

728
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,080
Are you all right?

729
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,700
Can you go now?

730
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,000
Why don't you go home too?

731
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,680
Don't embarrass Wake.

732
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
Why don't you go and free yourself?

733
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Li Jue Er! Li Jue Er!

734
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Are you okay?

735
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Li Jue Er!

736
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,280
No, no, no!

737
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Don't cry.

738
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
If you can prove one is true,

739
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,080
you can also deduce that the other is also true.

740
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,080
Luo Li Jun's mother diary

741
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,080
is not a rumor.

742
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,080
It's a true incident with suspicious ingredients.

743
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,080
Then what did she say about that ghost?

744
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,080
If Luo Li Jun's jump was not an accident,

745
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,080
it was Yang You Mo and the so-called ghost's mental damage.

746
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,080
Would Yang Yan's drowning be an accident half a year ago?

747
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,080
The ghost is Zhao Qian, right?

748
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,080
Isn't it?

749
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,080
When did Zhao Qian and Liu Ren Kai wear the same pants?

750
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,080
The thing that Ah Xiang got from the amusement park

751
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
must be bad for Zhao Qian.

752
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,080
And now it's in Liu Ren Kai's hands.

753
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
Evidence?

754
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,080
Since the mystery of the moment is not easy to open,

755
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,080
then we'll start from the beginning of the mystery.

756
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,080
So the Chinese question is already started to investigate?

757
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,080
Actually, I've always been a big question mark

758
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,080
for Yang Yan's disappearance.

759
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,080
But I can't find any evidence.

760
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Luo Li Jun's engine behind the suicide

761
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
helped me open a mouth.

762
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,080
Tell me.

763
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
Yang Yan was in the wild

764
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
and was hit by a flood.

765
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
He was washed away by accident.

766
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,080
You said the truth should be measured by the feet.

767
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,080
I've been there.

768
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
A month before Yang Yan's accident,

769
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Yang You Mo went there to write.

770
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
The most important thing is

771
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
Yang You Mo asked the locals

772
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,080
about the weather

773
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,080
and the date and time of the flood.

774
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
It's a given.

775
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
If things change,

776
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
no matter how small the possibility is,

777
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
it will happen.

778
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,080
So it's not the flood that hit Yang Yan.

779
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
It's Yang You Mo

780
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
that hit the flood.

781
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
First, I want to say

782
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,080
it's not a fairy tale.

783
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,080
It's a real story.

784
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,200
Go and fry the rabbitар lands.

785
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,080
Please don't say it again for true.

786
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,080
The 리第1å parao

787
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,080
should be coriander.

788
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,440
Don't be too strong, Xia Zhuo it's against a trusting

789
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,960
Sun Wuyi

790
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,560
I Project, not against a trusting

791
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,320
Actually, it based on a story

792
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:32,000
No one else separate from this Maspod demos

793
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Who's bag is this?

794
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Who's bag is this?

795
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I don't know.

796
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I made a mistake.

797
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm not going to be a star.

798
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm not going to be a star.

799
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm not going to be a star.

800
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm not going to be a star.

801
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm not going to be a star.

802
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm not going to be a star.

803
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm not going to be a star.

804
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm not going to be a star.

805
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm not going to be a star.

806
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm not going to be a star.

807
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm not going to be a star.

808
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm not going to be a star.

809
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm not going to be a star.

810
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm not going to be a star.

811
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I'm not going to be a star.

812
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm not going to be a star.

813
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm not going to be a star.

814
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm not going to be a star.

815
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm not going to be a star.

816
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm not going to be a star.

817
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Thank you.

818
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
In the dark night,

819
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
the sound of the heart is loud.

820
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The rose is singing in the dark night.

821
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The blue flame is lighting up the love.

822
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The bright night is singing.

823
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The night is not looking for the past.

824
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The broken wall is clearly seeing the sun.

825
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The blood is singing on the flowing wings.

826
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The light is shining on the white wings.

827
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,320
The

828
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
sis-in-law is a good başg參 sayin.

829
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,380
The sister-in-law is a good başg.

830
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,320
The storm is singing in the fear that the brothers will not see the ihrn внимание prz regulations.

831
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:44,760
The mother, who uses the brain to twitch,

832
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,000
is trying to ruin her sister Lv Kong's heart.

833
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,800
She does not know her size.

834
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,400
Lv ming,
