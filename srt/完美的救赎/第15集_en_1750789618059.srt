1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,420
location

2
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Grocery repair shop

3
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
Your daughter is drunk

4
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
why do you did this?

5
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,600
I want to do that too

6
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,960
but it is always scary when I am near her

7
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,280
It's me who do this

8
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
The psychologist said

9
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
her current condition is easily stimulated.

10
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
How about we wait a little longer?

11
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
When she's calm,

12
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
we'll come back.

13
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,240
Let's go.

14
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,480
Yang Yan and I are good friends.

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
Let's go.

16
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,080
Who gave you

17
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
the Rainbow of the Little Princess?

18
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
Yang Yan gave it to me.

19
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
When did he give it to you?

20
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,160
A long time ago.

21
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,160
Why did Yang Yan

22
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
give you this book?

23
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,880
Because

24
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
he told me

25
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
there's a secret base

26
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
in this book.

27
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I really miss him.

28
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,200
I followed the book

29
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,360
and went to the secret base he told me.

30
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,200
But...

31
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
A secret base

32
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
in this book?

33
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
Moving it.

34
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Help!

35
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
I want to go home.

36
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Don't you like it here?

37
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
This is your home.

38
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Is it suitable?

39
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I'll be your mother in the future.

40
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Okay?

41
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Zixuan,

42
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I hope you can tell us the truth.

43
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Actually,

44
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Aunt Wang Ya kidnapped me,

45
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
but she was nice to me.

46
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Even better than my mother.

47
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Uncle, I have another question.

48
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I asked you before,

49
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
but I still have to ask you again.

50
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
It's okay.

51
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Wait till you think it over, okay?

52
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
When did Liang Yan give you

53
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
that little princess rainbow?

54
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
The hideout.

55
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I thought it was the killer.

56
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Now it seems that

57
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
the real hidden power in this game

58
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
is the child.

59
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
We analyzed before

60
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
what kind of motivation

61
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
would make Liao Boyan

62
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
want to work with

63
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
the person who killed his daughter.

64
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
If it's for the child,

65
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
this motivation is enough.

66
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
You are also a father.

67
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
What do you think?

68
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Liao Boyan is also a father.

69
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
He must know

70
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
that Liao Yifan's heart

71
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
was transplanted to Yang Yan.

72
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
So he will be involved in

73
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
a series of things

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
related to Yang Yan.

75
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,280
This is the motivation and cause and effect.

76
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Ke Ran,

77
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
do you have Yang Yan's

78
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
photo and information?

79
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Yes.

80
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Find the photo of

81
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
that graduation from primary school.

82
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Here.

83
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
I saw this photo before.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I thought it was strange at that time,

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
but I didn't think much.

86
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Look.

87
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Yang You Mo is here.

88
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Luo Lijuan is here.

89
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Who is Yang Yan looking at?

90
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Please show us all the photos

91
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
you took at that time.

92
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Let me find it first.

93
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I have to find it.

94
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
I have to find it.

95
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I have to find it.

96
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Let me find it first.

97
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
I will save the photos

98
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
of the graduation every year.

99
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
You can have a look.

100
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Wait.

101
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Please zoom in.

102
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Here?

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Yes, Commander.

104
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
They have known each other for a long time.

105
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
They are so close.

106
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Look.

107
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Liao Boyan,

108
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,280
You told us a story

109
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,280
I also told you a story

110
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,280
A story about a father

111
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
There was a father

112
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,280
He loved his daughter very much

113
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
But because of a car accident

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,280
His daughter left him forever

115
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
The weather in China is comfortable

116
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
It's comfortable

117
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Dad, I'll treat you to ice cream

118
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Do you want to eat it yourself?

119
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I'll buy one for each person

120
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Three flavors

121
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Slow down

122
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
It will melt

123
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Your daughter has grown up

124
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
You're so cute

125
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Your daughter has grown up

126
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Still thinking

127
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
You said it

128
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
She's so young

129
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Why do you always take her to work?

130
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't know if she can adapt to the return home

131
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Ice cream can be eaten

132
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Thank you

133
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
From now on, her life is dark

134
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,280
There is no light around her

135
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Your friend said

136
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
If you don't want to go

137
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
You can't go

138
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I don't want to go

139
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
I don't want to go

140
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Your friend said

141
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
If we both give our blood

142
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,280
The suspect's heart can save another child

143
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I don't want to go

144
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I don't want to go

145
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
I don't want to go

146
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I don't want to go

147
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I don't want to go

148
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I don't want to go

149
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
I don't want to go

150
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
I don't want to go

151
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I don't want to go

152
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
I don't want to go

153
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I don't want to go

154
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I don't want to go

155
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I don't want to go

156
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I don't want to go

157
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I don't want to go

158
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Seigneur

159
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,280
You and Tan Qing donate liao yifan's heart

160
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,280
The organ donor should follow the principles of two dead

161
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
And you didn't overcome your obsession

162
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,560
Reporting software description

163
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,040
It's not muito

164
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:43,160
Instead, I would like to warn

165
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,200
You eat a lot

166
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,760
So my heart won't assent

167
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,320
Way for you

168
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Have a meal

169
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,400
excess

170
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,920
Have a meal

171
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
your own daughter.

172
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,280
You want her to be your daughter.

173
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
You want to go back to the palace.

174
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
So you made a bold decision.

175
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Use your way to protect her.

176
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Protect her.

177
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Let her be your princess.

178
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Uncle, bye.

179
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Your protection

180
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
also makes her more dependent on you.

181
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Slowly,

182
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
her dependence on you

183
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
even exceeds her family.

184
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
You know Yang Yan's life.

185
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
You know her family situation.

186
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I know.

187
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
But what this father didn't expect

188
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
was that Yang Yan would meet a bad guy.

189
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,280
In order to be with Zhao Qian,

190
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Yang You Mo actually worked with his family.

191
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Under the many mental harm

192
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
that Yang You Mo and Zhao Qian have been through,

193
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Yang Yan's mother jumped into the water.

194
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
It looked like a suicide.

195
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Yang Yan's brother

196
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
also became a victim of fate.

197
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
At first,

198
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
this father didn't realize

199
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
the danger around Yang Yan.

200
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Finally, Yang Yan was also badly poisoned.

201
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
He thought that his father

202
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
was a bad guy.

203
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
You're right.

204
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I didn't realize that he would be in danger.

205
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
If I had known earlier,

206
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
he wouldn't have...

207
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm sorry.

208
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Cheng Ning,

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I remember now.

211
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
What do you remember?

212
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I remember

213
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
that Zhao Qian and Yang You Mo

214
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
wanted to kill Yang Yan twice.

215
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Twice.

216
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
I remember.

217
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Dad, the safety belt is stuck.

218
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Dad, drive slowly. I'm scared.

219
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Dad.

220
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Are you okay?

221
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Thank you, Dad.

222
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Actually, I was a little scared yesterday.

223
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,280
The seat belt was stuck, and the car was driving so fast.

224
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280
I was scared too.

225
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Good thing, you were safe.

226
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,280
You must remember to put on your seat belt first.

227
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Here, eat.

228
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Thank you, Uncle Liao.

229
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Liao Boyan, you are the one who is hiding behind Fang Qingchun and Zhang Qiaoyun.

230
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,280
And Wang Ya is the one who is hiding behind you.

231
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,280
He was an excellent engineer.

232
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,280
If he didn't help you, you wouldn't have been able to use Yang Youmo's phone to access the surveillance software.

233
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,280
And you wouldn't have been able to modify the high-level killing.

234
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
This painting is Zhao Ling's masterpiece.

235
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Look at the lines and the ink. It's absolutely real.

236
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
You have to check it.

237
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Yours.

238
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,720
I tried Nice to move out with your dad's opinion,

239
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,140
he said that

240
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,480
you can't let him influence on you.

241
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,680
But sometimes,

242
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,120
it's real.

243
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,400
I localize Quite独处

244
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:21,480
in

245
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
It must be that the operation is wrong.

246
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
We have to check him again.

247
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
It shouldn't be.

248
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
A week later

249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
I haven't seen you smoke.

250
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
I left it earlier.

251
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,900
Someone may be inside.

252
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,660
She didn't die or fill up the battery.

253
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,380
Give her pocket money.

254
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Take her home.

255
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
You know what I will do?

256
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,480
You Mo, I don't want to see you like this.

257
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
I feel guilty.

258
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,480
But I feel guilty because I love you.

259
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Zhao Qian and Yang You Mo must die.

260
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Or Yang Yan will be in trouble.

261
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
I asked you if you have been to the amusement park.

262
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You told me you went with your daughter.

263
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
I thought you were confused.

264
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Because your daughter died five years ago.

265
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,480
And the amusement park has just opened for less than two years.

266
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Now I understand.

267
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
You are not the only one who is confused.

268
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,480
You are the only one who is confused.

269
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Now I understand.

270
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
The daughter you are talking about is Yang Yan.

271
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Love is like a duck in the night.

272
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Looking at the distant sky,

273
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Waiting quietly.

274
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,480
The blood-red flowers are like the sunflowers.

275
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,480
The wind blows and the rain falls.

276
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Looking at the distant sky in my heart.

277
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Xie Xiaohua and Yang Yan are friends.

278
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Yang Yan moved to Liao Yifan's heart.

279
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
And she had an contact with Xie Xiaohua.

280
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
So you already know Xie Xiaohua's family situation.

281
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480
You also know that her father Xie Wuqiang

282
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
sold the gold medicine.

283
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Right?

284
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Where is the hometown?

285
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,480
The road is full of swaying.

286
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,100
The

287
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,480
This is the real root of the murder of Yang Youmo and Zhao Qian.

288
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
They killed Yang Yan.

289
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
And Yang Yan moved to Liao Yifan's heart.

290
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Yang Yan is my daughter.

291
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,480
The blood-red flowers are like the sunflowers.

292
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,480
The wind blows and the rain falls.

293
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Looking at the distant sky in my heart.

294
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
The wind blows and the rain falls.

295
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,480
The wind blows and the rain falls.

296
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,480
The wind blows and the rain falls.

297
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
The hope that will continue to be lost

298
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
will also be destroyed by her.

299
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Who sings the song of fate

300
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,480
like the flowers in the sun.

301
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Enough.

302
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Let's relax.

303
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I'll call everyone tonight.

304
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Let's have a small gathering.

305
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
You treat the guests.

306
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Hey, you said you would treat the guests.

307
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
You can't hear it, right?

308
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
I hope this case is really over.

309
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Master.

310
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
As you expected,

311
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Liao Boyan did a full medical check-up during the suppression.

312
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,480
He is sure that he has no secondary suicide syndrome.

313
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,480
But I still believe my intuition.

314
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Use the memory to transfer our vision

315
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
to eliminate his suspicion of the case.

316
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Or behind the memory and silence,

317
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,480
there is still the secret he wants to hide.

318
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
What other secrets?

319
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Director Zhang.

320
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Director Zhang.

321
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
They are all here.

322
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
We want to know what secrets Liao Boyan is hiding.

323
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,480
I want to know too.

324
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Hey.

325
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
You fell asleep?

326
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Dr. Liao's secondary suicide syndrome looks like him.

327
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Liao Boyan.

328
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Did you tell me to tell you or let me check it?

329
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,480
You and Wang Ya are all lying.

330
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
So many lies.

331
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
As long as one is broken,

332
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,480
the other lies will be like a soap bubble.

333
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
It will be torn apart.

334
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
We will find the truth.

335
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Director Zhang.

336
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I know you are a person who knows the grace and is unrepentant.

337
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I saved the life of Chu Junxi.

338
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,480
You are a person who knows the law.

339
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I am a person who knows the law.

340
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
God will do so.

341
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I am already broken.

342
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
If you kill me,

343
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
you can draw a perfect symbol.

344
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I gave my life to the loyal people.

345
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
I only want to die now.

346
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,480
You can't be revenge.

347
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I only want to die.

348
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
I only want to die.

349
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Wang Ya.

350
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Liao Boyan didn't change his secondary suicide syndrome.

351
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
The criminal record you brought us

352
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
was forged by you, right?

353
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Wang Ya.

354
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,480
You said you helped Liao Boyan to atone for his sins.

355
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
But now,

356
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
you have made a bigger mistake.

357
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Because the way you chose to atone for your sins was wrong.

358
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
You killed Liao Yifan.

359
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,480
You made a mistake and made a mistake again.

360
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Do you want to continue making mistakes?

361
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,480
The only way you can get rid of your pain

362
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
is to confess and atone for your sins.

363
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Only then

364
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,480
can you really let go of your stone in your heart.

365
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Yang Yan is still alive.

366
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
He is still alive.

367
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
He is still alive.

368
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
He is still alive.

369
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Over there.

370
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Over there.

371
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
It's here.

372
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Is anyone there?

373
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Over there.

374
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
It's here.

375
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Turn it off.

376
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Please don't let go.

377
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Turn it off.

378
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
We meet again.

379
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Yang Yan.

380
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Yang Yan.

381
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I saw a pair of slippers outside.

382
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,480
And two pairs of teeth.

383
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Who did you live with in this room?

384
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,480
The memorial space flower in Liao Yifan's room

385
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,480
is the signal you made with Liao Boyan, right?

386
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Who are you?

387
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Who are you?

388
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Where is Yifan?

389
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Where is Yifan?

390
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Where is Yifan?

391
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I didn't expect

392
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Yang Yan, a little rabbit,

393
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
to be the one who made Liao Boyan suffer.

394
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,480
What did you say? A rabbit?

395
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Zhao Qian, you have come to this conclusion

396
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,480
because you see other people's lives like this.

397
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm already like this.

398
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Don't mind my words.

399
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
But you shouldn't think of putting all your sins

400
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
on me.

401
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,480
You can't even take a slap.

402
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Have you ever considered what kind of person Yang You Mo is?

403
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,480
If he is honest and has no evil in his heart,

404
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
can I control him?

405
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I've never loved Yang You Mo.

406
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
How could I fall in love with someone

407
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,480
who is like Zhang Yunhong?

408
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
From the first sight,

409
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I can tell they are the same kind of person.

410
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Greed, hypocrisy.

411
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
In the eyes of outsiders,

412
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
they are like a good father,

413
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,480
a good husband.

414
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,480
That's because they can't see their true selves.

415
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Just like what Zhao Yunhong did to my mother,

416
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,480
no one will see it.

417
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,480
So I have to tear off such a layer of skin myself.

418
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm just enjoying the process of the ghost showing its original form.

419
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I think this is what I should do.

420
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:14,480
And it proves that Yang You Mo is a ghost.

421
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Have you ever lived with ghosts?

422
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I have a rabbit that I like very much.

423
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I took it to my father's place.

424
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,480
My father held my hand and forced me to throw the rabbit into the dog cage.

425
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I watched them being bitten to death by the living.

426
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,480
My father told me

427
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,480
this is the standard of survival in this society.

428
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,480
If you are strong,

429
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,480
only the strong can live in this world.

430
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I don't know why my mother committed suicide.

431
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,480
I think she was very happy.

432
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,480
But when she died, she still smiled.

433
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
She used her hands

434
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,480
to hold the rabbit.

435
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,480
She was so happy.

436
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,480
She used her hands

437
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,480
to touch me.

438
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,480
I felt like she was going to say something.

439
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,480
From then on, I became very clean.

440
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,480
I had to make my hands and face clean.

441
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
I was always clean.

442
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
I hate children.

443
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I hate hearing their laughter.

444
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Because I may be different from them.

445
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I don't have childhood like them.

446
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,480
I will go back to the family house when I am in a bad mood.

447
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Because there is still a person there.

448
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
When I was a kid,

449
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I would throw the rabbit into the dog cage.

450
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
I watched them being bitten to death and heard them screaming.

451
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
I feel so relieved.

452
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't know why I became Zhao Yinghong.

453
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,480
I am the most pitiful person.

454
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I admit it.

455
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I admit it.

456
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
All those things

457
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,480
were done by Zhao Qian.

458
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I am sorry.

459
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I am sorry.

460
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Dad!

461
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Dad!

462
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Dad, save me! It's too dry here!

463
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,480
You don't listen to your dad.

464
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,480
You will be punished.

465
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
Why? I didn't become a rabbit.

466
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I didn't become a rabbit. Why did you do this to me?

467
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,480
Dad, you can't kill me.

468
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Don't kill me, dad!

469
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Dad!

470
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Zhao Qian has committed a murder on purpose.

471
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
He will be sentenced to two years in prison.

472
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
The wind

473
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,480
You love the wind

474
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
You are the star

475
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
You are the star

476
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,480
You are the wind

477
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,480
In the blue sky, the sound of the heart

478
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,480
The song of the beautiful girl

479
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,480
The blue flame, the blue sky

480
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
The stirrup, the stirrup

481
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Waves crash on the morn

482
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,480
The boat boat

483
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Now we are here

484
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Like that

485
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
We are adding smoke

486
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,800
covered from嗎
