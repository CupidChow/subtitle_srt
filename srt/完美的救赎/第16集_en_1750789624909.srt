1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Some people do not save their curtains.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:26,180
Do you still remember the crackdown of the exceeded

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,360
Sir,

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,480
you are right,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want people we know to look at me with sympathy.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,560
Don't worry.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,160
Director Cao won't know either.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here, take it.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is it good?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mom, you eat.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's delicious.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You try it.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's really delicious.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Uncle Miao, thank you for picking me up.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Actually, I have a question that I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What question?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why are you so good to me?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because you look like my daughter.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do I look like her?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You look like her in your heart.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What about your daughter?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Uncle Miao, I think sometimes Aunt Tan is weird.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
She's sick.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's wrong with her?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A lot of things.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wait for me.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Aunt Tan is back.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get in the car. Let's go home.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Not going home?

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where's Yifan?

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want to go home.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want to find Yifan.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yifan.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yifan.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I miss you so much.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I really miss you.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I miss you so much.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My Yifan.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My Yifan.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My Yifan.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
My Yifan.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I finally know how you convinced Zhang Qiaoyun.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You must have told her that Yang Yan is still alive.

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The real reason Wang Ya controlled Liu Zixuan

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
was because you and Yang Yan were in that warehouse.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you don't say it, I'll tell you.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll tell you.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you don't say it, I'll tell you.

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Half of the story about that father is true.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The other half, I'll tell you.

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You did go to the warehouse on the day Yang Yan disappeared.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Luckily, he didn't die and was rushed to the bottom.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And you found him.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yifan.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yifan.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yifan.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wake up.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wake up.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yifan.

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yifan.

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's wrong?

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Guan Dao.

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why did he do this to me?

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Kid.

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Tell me the password of your house.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's not my house.

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll tell you.

70
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll tell you.

71
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll tell you.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll tell you.

73
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll tell you.

74
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll tell you.

75
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll tell you.

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll tell you.

77
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll tell you.

78
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll tell you.

79
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll tell you.

80
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll tell you.

81
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll tell you.

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll tell you.

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll tell you.

84
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll tell you.

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll tell you.

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll tell you.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll tell you.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll tell you.

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll tell you.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll tell you.

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll tell you.

92
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll tell you.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll tell you.

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll tell you.

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll tell you.

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll tell you.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll tell you.

98
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll tell you.

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll tell you.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll tell you.

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll tell you.

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll tell you.

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll tell you.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll tell you.

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll tell you.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll tell you.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll tell you.

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll tell you.

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll tell you.

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm afraid that if Yang Yan sees this,

112
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
and finds out the truth,

113
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
he'll be more desperate

114
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
and hateful, right?

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
You killed Yang Yong Mo to deal with Zhao Qian.

116
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Your real motive was to protect Yang Yan.

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,400
When Yang Yan was still alive,

118
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
I didn't understand why you did that.

119
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,400
I didn't understand why you hid him

120
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
until I met Tan Qing.

121
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Is it good?

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello.

123
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Enjoy.

124
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Thank you.

125
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Here.

126
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Thank you, Uncle.

127
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Yifan,

128
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
I'll go buy you something good.

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Thank you, kid.

130
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
As long as you're happy.

131
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Eat.

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Yifan.

133
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Thank you.

134
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Thank you.

135
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Thank you.

136
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Why did you divorce?

137
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Why did I go abroad?

138
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't want it.

139
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I want to be with you.

140
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I want to be with you.

141
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I want to be with you.

142
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I want to be with you.

143
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Because someone wants to hurt my daughter.

144
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Divorce and going abroad are temporary.

145
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
It's all to protect my daughter.

146
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
That way,

147
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I can have no future,

148
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
and carry out the plan.

149
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
What plan?

150
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Don't worry.

151
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
If the police ask about me,

152
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
just tell them I have an affair with a man and a woman.

153
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
You hate me.

154
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
You hate Liu Boyan.

155
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
But I don't hate you.

156
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I love you very much.

157
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I love you very much.

158
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I love my daughter.

159
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Why?

160
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Why?

161
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Don't ask why.

162
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Just know that

163
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
we're doing this for our daughter.

164
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
When she's safe,

165
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
you can come back.

166
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
When we're together,

167
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
we'll be together.

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
When we're together,

169
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
we'll never be apart.

170
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Never be apart.

171
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Never be apart.

172
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Because you're still alive.

173
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
You won't suffer as much as I do.

174
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,120
I hope you can never think of me

175
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Take the medicine

176
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
I don't take it

177
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
How can you get better without medicine

178
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,040
Do you know this medicine is hard to get

179
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,280
Who asked you to do that

180
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,680
Who asked you to help me like this

181
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,360
Have you ever thought about yourself

182
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,200
I will grow up

183
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,440
I will find the bad guy to revenge myself

184
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,120
This is the last time I come to see you

185
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
I will never leave you

186
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,200
You should take the medicine first

187
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I will find a safe place to hide you

188
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I will find a safe place to hide you

189
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Uncle Liu, don't leave me

190
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I will follow you wherever you go

191
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Are you going to kill yourself?

192
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Don't cry

193
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Listen to me carefully

194
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
From now on

195
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
you have to log in every day

196
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
to Yifan's memorial space

197
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Why?

198
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Because I have to log in and talk to you every day

199
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,040
If you find that I didn't log in and talk to you

200
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
it means that

201
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
everything is over

202
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
You can call Aunt Tan

203
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
and ask her to come back

204
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
You can pick her up at the airport

205
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
But you have to hide yourself

206
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Aunt Tan has forgotten a lot of things

207
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
But she still really cares about you

208
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I know

209
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I know

210
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
You have to promise me

211
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
If I get caught

212
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
you can pretend that you don't know me

213
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,040
and don't have anything to do with me

214
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
When the bad guys are gone

215
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
you have to go back to the sun

216
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
and smile like before

217
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Just like when I first met you

218
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Uncle ар pact

219
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Liao Boy Yan

220
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
from the start

221
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,080
you have already

222
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
never doubt anyone

223
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
You are true to your promises

224
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
and always lied to all of us

225
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,840
But the report you gave to Dean Cao

226
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,000
was Tan Qing's.

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,240
You forged a fake report for Dean Cao.

228
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,040
Tan Qing is the one who really has a second semen.

229
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,200
You regularly go to the hospital for a check-up

230
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,960
just to keep the complete medical record.

231
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,640
You have to thank your witness.

232
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,760
Otherwise,

233
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,640
I wouldn't have met you in the hospital.

234
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
You want to say it?

235
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm a trickster, right?

236
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,720
I have nothing to say.

237
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
I only ask you one thing.

238
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,520
What is it?

239
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't wake Tan Qing up from her mother's dream.

240
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,920
Let her live in her dream.

241
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,320
So for her dream,

242
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,120
you don't want Yang Yan to lose her freedom

243
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,520
and hide her forever?

244
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,720
This is not only Tan Qing's dream,

245
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,320
but also Yang Yan's dream.

246
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
One has lost her mother.

247
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,520
One has lost her daughter.

248
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Their dream

249
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
is warmer than reality.

250
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Not to mention that life is short.

251
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
It's just a dream.

252
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,120
You think life is a dream,

253
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,920
so you can kill people?

254
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
Kill people?

255
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,520
I see it as a surgery.

256
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,720
Zhao Qianyang has Mo Xie Wuqiang.

257
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
It's important to kill people.

258
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,320
It's necessary to get in touch with them.

259
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Only then can you kill them.

260
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,320
Only then can people live more healthy.

261
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Zhao Qianyang has Mo Xie Wuqiang.

262
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,520
He should be sanctioned.

263
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
But what right do you have

264
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
to punish them on behalf of the law?

265
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
Have you thought about Yang Yan?

266
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
Killing is killing. It's a crime.

267
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
You want to protect your child, right?

268
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,720
He lost a person who cares so much about him.

269
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,320
Have you thought about how he will face his life in the future?

270
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
How will he face you?

271
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,320
You don't know that a child

272
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,120
needs education and company.

273
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,320
Liao Boyan, don't be a fan of yourself.

274
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
You are full of hatred.

275
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
You want to vent your anger.

276
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Your hatred even affected Fang Qinchun, Zhang Qiaoyun and Wu Pin.

277
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,520
Their life is already very difficult.

278
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,720
Because of you, they became your accomplices.

279
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
Do you know that you changed their fate?

280
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,320
Fate?

281
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Can fate be changed?

282
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Of course.

283
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Every crossroad in life

284
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,520
is a choice and a change.

285
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Seven years ago, you chose to do surgery for Zhong Renxi.

286
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,920
You changed my fate.

287
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,320
Four months ago, you chose to kill.

288
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,920
You changed many people's fate.

289
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,320
Many people.

290
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Many people.

291
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,720
There are people who care about you.

292
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Including Zhong Renxi. Including me.

293
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,120
You chose a path that you shouldn't have chosen.

294
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,720
Why did you force me to sit in front of you in this way?

295
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,520
You have many choices.

296
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,720
You can find a police.

297
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,720
You can completely change your fate.

298
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,120
You can change your fate.

299
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,720
You can change your fate.

300
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,120
You can change your fate.

301
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,520
You can change your fate.

302
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,520
You can speak with evidence.

303
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,120
The person you should trust the most is us.

304
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,520
Because justice and hope

305
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
will always exist.

306
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,520
You can have many opportunities.

307
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
Many ways to protect Yang Yan.

308
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
You can watch him grow.

309
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,520
You will have many good things.

310
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,320
Isn't this what you want?

311
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,720
But because of your choice,

312
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,120
you destroyed all the good things.

313
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,720
Xia Di.

314
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,320
We found anывleased.

315
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,280
No way, creator.

316
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
He's real.

317
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,100
It's him again.

318
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,480
Dear

319
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
Dad

320
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,880
Dad

321
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,920
Good.

322
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,160
The snow has turned into ice.

323
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,760
The ice has turned into water.

324
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,520
The water has evaporated into ice.

325
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,720
The ice has turned into rain.

326
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,880
The rain has fallen into the sea.

327
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,240
There's a rain in the sea.

328
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,000
You've been walking for thousands of miles.

329
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,680
You're going back to the ancient land.

330
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:58,320
Waiting for you in the vast land.

331
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,920
I miss you so much.

332
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,480
Tears fall.

333
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:13,120
Holding you, I don't hate you anymore.

334
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,600
I love you.

335
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,360
My soul can breathe.

336
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
I love you.

How can you stay here?

339
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Are you not afraid of shows of welcome?

340
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you afraid of showing 어ce like that?

341
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Not to worry of those who disease

This is what I want for everything.

Just like you.

414
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,620
on behalf of Jin Eleven

415
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,240
Director Song

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,400
please make a decision

417
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,840
to talk to our chef today.

418
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,320
Great.

419
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,600
Thank you for giving me a chance.

420
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,920
Today is a happy day.

421
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I specially prepared these hard dishes

422
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,640
which are all your favorite.

423
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,240
It's a sign of action.

424
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,960
Eat well and drink well.

425
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
You can drink less.

426
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,640
No more.

427
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,760
It's your turn to drink.

428
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,600
Let's do it.

429
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,320
Okay.

430
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,000
Drink it.

431
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,760
Eat more.

432
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,840
Don't be shy.

433
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,320
Thank you.

434
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,520
Eat more, kid.

435
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,400
Come on.

436
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,960
Look.

437
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Gu Wen Zheng

438
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,920
has officially completed

439
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,120
his mission.

440
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,040
Master.

441
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
I plan to

442
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
re-entrance the police force.

443
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,360
You've decided?

444
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,880
It's not easy to enter the police force.

445
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,280
It's an interview and a competition.

446
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,840
Even if you pass,

447
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
you have to start from the bottom.

448
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
Even if I start from the bottom,

449
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm willing to do it.

450
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,280
This is my only dream and pursuit.

451
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,800
Great.

452
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,560
Come on, kid.

453
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,640
Come on.

454
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,840
Why don't you respond?

455
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,600
Come on.

456
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,840
Your eyes are red.

457
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,360
You're touched, right?

458
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,240
A drink with wine.

459
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,280
Cheers.

460
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,760
Come on.

461
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,920
Come on.

462
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Let's drink.

463
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Thank you.

464
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
Cheers.

465
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm glad

466
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,240
that this kid can come back.

467
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,080
I'll retire in two years.

468
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,720
I can retire in peace.

469
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,800
What do you think?

470
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,600
I know.

471
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,920
It's a legacy.

472
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,280
After all, you're my boss.

473
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,120
It's a pity that

474
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,840
Zhong Ning doesn't have more time

475
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,520
to accompany Xixi.

476
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Xixi is more sensible than Zhong Ning.

477
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,440
She can take care of herself.

478
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,680
This kind of kid

479
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
from a family environment,

480
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,640
do you believe it?

481
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,560
She will be successful in the future.

482
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,760
She will be successful.

483
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,920
Xixi is very happy

484
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,120
to have a good family environment.

485
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,760
But in this case,

486
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,840
some kids

487
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,120
are not in a good family.

488
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,560
Yes.

489
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,840
For kids,

490
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
family is so important.

491
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
Yes.

492
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,560
We should be grateful.

493
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
It's a good news.

494
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,160
Later this month,

495
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
only me and my sister

496
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,360
three of you

497
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,680
two overcame one more.

498
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,080
Only myself and my sister

499
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,360
for Grandpa Yiru.

500
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,640
Such a good mood.

501
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,760
Two people who won the lottery

502
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,800
quite fairly

503
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,560
and happily

504
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,040
and be punished.

505
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,400
Everyone's life

506
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,240
has been changed by many things.

507
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,200
For example...

508
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,480
Did you see it?

509
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,120
This is what you call a shadow.

510
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,080
It's really beautiful.

511
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,040
What?

512
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,640
I said

513
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,280
I know what a shadow is.

514
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,760
I was just kidding with you that day.

515
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,840
You...

516
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,560
Hello.

517
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,160
I want to pack a black eye ring.

518
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
When we were eating that day,

519
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
I saw that they had a bad eye sight.

520
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,480
And him.

521
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,960
Such a big shadow.

522
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,760
Boss.

523
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,920
Give me 20 of them.

524
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,920
Do you still like them?

525
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,800
I don't.

526
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,360
You're still so...

527
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,520
sisterly.

528
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,520
Well,

529
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,960
I don't have to say more.

530
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,520
When playing basketball,

531
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,320
you can't grab the ball.

532
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,480
This is for the doctor.

533
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,400
Potter.

534
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,960
Roll in carefully.

535
00:42:51,200 --> 00:43:11,080
öl

536
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,960
I'll take care of it.

537
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,800
Okay.

538
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Go, captain.

539
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,720
The TV show is funny.

540
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,480
It's a comedy.

541
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,680
I don't like comedy.

542
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,560
Go, guys.

543
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,960
Captain, just go.

544
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,120
I've never seen you before.

545
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,000
Let's have fun together.

546
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,480
Right.

547
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,080
Look, the younger brothers

548
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,280
haven't seen you for a long time.

549
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,920
Tell them

550
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,800
that the team will treat us to dinner some other day.

551
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,880
Go, don't be late.

552
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,840
Go, go, go.

553
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,560
Go, go, go.

554
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,720
Go, captain.

555
00:43:41,080 --> 00:44:06,480
The first team is 않는.

556
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm busy now.

557
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,560
You called me but I didn't answer.

558
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,120
And I didn't pay your appointment.

559
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,200
Well,

560
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm sorry.

561
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm done with my work.

562
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,480
I heard there's a movie

563
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,520
that's really good.

564
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,880
When are you free?

565
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,960
Let's go watch it together.

566
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,440
I'm a little busy now.

567
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm in a meeting.

568
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,320
It's okay.

569
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,240
You're busy.

570
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,760
It's okay.

571
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,680
I can finish the meeting at six o'clock.

572
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,200
There's a new comedy.

573
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,320
Let's go watch it.

574
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,880
No problem.

575
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,200
I'll wait for you downstairs.

576
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,000
Lingling, it's okay.

577
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,680
Meeting is important.

578
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,360
No hurry.

579
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,280
I'll wait for you downstairs.

580
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,880
See you later.

581
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,120
That's it.

582
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,360
Lingling.

583
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,640
Finally, you're off the list.

584
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,800
Your brother has a big case again.

585
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,320
He's done his work again.

586
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,160
But I don't know what's going on.

587
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,240
It's different from before.

588
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,640
After the case,

589
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,760
I still can't calm down.

590
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,160
I have good news for you.

591
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,360
I've made up with Zhong Nian.

592
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,640
I've finally

593
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,440
forgiven him.

594
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,040
And

595
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,200
he'll wear a police uniform

596
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
and look like the one you like.

597
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,600
I miss you.

598
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,760
Dad!

599
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,040
You're so handsome!

600
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,400
I want to see you!

601
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,760
Look.

602
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,040
Dad,

603
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,680
you're right.

604
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,080
What?

605
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,880
Look at you!

606
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,360
So handsome!

607
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Who's memory is blurred?

608
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Who sings the song of fate

609
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,480
like the fireworks?

610
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
elephants

611
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,480
In the dark night, the heart is growing

612
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
The beautiful song, the beautiful song

613
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,480
The flame of the night, the flame of the night

614
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,480
The night is flying, the night is burning

615
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,480
The fire is burning, the fire is burning

616
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,480
The wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

617
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,480
The wings are flying, the wings are flying

618
00:48:46,480 --> 00:49:03,960
