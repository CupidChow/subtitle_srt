00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,060
I told you to get lost.

7
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,190
I'm sorry...

8
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,720
for having walked away like that.

9
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,700
Back then,

10
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,910
I was afraid of my own feelings

11
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,850
because I'd never
felt that way about anyone.

12
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,800
I didn't know what to do.

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,650
I suppose I just ran away
because I didn't have

14
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,139
the courage to face it.

15
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,310
At first, I wondered why
I could fall asleep when I was with you.

16
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,670
Then,

17
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,380
I gradually started falling for you.

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,760
When I woke up
from a good sleep,

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,470
I was glad it was you who I saw.

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,170
That's why

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,070
I was determined not to make the same mistake,

22
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,310
but I ended up hurting you again.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm sorry, Dohyun.

24
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,950

Last class, we talked about insomnia.

67

There are two types of sleep disorders.

The first type is
caused by mental factors

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,350
and the second type is
caused by physical factors.

As for sleep disorders caused
by physical factors,

00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,910
there are sleep apnea,

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,470

Among those who overcome insomnia,

there are cases where the cure is unclear.

81
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,330
It's because of psychological factors

82
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,970
that can't be explained scientifically.
