Just like my insomnia that has no reason.

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,479
Just like the shower without any warning.

Hey, do it again.

Does it make sense that there's no one on the cold bench?

We lack people if he gets hurt.

You still can't change that habit.

186
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,370
This isn't a game that'll end once.

187
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,910
It's important to me. Play properly.

188
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,570
If we win, then you have to grant me a wish.

189
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,720
Why? You're scared we'd win?

190
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,190
If we lose today, we won't have to meet again.
