=Episode 14=

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,360
I saw some entertainment news recently.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Mr. Cen and Miss Su

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
seem pretty close these days.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,800
Looks like they're together every night.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,520
So, where does that leave you?

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Which one of you is his true love?

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Why do you love meddling so much?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,080
Can you stop being so annoying?

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,680
Are you out of the picture now?

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,400
Got it.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,160
You have a schedule at home.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,260
She comes on Mon, Wed, Fri;
you on Tue, Thu, Sat.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,420
You two just take turns.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,760
Try not to stress about it.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
Let me tell you something.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
Men are all the same.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,320
We think with our instincts.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,960
I can tell you

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,980
what he won't say to you.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you know what makes

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,120
a man's dream partner?

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
It's a woman

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,080
who's a mystery.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
As the saying goes,

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
we always want what we can't have.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,160
He'll get bored

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,520
with someone like you one day.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Trust me on this.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,760
Let me give you a saying too.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Don't expect kindness from the unkind.

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Mr. Chang.

42
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,700
Can you do me a favor?

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I get it now.

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,300
I know why Mrs. Cen

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
let Mr. Cen and Miss Su get close.

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,320
Looks like she found someone new.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,580
A new man, huh?

48
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,100
From now on,

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,340
I'll call you Mrs. Deng.

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,700
Is that alright?

51
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,940
When did that happen?

52
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,380
Why didn't I get an invite?

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,220
You don't need to worry, Mr. Chang.

54
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,740
Look at you two.

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,620
You're like an old married couple.

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,220
So, you must be family now.

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,020
If you're family,

58
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,340
you can't attend Mirui's
bidding meeting.

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,100
Mr. Deng and I

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,380
aren't what you think we are.

61
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
How can you prove that?

62
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,140
We have nothing to hide.

63
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,180
Miss Lin is part of my family.

64
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,180
She's with me.

65
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,820
What is wrong with you?

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,020
What are you doing?

67
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm trying to claim my territory.

68
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Can't you tell?

69
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,500
Did you ever ask me first?

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,220
You two are quite the pair.

71
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,660
Cheating on each other, huh?

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,180
You do belong together.

73
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,500
Can't we just talk this out?

74
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,340
Talk about what?

75
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,520
About how childish you are?

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,700
Have you ever respected me?

77
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,980
Am I just your toy?

78
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,440
In front of everyone here,

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,840
you just pulled me in and kissed me.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Was it to show off your strength?

81
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,950
To show off your CEO vibe?

82
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,910
That's not what I meant.

83
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,220
What did you mean then?

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,390
I mean...

85
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,920
Lately,

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,540
you've been avoiding me nonstop.

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,550
I couldn't get an answer,

88
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
so I had to make one on my own.

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,260
I'm not avoiding you.

90
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,380
You are.

91
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,820
All this time,

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,180
you've been dodging me.

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,940
You know I've been thinking of you,

94
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,280
but you still keep your distance.

95
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,060
If you want me to wait like this,

96
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,180
I can handle it,

97
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,060
but at least set a deadline, right?

98
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,860
You don't have to do this.

99
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,380
But I really need a clear answer.

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm not sure how much longer
I can hold on.

101
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,740
Ten years.

102
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,220
After ten years,

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,940

104
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,420
and you too are still single,

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,900
