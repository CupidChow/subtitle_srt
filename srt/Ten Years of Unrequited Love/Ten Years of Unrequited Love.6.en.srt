Are you crazy?

12

You want to see Chang Qixing?

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,240
That's like walking into the lion's den.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,720
Listen to yourself.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
I've faced far worse before.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,900
Let me go with you then.

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,260
The deadline's been moved up.

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,300
Within half a day,

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
I need to see results.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,580
Understood.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,300
Miss Lin.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,740
Mr. Chang.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,660
You seem well-prepared today.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,660
I've toiled for Chairman Cen
for ten years.

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,540
Now that Mirui's in trouble,

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,790
it's wise to gather more information.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,670
Hmm.

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,380
It's good to seek shelter
under a big tree.

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,440
Mr. Chang, you won't mind
if I aim high, right?

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,700
You make it sound so easy.

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,140
Then let me test your sincerity.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,180
If you're turning to the light,

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,820
I'd welcome you with open arms.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,740
But if you're here to be a spy,

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,300
I can't allow that.

36
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,100
Even if I wanted to,

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,660
we'd need some ground rules.

38
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,300
Shall we talk terms first?

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,980
Yes, let's begin.

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,740
Everyone, allow me to introduce someone.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,540
This is Mirui's backbone.

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,700
Lin Miaomiao, the true heiress.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh, the guest Mr. Chang mentioned
is Secretary Lin.

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,740
I've heard about you,

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,340
but this is my first time meeting you.

46
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,160
It's a pleasure, truly.

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
I must apologize.

48
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,220
I'm late today.

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,720
I hope I haven't dampened the mood.

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Of course not.

51
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,380
Look at our gathering.

52
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,900
It's full of gentlemen.

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,220
We were missing a graceful lady.

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,380
Now, things feel balanced.

55
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,940
Alright, alright.

56
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,460
Come on, Zhou, sit here.

57
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,440
Miaomiao, come with me.

58
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,180
Mr. Cen, have you arrived?

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,380
Mirui and Weiyang

60
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,500
have always been
our nation's top coffee brands.

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,580
Though we've been rivals for years,

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,380
now we both face pressure
from foreign brands.

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,660
In a way, we're in this together.

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,140
At the bidding a few days ago,

65
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,500
there were some minor incidents,

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,060
but I believe,

67
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,220
Mr. Chang,

68
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,500
you were simply misled by false news.

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,500
Surely, you're open
to a win-win solution?

70
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,140
You really know how to betray me.

71
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,100
You were just praising
the big tree's shade,

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,180
and now you change your attitude.

73
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,140
Everyone here is smart.

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,100
Only by keeping diversity

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
can our circle truly thrive.

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,540
If we stir up these waters,

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,860
can we still win over Deman?

78
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,260
There will be many at the top

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,660
to persuade.

80
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,940
Mr. Chang.

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,980
A great mind can hold anything.

82
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,620
What do you think?

83
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,580
Come on, come on.

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Tonight,

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,260
Mr. Chang brought us together.

86
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,740
It must be fate that we meet.

87
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,100
Let's have a drink. Come on.

88
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,540
- Mr. Wang.
- Cheers.

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,660
Does your presence at this table tonight

90
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,340
mean you've chosen your side?

91
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,980
Not exactly.

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,620
I just see it as a meal

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
and a chance for a drink.

94
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540
Mirui had mud slung at it today.

95
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,260
Does anyone care about the truth?

96
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,380
Mr. Wang, you must know.

97
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,540
Everyone only cares about the outcome.

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,580
The terms are decent.

99
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,860
Not bad.

100
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,660
But coincidentally,

101
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,420
our capital flow is quite substantial.

102
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,340
Such petty profits hardly impress us.

103
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,540
If you wish to work with us,

104
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,780
you'll need to show some sincerity.

105
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,900
What do you mean?

106
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,340
Miaomiao.

107
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,780
Deals at the table

108
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,140
follow certain customs.

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,180
Everyone here can serve as a witness.

110
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,820
Have a cross-arm drink with me,

111
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,220
and this will be over at once.

112
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,580
You can take the contract home.

113
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,100
I'll handle anything

114
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
that might affect Mirui.

115
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,940
How does that sound?

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,140
Mr. Chang,

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,300
that's too far.

118
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,140
It's just a cross-arm drink.

119
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,220
It can wipe away old grudges.

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
It's worth it, Secretary Lin.

121
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,620
This is a good deal.

122
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,380
Secretary Lin, you may be charming,

123
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,020
but you can't slack off at the banquet.

124
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
Mr. Chang,

125
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,540
you flatter me.

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
I'll drink.

127
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,460
The heiress of Mirui

128
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,620
and the president of Weiyang.

129
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,100
What a perfect match.

130
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,660
Good, after this drink,

131
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,380
I'll play the matchmaker.

132
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,700
What are you doing?

133
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,700
Mr. Cen.

134
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,500
How discourteous of you.

135
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
You've ruined things
between Miaomiao and me.

136
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,860
Mr. Chang.

137
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,860
Don't forget our recent agreement.

138
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
Miaomiao.

139
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,780
I've finished my drink.

140
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,300
But you haven't touched yours at all.

141
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,940
What are you doing?

142
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,660
Do you know what you're doing?

143
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,100
What's wrong with me?

144
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,300
It's just a cross-arm drink.

145
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,260
It happens all the time; why so serious?

146
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,360
Let me tell you something.

147
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,700
Not only did I drink today,

148
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,980
but I've done it before.

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,720
It's just for some fun.

150
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,940
Once it's over, they'll forget.

151
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,300
Do you think they'll really forget?

152
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,580
Well, I...

153
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,740
I'll take my leave, Mr. Cen.

154
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,060
Do you think they'll forget?

155
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,710
