=Episode 10=

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,320
Mrs. Cen.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,370
You seem quite relaxed.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Where's Mr. Cen?

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,520
Isn't he worried that you're here?

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,640
Let me introduce you.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,840
This is the wife of Mr. Cen from Mirui.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,160
Mr. Cen's girlfriend?

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,080
Isn't that actress Su Peipei?

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,100
I've never

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,780
seen her before.

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,180
So what if she's an actress?

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,460
You don't get men.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,060
What makes a man?

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,580
We get bored fast.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,980
Men

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,460
always cheat.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,100
No way.

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,940
Miaomiao.

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,500
If Mr. Cen ever leaves you,

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,100
just let me know.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,940
I'm here for you.

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,020
I can give you

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,340
whatever he can offer you.

34
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,020
Who even are you?

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
What's wrong with him?

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,900
What a jerk.

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,660
Don't waste your energy on him.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,380
I'm never

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,140
coming back here again.

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,340
I paid for the car.

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,660
She just sped off without a word.

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,860
How carefree.

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,740
She left me alone in the parking lot.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,540
Seriously, does she have no heart?

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,460
Mr. Cen, just stay calm.

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,940
Are you upset about that?

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,980
Are you kidding me?

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,340
Why would I get upset about that?

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,380
Let me break it down for you.

50
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,780
Your mom slapped you once.

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,060
Secretary Lin slapped you once.

52
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,220
Su Peipei slapped Secretary Lin.

53
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,140
Secretary Lin slapped Su Peipei.

54
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,380
Secretary Lin gave two slaps in total.

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,300
Stop counting.

56
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,060
What's that for?

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
Look.

58
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Secretary Lin gave two slaps in total.

59
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,820
Didn't she put in the most effort?

60
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,260
What kind of logic is that?

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,420
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,780
Come on, let's go this way.

63
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,940
Chang Qixing?

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,540
Why is he still here?

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,140
What's going on?

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,180
What are they doing?

67
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,300
(Bar and Night Market)

68
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,280
Let's go.

69
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,700
I told you.

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,060
You'll see weird stuff
when walking at night.

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,340
Better be careful next time.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,540
Miaomiao.

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,900
He was drunk and got beaten.

74
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,580
Could he pass out for good?

75
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,060
Let's go check on him.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,260
Is he okay? He's not dead, is he?

77
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,980
Are you all right?

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,220
Lin Miaomiao.

79
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,280
What are you trying to do?

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,250
Did you hit me just now?

81
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,940
- What? Are you crazy?
- No.

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,420
When I walked over, someone covered me

83
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,760
with this and hit me. Was it you?

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,620
I came to check if you were okay.

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,470
It must be you.

86
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,340
It wasn't me.

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,180
Don't move.

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,220
What are you doing?

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,700
The more I think, the angrier I get.

90
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,860
I won't bother helping you again.

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,780
(Zhou Wan)

92
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,010
Hello.

93
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,460
Hello, Cen Siyuan.

94
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,460
Miss Lin...

95
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,980
Your wife is with me now.

96
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
What wife?

97
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,500
You have ten minutes.

98
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,660
Hurry to the Second Hospital.

99
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,620
Or I'll propose to her.

100
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,540
It's up to you.

101
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,060
Mr. Cen.

102
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,590
- What happened?
- Let's go.

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,500
Chang Qixing got beaten up.

104
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,660
Miaomiao thought he was gone,

105
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,020
so she went over to check it out,

106
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,220
but Chang Qixing grabbed her,

107
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,700
saying Miaomiao was behind it.

108
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,640
So what if he was dead?

109
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Why get involved?

110
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,260
Mr. Cen is here.

111
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,260
Mr. Chang, who did you upset this time?

112
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,340
You brought this on yourself.

113
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,460
She showed up too conveniently today.

114
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,380
It makes me think she set me up.

115
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,060
It wasn't me.

116
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,540
So why did you call me here?

117
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
Mr. Cen.

118
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,020
We've known each other for years.

119
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,100
You know me.

120
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,860
I'm not unreasonable.

121
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Admit she's your wife,

122
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,860
and I'll let this slide

123
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,700
for your sake.

124
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,900
How about that?

125
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm the one who did it.

126
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
You said it yourself.

127
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,690
- Yes.
- Fine.

128
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,820
- Yu Yang, call the police.
- Got it.

129
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,980
She hit me. Arrest her.

130
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,540
Mr. Chang,

131
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,540
Miaomiao would never dare hit you.

132
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,580
She's just saying that to annoy me.

133
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,340
If she really goes in,

134
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,660
my mom will tear me apart.

135
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,740
Do you admit she's your wife now?

136
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm right here.

137
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,500
Answer me.

138
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,460
Do you?

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah.

140
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,700
I've always seen her as my wife.

141
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,300
Alright.

142
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,860
Very good.

143
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,700
So, who is this?

144
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Not talking now?

145
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,940
You can't answer, huh?

146
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,900
You say she's your wife.

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,820
Then, who is Miss Su to you?

148
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,420
A mistress? A homewrecker?

149
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,060
Family matters are hard to judge.

150
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,100
Mr. Chang, no need for you...

151
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,780
It's not hard. It's simple.

152
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,930
This is Yu Yang.

153
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,180
This is Yu Yang's girlfriend.

154
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,060
Easy, right?

155
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,140
Look.

156
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,300
Everyone's being reasonable.

157
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,380
It's getting late now.

158
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,500
Rumors are everywhere.

159
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,980
Just tell us one thing.

160
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,380
Who is Miss Su to you?

161
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,060
An ex.

162
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,460
An ex?

163
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,860
Girlfriend,

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
mistress,

165
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,780
or a homewrecker.

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,380
What do you mean by "ex"?

167
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,820
Mrs. Cen, you spoil him too much.

168
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,340
He sneaks around with someone else.

169
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,100
Cen Siyuan.

170
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,300
You jerk.

171
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,260
Sorry about that.

172
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,260
Since you're Mr. Cen's wife,

173
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,380
I trust you.

174
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,540
I know it wasn't you.

175
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,580
You can leave.

176
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
I'm still shaken.

177
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,120
I need a moment to rest.

178
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,700
Can you think before you act?

179
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,460
I didn't hit him. What's wrong?

180
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,940
Don't I know what you're like?

181
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,280
Stop pretending with me.

182
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,220
We're in the hospital.

183
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,140
Why are you yelling?

184
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
Plus, did I ask you to come today?

185
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,460
Fine, I was just being nosy.

186
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
That's exactly it.

187
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,540
Great, now I'm a woman

188
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,340
who stole someone's boyfriend.

189
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,100
Happy now?

190
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,480
