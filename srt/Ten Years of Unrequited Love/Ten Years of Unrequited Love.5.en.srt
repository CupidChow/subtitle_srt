You...

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,800
You didn't leave last night?

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
I had some wine too,

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
so I couldn't drive home.

49
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,460
I had no choice

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,260
but to spend the night
in your living room.

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,680
Couldn't you call a driver instead?

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Lin Miaomiao,

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,620
you're both loyal and ungrateful.

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
How many nights have you stayed
at my home with my mother?

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
Can't I even sleep
on the floor at your place?

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,100
- You...
- What?

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,640
Look at the time.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,160
If you lose the Deman bid,

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,280
how will you explain that?

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Hold on.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,120
You're driving today.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't wear high heels.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,480
Aren't heels more formal?

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
What's your role here?

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
With me, comfort comes first.

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Mr. Cen.

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,640
Secretary Lin.

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Good morning.

69
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,860
Mr. Cen, impressive.

70
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,180
You just announced with a star,

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,420
yet then spent the night elsewhere.

72
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,260
Quite the adventure, isn't it?

73
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,620
Why is there not a single mark

74
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,900
left behind?

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,700
After all these years,

76
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,620
you still chase after rumors.

77
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,580
Wasn't your car

78
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,660
parked all night long

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,580
outside her apartment last night?

80
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Mr. Chang, your mind does wander.

81
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,300
Just selling coffee
is a waste of talent.

82
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,300
There's nothing more to say.

83
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,540
Let's go.

84
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,820
Mr. Cen.

85
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,660
How does the iced Americano

86
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,180
from the KEES coffee machine

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,580
at Miaomiao's place taste?

88
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,300
My apologies, Mr. Chang.

89
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,140
I left the one you gave me

90
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,660
at my door and forgot about it.

91
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,740
Someone collecting scraps took it away.

92
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,900
Is that so?

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,740
Miaomiao works for Mirui.

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,420
If she needs anything,

95
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,940
I'll arrange it for her.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,540
No need to trouble you.

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,580
Very well.

98
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,740
How thoughtful.

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,620
Miaomiao is Mirui's true heiress.

100
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,800
Of course, she deserves that care.

101
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,300
The true heiress?

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,680
That means she's your rival

103
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,000
for the right to inherit, right?

104
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,660
It's just a nickname.

105
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,260
No need for you to make a fuss.

106
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,860
We're in the same field.

107
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,100
Sometimes, it's best to let things go.

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,540
I'm not gossiping,

109
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,780
but rumors are everywhere now.

110
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,580
They say you set the gold standard
for patience.

111
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,380
So, you must know

112
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,300
that his admirers are

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,020
enough to fill several tables
of mahjong.

114
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,580
Let me ask you this.

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,700
Who's his true love,

116
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,780
you or Su Peipei?

117
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,220
Why are you so curious?

118
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,540
Don't tell me you have feelings
for Mr. Cen.

119
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,180
Miaomiao,

120
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm just looking out for you.

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,540
Don't catch any strange illnesses.

122
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,020
Mind your own business.

123
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,300
Everyone.

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,220
This way, please.

125
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,860
This is our proposal

126
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,380
(Mirui Coffee Proposal for Deman)
for Deman's floor space.

127
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,620
I believe,

128
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,220
in terms of brand value

129
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,100
and influence,

130
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,980
Mirui is the best choice for Deman.

131
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,460
We hope Mirui and Deman
can work together

132
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,540
and achieve mutual success.

133
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
From my view,

134
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,980
this proposal is good.

135
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,140
It shows Mirui's genuine intent.

136
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,540
Mirui's data is indeed impressive.

137
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,140
Under normal circumstances,

138
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,660
I'd quit.

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,220
However,

140
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,340
there are doubts
about the data's accuracy.

141
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,540
All of Mirui's sales figures

142
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,900
have been verified
by Deman and our experts.

143
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,900
You may not trust Mirui,

144
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,220
but would you doubt Deman as well?

145
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,740
Mr. Cen, no rush.

146
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,580
Lately, during our research,

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,020
when we looked into Mirui,

148
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,220
we found some evidence

149
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,940
about its unreliability.

150
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,740
Let's first watch this video.

151
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,420
Mr. Chang, what do you mean by this?

152
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,340
Show real evidence for your accusation.

153
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,860
This vague and unverified video

154
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,140
shown at such a formal event

155
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,360
at a high-level bidding meeting

156
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,500
makes your defeat less respectable.

157
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,500
If you think we've lost,

158
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,940
just pretend you never saw it.

159
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,660
But you're so upset now,

160
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,260
so this video might be true, right?

161
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,340
If my guess is right,

162
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,300
this must be spreading online now.

163
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,820
It's not unlikely.

164
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Mr. Cen,

165
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,100
it's already trending.

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,580
Manager Zhao,

167
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,340
Mr. Chang just leaked the kitchen video,

168
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,500
and now it's on the trending list.

169
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,780
The timing couldn't be more precise.

170
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,860
I'd like to ask you

171
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,460
to give us a few days.

172
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,380
The more you explain,
the messier it gets.

173
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,140
Well.

174
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,100
This incident

175
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,260
is quite suspicious.

176
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll give you three days.
Is that enough?

177
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,860
Thank you for trusting Mirui.

178
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,320
Was the KEES at your house

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,540
a gift from Chang Qixing?

180
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,940
I bought it myself.

181
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,780
What a coincidence.

182
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,380
It's the same brand.

183
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,980
You think I'm disloyal to Mirui?

184
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,980
Is this really about loyalty?

185
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,820
You know what kind of man
Chang Qixing is.

186
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,500
Why believe everything he says?

187
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,420
Seems you know him well.

188
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,780
What do you mean by that?

189
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,020
Who do I know?

190
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,860
True.

191
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Anyway,
tricks like gifting coffee makers

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,820
won't work on you.

193
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,860
You talk like you truly know me.

194
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,220
It's not about that.

195
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,220
You were drunk last night

196
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,300
and told me everything
as if I were your confidant.

197
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,020
What did I say?

198
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
You said a lot.
I need time to recall it.

199
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,060
You apologized to me

200
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,620
for accidentally losing my coffee cup.

201
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,280
Did I say that?

202
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,420
You did. Of course, you did.

203
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,300
You even called me a scoundrel.

204
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,220
You called me a jerk.

205
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,940
You went on and on about me.

206
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,900
No way.

207
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,340
There's no way I'd say that.

208
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,020
What else did I say?

209
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,420
Well.

210
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,900
You also said...

211
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,940
Hello, Chairman Cen.

212
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,100
The PR Department is on it.

213
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,060
Public response
will settle within an hour.

214
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,300
A statement to reassure consumers
is on the way.

215
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,100
Alright.

216
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Alright, I understand.

217
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,100
What are you doing?

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,390
Are you out of your mind?
That's Chairman Cen's call.

219
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,330
Don't you want to know

220
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,660
what you actually said last night?

221
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,580
I don't want to know.

222
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,140
I was drunk.

223
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,660
Who can tell if those words are true?

224
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,140
I can't even recall those words now.

225
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,980
I'm not like you.

226
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,300
You have time to seek comfort
with women,

227
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,500
but I'm not the same as you.

228
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,300
Miaomiao.

229
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,220
Have a cup of coffee.

230
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,490
How about it?

231
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,780
Have you thought of a solution?

232
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,700
I have an idea.

233
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,860
What is it?

234
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,270
Are you crazy?

235
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,500
You want to see Chang Qixing?
