11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,800
Since my childhood,
have you ever thought

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,620
about how I'd feel
when you make your decision?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,600
If you hadn't split us up ten years ago,

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
none of this would be happening.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
Didn't you push me to defy you?

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,320
Just because you're my mom,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,360
does that mean

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
you can be unfair?

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Chairman Cen.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,440
Are you all right?

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,280
She's fine.

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,600
See for yourself.

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,960
Look how well you've controlled her
for ten years.

24
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,020
So,

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,300
let's see today

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,340
how the Chairman of Mirui Group

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,460
bullies a workplace rookie

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,180
fresh out of college.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,100

What are you doing?

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,100
Don't move.

If Party B meets
any of these conditions,

35
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,700
Party A can end the contract anytime

36
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,620
and demand that Party B pay ten times

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,620
the medical expenses Party A covered.

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,060
During the contract,

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,420
Party B secretly dates Party A's son,
Cen Siyuan.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,340
Scenario two,

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,100
Party B leaks secrets
to any third party.

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,260

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100

119
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,860

We have a contract.

129
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,420
Tell him to let go.

130
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,860

131
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,470

148
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,780

149
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,460
and letting Miaomiao help with the kid.

150

Yeah.

Every time I see him,

156
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,140

six or seven years from now,

158
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,740

159
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,100
buy toys for him,

160
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,460

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,860
Six or seven years later?

162
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,500
He's five years old now.

163
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,060
