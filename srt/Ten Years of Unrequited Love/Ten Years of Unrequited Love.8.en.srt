=Episode 8=

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,920
Hello.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,600
You are Su Peipei, right?

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,400
I am Cen Siyuan's mother.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
Hello, Chairman Cen.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,880
Are you free tonight?

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,280
Let's have dinner together.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
Sure.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Mr. Cen, these are

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,200
our company's latest cup sleeves.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,960
I think these two look really fresh.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,840
(Lin Miaomiao)
It matches our company's image.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Besides that...

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,160
Hold on a sec.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,240
Hey, Cen Siyuan.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,500
Got a question for you.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
If your mom and Su Peipei
fell into the water,

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,440
who would you save first?

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,640
Can you be serious?

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,360
If your mom and Su Peipei fought,

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
who would you help?

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,920
What do you mean?

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
How old are you?

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,240
I'm 24 this year.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,440
Is it your traditional age
or your actual age?

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
My actual age.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm really 24.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,320
I'm a Tiger.

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,980
I'm lacking the water element
in the Five Elements,

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,300
so my parents named me Peipei.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,800
Zodiac sign?

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm a Pisces.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,680
I know Siyuan is a Scorpio.

43
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,040
Our zodiac match is 99%.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
It's like we're made for each other.

45
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,210
Blood type?

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm Type O blood.

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,880
Siyuan

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,920
is Type A, right?

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
They say kids with these blood types

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,240
are both adorable and smart.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,960
Most importantly, they're caring too.

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,300
MBTI?

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm an introvert

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,250
and an advocate.

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm INFJ.

56
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
People like us

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
believe in love.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
We're empathetic.

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
We love to give.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,680
Those make us great partners.

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
Just talking isn't enough.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,680
If Siyuan wants to marry you,

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
he'll need my approval in the end.

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
What makes you so sure

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,200
that I'd give my consent?

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,400
Because...

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,400
Chairman Cen,

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
our feelings are real.

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
Tell me.

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
How does coffee taste?

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
It's bitter.

72
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
But you can add sugar.

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Right.

74
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,840
It's like going through storms.

75
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,920
It's exhausting

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,040
and tough,

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
but

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,800
there's still sweetness in the end.

79
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,200
I built Mirui from the ground up.

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Whoever stands with its heir

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,280
must handle hardship too.

82
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Of course.

83
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Mom.

84
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,000
Siyuan.

85
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,800
Mom, she hasn't even married me.

86
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Why lecture her now?

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,520
As Mirui's Chairman,

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm interviewing the brand ambassador.

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,160
Do I need to report to you,

90
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,360
the Executive Director?

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,640
What?

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
Brand Ambassador?

93
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
Miss Su, are you not interested?

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Of course, she is.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Chairman Cen,
you really have an eye for talent.

96
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Everyone can see Peipei's momentum

97
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
in recent years.

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
Her business value
keeps rising steadily.

99
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
If we can work with Mirui,

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,480
it'll be a win-win for sure.

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,540
Thank you, Chairman Cen.

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
Mom,

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,880
this is really sudden.

104
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
Why didn't you talk to me first?

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
You didn't just decide on a whim, right?

106
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,920
When have I ever given empty promises?

107
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,600
What do you think, Miaomiao?

108
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,280
Every decision Chairman Cen makes

109
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,520
is always well thought out.

110
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Also,

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
I'll have finance transfer

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,800
your film & TV investment funds
for Miss Su tomorrow.

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
Here.

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
Miss Su,

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240
may we cooperate well.

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
Looking forward to it, Chairman Cen.

117
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Hey.

118
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,380
I'm downstairs at your place.

119
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,020
Aren't we supposed to go together?

120
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,200
It's like going through storms.

121
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,760
It's exhausting

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
and tough,

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,440
but

124
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,160
there's still sweetness in the end.

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
Work with me and give it your all.

126
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
Leave Siyuan behind.

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
Ten years.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
- Senior.
- Miaomiao.

129
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Wow, it really is you, Lin Miaomiao.

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
What a coincidence.

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
Long time no see.

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
You've gotten even prettier.

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
I just saw you over there.

134
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,520
Still small and skinny,

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,740
just like when you were a kid.

136
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,780
You look like a kid still.

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,200
Oh, stop it.

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,000
After all these years? Still a kid?

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
That'd be wild.

140
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
It's pouring out.

141
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,060
What are you doing here alone?

142
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm here for a business meeting today.

143
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,520
Don't try to fool me.

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,000
You're obviously hiding here,
feeling down.

145
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,940
Did your boyfriend upset you?

146
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Mr. Cen.

147
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,540
I can't just deal with him directly,

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,300
but at least I can help
with advice, right?

149
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,180
Mr. Deng.

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Long time no see.

151
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Hello.

152
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
No.

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm not upset.

154
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm still single.

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,160
You two...

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
This is my boss.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,360
He's Cen Siyuan,
Executive Director of Mirui Coffee.

158
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,900
I've been Miss Lin's boss
for a full ten years

159
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,460
since she graduated.

160
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Mirui?

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
Miaomiao,

162
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
I didn't expect we'd cross paths
at work.

163
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,260
I'm with the Investment Department
of Deman.

164
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm in charge of the Mirui project.

165
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
What a coincidence.

166
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm here at Mirui to sign the contract.

167
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,280
This morning, when I left home,

168
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,760
no wonder there were magpies
chirping outside my door.

169
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
Maybe they were hinting
I'd see an old friend.

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Magpies? It's raining out there.

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Let's go.

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,840
I'll hold the umbrella for you,
Miaomiao.

173
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,000
Here, have some coffee.

174
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Thanks.

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,560
Mr. Cen is so down-to-earth.

176
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,640
You really care for your team.

177
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
Working at Mirui,

178
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,060
Miaomiao's got it good.

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a two-way street.

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,470
Secretary Lin
always looks after me, too.

181
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Right?

182
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,040
Senior, you really are quite the catch.

183
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,100
You're the Investment Manager of Deman.

184
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,300
Even your voice sounds charming.

185
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,540
Just look
at that prominent Adam's apple.

186
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,240
You give off a strong masculine vibe.

187
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,060
There must be so many girls

188
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,180
who secretly dream about you.

189
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,100
I can't compare to you, though.

190
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,420
Your trending topic scandals
are unbeatable.

191
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,540
Nice phone case.

192
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,140
Paw Patrol.

193
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,060
I'm still holding

194
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,220
onto my childhood.

195
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,820
Even if I look mature,

196
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,180
deep down,

197
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm really still a kid inside.

198
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,700
A pretty big kid.

199
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,780
You didn't even shave
your beard properly.

200
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
That's rare.

201
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,140
If you put it that way,

202
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,340
Mr. Cen,

203
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,340
you're pretty mature for your age.

204
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,740
After all, you look so young.

205
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,740
Your love life

206
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,300
is honestly quite colorful.

207
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,740
To be with the right person,

208
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
learning from experience

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,820
is actually pretty important.

210
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,740
What's wrong with you?

211
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,140
Everything you say
reflects on Mirui now.

212
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,870
OK.

213
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,340
We can go in now.

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,860
- Cheers to our partnership.
- Cheers.

215
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,700
Mr. Deng.

216
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,860
May we cooperate well.

217
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,380
Deman's bid

218
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
was secured by Miaomiao's hard work.

219
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,820
It was she who signed the contract
with Deman on behalf of Mirui.

220
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,140
Shouldn't I shake her hand?

221
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,260
At Mirui,

222
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,660
my rank is higher than hers.

223
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,500
That's my honor.

224
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,900
Mirui will definitely deliver

225
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,540
a great result.

226
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm looking forward to it.

227
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,260
What do you want to do, Cen Siyuan?

228
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,420
What do you mean?

229
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Today is such an important day,

230
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,980
with so many eyes watching you.

231
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,260
Why did you grab his hand so hard?

232
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,060
Even if you're upset,

233
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,560
can't you hold back for Mirui?

234
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,880
Did you see how he looked at you?

235
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,560
You think I don't know
what he's thinking?

236
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,580
Why should I hold back?

237
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,140
I'm single.

238
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,620
Senior Deng is single, too.

239
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,180
Even if he likes me,

240
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,260
so what?

241
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,460
Don't I have the right to like someone?
