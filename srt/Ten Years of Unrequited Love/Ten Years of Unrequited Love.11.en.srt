186
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,180

187
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,060
If we add some elements
from the Bauhaus style

188
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,700

it might stand out.

Go on.

190
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,620
However, I think

191
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,300
we should keep the retro vibe overall.

192
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,580
But for areas like the reception

193
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,900
or restroom,

194
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,820
we could add some bright color.

195
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,540
We could even set up

196
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,980
some small photo spots.

197
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,600
We could switch those photo spot styles

198
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,380
every season,

199
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,680
so it'll be all-encompassing

200
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,600
and always on trend.

201
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,260
Hmm.

202
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Sounds pretty good.

203
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,740
It's just a little...

204
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,940
A little pricey.

205
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,860
Securing Deman's spot wasn't easy.

206
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,420
No risk, no reward, Mr. Cen.

207
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,900
Hmm.

208
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Let's think it over.

209
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,420
Maybe there's a fresh idea that's cheap.

210
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,300
Such a capitalist.

211
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,340
Why push yourself so hard?

212
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,940
You should really take care of yourself.
