12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,440
Miaomiao.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Thank you.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,800
Go pour a drink for Senior Deng.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
Guests should be welcomed.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Let's toast to Senior Deng.

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,600
Why pour sparkling water
into a coffee mug?

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,680
You only have three cups at home.

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
Two coffee mugs and one glass cup.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,270
I can't share a coffee mug

22
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,560
with Senior Deng.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
Right, Senior?

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
Here.

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,680
So, you two

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
are actually together now?

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
No, we're not.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,880
Senior, you got it wrong.

29
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,120
I thought so.

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
If you were together,

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,760
I'd have left already.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,800
We aren't now,

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,200
but in the future...

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,500
Let's not talk about the future.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,440
In that case,

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll stay for dinner.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Miaomiao didn't invite you.

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,920
When Miaomiao was five,

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,600
she played as my wife.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,380
That's how close we are.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,020
Does she need to invite me?

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,520
What's that about?

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,440
And it lasted the whole summer.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
When Miaomiao was little,

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,280
she loved chicken legs the most.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Here, have more chicken legs.

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,360
What's so great about chicken legs?

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,250
The meat's always dry.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,600
Here, try a chicken wing instead.

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
You picked it up; you eat it.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
Come on, have some greens.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
This one.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
The braised pork is pretty good too.

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,880
This one.

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
This one.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
You two,

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
that's enough.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,680
Can't this wait till later?

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,620
OK, I'll come as soon as I can.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Miaomiao.

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
Something happened at the company.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
Senior, you should go handle it.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,680
Miaomiao has me here. Go ahead.

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Actually, I wanted to talk to you...

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Just go.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
Work comes first.

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,160
It's the top priority.

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,080
You two aren't dating, right?

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,960
So, it's not proper for you to stay.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Let's leave together. Come on.

71
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm Miaomiao's supervisor.

72
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
She hasn't finished her work.

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,480
I need to keep an eye on things.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Miaomiao is super disciplined.

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,660
She doesn't need you watching her.

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
Plus,

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,600
if word gets out about you two
alone in a room,

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
that could affect Miaomiao's reputation.

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,160
You being her boss doesn't mean

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
you can cross the line.

81
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,640
She just feels too shy to say it.

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Why are you being so nosy?

83
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
Mr. Cen,

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
maybe you should leave too.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Did you hear that?

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Let's go.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,380
Let's leave together.

88
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,640
Let's leave together.

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Let's go.

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Come on.

91
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,320
Miaomiao already said it.

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's go.

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,080
Bye-bye.

94
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Bye.

95
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,640
Forgot my coat.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Let's go.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760

about that plan.

How did you handle this?

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
I'll head over in a bit.

How about this?

170

After my contract with Mirui ends,

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
we can talk about it.

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Sure.

to invite you as our brand ambassador.

you signed with the company,

We can start work today.

189
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
What's going on?

190
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,410
What's happening between you and Siyuan?

191
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,160
Chairman Cen,

192
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,780
it's a complicated situation.

193
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
I...

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
You've never let me down before.

195
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,880
I'll keep this under wraps.

196
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,040
You'd better know what you're doing.

197
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,630
Understood.

198
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,490
Within a week,

199
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,740
get this handled.

200
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
Then I can pretend nothing happened.
