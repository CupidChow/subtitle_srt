it'll take some time.

Let me tell you something.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Well...

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,260
I want to set up a meeting
with Chairman Cen.

Let's talk when we meet.

18
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,230

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,780
(We'll talk later.
OK.)

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
Take a seat.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,680
You've lost weight.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,200
Maybe I haven't been sleeping well.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
Miaomiao.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
I...

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
Let me tell you a story.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Back when Siyuan was just a baby,

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,640
I separated from his dad.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,920
You probably see me as a villain,

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,160
but I really valued love back then.

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
I thought Siyuan's dad was my true love.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Honestly,

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,480
his family was doing well at the time,

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
and he was talented too.

40
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,320
I was just a girl from a small town.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
All I knew was how to ace tests.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,620
That's how it started.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,040
The two of us got together.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,560
First came the baby,

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
and then we got married.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
He was studying to be a teacher.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,240
His handwriting was beautiful.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,280
He wrote me the sweetest love letters

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,760
and said the most moving things to me.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,780
But then, things changed.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
All I got was 30 years alone.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
I cried, made a scene,

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,140
and tried everything I could,

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
but he just wouldn't stay.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
I got tired,

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
so we split up.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
I know

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,560
I don't deserve it.

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
Chairman Cen,

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,480
please don't say that.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Miaomiao,

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,080
there are only two things

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
I believe in.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Love is nothing but an illusion.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
Men are never really trustworthy.

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,760
Even Siyuan isn't any better.

67
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,880
Since his earliest memories,

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
he hasn't known real hardship.

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,280
By then, I'd already grown strong.

70
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,320
I've always been protecting him

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
just because he's my son.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
Maybe I'm being narrow-minded.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,700
I've lived so long on my own

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,420
without ever being truly loved.

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Sometimes, I forget how to love others.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
In my heart,

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
I might even treat you better than him.

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm scared you two

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
will end up alone

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,000
just like I am now.

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
I don't want someone I love

82
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
to live a life like mine.

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,800
