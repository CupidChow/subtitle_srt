=Episode 2=

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
Did she really said that?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,360
Yes.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,000
What do you think?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
I think she's good.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,540
She's young and lively,

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,720
and she carries herself well.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,920
She suits Mr. Cen.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,360
She's a decent girl,

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,700
but to join our family,

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,500
she still needs some time.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,300
Stop worrying about it.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,620
Let Mr. Cen decide for himself.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,900
I feel Su Peipei

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,340
is still a bit immature.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,860
It's fine for her to date,

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,540
but when it comes to marriage,

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,340
she may not be ready
for that responsibility.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,060
Siyuan changes girlfriends so often.

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,940
Can Su Peipei handle that?

30
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,620
My daughter-in-law

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,420
must be able to keep my son in check.

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,820
She can't stir up gossip every day

33
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,060
and put Mirui in a tough spot.

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,700
So,

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,800
you need to help him choose wisely.

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,980
Yes.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,780
Lin Miaomiao is your secretary,

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,340
not some marriage consultant.

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm just dating.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,360
Do you have to investigate me
like a suspect?

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,460
When did you get back?

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,700
You didn't even tell me.

43
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,020
I'm here now, aren't I?

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,340
Do you know
what people are saying outside?

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,940
They say one's too fickle and carefree,

46
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,360
and the other's seizing the chance.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,620
Now, Mirui's reputation is at stake.

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,420
Am I not allowed to ask about it?

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,380
Is that so?

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,060
The news I've read

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,660
says we're a perfect match,

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,540
like we're meant to be a family.

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,220
You just returned from overseas,

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,860
and now you're picking a fight with me?

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,140
It's not that I'm against you,

56
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,980
but look at what you've done.

57
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,300
One always barks;

58
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,100
the other always meddles.

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,340
Who's barking?

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,460
And who's meddling?

61
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,240
Explain it.

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,340
You meddled in my marriage.

63
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,820
Isn't that right?

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,300
You still want to marry her, right?

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,180
Why can't I?

66
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,580
If I wish to, I will.

67
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,460
Are you trying to anger me to death?

68
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,020
Chairman Cen.

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,180
Why are you so kind?

70
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,020
Caring for my boss's health

71
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
is my duty as an employee.

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,060
Besides,

73
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,300
you got hurt because I failed my task.

74
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,380
I'm worried about my lifespan.

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,120
The redness is gone; why apply it?

76
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,580
Also, my quarrel with my mother

77
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,020
was because of Peipei.

78
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,540
What's it got to do with you?

79
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,460
She must be special

80
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,180
for you to do this.

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,980
Since you're my employee,

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,660
don't comment
on your boss's private life.

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,060
I spoke out of turn.

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,060
Why are you still here so late?

85
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,300
Chairman Cen asked me
to stay here these days.

86
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,580
You're getting good at being her lackey.

87
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,700
What about you?

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,580
Why aren't you with Miss Su
on such a fine night?

89
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,540
Why leave her alone in an empty room?

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,500
Spending time with her

91
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,060
can't compare to watching you slip up.

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,180
That's far more entertaining.

93
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,780
What blunder could I possibly make?

94
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,620
Looks like you tried
to win but lost instead.

95
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,660
At first, I thought

96
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,780
with my mother's temper,

97
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
she'd surely scold you

98
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,460
for failing to tear us apart.

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Chairman Cen

100
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,380
doesn't seem so harsh anymore.

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,740
Seems like

102
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,060
she's become more tolerant.

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,460
Are you joking?

104
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,760
Doesn't she have to be here

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,540
when you flatter her?

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,740
Why are you laughing?

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,700
You don't have

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,620
to say

109
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,540
I'm flattering her

110
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,540
while touching your face.

111
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,380
So childish.

112
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,420
Miaomiao.

113
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,060
How long have you followed me?

114
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,980
Two more months make ten years.

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,420
Sometimes,

116
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,460
I can't help but feel time flies.

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,740
I remember when you first joined me,

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,140
you were just about to finish uni.

119
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,490
Now you can handle things
for Mirui alone.

120
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,500
Wait here.

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,700
Miaomiao, come in with me.

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,620
Chairman Cen.

123
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,620
Miaomiao, all these years by my side

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,900
must've been hard for you.

125
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Not at all.

126
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,180
I've even bought a house here.

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,900
Saying it's tough sounds fake.

128
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,340
About the bid
for Deman Mall's floor space,

129
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,620
how's your preparation going?

130
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm ready for it.

131
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,750
Deman is

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,540
one of the top malls in the country.

133
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,060
Securing the floor space rights

134
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
would boost

135
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,980
our high-end coffee brand.

136
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,260
Yeah.

137
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,260
This time,
our main rival is still Weiyang.

138
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,620
If you can win this bid,

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,740
I'll promote you straight to the CSO.

140
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
From then on,

141
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,860
you won't be a secretary anymore.

142
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,100
I feel sorry about that.

143
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,020
When you become the CSO,

144
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,540
you won't need to endure any hardship.

145
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,460
Not at all.

146
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,580
I don't feel wronged at all.

147
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,980
Chairman Cen,

148
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
I won't disappoint you.

149
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,620
Don't mention disappointment again.

150
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,600
Remember:

151
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,540
Your words must be flawless.

152
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,900
Alright, alright.

153
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,860
Then I'll work hard to become the CSO.

154
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,740
And you'll call me Ms. Lin.

155
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,340
I'd have the Legal Department
draft a contract now

156
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,060
just to tie you to Mirui forever.

157
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,380
Thanks, Chairman Cen.

158
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,500
Alright.

159
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,500
Let them in.

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,340
Okay.

Do you know who I am?

170
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,300
I've paid your surgery fees.

171
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,300
As for the ongoing expenses

172
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,860
and medical fees,

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,060
I'll cover them all.

174
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,980
I only have one request.

175
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,900
Stay away from Siyuan.

176
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,460
Is this Cen Siyuan's wish?

177
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,460
He doesn't need to know.

178
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,900
You're forcing me into this.

179
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,460
How could a parent act like you?

180
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,180
Don't blame me for being harsh.

181
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,180
If I hadn't paid your medical fees,

182
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,660
you would have lost both your parents.

183
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,260
I know my son

184
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,780
better than anyone.

185
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,900
In the end, he won't choose you.

186
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,980
We're different.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Look at your family.

188
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980

You won't lower the price,
but you need money to save your mom.

190
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,220
As for our family,

191
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,100
we built our fortune on real estate,

192
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,380
so saving a life is no trouble for us.

193
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,220
Do you truly think

194
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,300
the two of you can really be together?

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,140
Is that realistic?

196
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,180
So, in your eyes,

197
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm not good enough for him.

198
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,620
I know your grades are excellent.

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,980
So,

200
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,940
I'll give you a chance.

201
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,980
Work with me and give it your all.

202
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,620
Leave Siyuan behind.

203
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,300
Ten years.

204
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,700
After ten years,

205
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,540
if he remains unmarried,

206
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,020
and you too are still single,

207
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,520
I won't interfere with you two.

208
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,780
Ten years?

209
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,540
Not a day more.

210
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
Not a day less.

211
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,460
As for me,

212
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
I value my promises,

213
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,780
and I won't force anyone.

214
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,060
Think it through yourself,

215
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,960
and come to me if you decide.

216
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,500
(Cen Fengling)

217
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,980
I've made up my mind.

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,220
It's over between us.

219
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,420
Please stop bothering me, alright?

220
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,700
Chairman Cen hasn't been well lately.

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,050
(Ten-Year Pact)
She might've forgotten.

222
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,980
I'll remind her
when the time draws near.

223
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,540
Do you have a boyfriend now?

224
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,180
After all,

225
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,300
I've never lacked company.

226
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,020
If you send her away,

227
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,020
who will fill her place then?
