Miss Su, Mr. Chang is busy.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,160
You can't go in.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Don't just stand there.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,530
Have a seat.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,440
Let's sit and talk.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,320
Are you behind the art gallery incident?

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Oh.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Miss Su, you really see everything

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,450
and hear everything.

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,520
Your skills are impressive.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,480
You know this is breaking the law,
right?

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,880
Didn't Lisa ever teach you that?

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,720
As a celebrity, you should be cautious.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,990
Got it?

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,930
Words can cause real trouble.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,720
If anything happens to Siyuan,

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,760
I won't just let it go.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Yeah.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
And what will you do?

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,810
You...

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,320
Doctor, is the checkup done?

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,820
Is there really nothing wrong?

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,960
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,940
Could something be wrong?

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,040
The CT and MRI reports

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
are all out, right?

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,880
Everything is fine.

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,280
Just a mild concussion.

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,560
Change the bandage once a day,

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,900
and make sure he gets enough rest.

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,920
Concussion?

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,420
What if he loses his memory?

43
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,640
Could something else be wrong?

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,920
Any side effects to worry about?

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,040
Should we do another check?

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,120
Can you prescribe something?

47
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
It's not that serious.

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,600
It's mild;
a week or so of rest should do.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,120
Then why hasn't he woken up?

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080

You scared me to death.

54
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Stop being so dramatic.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,600
A concussion, seriously?

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Can't you just hope for the best?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,460
Are you still in pain?

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,120
It's nothing. I feel fine now.

Any update from the police?

85
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
The sender is linked to Chang Qixing.

86
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
He might be behind it.

87
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,040
Trouble only finds those with cracks.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Since it's his move,

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
there must be a weak spot.

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,480
whether we settle in court or privately,

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
we need a proper ending.

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Got it.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Chairman Cen.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
Miaomiao, have a seat.

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,580
How long have you worked with me?

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Ten years.

98
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
These past ten years,

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
you've looked after me

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,180
and helped me get things done.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
You've worked so hard.

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
I've noticed everything you do.

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
It's normal for men

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
and women to get married.

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,640
You're in your early 30s now.

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,280
Chairman Cen,

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm not looking to get married.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
That's just silly talk.

109
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
A woman needs a home.

110
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
You can't just focus on your work.

111
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Work only brings money and comfort.

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
What about your feelings?

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
Having kids matters too.

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
Isn't your mom hoping for grandkids?

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
However,

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,320
you must be careful with marriage.

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
One wrong choice,

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,680
and life gets tough for years.

119
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,680
Don't end up like me.

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
Chairman Cen.

121
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,880
What's wrong?

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
I...

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Actually,
it's not that I don't want to marry.

124
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,160
Can I ask you something?

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Go ahead.

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
You...

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,720
Did you really forget
why I joined Mirui?

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,120
Did you forget the promise
you made to me?

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,600
Maybe you've forgotten,

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
but I remember every single word.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,160
You saved my dad back then.

132
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,060
I'm truly grateful for that.

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,760
However,

134
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,800
back then, you promised me

135
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,320
that if Siyuan and I

136
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,200
were still in love after ten years,

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
you'd let us be together.

138
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,440
I've worked hard for you for ten years.

139
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Ten years.

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Don't you remember?

141
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
Of course, I do.

142
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,880
If I'm not mistaken,

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,160
there are still days left

144
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,200
until our pact, right?

145
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,160
You've held on for ten years,

146
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,880
so why let go now?

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
What does our pact even mean to you?

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,880
Is it just some kind of joke?

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Or a promise that never really mattered?

150
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,800
Ten years ago,

151
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,060
your dad was seriously ill,

152
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,960
and you didn't have the money
for treatment.

153
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,800
Back then, you had nothing.

154
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,680
You chose to stay rational

155
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,920
and agreed to my terms.

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
For these ten years,

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
you built your life
step by step with Mirui.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
You bought a place of your own

159
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
and supported your family.

160
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, you have everything you wanted,

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
so you feel it's unfair

162
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,320
and choose to break your promise?

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,160
So,

164
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,880
do you still think I'm not good enough
for Siyuan?

165
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,920
Are you questioning my choice
from ten years ago?

166
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,760
Is love all you care about,

167
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,360
and nothing else matters anymore?

168
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
I always believed

169
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,000
you were thoughtful and sensible.

170
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,320
I've always pushed you to be your best.

171
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
Just a few days ago,

172
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
when you two were photographed
at the Deman party,

173
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
you promised me

174
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,960
that you'd handle it properly.

175
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,280
I've given you a chance.

176
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Why did you ignore everything

177
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
and break your promise
right under my nose?

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,560
Miaomiao,

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
what I can't stand most in life

180
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
is someone who doesn't keep their word.

181
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
You treated our pact like a joke.

182
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,320
You can break our pact today,

183
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,040
so what can stop you
from quitting tomorrow

184
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,960
on projects worth hundreds of millions?

185
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,400
If that's really the case,

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,180
have my efforts
in mentoring you for years

187
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,500
gone in vain?

188
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,800
Ask yourself this.

189

I don't expect much from others,

at least in you.
