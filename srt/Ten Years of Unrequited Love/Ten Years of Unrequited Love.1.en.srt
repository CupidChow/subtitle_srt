I've done this many times before.

101
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,140
I'm just here to carry out
Chairman Cen's orders.

102
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
Today, I remain as mechanical as ever.

103
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,860

104
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,420

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,730
Right now,

107
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,940
rumors about you and Mr. Cen
are everywhere.

108
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,670
Chairman Cen wishes to know

109
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,920
what your thoughts
about your future are.

110
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,540
Naturally, we are thinking of marriage.

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,140
Once you are wed,

112
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,540
Chairman Cen

113
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,260
hopes you will become a housewife.

114
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,140
A housewife?

115
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,900
Come on.

116
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,220
What era do you think this is?

117
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,420
You must be joking.

118
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,700
I know you're a public figure.

119
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,220
It'd be difficult for you
to step back from the spotlight.

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,820
Women should be financially independent.

121
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,040
Success in both career
and love is ideal.

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,820
But Chairman Cen started from nothing.

123
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,980
She worked hard to give Mirui
what it has today.

124
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,420
If her daughter-in-law

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,020
is in the entertainment industry,

126
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,780
there's bound to be gossip.

127
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,380
If you two are just dating,

128
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,980
whether it's genuine or just for show,

129
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,700
she can simply turn a blind eye.

130
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,420
But if marriage is your goal,

131
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,500
you can't have it all.

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,260
In terms of career, I think...

133
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,340
Marrying into a rich family is limiting.

134
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,220
If you can't make this sacrifice,

135
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,780
how can you care
for your future mother-in-law?

136
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,420
Secretary Lin,

137
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,140
of course,
I'll care for my future mother-in-law.

138
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,420
I just wanted to remind you

139
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,020
that Cen Siyuan is definitely not

140
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,580
the hero from a romance novel.

141
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,020
He changes women
as often as his clothes.

142
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,980
You must have heard about this.

143
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,860
I just hope you can

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,100
step back before it gets hard

145
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,140
and protect yourself.

146
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,100
Don't fall for him for real.

147
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,780
Because you will never

148
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,020
be his last woman.

149
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,940
Who says that?

150
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,180
Aren't you...

151
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,580
Don't think being close to my mother

152
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,580
gives you the right to pick on Peipei.

153
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,540
Siyuan.

154
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,020
Secretary Lin

155
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,900
wasn't making things hard for me.

156
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,580
We were only having a talk.

157
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,620
Is that so?

158
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,100
You haven't seen her get ruthless.

159
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,100
It's not that exaggerated.

160
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,060
Did you hear what she just said?

161
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,980
I know this is Ms. Cen's test.

162
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,260
Why would I go against the examiner?

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,620
Anyway, I've said all I needed to.

164
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,540
Lin Miaomiao.

165
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,820
You must've gotten too used

166
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,340
to being a lackey to have principles.

167
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,260
You came to embarrass my girlfriend,

168
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,780
relying on my mother's support.

169
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,340
Miss Su.

170
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,340
I'll leave you in peace for now.

171
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,720
Think carefully about what I said.

172
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,060
I'll wait for your reply.

173
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,380
Aren't you going to see her off?

174
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,300
What are you doing?

175
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,380
You're hurting me.

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
How many times have you done this?

177
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,300
I was just listening to your mother.

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,700
You've truly become
my mother's loyal aide.

179
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,700
I am Chairman Cen's secretary.

180
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,980
Of course, I serve at her side.

181
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,300
But if you're willing

182
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,060
to pay me double the salary,

183
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,260
I might just cheer for you.

184
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,780
After all, as you know,

185
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,140
I'm always after promotions and raises.

186
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,100
You never think for yourself

187
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,760
and just do whatever my mother says.

188
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,500
Do you know what people say about you?

189
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,000
Do others' opinions really matter?

190
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,620
Can it earn me any bonus or insurance?

191
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,640
If my mother told you to break the law,
would you?

192
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,620
Mr. Cen,

193
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
perhaps you should show more concern

194
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,540
for Miss Su's feelings.

195
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,540
What if she's just pretending
to be strong?

196
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
If you really have nothing to do,

197
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,860
go find yourself a companion

198
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,180
instead of meddling in others' affairs.

199
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,900
After all,

200
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,980
I've never lacked company.

201
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,660
If you send her away,

202
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,700
who will fill her place then?

203
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,500
Besides, I recall someone once saying

204
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,060
she wanted to experience love

205
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
while she was still young,

206
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,020
to find the best husband.

207
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
Am I right?

208
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,180
