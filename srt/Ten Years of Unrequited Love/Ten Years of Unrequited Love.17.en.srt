11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,920
These two cups sold well this year.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,520
Restock them as much as you can.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
How would I even know?

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,080
It's kind of like metaphysics.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,460
But the butterfly
actually means something.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Miaomiao.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,340
Let's leave it here for now.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,280
Senior, what are you doing here?

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,520
Blind date.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,800
Are you serious?

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
It's almost time now.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Can you keep an eye out for me?

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,800
Just hide nearby.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,160
Over here, this way.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,360
Alright.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,160
Coffee's on me, okay?

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
Hi, are you Mr. Deng?

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,800
That's me. Please sit.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,400
You're even more handsome in person.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720
Are you a Horse?

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Yes.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,560
That doesn't clash with me.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,960
You believe in that too?

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
My grandma says

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,560
marrying a Horse brings luck
to the family.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
Right, if you believe,
miracles will happen.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,400
You look way prettier than your photos.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,100
You must have plenty of admirers.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
So, why try blind dating?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
I wasn't into it before either.

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,920
I've met a few people lately.

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,520
Honestly, I think it's a smart way.

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,840
We lay all our cards out up front.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
It's not like

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,760
it has nothing to do with love, right?

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,120
Look at some people these days.

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
They aren't really a match,

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
and so much time gets wasted.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,580
That's a good point.

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,940
I ordered you a cup of coffee.

51
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
Let's chat while we drink.

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
- It's here.
- Your coffee.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
Thanks.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,720
Do you mind me being this direct?

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,040
Not at all.

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
I actually like it.

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
Yeah, I like it too.

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
Would you mind

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,360
if your partner had a kid?

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
You...

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Do you mean you?

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah.

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,840
I think it's pretty good.

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Really?

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Painless motherhood is trending now.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,960
But I think I still need

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
to think it over a bit more.

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Sorry.

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
And she left?

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
I suppose she did.

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,800
She didn't even touch the coffee.

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Go ahead, drink it.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
Forget it.

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm used to this anyway.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
Honestly,
I'm not really into remarriage.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,640
It's just...

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
Just what?

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
It's my son.

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
He's four now.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,080
He's growing up, getting sensible,

81
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
and always asking for her mom.

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,440
Miaomiao.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,640
I have a favor to ask.

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,920
Could you maybe...?

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,280
We've arrived.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Alright.

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,720
I'll walk you upstairs.

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,680
No need, I'm almost home.

89
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
You should go get some rest.

90
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,120
I'll head back now.

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
a lot to me.

95
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,800
I've already said yes.

96
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,440
Go home and get some sleep.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840

That's right.

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,080

You can't go.

00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,560

Fine.

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,920
But you have to be home by 8:30.

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's go see a movie together.

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
I'm not your mom.

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm your dad's friend.

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,480

179
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,680
You can't do that.

180
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
You can't call me Mom.

181

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
your mom...

183
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
I won't play with you anymore.

184

Paw Patrol has a team meeting.

192
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,240
That's so cute.

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,840
Thank you, Mom.

194
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,030
Go play with this, Chengcheng.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
Don't mind what Chengcheng says.

196
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,680
It's fine.

197
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
He just really wants a mom.

198
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,640
Kids say all sorts of things.

199
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
Chengcheng is just adorable.

200
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
I'll go play with him for a bit.

201
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,160
Can you hold this for me?

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
Chengcheng.

203
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,960
Happy birthday, Chengcheng.

204
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
Happy birthday.

205
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
May you smile every day.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
Let's blow out the candles.

207
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
What did you wish for just now?

208
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm not telling you.

209
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
My dad said

210
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,080
if you say your wish,
it won't come true.

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
But if you don't tell me,

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
how can I help make it happen?

213
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,840
How can I get you more Paw Patrol toys?

214
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Right?

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,880
OK, I'll tell you.

216
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,280
I wish you could be my mom.

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,560
Chengcheng.

218
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
You can't just call someone Mom.

219
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,480
I want Mom to read me stories.

220
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
Chengcheng.

221
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
She's got a lot going on.

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,280
Let's not keep her any longer, okay?

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
How about we have some cake?

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Do you want some cake?

225
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
Then let's grab some cake.
