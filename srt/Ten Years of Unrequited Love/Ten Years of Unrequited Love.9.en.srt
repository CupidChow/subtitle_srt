so what?

Don't I have the right to like someone?

I'm just looking out for you.

Why do you get to look out for me?

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,840
Aren't you planning to marry Miss Su?

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,980
You'll live happily with her.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,700
Why care about your ex
from ten years ago?

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,020
Or is it that you're just bored now

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,700
and Miss Su can't satisfy you anymore?

You want it all, don't you?

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,540
You believe that?

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,860
The elders say

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,260
that as long as you believe,

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,900
there will be a miracle.

42
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,900
I want to be with you forever.

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
That's not hard.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,740
We're already together now.

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,940
It's so tough.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm so ordinary,

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,380
and I feel small.

48
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,020
My family's not well-off.

49
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,420
I've worked and studied to get by.

50
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
So,

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,460
I know there's a big gap between us.

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,420
Besides,

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,140
you've never made me any promises.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,700
Don't say that, Ran.

55
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,460
Let's get married.

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
Sure.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,500
Why are you crying like this?

58
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,220
Are you really so into this?

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,500
When I think about it,

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,180
I realize I'm a bit pitiful too,

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,540
so I can't stop the tears.

62
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,260
I want so much love.

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,060
I want to do my best as an actress.

64
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
Siyuan.

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,300
Are you still thinking
about Lin Miaomiao?

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,140
Are you?

67
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
Do you still like her?

68
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,340
Do you think I'm blind?

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,860
You two keep flirting right
in front of me.

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,480
You don't care about my feelings at all.

71
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,520
Don't think I don't know

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
what's on your mind.

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,260
You still have feelings
for Lin Miaomiao,

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,580
don't you?

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,060
Are you going to see her again?

76
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,620
You don't want the contract now?

77
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,980
Chairman Cen has reviewed

78
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,300
the contract Lisa drafted.

79
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,200
She has no objections.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
(Weiyang Brand Ambassador Contract)
Mirui's sincerity

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,220
is shown here.

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,260
Secretary Lin,

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,580
please pass on my gratitude
to Chairman Cen.

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
Siyuan,

85
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,340
sometimes I envy Secretary Lin.

86
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,840
After signing the contract...

87
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,760
What do you envy about me?

88
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,980
It must be nice to be ordinary like you.

89
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,620
You're free as can be.

90
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,940
No need to worry about this

91
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,620
or stress over that.

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,300
You can cry and laugh

93
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,580
when you want to.

94
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,720
If you want to get close to someone,

95
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,740
you don't have paparazzi chasing you.

96
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,260
Miss Su,

97
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,940
are you thinking
of quitting the industry?

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,740
I'll let Chairman Cen know then.

99
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,100
Secretary Lin, I was just joking.

100
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,140
You take your job way too seriously.

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,140
No wonder Chairman Cen and Siyuan

102
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,340
think so highly of you.

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,460
Miss Su, you turned things around

104
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,020
for Mirui all by yourself.

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,100
Of course, Chairman Cen and Mr. Cen

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
value you even more.

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,580
Secretary Lin,

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,540
don't be so hard on yourself.

109
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,740
Chairman Cen didn't know me before,

110
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,660
so she wanted me to give up

111
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,960
by making me become a housewife.

112
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,260
Now, she knows
I can help Mirui get back up,

113
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,060
so she won't want me to disappear.

114
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,060
Of course,

115
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,940
I won't let her down either.

116
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,260
By the way,

117
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,500
you'll pay for this.

118
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,940
Sure.

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,780
Let's go.

120
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,700
You go ahead first.

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,000
I scheduled a meeting
with the Product Department.

122
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,940
What meeting?

123
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,060

What did you just say?

137
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,540
Let's break up.

138
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,700
Don't you feel ashamed, Cen Siyuan?

139
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,420
If you like someone else,

140
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,940
then stop leading me on.

141
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,060
Sorry.

142
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
Don't say sorry to me.

143
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
I was a fool.

144
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,100
I was just too naive.

145
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,540
Do I look like a joke to you?

146
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,740
No.

147
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,020
You're pretty great.

148
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,020
No need to praise me now.

149
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,060
If she weren't around,

150
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,580
would things have stayed the same?

151
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,480
This has nothing to do with Miaomiao.

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,220
How could it not be about her?

153
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
She's been showing up
out of nowhere lately,

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,080
and then she acts

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
like none of it even matters to her.

156
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Who is she putting on that act for?

157
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,460
Do you know what that's called?

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,260
That's the tomboy style.

159
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,060
She's polite on the surface,

160
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,620
pretending to play by the rules.

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,620
Actually,

162
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,300
she's having her own plan.

163
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
What did you just say?

164
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,820
Why?

165
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,340
Are you afraid
to own up to what you did?

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,740
Do you dare admit

167
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,620
that you're two-faced?

168
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,900
How am I two-faced?

169
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,980
In front of Siyuan and Chairman Cen,

170
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,380
you act so gracious and fair,

171
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,060
but behind the scenes,

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,540
when you want me to back off,

173
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,380
you get all smug

174
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
and push me around.

175
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,980
Can you really say

176
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,140
you aren't two-faced?

177
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,320
What else could it be?

178
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,020
You're involved

179
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,260
with Chang Qixing,

180
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,580
and you won't even let go of Siyuan.

181
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,980
You even got between us.

182
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,220
Honestly, you keep surprising me.

183
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,300
You switch between personalities
so smoothly.

184
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,220
You'd better think before you freak out.

185
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,940
If I wanted to mess with you,

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,340
Cen Siyuan would've dumped you ages ago.

187
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,860
Why pretend to be so nice?

188
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,540
If you hadn't totally charmed him,

189
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,020
Siyuan wouldn't have just dumped me.

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,540
It's because of you.

191
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,860
- Stop it, okay?
- Let go.

192
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,380
- Can you stop it?
- Let me go.

193
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,060
You picked her over me?

194
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,660
Cen Siyuan,

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,580
breaking up isn't your call alone.

196
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,380
It's about both of us.

197
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,820
Let me be clear:

198
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,140
I don't agree to this.

199
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Did you hear me?

200
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,820
I don't agree.

201
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,260
You have no idea how dramatic it was.

202
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,740
I've lived this long,

203
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,140
and I've never been slapped before.

204
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,420
Plus, it was so loud.

205
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,270
You know what?

206
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,220
The whole parking lot

207
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,900
kept echoing with that sound.

208
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,580
Who hit you?

209
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,620
Su Peipei.

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,260
I started it, though.

211
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Then why complain now?

212
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,980
Wait, where didn't you two fight?

213
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,660
What happened?

214
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,900
You fought Su Peipei over Mr. Cen?

215
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
It's driving me crazy.

216
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,980
But it's a good sign,

217
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,290
right?

218
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,470
At least it proves

219
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,020
Mr. Cen is on your side.

220
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,160
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,020
I knew it.

222
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,860
He finally couldn't hold back.

223
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,140
Before, he kept hanging out
with Su Peipei,

224
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,500
acting all close and sweet.

225
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,060
He even had you cheer for her

226
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,580
and drive her around, and invested.

227
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,460
Keep your voice down.

228
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,140
Wasn't that all to get a reaction
from you?

229
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,580
He knew exactly where to hit.

230
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,660
Two years ago, I didn't notice it.

231
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,660
But this time, I'm sure of it.

232
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,100
He really...

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,340
Nonsense. Stop gossiping.

234
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,980
Tell me.

235
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
What should I do now?

236
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,980
- I just remembered.
- What is it?

237
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,720
You told me before

238
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,980
that your first love was a jerk.

239
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,200
Is it Mr. Cen?

240
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,260
- Right?
- No.

241
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,580
It isn't.

242
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,780
Oh, my gosh.

243
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,180
Miaomiao.

244
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
Let's drink. It's not him.

245
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,900
I can't believe I didn't notice

246
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,140
that you two...

247
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,700
Honestly, he had it coming.

248
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,160
Just listen to me this time.

249
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,740
Don't talk to him. Let him be.

250
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,700
Did you hear me?

251
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,020
What do you mean?

252
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,980
Why are you acting so jumpy?

253
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,060
You...

254
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,860
Come on.

255
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,980
It's like you two are mute.

256
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,260
You're both so clever,

257
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,060
yet you can't say a word to each other.

258
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,500
Neither of you talked.

259
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,340
So...

260
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,340
So, Su Peipei beat you to it.

261
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,340
This makes no sense at all.

262
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,060
You don't agree?

263
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,220
What are you talking about?

264
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,380
Mrs. Cen.

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,140
You seem quite relaxed.

266
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,660
Where's Mr. Cen?

267
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,540
Isn't he worried that you're here?
