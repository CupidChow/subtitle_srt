11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
Siyuan,

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,930
you finally came to see me.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,920
Peipei.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,520
It's all my fault.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
You don't have to hurt yourself.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,160
Honestly, these days,

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880
every single day,

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,840
every minute,

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,880
every second,

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,240
I've been struggling.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,000
I tried to move on with my life.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
I even agreed with Lisa and Mr. Chang

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,920
to end the brand contract.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,880
I thought if I did that,

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
you'd just dislike me,

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,400
and maybe

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
I'd miss you less.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,520
But in the end,

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
I realized everything I did

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
was just me fooling myself.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
Does it still hurt?

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,600
Are you still in pain?

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
Do you feel sorry for me?

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,760
I know how you feel.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
The whole art gallery incident

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
was planned by Chang Qixing.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
He hired someone to take

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,560
those photos of you and Secretary Lin.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
He kept asking me to work with him,

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
but I never said yes.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
Don't worry.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,480
I've given the evidence to the police.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Thank you.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
Thank you, Siyuan.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
I've been truly happy

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,360
in these six months with you,

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,140
and I really enjoyed it.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
By the way,

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
where is she?

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,380
She's waiting outside.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
I didn't expect myself

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,440
to lose so badly.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,680
Can you do one last thing for me?

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,240
What is it?

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Promise me first.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,160
Alright.

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
Tell me

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,880
the story of you and Secretary Lin.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Sure.

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
But you have to promise me

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
not to hurt yourself again.

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
Alright.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
As long as your story is good enough

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,960
and gives me a decent reason,

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,480
I'll agree.

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,200
Your mom really did that?

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
Why make things hard for another woman?

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,480
She must've had her reasons.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,300
It's all in the past now.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Siyuan.

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Wish you all the best.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
You too.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Mom.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,680
Mom, Mom.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,360
Whose kid is this?

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
Kid, don't call me that.

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Mom, I've been looking for you.

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Don't call me that.

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm a celebrity.

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,120
You're putting my reputation at stake.

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Whose kid is this?

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
Deng Chengcheng,

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
when are you going

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,640
to stop calling people Mom?

85
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
You know him?

86
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,560
Who is he?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,040
He's a friend's kid.

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
Miaomiao and I are watching him today.

89
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,280
Mom, you're hurt.

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
Does it hurt?

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
A little bit.

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Then you should lie down and rest.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
I'll tell you a story.

94
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
Sure.

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Once there was a boy

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,440
and a little mole.

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Chengcheng.

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
What are you doing here?

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
I told you not to run off.

100
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,560
Dad, I'm telling a story with Mom.

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
Sorry about my kid.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,660
He must've offended you.

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,120
It's alright.

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
No worries.

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,200
He's actually pretty sweet.

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,880
Looks like you got hurt.

107
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
It's nothing.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,320
How about some water?

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,680
That'd be great.

110
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,360
Thanks.

111
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,920
It's over there.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
They say when God closes a door,

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
he'll open another for you soon.

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,240
She's really okay now, right?

115
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,520
I suppose so.

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,560
What were you two talking about?

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,500
You chatted for so long.

118
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
She asked me about our story.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,800
I bet you made me sound

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
like a cruel and heartless bad woman.

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
Yeah, you're like a witch.

122
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
We still haven't settled
that last thing.

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,700
What are you doing here?

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,280
Mr. Cen, I just...

125
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm not feeling too well.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Cut the crap.

127
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,160

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Where is Chairman Cen?

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
She's in the Intensive Care Unit.

131
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,660
They'll start general anesthesia soon.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
What's the chance?

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
About 30%.

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
What about the medical team?

135
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,280
It's the top team
in the top-tier hospital.

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
The top team.

137
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,960
Maybe you should go see her.

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,160
Siyuan.

139
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Chairman Cen kept it a secret from you,

140
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,800
but I have a feeling

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,200
that she was pretty scared.

142
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Mr. Cen,

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,800
she's here.

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
Mom.

145
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,080
Mom.

146
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Mom.

147
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,480
Let me tell you a story.

148
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,120
When I was little,

149
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
my mom rode her bike

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,880
and took me to the photo studio.

151
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,720
It was snowing hard that day.

152
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,840
The roads were so slippery.

153
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,480
We passed an intersection on the way

154
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,640
and ran into someone we knew.

155
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,760
He was a distant uncle
from my grandma's side.

156
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
He was selling steamed buns there.

157
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,440
They were big and steaming hot.

158
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,800
My mom chatted with him for a bit,

159
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
and he insisted

160
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,400
on giving me a steaming hot bun.

161
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
I grabbed my mom's sleeve

162
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
and hid behind her,

163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
refusing to eat.

164
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Then my mom said...

165
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
She said,

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,520
"Don't you want to eat?"

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,600
"Just take it."

168
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,740
"Why are you hiding?"

169
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,660
Honestly, I really wanted to eat it.

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
It's been over 20 years.

171
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,250
I still remember that steaming hot bun.

172
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,280

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,760
Sure.

195
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
What's up, Mom?

196
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360

I'm not giving you the betrothal gift.

I won't be buying your dowry either.

202
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
But I got this one

203
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,200
when I got married.

204
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,000

212
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,640
I called her dear, and she panicked.
