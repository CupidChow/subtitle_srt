11

Hello, that's all.

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,980
What's the matter?

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,500
Showing off your drinking capacity?

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,780
Guess you picked that up at the pub.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,460
I can hear it in your tone.

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,300
You're mocking me
for having too much fun.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,300
How could I dare mock you?

18
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,380
- I only serve...
- "I only serve Chairman Cen."

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,020
"Let your admirers handle your affairs."

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,940
I've heard this reasoning
countless times.

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,780
Can you try

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,380
something new?

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,180
Mr. Cen.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
Don't call me Mr. Cen.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,580
- Cen Siyuan.
- Stop that.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,180
Don't smile.

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,980
Are you

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,860
arguing with Miss Su again?

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,740
Unlike someone,
Peipei doesn't fuss over every detail.

30
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Besides,

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,180
I can always buy some gifts.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,620
Exactly.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,900
In your eyes,

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,380
the problems

35
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,540
that gifts and money can solve
aren't problems.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,380
Isn't that right?

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,780
Isn't that how you handle things
with my mother too?

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,440
Wasn't it you who mentioned
the bonus and insurance yesterday?

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,500
How about this?

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,320
I'll hire you as a part-timer.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
It's sure to be more
than what my mother gave you.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,160
You just help me come up with a plan.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,500
Put together a PPT for me

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,180
to win Peipei's favor,

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,140
so she won't ever want to leave me.

46
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,900
You can also make up for yesterday.

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,660
Alright.

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,500

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,420
Come on.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,060

I've really seen it all now.

55
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,620
Miss Su's got skills
and works hard herself.

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,700
I think you should

57
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,860
focus more on her emotional needs.

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Tell me more.

59
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,180
Chairman Cen demeaned her.

60
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,280
You shouldn't treat her
with just a bit of sweetness.

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,940

just to make her this breakfast,

110

Maybe.

114
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,900
She might even cry happy tears,

115
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,620
then snap a photo, and post it online

116
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,940
to let the world know

117
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,540
she has such a good boyfriend.

118
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,620

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920

Thanks to your advice last night,

123
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,340
I finally took action.

124
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,420

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,180
When the wedding comes,

126
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,960
you'll sit at the main table.

127
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,500
You don't need to work today.

128
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,780
I've told my mother already.

129
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,740
You'll come with me to the set later

131
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980

144
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,780
Still upset?

145
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,260
You left me alone last night.

146
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,860
I had to deal with my mother.

147
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,940
Did you manage it?

148
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,300
I made you a full breakfast.

149
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,140
Still not enough?

150
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
No.

151
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,900
Then what will make you happy?

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,380
Aren't you going to see her off?

153
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,860
Good idea.

154
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,380
You really left?

155
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I was just saying.

156
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,660
I want

157
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,700
Secretary Lin to apologize
to me for yesterday.

158
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,720
Didn't you say

159
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,540
you didn't need her
to apologize yesterday?

160
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,260
That was yesterday.

161
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,060
Can't you even handle this small task?

162
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,900
Stop staring at her.

163
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,200
I wasn't staring at her.

164
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,700
You clearly kept looking at her.

165
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,860
Stop this.

166
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,380
I'm just thinking about how to fix this.

167
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,540
I said she should apologize to me.

168
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,660
She's my mother's lackey.

169
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,780
You know that.

170
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,920
What happened yesterday
was my mother's idea.

171
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,820
Let's just let it pass.

172
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,420
Don't turn this into a big thing.

173
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,980
What if she complains
to my mother again?

174
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,500
Aren't we just making things worse?

175
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,900
Why do I feel like you're siding

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
with her?

177
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
Fine.

178
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,380
What are you two talking about?

179
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm asking Miaomiao for romance advice.

180
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,740
I've been single since birth.

181
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,620
I wonder when I'll finally meet someone.

182
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,200
Then you should ask for some tips.

183
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,700
Secretary Lin knows a lot.

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,220
Who said that? Miaomiao just said

185
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,020
she hasn't dated in ages.

186
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,220
You must be kidding.

187
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm serious. She just had one boyfriend.

188
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,580
Her first love hurt her deeply.

189
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,900
He was a playboy.

190
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,980
Now, she can't trust love anymore.

191
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,980
I hope I never run into that jerk.

192
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,100
Don't you have many admirers?

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,180
Haven't you met the right one?

194
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,420
Mr. Cen.

195
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,160
No need to worry
about your employees' private lives.

196
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,020
Let's get back to business.

197
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,540
I need a favor.

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,860
It's about Miss Su, right?

199
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,900
Yes.

200
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,420
She wants you to apologize
for yesterday.

201
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,060
Peipei didn't do anything wrong.

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,980
Yet you scolded her so harshly.

203
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,220
I felt bad for her.

204
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,900
I feel bad for...

205
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,220
I feel bad for my future wife.

206
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,060
Is that not allowed?

207
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Future wife?

208
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,980
That's right.

209
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,460
We're planning to get married.

210
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,820
You can't calm her down,

211
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,220
so you drag me into this?

212
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,240
Am I just a tool

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,620
that you can use wherever you need?

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
When you promised my mother,

215
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,740
why didn't you think of the outcome?

216
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,340
I never thought you would...

217
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,740
What?

218
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,900
I just spoke to her
on behalf of Chairman Cen.

219
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,340
Why am I the one apologizing?

220
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,260
Besides,

221
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,140
you used to be so carefree about this.

222
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,220
It's always easy to let go.

223
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,460
Why is it different this time?

224
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,340
Can she be compared to others?

225
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,660
She's different.

226
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,660
Peipei isn't the type to hold grudges.

227
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,180
Just offer her an apology,

228
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,380
make peace, and shake hands.

229
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,580
Wouldn't that be for the best?

230
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,260
