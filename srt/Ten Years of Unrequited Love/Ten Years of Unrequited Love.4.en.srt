Secretary Lin.

Miss Su.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,660
I was too abrupt yesterday.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,180
I owe you an apology.

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,140
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,140
An apology?

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,940
What for?

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,720
Siyuan, what is this about?

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,940
It's my fault.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,940
Secretary Lin, don't take it seriously.

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,820
I was just joking with Siyuan.

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,100
I didn't expect he'd actually tell you.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,380
Siyuan, come on.

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,420
Why ask Secretary Lin
to do this?

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,300
Miss Su,

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,980
Mr. Cen truly cares about you.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm well aware of that.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,260
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,900
thought of marrying me.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,380
Secretary Lin, how about this?

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,220
We'll pick our rings and gowns
in a few days.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,220
We'd like your thoughts as well.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,380
At your service, anytime.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,220
Thank you.

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,380
Then I'll get back to my work.

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,220
Sure.

37
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,380
Tell me.

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,940
Did you use to date Lin Miaomiao?

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,820
Why do you ask that?

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,380
Answer my question.

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,340
Do you want to hear some good news?

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,020
What good news?

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
I've secured the funding for your play.

Really?

45
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,900
That was quick.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,420
I thought you were just saying it

47
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,340
to comfort me back then.

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,300
Have I ever lied to you?

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,580
If I can give it to you,

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,380

come and work for my family.

95
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,980
Are you upset?

96
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,900
Is it because I asked you to apologize

97
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,820
to Peipei?

98
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm well aware

99
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,500
of the fact that I'm working for you.

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,620
Didn't you just say that?

101
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,660
You're my boss.

102
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,100
Whatever you say, I must obey.

103
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,060
How could I dare be upset?

104
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,830
Alright.

105
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,220
Let me take you home.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,310
No need.

107
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,420
Just drop me off at the subway ahead.

108
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,880
Treat it as a bargaining chip.

109
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,980
What kind of chip?

110
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,460
I'll take you home,

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,700
and you

112
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,660
will put in a good word to my mother

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
and convince her
to consider accepting Peipei.

114
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,900
You've really gone too far these days.

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,460
If you two have problems,

116
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,900
can't you settle them yourselves?

117
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
Stop the car.

118
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,780
Stop it.

119
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,340
My mother is so fond of you.

120
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,060
Saying a word won't cost you anything.

121
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,960
It's easy for Miss Su
to earn Chairman Cen's approval.

122
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,740
She just needs to agree
to be a housewife,

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,180
and Chairman Cen will accept her.

124
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,870
You're so clever.

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,860
Can't you see
this is my mother's indirect plan?

126
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,500
She simply wants to make her give up.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,380
I know.

128
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,060
Then why are you helping her?

129
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,940
What else can I do?

130
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,980
If you got to know Peipei better,

131
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,020
you'd see she's not a monster.

132
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,980
Maybe one day,

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
you could even be friends.

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,060
Mr. Cen,

135
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,620
that's not my duty, is it?

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,940
Besides,

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,980
next time you act,

138
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,740
could you think it through?

139
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Please don't drag me into your problems.

140
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,620
I don't want her to misunderstand me.

141
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,160
A misunderstanding means she likes me.

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,740
We're friends.

143
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

144
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,300
First of all,

145
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,380
we're not exactly friends right now.

146
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,060
It's more accurate
to say I work for you.

147
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,300
Second,

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,820
I don't want to get dragged into this

149
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,660
because I'm worried she'll get fixated.

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,380
If she asks you to pick

151
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,540
between us or raises tricky questions,

152
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,860
I can't take the blame for that.

153
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,900
I'd choose you.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,860
After all,
my mother can't do without you.

155
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,500
And I can't do without my mother.

156
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,060
Do you understand?

157
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,420
You're a paragon of filial piety.

158
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,780
Everyone at Mirui knows it.

159
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,020
Take me to Chairman Cen.

160
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,360
We're going to your home.

161
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,020
My...

162
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,980
My home?

163
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,580
How did you know where I live?

164
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,020
How could I not know?

165
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
Cen Siyuan.

166
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
What are you really after?

167
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
You don't welcome me.

168
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,140
Is it because you're hiding a man?

169
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,420
So what if I am?

170
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,500
At least it's not as chaotic as yours.

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,160
So, something is going on.

172
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,020
Since I'm here,

173
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,600
let me at least greet the new ones.

174
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,260
I'm getting upset.

175
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,820
If I recall correctly,

176
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,940
today is your birthday.

177
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,580
Open the door.

178
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
Who shows up empty-handed
for a birthday?

179
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
Hello, your takeout is here.

180
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,260
Sorry about that.

181
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,460
I guessed what you'd say that.

182
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,420
Thank you.

183
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,660
You really are a workaholic.

184
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,060
Your place feels
like the museum of Mirui.

185
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,580
This is too old.

186
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,700
Where's mine?

187
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,140
I tossed it ages ago.

188
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,380
I drank from that one.

189
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,340
Fine.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Look how anxious you are.

191
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
You're really hiding a man?

192
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,620
Can I hide a man in the fridge?

193
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm just looking for water.

194
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,140
Go ahead.

195
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,300
What did you wish for?

196
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,700
To find a boyfriend soon

197
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,100
or to strike it rich overnight?

198
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,460
Adults don't choose.

199
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,460
Of course, I want both.

200
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,140
Don't you want me to find someone too?

201
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,060
So I don't get too bored

202
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
and end up meddling
between you and Miss Su.

203
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,340
Are you still

204
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,420
hung up on me?

205
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,140
Cen Siyuan,

206
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,740
you're just as self-absorbed as ever.

207
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,380
I may not recall every detail clearly,

208
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,980
but I do remember
I was the one who ended it.

209
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,900
It was just a joke.

210
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,620
No need to take it seriously.

211
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,620
Let's play a game.

212
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,060
Sure.

213
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,540
Truth or dare.

214
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
I'll go first.

215
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,340
Ask away.

216
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,380
Cen Siyuan,

217
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,860
over these ten years,

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,060
how many women have you slept with?

219
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,820
That's too personal.

220
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,000
I can drink.

221
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,660
Is one hand enough to count them?

222
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
No?

223
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,500
How about two hands?

224
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
Can two hands cover it?

225
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,740
Even two hands aren't enough?

226
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,700
Then add your hand too.

227
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,980
Would three hands be enough?

228
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
- You're drunk.
- Three hands.

229
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,030
You're drunk.

230
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,460
Three hands still won't cover it?

231
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,940
Then maybe I underestimated you.

232
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,900
You know my reputation,

233
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,220
don't you?

234
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,260
You...

235
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,860
Don't you want to ask me

236
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,860
how many men I've slept with

237
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
after all these years?

238
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,300
Aren't you curious?

239
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,780
Isn't this

240
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,340
truth or dare?

241
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,060
Why did you stop asking?

242
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,780
Go on, ask me.

243
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,620
Ask me, and I'll answer.

244
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,740
Ask me. I can tell you.

245
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,140
- Miaomiao.
- Just ask me.

246
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,060
