Then just order

189
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
some food yourself.

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,620
I'm heading back to the company.

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,170
Go ahead.

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,320
No need to check in with me.

193
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,160
Sure.

194
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,710
Miaomiao.

195
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,620
How are you feeling? Any better?

196
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
You can come if you want,

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
but why bring so much stuff?

198
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh my, you have no idea.

199
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,990
Mr. Cen called me.

200
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,400
He said you passed out.

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,280
You really scared me there.

202
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
I hurried over right away.

203
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,240
Look here.

204
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,640
I got you so many health boosters.

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
What did you get?

206
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,480
There's saffron in here.

207
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,860
Plus American ginseng and reishi.

208
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Sea cucumber and bird's nest.

209
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
And cordyceps, too.

210
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
Zhou Wan,

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
how much do you even make a month?

212
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,400
You really went all out here.

213
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,040
It's all for your health.

214
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,440
This is nothing.

215
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Just a little, no big deal.

216
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,160
Zhou Wan.

217
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
What's wrong?

218
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,560
Wan.

219
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,360
Wan.

220
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,760
Alright then.

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,640
Mr. Cen asked me to buy these.

222
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,150
Miaomiao.

223
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
I'm a big fan of you two as a couple.

224
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Please don't sell me, okay?

225
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm really fine.

226
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
Why spend so much money?

227
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
That's necessary.

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,400
You must be hungry. Try some food.

229
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,070
Give it a taste.

231
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,960
It's still warm.

232
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Being your couple fan

233
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
for so long was worth it.

234
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
You really didn't let me down.

235
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,960
There is the stir-fried pork,

236
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,900
the pork rib soup,

237
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,960
and the crucian carp tofu.

238
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
These are all your favorites.

239
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,840
Aren't these just normal dishes?

240
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,720
Really?

241
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
Yeah.

242
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,840
Be honest with me.

243
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,880
How far have you two gone?

244
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,880
What do you mean?

245
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,040
Did anything really happen?

246
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
What are you talking about?

247
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,760
No.

248
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,700
In that case,

249
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,080
why did he buy you all this stuff?

250
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,020
How should I know why?

251
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,860
Nothing happened.

252
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
But I heard Mr. Cen

253
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
didn't come home last night.

254
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
You didn't know that?

255
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
No.

256
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,820
Why would Cen Siyuan treat me like this?

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,800
You're still at Mirui Studios.

258
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
Don't act so childish.

259
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
You've worked hard for your popularity.

260
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,340
Don't take it for granted.

261
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,600
I just can't let it go.

262
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,280
I gave up so much for him,

263
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,360
even my career

264
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,400
in Singapore.

265
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,840
But look at him.

266
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,840
He met his old flame

267
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,440
and dumped me just like that.

268
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,560
For women, love is like clothes.

269
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,840
We patch it up and keep going.

270
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
But for men,

271
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
love's the same.

272
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Once it's worn out, it's tossed.

273
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
How much is love really worth?

274
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
You need to wake up.

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
Only your job and money

276
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
can keep you steady in life.

277
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,280
That's true, but...

278
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,600
I know letting go is tough.

279
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,080
But he hasn't made it public yet,

280
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
so there's still a chance

281
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,840
to fix things.

282
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
Maybe he just lost his mind
for a moment.

283
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,320
That woman messed with his mind.

284
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
He'll come to his senses soon enough.

285
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
Exactly.

286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
No one knows who'll win in the end.

287
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,400
What's going on with you and Su Peipei?

288
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,670
(It's Peipei: A man out for fun meeting
a woman who cares too much)

289
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,780
(is like catching the white whale
while fishing.)
