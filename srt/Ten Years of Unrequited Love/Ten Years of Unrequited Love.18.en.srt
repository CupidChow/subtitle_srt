159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,200

160
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,210
that you want free labor?

161
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,320

of us not knowing the law?

162
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,540
- Right?
- No.

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,400
Pay us now.

164
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960

183
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,760
Come on, this is about my mom,

184
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,520

of being unreasonable.

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,560
Is there any justice left?

186
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
- No.
- Guys.

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,920
If we don't get paid today,

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,160
smash up this shop for me.

189
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,040
No, please don't.

190
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,820
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the cops.

191
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,200
- You can't do this.
- Calm down.

192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
- Go ahead.
- Sir.

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,230
Sir, take it easy.

194
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
Come on, hit me if you dare.

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,040
- Sir.
- Hit me!

196
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Siyuan!

197
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Cen Siyuan!

198
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,240
Are you alright?

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,400
