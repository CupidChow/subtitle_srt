=Ten Years of Unrequited Love=

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,580
=Episode 20=

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Miaomiao.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,760
Mom.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm just glad you're back.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,320
Don't cry; it's okay now.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,160
Back then,

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,760
you helped your dad

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,640
pull through.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
During the extra five years,

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,960
he made the most of them.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,060
He saw everything he wanted.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
He left with a peaceful heart.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
Your dad never felt regret

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
in his whole life.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Mom,

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,320
I miss you.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
Siyuan.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
(Lin Miaomiao)

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Let's take a break

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,720
for now.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
What did you say to Miaomiao?

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
What could I possibly say?

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
Don't you know what you said?

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
All I remember saying is:

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
Don't see yourself as the weak one.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Mom.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,400
Mom.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
You'll never understand.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Love isn't a weakness.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,600
Closed-minded people are the weak ones.

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,720
I think only when someone can love

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,300
can they find happiness.

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,920
She quit her job.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
I didn't approve it.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,600
She took a long break instead.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,040
She probably went back home.

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Siyuan.

47
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,270
No one knows Miaomiao like I do.

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,940
Just give her some space.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,970
Look at you,

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,240
always saying you're busy.

51
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,720
Why suddenly make time to come back?

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
I saved up some leave days.

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,760
It's ten years' worth.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
How many days have you saved?

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
Until the Lantern Festival.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
The Lantern Festival?

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,600
So, another year will have gone by.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
You'll be home for that long?

59
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,060
What's up, Mom?

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,200
Aren't you happy to see me?

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
Of course, I'm happy.

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,900
But how can you meet someone

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,440
if you keep staying here?

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,200
There you go again.

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Come on.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
Don't get annoyed, okay?

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,580
Let me tell you something.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
Girls

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
need a place to call home.

70
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,680
In life,

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
you'll need a man sooner or later.

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,070
I get it.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
Just

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
listen to me.

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm worried you'll be alone
when you're older.

76
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
Look at you.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
I've told you so many times.

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,880
- Style's nice, but keep warm too.
- OK.

79
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,600
Chronic leg pain is no joke
when you're older.

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
Yeah, I know.

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Let's go home for dinner, Mom.

82
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm starving. Come on.

83
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,840
Are you saying I'm nagging again?

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
No.

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Listen to me.

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
If you bring home a boyfriend,

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
I promise I won't say a word.

88
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
You can do whatever you want.

89
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,600
Give it a rest.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Then you'll want a grandchild.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,880
And after one,
you'll ask for a second child.

92
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Isn't that true?

93
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,680
Look, you barely bought enough food.

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
This isn't enough to eat?

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
We have to watch our spending.

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
You're not married yet.

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
Manman is still in school.

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
These are all major life events.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
None of them are settled.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Everything costs money.

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Mom,

102
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,200
I keep telling you

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
to stop worrying about money.

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,080
I can save up on my own

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
and even take care of Manman.

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,880
Just enjoy the money I give you.

107
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,880
You deserve a better life.

108
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
I just need to see you

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
marry happily.

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
When your dowry

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
is ready

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,840
and everything is set,

113
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,480
I'll feel at ease then.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
In my whole life,

115
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
I've stayed in this small town

116
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,480
and never seen much of the world.

117
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,980
I don't understand anything

118
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,280
about elites

119
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
or white collars.

120
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't have

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,640
any other requests for you.

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
I just don't want you

123
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
to push yourself too hard.

124
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,920
Whenever you have time,

125
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,280
try to come home more often.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,400
Let me do it, Mom.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,040
Mom, I'm back.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Miaomiao.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,360
Miaomiao, what brings you home?

130
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,380
I've missed you so much.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
You've gotten so tall.

132
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
Miaomiao, I actually need your help.

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,640
- Come with me.
- What for?

134
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Lin Manman, I'm warning you.

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't ask your sister for a phone.

136
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
You're still a high school student.

137
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,760
Having a phone is enough for now.

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,040
No need to get a fancy one.

139
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,100
Your sister works hard for her money.

140
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you hear me?

141
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,640
OK, I got it.

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Miaomiao, let's go.

143
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,200
Miaomiao,

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
you're getting more like Mom.

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
Why do you say that?

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,280
Always trying to win me over
with treats.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
But honestly,

148
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,100
I'll let it slide.

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,720
After all, I'm your little sister.

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,240
Let it slide?

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,600
But if my future brother-in-law
does this,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
you shouldn't let it slide.

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,520
So what should I do then?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
If he only likes your looks,

155
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
he's just too shallow.

156
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,680
He has to stick with you at your lowest,

157
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,180
never leaving you no matter what.

158
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,640
Wow, you sure know a lot.

159
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
Are you dating someone?

160
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
No way.

161
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
I noticed all this

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
when Dad was in the hospital.

163
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,880
So, even if Mom nags a lot,

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
she's still the best.

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Manman,

166
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,440
if you ever like a guy,

167
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
make sure you tell him how you feel.

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
Don't be afraid to fail,

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,840
and don't let the chance slip by.

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
I'll always have your back.

171
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200
Miaomiao,

172
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,640
wouldn't a new phone
make me even stronger?

173
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,160
Didn't I say it? That depends on you.

174
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,200
Come on.

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,660
You'll buy it for me sooner or later.

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
Don't keep me hanging like this.

177
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,440
Hanging? What are you, a little fish?

178
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Let's go home.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,480
Check out my new hairstyle.

180
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
It's the one you suggested.

181
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
- Really?
- Does it suit me?

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
Mom.

183
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
We're back.

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,240
Isn't that Miaomiao?

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Aunt Zhang.

186
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,280
I haven't seen you in years.

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Are you seeing someone?

188
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,900
Where's your boyfriend from?
What does he do?

189
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,480
Oh, please, stop.

190
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,100
She thinks I'm nagging every day

191
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,780
because of this question.

192
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,360
I remember Miaomiao is a Rabbit.

193
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,740
Your traditional age is already 33.

194
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,060
You're a year older than my son.

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Thirty-two is about time to settle down.

196
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,280
Don't take it the wrong way.

197
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
Your mom just worries about you.

198
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,640
With no men at home,

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
it just doesn't feel right.

200
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
There's nothing I can do.

201
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,800
The little one
is always up to something.

202
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,920
And the older one keeps me
on my toes too.

203
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,240
If I ever see their dad,

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
how am I supposed to explain this?

205
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,760
Mom, Manman has homework to do.

206
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
We're heading in, okay?

207
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,720
- Go ahead.
- Bye, Aunt Zhang.

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,560
She really is good-looking.

209
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Cen, if you don't step up soon,

210
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,480
I can't keep playing the spy.

211
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,040
You didn't see the look
Aunt Zhang gave us.

212
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,440
She even wants
to set up a blind date tomorrow.
