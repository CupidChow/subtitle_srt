=Episode 13=

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,240
What's going on with you and Su Peipei?

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,880
I broke up with her.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,300
(It's Peipei)
When did that happen?

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,310
(A man)
A few days ago.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,580
(out for fun meeting)
Why now?

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,360
She just became our band ambassador.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,960
I told you to break up with her,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,440
yet it's like you were under a spell.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,640
Are you still my son?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Or did the other side send you
to mess with Mirui?

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Let people say what they want.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,100
I honestly don't care.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,240
You don't care,

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,000
but the board of directors does.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,880
If you want to break up with her,

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,490
I won't object.

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,080
But Mirui's stock price just went up.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,120
Announcing a breakup now isn't smart.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Try to hold off for a bit.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
Let's wait a while.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,960
Even if it drops,

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
it'll bounce back again.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,160
Easy for you to say.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,960
Miaomiao and I built this from scratch.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,520
It's not for you to just throw away.

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Let me be clear.

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,640
What Mirui has today

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
and your extravagant life

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
brought by your family

40
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,440
are built on deals like this one by one.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you know that?

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
Miaomiao.

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,120
I can handle the advertisement

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
on my own today.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Things are awkward between you two.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
I haven't done anything wrong,

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,180
so it doesn't matter to me.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm not bothered by it.

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,880
Alright, I'll head over first.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
OK.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,890
Well done.

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Director.

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Peipei.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,320
What do you think?

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
I think it turned out great.

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,340
Let's set up the lights first.

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,450
You can take a short break.

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,560
Alright, thanks, Director.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
OK.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,160
Mrs. Cen.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,360
What brings you here today?

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,640
Chairman Cen asked me to do a set visit.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,300
Thanks for your hard work.

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Chairman Cen?

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
Isn't she your future mother-in-law?

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
Mrs. Cen, are you here

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
to mark your territory today?

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,440
You're overthinking it.

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
What happened between Cen Siyuan
and me is over.

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,760
If you two have issues,

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
please sort them out yourselves.

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
Don't drag anyone else into this.

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,480
Oh, please.

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm not naive.

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,940
I finally see it now.

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
I was

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
just a brief distraction for him.

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
I can't compete
with your place in his life.

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
You two

80
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,840
have been at this for ten years.

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,660
Now, I'm seen as the third wheel.

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
No wonder people out there say

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,920
you're the true heiress of Mirui.

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,760
I finally believe it now.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
You don't have to mock me.

86
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,560
I've never relied on any man.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Only I know

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,040
how tough it's been these years.

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
Even when I hit rock bottom,

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
I'd still swallow my pride.

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Enough.

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,440
I don't have time for your drama.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,440
If you're so upset, why not quit?

94
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,880
Is this because of the benefits?

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Or is it all worth it for Cen Siyuan?

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
Mr. Cen.

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Don't call me that.

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,400
I need to get back to work.

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
The director just kept praising you.

100
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
What about you?

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
What do you think of me?

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,840
I saw the footage; it looks good.

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,760
And this outfit really suits you today.

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Really?

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
Everyone's watching us.

106
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,040
If you keep looking at me like that,

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,640
guess what tomorrow's headlines
will say.

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
So, how do you want me to act?

109
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Mr. Cen.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
If you want to break up, fine.

111
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
But at least think about Mirui.

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
If you don't want the gossip accounts

113
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,880
to twist things and spread rumors,

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,280
just try to look happy.

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
You're not a kid anymore.

116
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,360
Stop making your mom worry so much.

117
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
I know you all too well.

118
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
Your mom sent you, didn't she?

119
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm also here to give you the contract.

120
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,280
If I hadn't let Chairman Cen know,

121
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,270
I'm afraid you wouldn't have been here.

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
But it doesn't matter.

123
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm just glad you're here.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,840
Why are you here with me

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,920
instead of at the ad agency gathering?

126
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. Cen's there to handle it.

127
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,960
I'd just be extra if I went.

128
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
Siyuan

129
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
really lacks awareness.

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,040
We just signed her,
and he broke up with her.

131
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,640
If I hadn't pushed him
to do a set visit,

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,000
those rumors would have started

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
flying around.

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,600
Here, take a look.

135
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,940
(Headline: Mirui's Heir Visits
His Celebrity Girlfriend on Set)

136
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,900
(How Sweet and Enviable)

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
I don't like my daughter-in-law

138
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
doing such public-facing jobs,

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,360
but

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
for now,

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,190
she's building a positive image

142
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
for Mirui.

143
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,120
So,

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,080
I need you to have a word with Siyuan.

145
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
After all,

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,060
you two went to school together.

147
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,280
I...

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
Well, I...

149
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
I don't think it's my place

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,440
to step into my boss's life.

151
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,720
Just give him a little nudge
now and then.

152
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,440
That kid listens to you.

153
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,040
By the way,

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
I have something for you.

155
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Deman's holding a cocktail party soon.

156
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Can you go for Mirui?

157
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Sure.

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,760
Come on, eat up.

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,840
Don't let it get cold.

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,880
Thank you, Chairman Cen.

161
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Secretary Lin.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
What a coincidence.

163
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,160
Coincidence?

164
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,040
Didn't you guys invite me?

165
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
You're really dressed up.

166
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,820
What's so shiny under your cape?

167
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
Well, there's a dress code.

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
I had to bring some sparkle, right?

169
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,040
Why are you smiling?

170
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,520
Do I look that funny?

171
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,280
No, I just think you really...

172
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
You've changed a lot.

173
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Couldn't stay a messy kid forever.

174
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,600
I never said you were messy.

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,060
But that's what you meant, right?

176
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,160
Since it hasn't started yet,

177
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
can I ask you something?

178
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
What is it?

179
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
Are you about to ask me

180
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
why I haven't come home
for the Spring Festival?

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
Here's the thing.

182
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
You know how our job works.

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
When the holidays come around,

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
we get even busier than usual.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
The pay is triple though.

186
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm all about making money.

187
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,640
I just want to earn money.

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
I don't believe you.

189
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,780
Old habits show up early.

190
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
I don't know about when I was three,

191
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
but when I was five,

192
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,960
you were already my wife.

193
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
You...

194
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
You took advantage of me.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
That really happened.

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,280
I'm not making things up.

197
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
Did you forget?

198
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I remember it.

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,960
Wasn't that just playing house?

200
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
And now, you're not playing anymore?

201
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm still playing.

202
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,800
Things got pretty intense back then.

203
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
But in the end, we still split up.

204
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,960
My mom told me about it.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Who did the kid end up with?

206
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,460
I should be honest about this.

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
The kid stayed with me.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,340
You don't mind

209
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,820
that I'm a dad raising a kid, do you?

210
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Of course not.

211
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,240
Here you go again.

212
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,920
Is this some trick Deman taught you?

213
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,760
Miaomiao.

214
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,920
You're as sweet as ever.

215
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,520
But I think you got it wrong.

216
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
I...

217
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,260
It all just happened at once.

218
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,560
Wait for me; I'll be right back.

219
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Go ahead.

220
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
Sure.

221
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,840
The overall plan looks pretty good.

222
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,520
But maybe the colors are too plain.

223
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Try adding some color blocking.

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Maybe...

225
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,400
It...

226
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
Maybe add some lace.

227
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,500
Wait. No.

228
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
How about paper-cut patterns?

229
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,200
Sounds good. You guys talk it over.

230
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,960
OK, we'll go with your idea.

231
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,340
Alright, let's do that.

232
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,420
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,450
Nothing.

234
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm just checking on your office.

235
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,920
Lin Miaomiao

236
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,160
really spoils you all.

237
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
You didn't even knock.

238
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
Mr. Cen.

239
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm a fan of you two as a couple.

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,480
And I've got a bit of inside info.

241
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,820
If you don't want to hear it, forget it.

242
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm leaving.

243
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Zhou.

244
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,360
The Equipment Department
has new laptops.

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,760
Pick one up before you leave.

246
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,160
Help Secretary Lin

247
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,520
with her work efficiency.

248
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,480
Alright.

249
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,720
Is this Mrs. Cen?

250
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
It really is you.

251
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,700
You're here by yourself?

252
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,800
Are you upset?

253
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Let me tell you something.

254
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,880
I saw some entertainment news recently.

255
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,520
Mr. Cen and Miss Su

256
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,600
seem pretty close these days.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,280
Looks like they're together every night.

258
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,040
So, where does that leave you?

259
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
Which one of you is his true love?

260
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
Why do you love meddling so much?

261
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,620
Can you stop being so annoying?
