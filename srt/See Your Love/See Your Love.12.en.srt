1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,900
My family

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,700
are also

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,400
yours.

4
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,010
Do you know

5
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,510
what you just said means?

6
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,010
His words made me forget

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,850
all the burdens I've been forced to carry.

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
I was too happy to think

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,569
how long it can last.

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,789
Let him come up.

11
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,460
(See Your Love)

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,160
(Episode 12)

13
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,170
That should be enough.

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Give it to my brother after you're done.

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,620
If anything's missing, let me know.

16
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
Wait.

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,440
Are you really going back to America to confront the President

18
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,560
for Jiang Shaopeng?

19
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,730
I've never dared to face my dad

20
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,460
and go against the decisions he made.

21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Now, I want to be brave for him just once.

22
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,810
You have to go back to America to report too.

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
If there's anything I can do,

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,160
just let me know,

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,230
although I'm...

26
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,060
Useless.

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,990
Hey,

28
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,090
are you really going to give up Hengfeng for him?

29
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,730
I never thought about owning it.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,310
So, there's nothing to give up.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,330
Is that generosity

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,700
or love brain?

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,560
Hey.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,890
You're going back to America?

35
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,100
What?

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,430
Going to miss me?

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,540
Who's going to miss you?

38
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,810
Bad temper.

39
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,200
I never thought I'd fall in love with someone.

40
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,850
Even less did I think this would make

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,260
my ordinary days so meaningful.

42
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,700
(I'm off work. I'll pick you up)

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:55,880
Messages sent...
(I'm off work. I'll pick you up)

44

46
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,600

(Okay, come to my house for dinner)

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,580
Those little things in life, though small, brought so much joy.
(Okay, come to my house for dinner)

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,080
Those little things in life, though small, brought so much joy.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,820
Even though there were occasional setbacks...

52
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,380
Let's eat.

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,200
Got it, thanks, Uncle!

54
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,920
Because of him,

55
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,030
life became so sweet.

56
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,909
Go home with me later.

57
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,070
Good morning.

58
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,190
You can cook?

59
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,860
Just simple stuff,

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,110
like toasted bread and fried eggs.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,380
Have a seat.

62
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,860
Only the chosen one can eat my cooking.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,260
Look at this.

64
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,800
Octopus-shaped small sausages.

65
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,740
The first time I made this. So cute, right?

66
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,390
And the salad next to it.

67
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,100
I washed each leaf individually.

68
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,650
I even added tomatoes,

69
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,120
grapes, and alfalfa sprouts.

70
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,010
And I made a fried egg and three pieces of ham.

71
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,430
I know you like them.

72
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,480
What are you doing?

73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,700
Keep talking.

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Jiang Shaopeng.

75
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,430
Jiang.

76
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,390
Shao.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Peng.

78
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,810
Jiang.

79
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,150
Shao.

80
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,240
Peng.

81
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,390
Jiang Shaopeng.

82
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,250
Jiang Shaopeng.

83
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,010
Jiang Shaopeng.

84
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,520
Jiang Shaopeng.

85
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,120
Have some fruits.

86
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,750
Thank you.

87
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,710
You're cute.

88
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,950
Yang Zixiang.

89
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
Have you sorted out your issues?

90
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,590
What issues?

91
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,070
The work-related ones.

92
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm working on it.

93
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,299
Let's talk.

94
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,750
Maybe I can help you solve your problems.

95
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,110
Uncle and Aunt, we're going out for a bit.

96
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,030
Okay.

97
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,760
What?

98
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,790
Honey.

99
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,240
Yes?

100
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,460
Don't you think it's strange?

101
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,890
Recently, Zixiang

102
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,820
often comes over to our place.

103
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,190
He spends weekends here.

104
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,560
Having your son's boyfriend over for dinner

105
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,820
won't break us.

106
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,250
Of course not.

107
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,710
Shaopeng has a boyfriend?

108
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,060
That means someone can take care of him.

109
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,390
Boyfriend?

110
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,540
What?

111
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,370
You have a problem?

112
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,400
I...

113
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,630
No.

114
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,540
Boyfriend?

115
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,320
Shaopeng will never hear

116
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,020
or speak.

117
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,900
You know that, right?

118
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,690
What are you trying to say?

119
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,050
If you really love Shaopeng,

120
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,200
you have to accept him as he is right now.

121
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Whatever happens in the future,

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,490
don't ever blame him for being unable to hear or speak.

123
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,700
Don't use that as an excuse to not love him.

124
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,290
Don't hurt him

125
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,520
the way I did.

126
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,510
What did you do to him?

127
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,480
Why can't you hear me?

128
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,370
Why can't you hear me?

129
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,640
Why can't you hear me?

130
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
What I want to say is

131
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,900
if you're not ready to accept that

132
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,430
he will never hear or speak,

133
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,710
then please leave him.

134
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,520
Before your love gets really deep.

135
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,360
Love doesn't depend on time.

136
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,400
From what you just said,

137
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,590
I can imagine what you've done to him.

138
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,860
Since you're worried about him,

139
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,600
I'll be honest with you.

140
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,820
I love the part where he can't hear or hear.

141
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,830
I don't expect him to suddenly speak or hear

142
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,410
I'd never make such a request.

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,690
Anyone can talk.

144
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll wait and see.

145
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,880
It feels like I'm going to have a very
hard-to-please sister-in-law in the future.

146
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,120
Sister-in-law?

147
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,950
I am hard to please, alright.

148
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,400
You better be on your toes.

149
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,460
If you make Shaopeng upset,

150
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,350
I won't let you off.

151
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,910
You go upstairs first.

152
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,400
Tell Auntie I'm going home

153
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,580
to sleep tonight.

154
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,950
She fainted on the spot.

155
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,320
When she woke up, she had no memory of that night.

156
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,460
The doctor said it was a defense mechanism.

157
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,260
We decided not to bring it up again.

158
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,560
I didn't expect her to remember.

159
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,960
Maybe she pretended to forget.

160
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,260
What's wrong?

161
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,860
Nothing.

162
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,540
If

163
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,620
that thing hadn't happened six years ago,

164
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,440
you and she might

165
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,330
have been together by now.

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,300
Maybe even married.

167
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,000
Right?

168
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,650
I don't know.

169
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,260
Maybe.

170
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,430
Good thing we didn't date.

171
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,180
Otherwise, I would have missed out on you.

172
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,260
If one day, you think I'm a burden to you,

173
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,220
just tell me you want to break up.

174
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,090
No need for any reason.

175
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,160
Maybe it's you who thinks I'm a burden.

176
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,900
I never expect you to hear

177
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,130
or to speak.

178
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,660
Not being able to hear isn't a flaw.

179
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,360
It's a part of what makes you Jiang Shaopeng.

180
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,190
I know this you

181
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,510
and I like you

182
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,420
as you.

183
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,060
Me too.

184
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,020
I like you

185
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,260
as you.

186
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,350
Let's go back.

187
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,230
Come with me.

188
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,960
Uncle.

189
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,930
Do you really want to fight?

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,240
Shaopeng said you've learned it.

191
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,120
I want to see how good you are.

192
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,820
You.

193
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,410
Score.

194
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,720
Take it as practice.

195
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
Please be gentle, Uncle.

196
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,350
Ah!

197
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,720
Uncle!

198
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,120
Honey.

199
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,820
What's wrong?

200
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,560
I pulled my back, pulled my back.

201
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,330
Are you okay?

202
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,690
I'm fine.

203
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,720
I'm fine.

204
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,370
You're fine after pulling your back?

205
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,480
I'm fine.

206
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,330
Before you want to test others' limits,

207
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,690
you should think about

208
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,840
your own age and strength.

209
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,390
Where?

210
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,730
Here?

211
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,170
-Here?
-Yes.

212
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,820
I'll stick it.

213
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,190
It's great now.

214
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,010
Ouch!

215
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,130
I was just worried...

216
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,760
Uncle, don't worry.

217
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,900
Trust Shaopeng to me.

218
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll take good care of you all.

219
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,020
Who needs you to take care of us?

220
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,050
Shaopeng can manage on his own.

221
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,870
Yes.

222
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,660
I'll take good care of him and you two.

223
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,630
Are you relieved now?

224
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,350
Thank you, Dad.

225
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,270
Here. Here. Here.

226
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,180
-Here.
-Here.

227
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,060
Okay.

228
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,630
Is this okay?

229
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:23,950
Slowly.

230
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,589
Slowly.

231
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,300
Slowly.

232
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,089
Okay.

233
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,260
Saturday is your birthday.

234
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,390
Remember to bring Zixiang back and celebrate together.

235
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,160
My birthday?

236
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,360
Friday is Zixiang's birthday.

237
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,920
He's one day older than me.

238
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,240
What a coincidence. When did you find out?

239
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,080
I saw it on his personal dietary card.

240
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,410
You remembered that back then?

241
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,170
Then you must take him home on Friday.

242
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,430
We'll celebrate his birthday.

243
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,890
But don't tell him.

244
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,000
It'll be a surprise.

245
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,330
Okay, thank you, Mom.

246
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,230
I'll go out first.

247
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,260
What's wrong?

248
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,150
What about my birthday?

249
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,960
It was half a year ago.

250
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,880
And how old are you now to still care about your birthday?

251
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,350
Just to remind yourself to be one year older?

252
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,300
Okay.

253
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,520
Let me massage it for you.

254
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,100
Be gentle.

255
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay. Be gentle.

256
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,820
Is this okay?

257
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,070
All right.

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,970
If I get married in the future, should I prepare

259
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,870
a bride price or dowry for a traditional wedding?

260
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,660
You came here just to ask me that?

261
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,260
You could have asked at home.

262
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,440
Why here?

263
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,380
I was just passing by.

264
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,680
I had a sudden impulse.

265
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,530
So, you and Jiang Shaopeng are at this stage, huh?

266
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,290
Or are you just a love-struck fool

267
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,270
starting to imagine things?

268
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,300
We're dating with marriage as the goal.

269
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,280
Okay?

270
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,260
We're finally done.

271
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,500
He wouldn't have

272
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,440
a secret crush on Yang Zixiang, would he?

273
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,250
Why does that make me upset?

274
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,790
Good work.

275
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,440
I didn't expect so much paperwork

276
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,690
for the land deal.

277
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,500
You office workers really have it hard.

278
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,920
It's not just that.

279
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,890
Our company is restructuring the area,

280
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,990
and we're reorganizing the files as well.

281
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,820
Yes.

282
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,690
Thank goodness Special Assistant Cheng hired you to help.

283
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,130
250 per hour.

284
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,100
The company pays well, right?

285
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,630
250 per hour?

286
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,450
Yes.

287
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,270
200 per hour.

288
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,890
250.

289
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,360
200.

290
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,060
250.

291
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,520
200.

292
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,800
By the way,

293
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,030
have you planned well to go back to America?

294
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Could it be...

295
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,950
You admire me

296
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,590
and want to follow me?

297
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,140
Who would appreciate you?

298
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,330
Cheng Fengjie!

299
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,390
Take care.

300
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,650
You tricked me.

301
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,130
Hongcheng offered 250 an hour.

302
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,250
But you gave me 200.

303
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,580
The extra 50 is for the service fee.

304
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,710
Service fee my foot!

305
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,960
You make so much money.

306
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,790
And you're quibbling over 50 bucks per hour?

307
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,230
Give it back.

308
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,640
What if I pay you back in kind?

309
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,840
In kind?

310
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,810
In

311
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,910
kind?

312
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,020
How?

313
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,680
Like this.

314
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,630
Are you crazy?

315
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,700
We agreed to work together to break up their relationship.

316
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,950
You lied to me.

317
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,570
I didn't know what you wanted to do to Shaopeng.

318
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,740
So I agreed

319
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,690
to keep an eye on you.

320
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,500
You tricked me?

321
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,320
Sorry.

322
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,470
But Yang Zixiang won't change his mind to like you

323
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
just because of the things you've done.

324
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,920
So, do you think this will

325
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,820
make Jiang Shaopeng like you

326
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,890
and date you?

327
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,540
What's the point of all your silent efforts?

328
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,420
Or should I tell him for you?

329
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,250
Don't tell him.

330
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,340
Zheng Yunong.

331
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,170
You're pitiful.

332
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,460
What do you mean?

333
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,490
You don't know what it's like to do things

334
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,770
for someone you love without thinking

335
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,450
about getting anything in return.

336
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,470
Just the act of giving makes you happy.

337
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,120
I've packed Auntie's clothes for her.

338
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,730
You really won't consider being my assistant?

339
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Whatever he says.

340
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,760
If we are too worried and ask too much,

341
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,580
we'll only put him under a lot of pressure.

342
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,240
And he'll think it's all his fault.

343
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,060
Good luck.

344
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,750
I'll wait for your good news.

345
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,370
Don't tell me you're happier this way.

346
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,520
Song Shuhe.

347
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,680
Liking someone makes you happy,

348
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,980
but it also makes you sad.

349
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,990
You don't dare to tell him now

350
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,210
because you're afraid it'll ruin your relationship with Jiang Shaopeng.

351
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,550
You can only get freedom through marriage.

352
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,000
How great that makes you?

353
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,910
I don't believe that seeing Yang Zixiang with him

354
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,440
would make you happy.

355
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,130
No.

356
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,150
I'm not the one who makes him happy.

357
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,410
I won't be happy.

358
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
But seeing him happy makes me happy.

359
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,050
This is my way of liking Shaopeng.

360
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,640
This is my choice

361
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,620
and I'll take responsibility for it.

362
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,560
I'll bear it willingly.

363
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
You...

364
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You've got some guts.

365
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,230
I don't care what you want to do to Yang Zixiang,

366
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,810
but if you make Shaopeng sad,

367
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,360
I'll pay you back double.

368
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,950
I'm so scared.

369
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,720
You won't.

370
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,010
You lied to me first.

371
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,560
You should buy me coffee

372
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,670
as an apology.

373
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,890
If you can break free by yourself,

374
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,220
I'd be happy to buy you dinner.

375
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,430
Remember what you said.

376
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,150
Can your son break up with mine?

377
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,560
Do you think I...

378
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,420
Has Shaopeng come over?

379
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,020
I've been calling, but his phone is off.

380
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,800
(Moments of seeing love)

381
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:25,990
Ah!
(Moments of seeing love)

382
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,620
Ah!

383
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,610
Honey, what's wrong?

384
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,510
I pulled my back.

385
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,100
Are you okay?

386
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm fine.

387
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,420
I'm fine.

388
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,480
You are fine

389
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,310
after pulling your back?

390
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,270
I'm fine.

391
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,470
Okay.

392
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,980
Cut.

393
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,520
Cut.

394
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,410
You just smiled.

395
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:47,790
(See Your Love)

396
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,680
I saw it.
(See Your Love)

397
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:48,710
(See Your Love)

398
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,260
I didn't.
(See Your Love)

399
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,470
(See Your Love)
