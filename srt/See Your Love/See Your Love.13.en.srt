1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,660
Okay.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,780
Wait.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,770
Do you have nothing to do?

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,580
No.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,540
I'm doing something.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,640
Relying on you.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,170
From now on, I'll stay by your side and rely on you.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,770
The words once spoken

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,380
now seem like ironic lies in retrospect.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,800
I've decided to stay in Taiwan.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,990
The thought of meetings gives me a headache.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't even get me started on all those complex documents.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,490
The family business has to be in your hands.

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,380
Zixiang has got the land for the mall's development.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,840
When he comes back,

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,360
we should hold a wedding for him and Yunong as soon as possible.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,230
Then with two years of training,

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,470
he can take over from me.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,210
I'm so relieved

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,740
with you helping him.

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,160
Once you start

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,260
telling a lie,

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,640
there will be more lies.

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,330
I fell in love with someone.

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,030
I'll break off my engagement with Yunong

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,750
and stay with him in Taiwan.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,860
Some things won't stop as long as they start.

28
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,990
(See Your Love)

29
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,860
(Episode 13)

30
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,980
What do you think...

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,690
of my style?

33
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,700
Not bad.

34
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,550
Then what do you think of...

35
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,430
Did Shaopeng come here?

36
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,250
Jiang Shaopeng.

37
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,430
You don't deserve him.

38
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,210
(Zixiang has chosen me)

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,190
He has always wanted to break free from the constraints of his family.

40
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,600
You're just a reason.

41
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,830
(He's not that kind of person. If he says he likes someone, he means it.)

42
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,909
Didn't you plan to celebrate your birthday together?

43
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,620
Were you late so that you missed each other?

44
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,690
I arrived there on time,

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,350
but his phone has been off the entire time.

46
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,820
Calm down.

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
Maybe his phone ran out of battery.

48
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,970
Hello.

49
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,530
Cousin.

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,660
Cousin.

51
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,820
You and your dad are so alike.

52
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,710
Telling lies is as easy as drinking water to you.

53
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,190
Cousin, why are you doing this?

54
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,450
What happened?

55
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,940
Take a guess.

56
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,280
If you and I were in danger at the same time,

57
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,350
who would Zixiang save first?

58
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,950
Back then, when we both fell into the sea,

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,630
everyone hurried to save you,

60
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,280
forgetting I was there too.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
If you hadn't asked them to save me,

62
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,680
I would have drowned.

63
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,560
From that moment on,

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,590
I knew the family cares about you the most.

65
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,110
It was a result intentionally caused by your father!

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,390
Your father chose to let you live back then.

67
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,210
Now,

68
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,860
there's only one bullet in the gun.

69
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,230
I'll give you five seconds.

70
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,890
You can choose to let me live

71
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,930
or let him live.

72
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,500
Cousin, I don't want to do this.

73
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,350
Pick it up!

74
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,170
No!

75
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,010
Cousin!

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
Pick it up!

77
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,820
Pull the trigger!

78
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,100
Five!

79
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,400
Four!

80
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,540
Three!

81
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,540
Two!

82
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,060
(He would sacrifice himself)

83
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,630
(to save you and me)

84
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,620
Cousin.

85
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,720
Shaopeng is the one I like.

86
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,810
You are my most important brother,

87
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,460
my most admired cousin.

88
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,600
If I had a choice,

89
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,990
I would have preferred

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,850
that you were the one

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,250
saved first back then.

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,620
You're more important than me.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,990
I sent people to interfere with your work in Taiwan.

94
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,820
I know.

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,800
It was also me who nearly had you killed!

96
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm still alive.

97
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,130
Things that failed never happened.

98
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,390
Why don't you care

99
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,050
about what I care about?

100
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,880
I've been trying so hard for it,

101
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,580
but why can you give it up so easily?

102
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,400
Why don't you compete with me for it?

103
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,440
If you had tried your best to compete with me,

104
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,780
I could do whatever it takes to destroy you.

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,710
I wouldn't have become like this!

106
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,440
Because you'll always be my cousin!

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,420
Cousin.

108
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,100
Long time no see.

109
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,080
Cousin.

110
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,870
Why are you here?

111
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,320
Relying on you.

112
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,450
From now on, I'll stay by your side and rely on you.

113
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,580
Why didn't you tell Yang Zixiang

114
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,680
there was no bullet in the gun?

115
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,690
Because I've got the answer I wanted.

116
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,950
Yang Zicheng,

117
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,580
I can help you.

118
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,550
Consider it a return favor for dealing with Crazy Dog Dong

119
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,790
and letting me take over his territory...

120
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,630
Shut up.

121
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,010
This is a return favor.

122
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,150
(The Color Shisha Bar)

123
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,380
(We're fine and we're on our way home)

124
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,470
It's good that they're okay.
(We're fine and we're on our way home)

125
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,600
It's good that they're okay.

126
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,420
But tell me,

127
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,010
are they really okay?

128
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,850
Being able to go home means everything's been settled.

129
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm relieved then.

130
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,170
What are you looking at?

131
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,370
You're cute.

132
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,780
That's the best.

133
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,550
Don't use your cheesy pick-up lines

134
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,150
to flirt with me.

135
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:55,920
Tell me.

136
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,910
Why did you ask me out and buy me a drink?

137
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,140
There's something else besides thanking me, right?

138
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
Aren't you going back to America?

139
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,260
A send-off?

140
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,100
Yes.

141
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,470
A send-off.

142
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,820
You drink up.

143
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll drink as much as I want.

144
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,390
I'm not drunk at all.

145
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,500
Right.

146
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,400
Do you remember this pillar?

147
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,380
Cheng Fengjie, you're so drunk.

148
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,050
Helping you has made me worn out.

149
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,300
Sit still.

150
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,690
Do you still remember this place?

151
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
It feels familiar.

152
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,890
Is this your first time?

153
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,780
No wonder...

154
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,020
you were so rough.

155
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,090
It made me uncomfortable.

156
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,730
This is the place where we slept together

157
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,310
for the first time.

158
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,030
It cost us 7,885 NT dollars. So expensive.

159
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,250
You're drunk,

160
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,970
Wang Xinjia.

161
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm not drunk.

162
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,840
You're drunk.

163
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,400
I made you get drunk

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
before telling you I like you.

165
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,810
In that way,

166
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,370
you'll forget everything tomorrow.

167
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,570
Don't you want to know if I like you?

168
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,930
I'll be... gentle.

169
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,810
It won't be like last time.

170
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,950
Fool.

171
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
You just believed

172
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,940
what I said about

173
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,800
who was up and who was below.

174
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,260
It's so easy to deceive you.

175
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,580
If no one is around,

176
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,200
you'll have no place to cry when you suffer losses.

177
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,250
Drinking alone?

178
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,060
How did you get in?

179
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,470
My family invested in the hotel.

180
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,690
It's easy to get

181
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
a universal key card.

182
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,010
You've talked to Sean?

183
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,920
He came here not long ago,

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,020
but he has changed so much.

185
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,020
He's fallen in love.

186
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,510
They say when it comes to love,

187
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,000
even a dog can become a poet.

188
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,670
You know what?

189
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,210
Sean even displayed his affection in front of me

190
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,830
and forced me to break off our engagement.

191
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,030
He succeeded.

192
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,900
I need your help.

193
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,930
I'm not your back-up.

194
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,430
Oh my God.

195
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,140
I'm asking you to solve

196
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,770
the problem for me, not to be my fiancé.

197
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,410
I want to rely on my own strength

198
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,260
to leave that family —

199
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,300
outwardly glamorous, but rotten to the core.

200
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,710
Is Jiang Shaopeng...

201
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,880
nice to him?

202
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,340
If not,

203
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,710
why would Sean

204
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,580
work so hard

205
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,460
to shed the image of a useless rich young master?

206
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,460
Jiang Shaopeng.

207
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,120
Jiang Shaopeng.

208
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm hungry.

209
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,170
I want steamed buns.

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,010
Good morning.

211
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,950
Good morning.

212
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,690
I slept in the wardrobe again.

213
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,050
Take your time.

214
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,020
It's okay.

215
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
We

216
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,710
still

217
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,800
have

218
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,380
a lot of time.

219
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,830
Yeah.

220
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,350
We still have a lot of time.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,790
(Zhengpeng Taekwondo)

222
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,940
Zixiang.

223
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,060
Uncle.

224
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,340
Thank you for cleaning the dojo with Shaopeng.

225
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,670
Don't mention it, Uncle.

226
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm gonna go get the door.

227
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,020
You guys stay and clean this place.

228
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,660
Okay.

229
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,480
(Zhengpeng Taekwondo)

230
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,740
Hello, who...

231
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,270
Platoon Leader Yang?

232
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,040
Long time no see, Five Bucks.

233
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,400
Long time no see.

234
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,120
Long time no see.

235
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,320
What's wrong?

236
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,020
He's my dad.

237
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,570
After I was discharged from the army,

238
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
I heard that you and your family immigrated to America.

239
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,540
When did you come back?

240
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,720
How did you know I'm here?

241
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,550
Zixiang is my son.

242
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,600
I came here

243
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,390
because I hope your son can break up with him.

244
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
Sorry, Platoon Leader.

245
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,020
When we were in the army, your orders

246
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,150
were everything.

247
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,580
But as Shaopeng's father,

248
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,760
I refuse.

249
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,500
Both of them are men.

250
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,070
And your son is...

251
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,940
Do you know my personality?

252
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,230
When I say no, I mean no.

253
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,720
No matter who negotiates with me, it won't change anything.

254
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,230
If they stay together, it will only bring shame upon us.

255
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,900
Have some tea.

256
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,750
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

257
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,100
My answer is still the same.

258
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,520
Jiang Zhengyuan!

259
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,230
Zixiang

260
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,880
really is a good man.

261
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,650
Don't worry.

262
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,700
I will take good care of him.

263
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,540
You're talking about my son!

264
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,580
But it seems you don't want him anymore, right?

265
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,620
What's wrong?

266
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,290
My dad said...

267
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,600
From now on, who he's with,

268
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,580
where he lives, or what he does —

269
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
it's none of your concern anymore, is it?

270
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,090
Aren't you worried they'll be judged by others?

271
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,990
You think society has changed and gender equality and diversity

272
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,090
have become the norm?

273
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,700
It's not that simple.

274
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,490
It's not like that even in America.

275
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,890
It sounds like you're not against it.

276
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,690
It's more like... you're worried about Zixiang.

277
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,950
Zixiang is my only son.

278
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,730
He deserves the best of everything in the world.

279
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,660
My career,

280
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,880
partners who can help him for the rest of his life,

281
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,160
and his wife —

282
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,930
I've arranged everything for him.

283
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,680
As long as he follows my plans,

284
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,430
he won't have anything to worry about.

285
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,160
Platoon Leader,

286
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,150
we gave our children life,

287
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,510
but we can't control their paths.

288
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,740
What's best for them

289
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,130
is not up to us,

290
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,110
but themselves.

291
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,430
It's what you think.

292
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,050
Now I finally understand

293
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,260
he made those arrangements out of love for me.

294
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,090
But he didn't do it in the way you prefer.

295
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,970
You should be mentally prepared.

296
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,110
Your dad is very stubborn.

297
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I'll be with you.

298
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,970
How should we show our love?

299
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,740
Some people show their love in a warm and gentle way,

300
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,240
(Taekwondo for Kids) (Elementary Class) (Poomsae Class)

301
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,550
while others show their care through strict and forceful intervention.

while others show their care through strict and forceful intervention.

303
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,060
I need an assistant.

304
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,370
Are you willing?

305
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,090
Yes.

306
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,280
In America?

307
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,710
But I'm not good at English.

308
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,800
Some people

309
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,060
hide the sorrow of farewell behind light-hearted teasing.

310
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,650
But I can learn.

311
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,040
Who is the new representative temporarily appointed by Hengfeng Group?

312
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,200
I don't know.

313
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,430
The documents haven't been handed over yet.

314
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,220
You just joined us yesterday.

315
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:57,930
It's not your fault.

316
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,050
And don't be nervous.

317
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,240
Thank you.

318
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,970
I'm here

319
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,150
for the meal you owe me.

320
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,640
Some people try to create opportunities to meet,

321
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,070
planning for the future.

322
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,380
Okay.

323
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,500
Well...

324
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,000
tonight then.

325
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,610
Some people communicate in a different way,

326
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,330
conveying messages through unspoken understanding.

327
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,900
Why did you ask me out today?

328
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,330
And you're so well-dressed.

329
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,440
To celebrate our birthday.

330
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,120
I've realized the beauty of sign language.

331
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,010
We can communicate even like this.

332
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,580
I've never needed to hear you say you love me.

333
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,800
Everything you've done for me

334
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,540
makes me know you love me deeply.

335
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,950
Me too.

336
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,620
I can't hear,

337
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,610
but I can see.

338
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,760
Thank you for loving me.

339
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,140

Good morning.

344
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,760
Are you okay?

345
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,030
I tried to be gentle.

346
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,280
After all, this is our first time.

347
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,630
I'm okay.

348
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,280
It's just...

349
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,900
a little painful.

350
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,090
Whose... Whose first time?

351
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,450
Your first time and my first time.

352
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,310
Our first time.

353
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:48,990
Then...

354
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,530
Then what about that night when we first met?

355
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,760
About that night, I was just kidding.

356
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,160
You even threw up on me.

357
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,390
I helped you take a shower.

358
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,370
Reflect on yourself.

359
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,490
Don't get so drunk.

360
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,940
No need to drink alcohol to boost your courage.

361
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,490
I like you too.

362
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,220
You're really annoying,

363
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,610
Cheng Fengjie.

364
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
You tricked me.

365
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,600
It's too late to say you like me now.

366
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,440
Who would believe that?

367
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,810
Do you really like me?

368
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,150
If you don't believe me,

369
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,840
I can show you again.

370
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,870
No, Cheng Fengjie!

371
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,460
(Another way of seeing love)

372
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,070
Good morning.

Good morning.

374
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,990
I slept in the wardrobe again.

375
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Take your time.
