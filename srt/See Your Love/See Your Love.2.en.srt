6
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,530
What's taking him so long?

7
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:06,068
Yes.

8
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,137
Finally, he's here.

9
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,242
Welcome to my...

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,781
Why is it you?

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,021
My shirt.

12
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,255
My face.

13
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,557
There's nothing on my face, right?

14
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:02,792
There's nothing on my face, right?

15
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:27,684
What are you doing?

16
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:51,808
Give me a hand.

17
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,210
Over there.

18
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:56,980
Put me here.

19
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,701
You can use the other bathroom.

20
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,607
Get a change of clothes for me later.

21
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,350
I didn't do it on purpose.

22
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,085
Why is he so angry?

23
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,621
He pretended not to hear me when
I asked him to get some clothes for me.

24
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:18,360
I can't believe this!

25
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,830
Jonathan! Just you wait!

26
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,637
Come here.

27
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,009
Come here.

28
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,183
Come here.

29
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,723
You have a nice body.

30
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,525
Looks like you train your body well.

31
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,560
You have hidden it quite well.

32
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:29,265
(Do you have a dryer at home?)

33
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:31,633
What's wrong?

34
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,336
Are you so mad
that you don't want to talk to me?

35
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:34,670
You are so petty.

36
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,038
I've made it up to you.

37
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:36,972
I lent you my bathroom.

38
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,541
And now, you want a dryer.

39
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:43,613
(I'm deaf. I can't talk.
I don't know what you are saying.)

40
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,119
Why didn't you say that earlier?

41
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,354
I keep talking.

42
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:54,023
Is this a talk show?

43
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,795
How can I communicate
with you like this?

44
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:02,898
Oh, yes.

45
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,333
You can use voice input.

46
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,269
It's good that we can communicate.

47
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,271
How about you help me
with another thing?

48
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,330
Please help me with my clothes too.

49
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,074
It's not that hard.

50
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:46,975
The washing machine is doing the job.

51
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,478
Not you.

52
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:01,157
How about you help me
with another thing?

53
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,976
This is my dryer.

54
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,411
Are you sure you don't want to help?

55
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:27,349
Okay. Forget it.

56
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,984
Forget it if you don't want to help me.

57
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,386
I can wash it myself.

58
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,357
You rejected me
without hearing me out first.

59
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,926
This is my territory.

60
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,436
Whose shoes are those out there?

61
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:48,638
Who did you let in?

62
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,339
You refused to cook for me

63
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
and went out angrily.

64
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,276
So, I could only order food
to be delivered to me.

65
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,845
You refused to cook for me.
But you bought me food.

66
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,447
You are not bad, Jonathan.

67
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,983
You ordered food delivery
and let that person in?

68
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,018
Have you forgotten
why we are staying here?

69
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:03,819
Of course I do.

70
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,421
We were chased after without a reason.

71
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:07,256
Were they gangsters?

72
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:09,525
Who is he?

73
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,260
He's the deliveryman.

74
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:15,130
I hear that the gangsters are always involved
in the land development projects here.

75
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,764
They steal the bids

76
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,567
and commit various heinous crimes.

77
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,474
Gangsters.

78
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:32,014
Heinous crimes.

79
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,394
Why did you order food delivery?

80
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,229
What are you doing?

81
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:49,564
There's an outsider here.
Watch what you say.

82
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:50,966
Don't worry. He can't hear us.

83
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,568
He doesn't know
what we are talking about.

84
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,638
We need to be cautious.

85
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,339
Have you found out who they are?

86
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,207
I'm still investigating.

87
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:03,613
Take your time.

88
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:09,584
Bye.

89
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,721
I'll ask you to deliver food
to my house again.

90
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,232
I told you that he couldn't hear us.
But you didn't believe me.

91
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,203
I thought you said
the walking stick was ugly.

92
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,236
The wheelchair is broken.
I'm waiting for you to fix it.

93
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,680
Jonathan.

94
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,281
Help me fix the wheelchair.

95
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:46,388
Don't worry, Chairman.

96
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,324
Young Boss's injury
has been properly treated.

97
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,328
He is also

98
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:55,398
doing well.

99
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,534
Although he's injured,
he still works hard.

100
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:00,001
Yes.

101
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,436
I will take good care of him

102
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:03,072
and help him seal this deal.

103
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:09,978
You have worked hard.

104
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,081
It's not easy to lie to my dad.

105
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,847
If you are like this,
how can the Chairman

106
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,548
hand over Hengfeng Group
to you without worries?

107
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,719
Those who want it can take it.
I don't want it anyway.

108
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,189
I just want to live off the bonus.

109
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,658
Do you know what others talk
about you behind your back?

110
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,227
The useless second generation.

111
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,130
Yes. I'm useless.

112
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,499
So, I suggest you work for another boss.

113
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,967
You have no future with me.

114
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,402
It'll be a waste of
your impeccable talents.

115
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:35,671
Don't you feel ashamed?

116
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,405
How about you become

117
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,774
Yang Zixiang starting today?

118
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,643
I will rest and recuperate here.

119
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:42,945
My leg is in so much pain.

120
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,413
What do you think?

121
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:46,082
Can you be even more useless?

122
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,017
I will

123
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:50,219
try my best.

124
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:10,973
Jonathan.

125
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,241
I'm thirsty. I want to drink some water.

126
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,477
Help me get some water.

127
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:21,584
Jonathan.

128
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,820
(Jiang Shaopeng)

129
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,007
(Shuhe: Give me a hand.)

130
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:15,971
I knew that you would make it.

131
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,373
Thank you.

132
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:19,174
Oh.

133
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,908
If I didn't have this document,
I would look like a fool at the meeting today.

134
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,146
Are you going out for another interview?

135
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,417
I hope I didn't waste your time.

136
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:32,721
(It's okay.)

137
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:33,655
(It's near.)

138
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,990
(Just downstairs.)

139
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,327
All the best.

140
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:39,962
I'll wait for your good news.

141
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:49,171
Why are you smiling so happily?

142
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,773
Is your boyfriend here?

143
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,976
The heads of each relevant department
are waiting for you in the meeting room.

144
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,144
You look pretty when you smile.

145
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:57,346
You should smile more.

146
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,350
If you say anything
about my smile again,

147
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:04,753
I'll sue you
for workplace sexual harassment.

148
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:08,456
Ms. Song.

149
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,159
Let's get the meeting started.

150
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:11,226
Jonathan.

151
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:12,928
Let's go to the meeting room.

152
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:14,663
Hurry up.

153
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,674
(Our job requires immediate response.
We can't accept a special employee.)

154
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:26,675
Mr. Jiang.

155
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,612
Mr. Jiang.

156
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:31,780
Here are your documents.

157
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:32,414
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,448
The manager who interviewed you

159
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,216
said something quite rude.

160
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:36,384
Don't take it to heart.

161
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,852
But you did very well
in the written test.

162
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:38,820
But...

163
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,789
Maybe because you are deaf,

164
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,924
it's a bit...

165
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,460
Wait for me.

166
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:49,330
Wait.

167
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,265
Mr. Jiang.

168
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,867
Wait for me.

169
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:53,903
Help me pick it up.

170
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,427
(Jiang Shaopeng)

171
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,596
(Company Names)

172
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,331
He's looking for a job.

173
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:09,167
(Jiang Shaopeng)

174
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:14,040
(Company Names)

175
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:20,629
The deaf can do everything
except hearing.

176
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,885
(Jiang Shaopeng)

177
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:30,439
Consider it again.

178
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:35,043
You are unhappy to follow me around.

179
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,943
And I don't like that you are
following me around either.

180
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,049
Not many in Taiwan know me anyway.

181
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,017
You can become Yang Zixiang.

182
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,286
If we don't tell anyone about it

183
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,821
and ask Shuhe to keep it a secret,

184
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,423
everyone will be happy.

185
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:49,591
Thank you.

186
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,024
Hi, Brother.

187
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:23,792
How are you lately?

188
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,693
You are still as busy as usual.

189
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:26,461
Take care of yourself.

190
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:28,263
How is it going
with the mall development project?

191
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:35,036
We have just finished our first meeting.

192
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,638
We are going
to make the second assessment.

193
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,638
We'll look at the land that will
be bid on in a few more days

194
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,606
- and go into the planning details.
- You can't do it.

195
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:45,713
Yes.

196
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,248
I've never liked studying.

197
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,082
I just want to have fun.

198
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,852
I have such a hard time with meetings.

199
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:51,987
Let alone those complicated documents.

200
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,156
You should handle the family business.

201
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,660
Then find a chance to do something.

202
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,163
Just like how you pushed me
into the sea back then.

203
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:05,067
Back then, I...

204
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,582
You need to take care of yourself

205
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,151
when you lead a tour outside
by yourself.

206
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:24,853
Someone has rung the doorbell.

207
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:25,788
Go and open the door.

208
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,790
You need to put yourself first.

209
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,360
You need to take care of yourself first
before you can take care of others.

210
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,231
Hi.

211
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,274
(Where's your key?)

212
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,643
I forgot to bring it with me.

213
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,410
Mrs. Jiang.

214
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,580
I'm famished.

215
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:53,681
You didn't even greet me.

216
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,281
You just complained about being hungry.

217
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:56,651
Where's your image?

218
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,219
Do you plan to get married?

219
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,255
I was just being real.

220
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:00,989
I see.

221
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,124
If they don't like me, stay away.

222
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,960
Even if I can't find anyone,

223
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,797
I still have Shaopeng.

224
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:16,804
(Your mom said that I complained
about eating as soon as I came in.)

225
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,138
(She said that nobody would marry me
because I didn't act like a lady.)

226
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,777
(You were just being real.)

227
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:24,613
(I think you are cute.)

228
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,047
Yes.

229
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,382
So, I told her

230
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:28,917
that if no one wanted to marry me,

231
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:31,386
I would marry you.

232
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,757
(I'm not a recycling center.)

233
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:37,325
What did you say?

234
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:39,560
Say it again.

235
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,161
Try it.

236
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,463
Say it again.

237
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,666
(Go and wash your hands)

238
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,301
(and get ready to eat.)

239
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:48,002
Okay.

240
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:48,871
I'll talk to you later.

241
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,760
(Palliative Care Training for Care Workers
Long-term Care Services Handbook)

242
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:59,972
(Pre-service Training Course
for Care Workers)

243
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:17,383
(Jiang Shaopeng)

244
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:32,881
Are you sure you don't want
to consider working as my assistant?

245
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:39,154
(I want to put what I learned to use.)

246
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,456
But taking care of others is tiring.

247
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:43,691
(This is a growing industry.)

248
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,793
(Now the population is aging)

249
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,729
(and the birth rate is declining.)

250
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,666
(Together with the implementation
of the Long-Term Care 2.0 policy,)

251
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:57,339
(I'm sure I can work in this industry
for a long time.)

252
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:01,143
If you have made up your mind,

253
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,779
I'll cheer you on.

254
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:13,855
(Are you okay at work?)

255
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:16,124
(You've been working overtime lately.)

256
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,159
(Are you exhausted?)

257
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes.

258
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,431
Our business partner came from America.

259
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,666
The assistant looks very capable.

260
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:30,439
Unfortunately, he's bringing along
a useless second generation.

261
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:31,573
Let me tell you.

262
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:33,642
When we were in meetings,

263
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,244
he would doze off.

264
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:37,980
This project worth
hundreds of billions.

265
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,715
But when I saw that useless
second-generation dozing off,

266
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,284
I couldn't help but feel

267
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,721
that it doesn't matter
who you are in the world.

268
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,722
What matters

269
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,358
is who your parents are.

270
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,130
(There's a place for everyone.)

271
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:57,065
There's a place for everyone?

272
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:00,569
(I'm sure he has something
he wants to do.)

273
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,271
Maybe leeching off his parents.

274
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,773
His assistant said that.

275
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:07,342
Okay now.

276
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:09,110
I won't disturb you anymore.

277
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:10,078
You can continue.

278
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:07,228
Oh, no.

279
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:08,230
I'm late.

280
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:09,330
I have to go out now.

281
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:10,332
Bye.

282
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,167
Slow down. Don't rush.

283
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:14,435
Okay.

284
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,436
Be safe.

285
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:16,738
Be careful on the road.

286
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,877
Look at how on the edge she is.

287
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,179
Is she really the assistant of a CEO?

288
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,080
(She's an amazing assistant.)

289
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:30,285
(Everyone in the company respects her.)

290
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:32,386
Maybe because she's very fierce.

291
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:33,622
So, everyone is afraid of her.

292
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,861
She must have forgotten something.

293
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:42,397
She's so forgetful.

294
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:54,250
(Opening a door is to connect
to the outside world.)

295
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:07,439
(I never thought
that opening the door this time)

296
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,310
(would turn my everyday life)

297
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,203
Good morning.
