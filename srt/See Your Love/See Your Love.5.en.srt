00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,010
(See Your Love)

2
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,690
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,480
Jiang Shaopeng.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,660
About yesterday...

5
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:00,960
(Resignation)
About yesterday...

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,110
(Resignation)

7
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,039
Jiang Shaopeng.

8
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,050
Jiang Shaopeng, are you serious?

9
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,890
You don't want to join Xin'an Long-term Care Center?

10
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,840
Don't be like this! I'm sorry!

11
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,560
I worked very hard

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,820
and took good care of you.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,350
Wait. Wait.

14
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,410
I don't know what your gestures mean!

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,690
I don't allow you to resign!

16
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,710
You're like a couple quarreling.

17
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,020
What did you do to make him so angry that he wants to resign?

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,600
I...

19
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,520
He...

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,040
Did you take advantage of him?

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,540
Jiang Shaopeng!

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,220
If so, don't you feel guilty towards your...

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,020
Shut up!

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,780
Jiang Shaopeng!

25
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,210
He can't hear you.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,470
I'm just telling the truth.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,579
Why are you looking at me like that?

28
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,810
It'll be your responsibility

29
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,890
to take care of me.

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,410
From today...

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,790
From now on.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,450
I'm very busy.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,910
Seriously?

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,340
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,590
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

36
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,510
(He favors sweet flavors)

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,440
(He has stomach problems)

38
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
(Avoid pungent food)

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
(He's a picky eater)

40
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,130
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,590
(He hates vegetables)

42
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,220
(Especially green peppers and carrots)

43
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,620
(He's like a child)

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,240
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

45
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,850
I didn't expect him to be so thoughtful.

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,010
He's a great carer.

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,640
What a pity.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
When eating alone, I never know what to buy.

49
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,910
Son!

50
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,880
Your boss is finally willing to let you have a day off and go home.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,010
I've finished my job.

52
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,410
It must be because you took good care of him.

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,380
Awesome!

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,250
What are you going to cook today?

55
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,960
If I'm alone,

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,710
a simple meal is enough.

57
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,620
But now that you're back,

58
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,130
of course I should cook what you like.

59
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,100
You've lost weight.

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,510
It's just

61
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,830
what you think.

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,720
Where did you learn that?

63
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,950
Good for you.

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,550
Auntie, what are we having for dinner tonight?

65
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,690
Shaopeng?

66
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,850
Why are you home?

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,200
Are you having a day off?

68
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,730
I've finished my job.

69
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,060
I see.

70
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,820
Then today,

71
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,170
let's drink wine.

72
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,640
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,500
Auntie!

74
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,990
Where is the plum wine I brought back from Japan last time?

75
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,110
I think it's over there.

76
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,780
Let's drink it later

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,500
to celebrate since Shaopeng has finished his first job.

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,430
Sure.

79
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,659
Do you need help?

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,030
Okay, come in first.

81
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,890
Okay.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,040
(Basic health information)

83
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,480
(Self-assessment of health)

84
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,450
(I want your health report and food preferences)

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,640
No problem. Take care of me from now on.

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,850
Little Boss!

87
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,060
Impressive.

88
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,610
You actually have found me.

89
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,990
Thank you.

90
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,180
I didn't expect him to be so thoughtful.

91
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,670
Jiang Shaopeng!

92
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,730
What did you do to make him so angry that he wants to resign?

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,090
He's a great carer.

94
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,060
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

95
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,300
What a pity.
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,380
(He likes beef, shrimps, and cheese)
(He hates vegetables, especially green peppers and carrots)

97
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,810
(Self-assessment of health)

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,610
Be careful.

99
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,620
Okay.

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,450
Okay.

101
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,550
He got drunk after just three drinks.

102
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,470
He has a low alcohol tolerance just like his father.

103
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,280
The alcohol content is 15%.

104
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,250
He's already quite impressive.

105
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,880
This boy...

106
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,190
Do you think

107
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,730
he really has finished his job or he got fired?

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,280
Whatever he says.

109
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,680
If we are too worried and ask too much,

110
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,650
we'll only put him under a lot of pressure.

111
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,580
And he'll think it's all his fault.

112
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,320
You're right.

113
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,590
He's been trying so hard just to make us rest assured.

114
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,850
If I had noticed something was wrong with him

115
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,740
after the doctor administered the medication

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,180
that year when Shaopeng fell ill,

117
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,580
we wouldn't have missed the chance for emergency treatment.

118
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,750
It's all in the past.

119
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,010
Auntie.

120
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,580
It was not anyone's fault.

121
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,240
Didn't we agree

122
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,560
to look ahead and never look back?

123
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,330
Look ahead.

124
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,240
Never look back.

125
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,070
I'll let you eat

126
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,630
after you handle this file.

127
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,560
I can order takeout

128
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,720
with my smartphone.

129
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,820
The file is in your hands.

130
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
You can eat only after you handle it.

131
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,590
You know I can't understand it.

132
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,210
Why are you making things difficult for me?

133
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,910
It's already three minutes.

134
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,040
My instant noodles…

135
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,990
Are you really so useless?

136
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,150
Yes.

137
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,750
That's why I advised you to work for another boss as soon as possible.

138
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,950
You'll have no future sticking with me.

139
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,080
President doesn't think so.

140
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,350
He has high expectations of you.

141
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,570
Not every expectation can be met.

142
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,050
I'm just not that capable.

143
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,870
Hengfeng Group will go bankrupt if it's handed over to you.

144
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,130
I think so too.

145
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,130
Stinky tofu?

146
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,490
Or oyster omelettes?

147
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm not hungry.

148
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,720
If only Jiang Shaopeng were here.

149
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,860
Go get him back.

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,100
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

151
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,250
I...

152
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
He really slammed the door in my face again.

153
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,050
Who is it? Why won't you open the door?

154
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,790
Mr. Yang.

155
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,770
Your former boss?

156
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,910
You've finished your job.

157
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,150
Why did he come to you?

158
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,410
Something happened?

159
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,550
So you haven't finished your job.

160
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,650
Is there...

161
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,160
some misunderstanding?

162
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,140
Or...

163
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,400
did you quarrel?

164
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,310
Go buy salt for me.

165
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,210
Boss, hello.

166
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,790
Go. Go.

167
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,040
Buy salt.

168
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,860
Buy salt.

169
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,100
Buy salt for me.

170
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,510
You know which brand I like.

171
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,070
Go buy salt!

172
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,850
I'll go buy salt with him.

173
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll send him back later.

174
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,270
Okay.

175
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
Take your time.

176
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,310
I'm not in urgent need of it.

177
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,770
Take your time.

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
(Don't worry. I won't tell Cheng Fengjie)
(I can't hear or speak)

179
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,660
I do want you to keep it a secret,

180
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,990
but I came here mainly to apologize to you.

181
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,600
(I'm sorry that I used you)

182
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm sorry that I used you.

183
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,380
No matter what the reason is,

184
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,730
I can't justify using you.

185
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,780
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,330
I hope you can accept my apology

187
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,080
and continue to take care of me.

188
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,460
Please.

189
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,780
(You drew them?)

190
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,490
Yes.

191
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,870
My...

192
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,570
interest.

193
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,550
(Why did you leave?)

194
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,270
Now, the whole family pays much attention

195
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,420
to your performance in Taiwan.

196
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,560
You can't handle it.

197
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,110
Do you know what people say about you behind your back?

198
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,040
Useless rich kid.

199
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,860
Um.

200
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,660
(Why did you leave?)

201
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,340
My dad wants me to take over the family business.

202
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,400
But I don't want to.

203
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,630
I want him to hand it over to my cousin.

204
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,100
He's very outstanding and capable.

205
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,110
But my dad doesn't like him.

206
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,090
(Why didn't you tell your dad?)

207
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,390
I dare not.

208
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,340
And he only wants to hear what he wants to hear.

209
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm useless, right?

210
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,610
(You just love your dad very much and you don't want to let him down)

211
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,550
Continue to take care of me.

212
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,350
(Your leg has recovered)

213
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm still injured.

214
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,900
Here.

215
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,520
Here.

216
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,750
And it hurts a lot here.

217
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,630
(I need to go home to get my luggage first)

218
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,770
That's all for today's meeting.

219
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,710
Ken, remind the department in charge to keep an eye on the progress.

220
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes.

221
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,860
This is for you.

222
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,510
Thank you.

223
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,110
I hope you like today's tea.

224
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,080
It's great.

225
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,220
I like it very much.

226
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,950
(Meet me at 10:30 in Room 1213 at Ouyou Hotel)

227
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,940
Stay away from my subordinate.

228
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,480
He took the initiative.

229
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
That's it?

230
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,170
No punishment?

231
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,470
What I value is his competence.

232
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,710
Then you should change your attitude towards me.

233
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm very competent.

234
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,800
Indeed, you're competent.

235
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,530
But my attitude towards you is purely personal.

236
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,860
It has nothing to do with your competence.

237
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,930
By the way,

238
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,680
has your Little Boss recovered?

239
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,590
He really wants you to pretend to be Yang Zixiang

240
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,990
and work on behalf of him?

241
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,430
You are doing this intentionally, aren't you?

242
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,130
You know I hate green peppers.

243
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,760
(You promised me you'd listen to me)

244
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,250
Half, okay?

245
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,660
Are we brothers?

246
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,640
You love to hold grudges.

247
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,920
(We'll be if you eat all of them)

248
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,840
You know what I was saying?

249
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,060
You can read lips?

250
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
Then why did you use your smartphone?

251
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,880
My dad wants me to take over the family business.

252
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,220
(I dare not, and he only wants to hear what he wants to hear)

253
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,940
(My mom passed away a long time ago. Since I started to remember things...)
(Life is a schedule measured in hours)

254
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:39,980
(We weren't close back then, so I couldn't understand the way your mouth moves when you speak)
(It was hard to read your lips. But I'm used to it now. I can understand most of it)

255
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,530
When I talked about the job with you back then,

256
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,840
what I told Jonathan...

257
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
what I told Cheng Fengjie...

258
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,160
You're worried the person hired would be a leaker.

259
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,090
It's perfect that he can't hear us.

260
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,770
We'll be brothers after I eat all of them.

261
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,410
Can we be friends and brothers now?

262
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,860
Do you think I'm a kid?

263
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,850
Have you found the people who tried to assassinate Yang Zixiang?

264
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,250
Keep looking.

265
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,440
I'll pay attention to it in Taiwan.

266
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Give the knife back to me!

267
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,380
You again.

268
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,660
It was your first time killing someone, right?

269
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,630
You didn't even know how to choose the right time or place to do it.

270
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,160
It's none of your business!

271
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,580
Remember, don't make a sound when you attack from behind

272
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,480
to avoid being noticed by your target.

273
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,680
What you are doing now is really stupid.

274
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,590
Shut up!

275
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,200
But it's much better

276
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,600
than your sex skills.

277
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,040
Bastard!

278
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
I won't let you go.

279
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,170
I'll definitely outshine you!

280
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,840
In which aspect?

281
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,410
He's like an idiot.

282
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,640
Hello.

283
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Brother Dong.

284
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,590
I've found Yang Zixiang's special assistant.

285
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,580
I'll continue to follow him

286
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,840
and find Yang Zixiang.

287
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,020
Who sent you here?

288
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,610
Have you ever complained that you can't hear?

289
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,810
(Moments of seeing love)

290
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,930
(I'm sorry that I used you)

291
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:01,140
(No matter what the reason is, I can't justify using you. I'm sorry)

292
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,310
(I hope you can accept my apology and continue to take care of me)

293
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,400
(Please)
