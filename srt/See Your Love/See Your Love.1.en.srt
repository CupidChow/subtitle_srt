1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,961
If you want something, go and get it.

2
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,398
What do you want?

3
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:22,102
Guess.

4
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,856
(Love, Patience, Empathy)

5
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,392
(Recruitment)

6
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:30,576
(Jiang Shaopeng)

7
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,078
Mr. Jiang, I know
it's not easy to find a job

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,181
with your condition.

9
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:43,256
This job is about taking care of people.

10
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,550
(This is about taking care of people.
It'll be hard work, do you understand?)

11
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,553
If you are not satisfied,
you can switch me out.

12
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,356
You are the one
who's not satisfied. Jonathan.

13
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,624
You are sent here by my dad to follow

14
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,793
a boss who's all play and no work.

15
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:25,965
But as an employee,
you don't get to choose.

16
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:32,080
(Recruitment, no requirements. Looking
for care workers who want to join us.)

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,441
The boss has the right
to choose his employees.

18
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,843
Being a care worker
is a complicated job.

19
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,945
Our clients are old people.

20
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,182
We need to pay attention
to their conditions at all times.

21
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,350
We need to take good care of them
from every aspect.

22
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,385
Can you talk to your clients?

23
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,655
Can you answer a call from their family?

24
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,356
If you can't communicate with them,

25
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,791
it's pointless even if you go through
professional training.

26
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,827
(I've gone through professional training
with a degree.)

27
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,267
The most important thing about
taking care of someone is communication.

28
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,303
Do you understand?

29
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,273
Being provocative is not
a good way to communicate.

30
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:09,174
It's okay.

31
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,110
I don't wish to communicate
with you either.

32
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,171
A convoy to welcome us?

33
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:42,141
Get out.

34
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,215
Stop right there!

35
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,284
Stop right there!

36
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,019
Stop right there!

37
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:03,396
It's good enough that he doesn't have to
be cared for. How can he take care of anyone?

38
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,879
(I can't hear but I can see.)

39
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:29,272
(An equal and peaceful world for all.)

Both.

49
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:45,965
Leave the Yang to me.

50
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,199
The three of you,

51
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,300
chase after the other one.

52
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:49,869
Let's go!

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,081

Let go of me!

56
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,375
Stop right there!

57
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,011
Hurry up!

58
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,028
Only a coward hides when there's danger.

59
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,651
We need to face our enemies
if we are real men.

60
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,632
Don't push me.

61
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,884
Don't be such a busybody.

62
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:47,819
Are you listening to me?

63
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,188
Are you deaf?

64
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:50,923
Is he over there?

65
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,025
I won't hide like a coward.

66
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:37,703
Why are you laughing?

67
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,006
So what if you have big hands?

68
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:53,853
You better watch it!

69
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,441
Finally, I got the color off.

70
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,914
They say that the best view here
is the people.

71
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,218
But I was hunted down
as soon as I left the airport.

72
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,820
How is this place beautiful?

73
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,694
Get in.

74
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,763
It took you so long to find me.

75
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,832
Are you sure you are
the most capable assistant?

76
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,778
Weren't you fine just now?

77
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,081
Do you just remember
that you are injured?

78
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,821
What are you doing?

79
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,024
Let me down.

80
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,126
This is so embarrassing.

81
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:09,328
Let me down!

82
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,639
You really did it!

83
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,140
You are the one who asked me to do it.

84
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,209
I was just following your order.

85
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,784
Cheng Fengjie.

86
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:36,649
You are back.

87
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,222
Honey.

88
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,223
Are you okay?

89
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:46,458
Be careful.

90
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,292
Are you okay?

91
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,227
Be careful.

92
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,607
Get me out of here now.

93
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm exhausted.

94
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,388
It's your own fault.

95
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,390
I asked you not to go overboard.

96
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,825
You don't understand.

97
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,736
It's called the right ambiance.

98
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,660
You are just making trouble
for yourself.

99
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:29,728
Shaopeng.

100
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,571
Help me pull that down. I can't reach it.

101
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:36,176
Before that, give me a kiss.

102
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:38,111
Let him get to work.

103
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,310
Don't kiss him.

104
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,012
Don't you want to take off your makeup?

105
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,013
You look scary.

106
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,515
What nonsense are you talking about?

107
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:46,418
Do I look scary?

108
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,687
Do I?

109
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,455
Luckily,

110
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:53,659
our son is like me, not you.

111
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:58,430
You are a beautiful handsome man.

112
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:02,200
(I'm as handsome as my dad.)

113
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,336
(But I'm not as beautiful as my mom.)

114
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,872
Do you see that?

115
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,840
You should learn from him.

116
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,241
He's so sweet.

117
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:10,943
Roger that.

118
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,122
Let's eat steamed eggs tonight.

119
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,458
Did he fail his interview again?

120
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,260
I got to kiss him today.

121
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,996
Usually, he'll struggle.

122
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,056
(Shuhe: How did the interview go?)

123
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,466
(Shaopeng: I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the result.)

124
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:27,336
(Shupeng: How about you give me a hand?
I need more manpower recently.)

125
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,775
(Shaopeng: It's okay.
I can find a job myself.)

126
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:37,780
(Shuhe: Let's talk tonight.
I need to work. Bye.)

127
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:00,019
Don't overdo it.

128
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,721
Otherwise, how can I explain this
to the Chairman?

129
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:05,591
That's your problem.

130
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,426
All the best.

131
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,099
Your coffee, Mr. Yang.

132
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,800
The one in the wheelchair
is Mr. Yang Zixiang.

133
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:20,672
I'm sorry
that I didn't explain it clearly.

134
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:21,807
It's okay.

135
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,109
It's not the first time.

136
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,011
I'm Song Shuhe from
Hongcheng Construction.

137
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:29,581
I'm in charge of the development site
bidding, mall planning,

138
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:30,615
welcoming the two of you,

139
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:34,119
and taking care of the issues
that have been troubling you.

140
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:37,856
I never thought the person in charge
would be such a beautiful girl.

141
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:43,428
I've sent someone to find
a safe house for you.

142
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,963
Only the driver and I know the location.

143
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,032
I hope that you can keep it
a secret too unless necessary

144
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,366
for your own safety.

145
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,202
Those who attacked us are locals.

146
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,439
We are your business partner
for this mall construction project.

147
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,641
There's no need for us to do that.

148
00:14:58,277 --> 00:14:59,644
But maybe someone

149
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,213
targeted us instead

150
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,249
because they couldn't take you down.

151
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,253
There's no point in making
an unverified assumption.

152
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,922
I've sent someone to investigate
those who attacked you.

153
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,925
I'll inform you
once I have the information.

154
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,763
You are so cool.

155
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:21,866
Your driver is ready.

156
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,635
He'll send you there and show you around...

157
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:24,636
We will drive our own car.

158
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,572
You'll come with us too, right?

159
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:28,307
As our business partner,

160
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,642
it'll be nice for us
to spend more time together.

161
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,310
Am I right,

162
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,379
Young Boss?

163
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:44,173
(This is not bad. Registration form.
International Day of Sign Languages.)

164
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,999
This is your favorite steamed egg.

165
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,101
Eat more.

166
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
Shaopeng.

167
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,318
It's okay.

168
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:13,951
After this...

169
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,087
Let me tell you.

170
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,320
Finding a job is
like looking for a husband.

171
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,850
Take your time. There's no rush.

172
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:24,590
You proposed to me after
we were together for a month.

173
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:26,564
If you rush it,

174
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,500
you'll make the wrong choice.

175
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,203
Who said that she would marry
no one else but me?

176
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:37,475
There will always be choices.

177
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,110
You've just graduated.

178
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,245
You are still young.

179
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,681
There are many job opportunities
waiting for you.

180
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:46,918
(I know.)

181
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,954
(Don't worry about me.)

182
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,124
(I've prepared myself mentally
when I looked for a job.)

183
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:53,759
(I'm fine.)

184
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,090
Eat.

185
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,166
I can't believe you.

186
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,003
Why didn't you say anything
to comfort your son?

187
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,269
I was going to.

188
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,920
I said ten sentences and
you said only one sentence.

189
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,551
What can this family do without me?

190
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:14,207
Thank you, Honey.

191
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,080
You are fortunate to have me.

192
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,450
I'll rely on you after this.

193
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,084
This one.

194
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,220
Eat more.

195
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,887
You need to nourish your body
while you can.

196
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,920
You are going to lead another tour soon.

197
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,520
You should eat more too
to have the energy to look for a job.

198
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:35,600
Here.

199
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,024
I've shown you around.

200
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,792
- If you don't have any other questions...
- Ask him.

201
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:57,903
I'll get going now.

202
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,390
Where's the nearest bar?

203
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,920
The map will give you the answer.

204
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,430
Bye.

205
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,201
It's just a bone fracture.
Do you have to be in a wheelchair?

206
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:11,903
Holding a walking stick is too ugly.

207
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:14,463
This is more convenient
and I look imposing in it.

208
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:16,870
A wheelchair can't change your aura.

209
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,240
Be more serious.

210
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,899
You are the one
who should be more serious.

211
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,375
We came to Taiwan in secret
for business.

212
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,914
But we got into danger
as soon as we arrived.

213
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,615
And you are so unhappy to be with me.

214
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:25,918
I'm sad.

215
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,519
I'm not...

216
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:29,550
(Yes.)

217
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,232
(How did they find out about us?)

218
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:35,190
Help me take a shower.

219
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,766
(Can you talk? Can you answer
a call from their family?)

220
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,408
(The most important thing
is communication.)

221
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,214
What are you thinking?

222
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,483
A martial artist needs
to have a stable mind.

223
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:39,191
(That's what happened.)

224
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,293
(And then...)

225
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:43,929
And then what happened?

226
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,953
(At first, I wanted
to give him the middle finger.)

227
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,736
(But I stopped myself.)

228
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,350
You should've given him

229
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,380
two middle fingers.

230
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,660
Do you want to help me out at the dojo?

231
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,599
(I want to give it another try.)

232
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,470
(I want to find a job by myself.)

233
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,904
How did it go?

234
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,440
I'm sorry. He got away.

235
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,912
We are trying to find out
where he is right now.

236
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,430
Don't overdo it.

237
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,367
Something that you can do

238
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:42,630
with your two hands and 10 fingers.

239
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,100
Or...

240
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,069
Don't tell me that you are inexperienced.

241
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,740
You are too old to be inexperienced.

242
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,869
I'm an assistant.

243
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,687
Your personal life

244
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,656
is not a part of my job.

245
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,480
I don't have to help you with that.

246
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,580
I'll pay you.

247
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,424
Who do you think I am?

248
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,690
A money boy?

249
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,559
You are so petty.

250
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,130
I'll find a way myself.

251
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,099
Why is he angry?

252
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,800
He still has such
a hot temper at this age.

253
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,480
What's taking him so long?

254
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:40,949
Yes.

255
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,060
Finally, he's here.

256
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,330
You can use the other bathroom.

257
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,460
Come here.

258
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,184

Don't you understand? I won't hide...

284
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,100
Okay. Cut.

285
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:45,314
(Squeeze)

286
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,450
Get in.

287
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,219
