6
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,417
Good morning.

7
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,953
Did he just slam the door close
in front of me?

8
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,403
Yes.

9
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,252
(I don't want to be your care worker.)

10
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,254
Have I been rejected?

11
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,104
Yes.

12
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,222
You have been rejected.

13
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,097
- Forget it if he doesn't want to do it.
- No. I need a care worker.

14
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,666
You are afraid that our secrets
will get exposed if we hire someone.

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,316
He's deaf.

16
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,368
Perfect for the job.

17
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,953
No one will ask a deaf person
to be a corporate espionage.

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,005
I want him.

19
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,264
I don't have anything much but money.

20
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,265
I can give you a high salary,
food and accommodation provided.

21
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,118
You just have to be my care worker.

22
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,493
(No.)

23
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,629
Are you unsatisfied with the job or me?

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,271
You are quite heartless.

25
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,658
How about this?

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,511
If you become my care worker,

27
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,514
I'll recommend you to
the Xin'an Long-Term Care Center.

28
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,716
You marked it with five stars
on your memo.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,685
It's the place where you want
to work at the most.

30
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,769
I can do that for you.

31
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,256
Other than money,
I have a lot of friends too.

32
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,191
What do you think?

33
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,908
(No.)

34
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,049
He's not so easy to convince.

35
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,454
Is everything okay there?

36
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,191
Of course.

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,259
Yes.

38
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,694
You are right.

39
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,879
Yes. I've heard from Shuhe.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,399
He hasn't had any luck
in finding a job yet.

41
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,835
Of course I still worry.

42
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,038
Your son is back.

43
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,841
You are back.

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,458
You could've talked at home.

45
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,010
Why did you have to go out?

46
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,348
(I don't know him well.)

47
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,918
Your dad.

48
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,421
(Ask him to do his best
in the competition.)

49
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,224
Your son asked you to do your best
in the competition.

50
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,042
He said, "I got it. Thank you.".

51
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,062
(I'll go back to my room first.)

52
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,033
Yes.

53
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,275
Of course I still worry about him.

54
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,779
It wasn't easy for him to go through
his university studies. He put in so much effort.

55
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,182
The lecturers said
that he did very well too.

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,267
He even got
a professional certification.

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,385
But what happened in the end?

58
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,320
After he graduated,

59
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,223
who would've expected that he couldn't
find a job because he was deaf?

60
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,147
Okay now. I can't talk anymore.

61
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,966
I need to make dinner first.

62
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,169
Talk to you later. Bye.

63
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:08,240
(Recruitment)

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,409
Work.

65
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,847
Sure.

66
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,049
But first, let me eat.

67
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,923
Did you have to make it
sound so obscene?

68
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,175
I didn't.

69
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,610
I just woke up.

70
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,844
If you can't satisfy my appetite,

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,031
how can I satisfy your
inhumane workaholic tendency?

72
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,667
Someone who works diligently
won't die of hunger.

73
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,953
But most of them
will die from illnesses.

74
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,821
Jonathan.

75
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,075
I won't look handsome
if I get any thinner.

76
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,755
(Are you gangsters?)

77
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,592
As long as I can achieve my goal,
does it matter?

78
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,060
Young Boss.

79
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,032
We are not gangsters.

80
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,400
We are businessmen.

81
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,076
(Are you sure you can get me a job
at Xin'an Long-Term Care Center?)

82
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,627
I promise.

83
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,029
So, I have only one question for you.

84
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,614
Yes or no?

85
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,458
Then feed me first.

86
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,033
Let me show you around first.

87
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,407
This is the living room.

88
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,676
There's a public bathroom
on the right side.

89
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,846
The laundry room
is just beside the kitchen.

90
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:53,055
The second floor is like
what I showed you just now.

91
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,440
This is Young Boss's room.

92
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,926
Your room is on the second floor.

93
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,412
When I go out for work,
keep a close eye on him.

94
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,147
If he does anything fishy,

95
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,265
inform me at once.

96
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,108
(He is my boss.)

97
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,778
I'm the one who will be paying you.

98
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,789
I'm very easy to get along with.

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,724
You just have to remember one thing.

100
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,742
Do not enter my room

101
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,328
without my permission.

102
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,463
Even if you want to wake me up.

103
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,799
You can call me or knock on the door.

104
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,902
But you can't enter my room
without my permission.

105
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,079
(I need your health report
and food preferences.)

106
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,282
No problem.
I'll leave everything in your care.

107
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,656
You suddenly found a job where
you had to move in with your boss.

108
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,141
And you have to keep
the location a secret.

109
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,227
How can your dad not worry about you?

110
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,746
I'm not at home because
I'm leading a team to compete outside.

111
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,299
Of course I'm worried about you.

112
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,570
How's the person you are caring for?

113
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,942
(He gets hungry very easily.)

114
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,277
(His personality
is a little bit strange.)

115
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,731
(But he is paying me well.)

116
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,400
(And the articles in the contract
are reasonable too.)

117
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,369
(Don't worry.)

118
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,257
That's good. You can come home
if you can't get used to it.

119
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,925
Come home.

120
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,294
You can always look for another job.

121
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,330
Don't be so hard on yourself.

122
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,517
The whole family pays a lot of attention

123
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,569
to your performance in Taiwan, China.

124
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,520
Dad, I don't want to...

125
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,005
You are not allowed to fail!

126
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,376
If you fail, don't bother coming back.

127
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,411
Okay.

128
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:35,918
But won't he seem

129
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,522
too fragile if he comes home
because he faces some hardships?

130
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,872
You are right.

131
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,374
Then you should bully them back

132
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,793
before you come back.

133
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,477
Do as your dad says.

134
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,530
It's rare to see him
being such a baddie.

135
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,315
(I know.)

136
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,317
(You taught me before.)

137
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,071
(If someone upsets me,
I'll make their lives miserable too.)

138
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,909
But you have to take care
of his three meals.

139
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,627
How about I make the meals

140
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,047
and get them delivered to you?

141
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,599
(I have to keep the address a secret.)

142
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,702
(You taught me how to cook.)

143
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,203
(You need to have confidence in me.)

144
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,239
Look at your son.

145
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,525
He has surpassed you.

146
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,395
Watch your words.

147
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,631
Are you saying that my son
can cook better than me?

148
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:23,615
No.

149
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,749
That's not what I meant.

150
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,968
Honey, I...

151
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,037
Honey.

152
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,872
Honey.

153
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,926
Suddenly,
I want to drink a glass of juice.

154
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,648
What do you think?

155
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,550
The person I chose is not bad, right?

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,237
The standard of our three meals
has improved so much.

157
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,554
Our food is cooked to order.

158
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,656
We can ask for both hot drinks
and cold drinks.

159
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,724
He's not bad.

160
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,977
It's one of the rare times
when you make the right decision.

161
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,147
Young Boss.

162
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,582
Young Boss!

163
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,888
Jiang Shaopeng, what did you do?

164
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,795
Young Boss!

165
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,799
Yang Zixiang.

166
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,572
How is he?

167
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,980
Yang Zixiang!

168
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,267
The doctor said you did very well.

169
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,539
(It was my duty. What happened?)

170
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,808
He's allergic to kiwis.

171
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,412
How useless is he

172
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,415
to not know what he's allergic to?

173
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,159
(Is he going to expose me?)

174
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,413
I'll confirm it with the doctor

175
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,999
to see if he's allergic
to anything else.

176
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,374
I'm not that impressed
with this young boss.

177
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,809
But

178
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,378
thank you for saving him in time.

179
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,148
You are not bad.

180
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,066
Thank you.

181
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,710
(Pretending to sleep
is not a long-term solution.)

182
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,512
I need to live in the now.

183
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,114
One moment can become forever.

184
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,122
I will go to Kaohsiung with
Song Shuhe tomorrow

185
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,123
to scout at the site.

186
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,375
You can rest at home.

187
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,126
So...

188
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,678
Yang Zixiang?

189
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,914
Not many people know me
in Taiwan, China.

190
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,965
You can become Yang Zixiang.

191
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,633
If we

192
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,767
don't tell anyone about it

193
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,536
and ask Shuhe to keep it a secret,

194
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,021
everyone will be happy.

195
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,757
What else can I do?

196
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,882
I have a business trip tomorrow.
I'll be back at night.

197
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,268
I'll leave everything to you.

198
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:46,411
(You deliberately drank
Fengjie's juice.)

199
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,696
That's impossible.

200
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,382
A serious allergic reaction
can kill someone.

201
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,017
Even if I wanted to fake an illness
to take a sick leave,

202
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,068
I wouldn't risk my own life to do that.

203
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,970
I'm not that brave.

204
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,257
(Really?)

205
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,809
Of course.

206
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,999
Just do your job,

207
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
earn your money,

208
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,419
and take what you deserve.

209
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,022
Don't care about anything else.

210
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,508
After we failed last time,
Yang Zixiang went into hiding.

211
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,410
Hongcheng has been
very secretive about it too.

212
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,679
I'll send someone to investigate.

213
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,497
Yes.

214
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,518
I'll get it done.

215
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,490
I wouldn't have agreed
if I knew this would be so troublesome.

216
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,893
Qing.

217
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,648
Dong.

218
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,601
Find Yang Zixiang and take care of him.

219
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,571
Destroy the collaboration
between those two companies.

220
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,873
If you can do that,

221
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,878
I'll consider your debt paid off.

222
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,780
Then I'll give you a gang to lead.

223
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,186
He can lead a gang
if he gets rid of Yang Zixiang?

224
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,788
Who is Yang Zixiang?

225
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,924
Why is Dong offering so much
to take him down?

226
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,560
Xinjia.

227
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,961
Shut up.

228
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,130
Dong would kill me if he found out
that I eavesdropped on them.

229
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,231
Did you...

230
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,866
Yes.

231
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,468
What did you hear this time?

232
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,072
I've found a chance to prove myself.

233
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,675
If I succeed, I can be a gang leader.

234
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,714
I'll leave it to you
to take care of the house.

235
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,869
Be good.

236
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,122
What can I do when I can't even walk?

237
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,958
Have a safe journey.

238
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,823
Give me a glass of water.

239
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,649
I'm sorry.

240
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,034
I didn't do it on purpose.

241
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,176
Take your time.

242
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,928
You can take a shower.

243
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,914
I can eat by myself.

244
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,802
You are so fast.

245
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,381
(I just changed my pants.)

246
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,818
You are right.

247
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,821
(I should've asked for juice just now.)

248
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,065
(My distance from the door.)

249
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,073
It's just seven.
And you are drinking so much already.

250
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,141
It's too early.

251
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,993
The early bird catches the worm.

252
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,932
But there aren't many worms here.

253
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,202
There will be more worms after 10.

254
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,438
The important thing is not the quantity.

255
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,508
The important thing is,
will they catch my fancy?

256
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,447
This one is my treat.

257
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,247
Finally, I managed to leave.

258
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,116
Now, even if the project is a success,

259
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,018
it has nothing to do with me.

Yang Zixiang.

279
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,782
You didn't take good care of him.
