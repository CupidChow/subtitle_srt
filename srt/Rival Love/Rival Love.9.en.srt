00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,378
[Rival Love]
[EP09]

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,759
[Li!]

4
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,639
[My wedding dress is soaked.]

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
[I'm so cold!]

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,000
It's Su Qiping who forced me to kill you!

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,599
Don't blame me!

8
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,440
Miss Su Mei?

9
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,280
It's you!

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,760
No! No!

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,679
I was forced by Su Qiping!

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
[If he came back,]

13
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,559
[your family couldn't live anymore.]

14
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,199
[It's up to you.]

15
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,959
I was forced by him!

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,279
Definitely!

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,720
Is that all?

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120
You fired twice

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,400
on that day of the winter solstice.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,440
The first shot

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,800
went between my father's eyebrows.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
The second shot

23
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,639
hit Biyun in the heart.

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,199
No! It's impossible!

25
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,359
It's impossible!

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,559
On that day,

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,199
no one was around!

28
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,960
But I saw it!

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,240
My dad said

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,840
he's going on a treasure hunt.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,199
I followed him secretly,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,600
hiding and falling asleep.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,439
When I woke up...

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,680
[Give me!]

35
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,159
[Give me!]

36
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,359
[You...]

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,439
[Li!]

38
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:19,320
[You!]

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,079
[It's you!]

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
[Help!]

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,279
[Help!]

42
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,999
When I got home,

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,840
Su Qiping had become the head of the family.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,439
He said my father was shipwrecked.

45
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,600
I knew back then

46
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,680
that if I

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,719
were to tell the truth,

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,960
my mother, sister and I

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
wouldn't live to see tomorrow!

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,520
It's been ten years!

51
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,920
A blood debt

52
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,800
has to be paid by blood!

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,159
I won't kill you.

54
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,520
Get lost!

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Get out of the way!

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,120
Li.

57
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,159
Don't you want to catch up with me?

58
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,120
You...

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,080
[It's rare for Her Lady]

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
[to go to bed so early.]

61
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,200
[She hasn't even had bedtime soup.]

62
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,120
Poor girl.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,680
She's had such a hard life.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,479
She's been working hard,

65
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,039
but never been treated fairly.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,879
[Her mother never let go]

67
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,279
[of the past]

68
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,879
and couldn't

69
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,360
get close to her

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,960
'cause believing

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,159
[that]

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,879
[her father died]

73
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,599
[because of her.]

74
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,039
And she's also

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,719
changed a lot

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,719
to be heartbreakingly obedient.

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,479
Xi.

78
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,680
You go back and rest.

79
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,719
Yes.

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
It's here.

81
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,159
I was going to just kill you.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
But Su Mei stopped me.

83
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,000
I will do

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,479
as she says.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,880
But...

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,760
who are you, exactly?

87
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,400
[Sister, I'm not going to school!]

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,679
[Don't marry that asshole for money!]

89
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
[Don't worry, Mochen.]

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,119
[I won't marry him.]

91
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,239
[An old man just gave me]

92
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,679
[a lot of money,]

93
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,200
[and asked me to help him seek for treasure.]

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,679
[Now,]

95
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,039
[hide yourself.]

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,159
[When I come back,]

97
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,200
[you can go to]

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,599
[the best school in Yunjing!]

99
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,359
[Is that okay?]

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,359
[Really?]

101
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,400
[When did I ever lie to you?]

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,279
[Hooray!]

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,119
I am...

104
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm Biyun's brother.

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
Because of you,

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,000
my sister would never come back!

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
As expected,

108
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,760
it's you two who put on the big show.

109
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,560
[People think]

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,599
[Su Mei is old-fashioned]

111
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,359
[and doesn't care about anything outside.]

112
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,880
[In fact, she knows well of Western affairs,]

113
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,599
[and often travels to and from Yunjing.]

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,119
[Crescent Necklace?]

115
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,080
How?

116
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,119
[Jiu.]

117
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,640
[My mother left it to me.]

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,760
[Please accept it.]

119
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,119
[Why?]

120
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,400
[Because you saved my life!]

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,799
[When I become a great general,]

122
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,520
[I will come back for you!]

123
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,119
[The necklace is a token.]

124
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,440
[Okay.]

125
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,320
[I'll wait for you.]

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
She's really Jiu.

127
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,159
Father.

128
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,880
The man who killed you

129
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,080
is your favorite brother.

130
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,960
Mei.

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,479
Don't cry.

132
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,639
Father!

133
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:23,719
Mei.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,840
Father!
