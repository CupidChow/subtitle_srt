00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,159
[Any luck?]

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,320
[We've searched the city,]

5
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,679
[no sign of her.]

6
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,759
[Keep looking!]

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,119
[Let's go!]

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
[Several brides have died in the city.]

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,159
[Could it be that]

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,000
[Miss Su Luo was taken]

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
[by those spirits?]

12
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,759
[Nonsense!]

13
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:15,759
[Keep searching!]

14
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,679
[General He will come tomorrow.]

15
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,880
[If Miss Su Luo isn't found,]

16
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,439
[no one in this city will be safe!]

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,119
[Move!]

18
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,200
[Quick!]

19
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,400
What does General He want?

20
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,159
Su Luo is missing.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,959
As her sister,

22
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,400
you're surprisingly calm.

23
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,000
Whatever.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,480
She wasn't the one

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,439
I wanted to marry.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,120
There's someone over there.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,840
Over there.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,359
The head family is listening.

29
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,519
Act well.

30
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,680
I don't care if Su Luo

31
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,319
eloped or ran away,

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,480
I need an explanation!

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,039
What do you want?

34
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,759
Is Miss Su Mei inside?

35
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,199
Invitations have been sent out.

36
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,680
Everyone knows

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,800
that I'll marry a girl from the Sus.

38
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,360
If the engagement is broken off,

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,879
where will

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
my honor go?

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
My family can't afford that shame!

42
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,400
So,

43
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,960
either Miss Su Mei

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
or Miss Su Luo

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
must marry me.

46
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,000
Otherwise,

47
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,840
I won't

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
spare your family.

49
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,879
What if I refuse?

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
Then

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,120
don't expect me

52
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,319
to show any respect to the Sus!

53
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,560
Understand?

54
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:10,879
Move,

55
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,360
quickly!

56
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
Since Miss Su Luo

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,120
has run away,

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,639
Su Mei will marry me

59
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,439
in her place.

60
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,599
My Lady?

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
Sir, give it to me.

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,479
Where are you going?

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
The family think

64
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,960
I've eloped with you.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,919
I see.

66
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,080
This way, the Sus

67
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,479
will think the replacement marriage

68
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,879
is a last resort,

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
and they won't suspect

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
your sister in Su Qiping's death

71
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,039
or prevent her

72
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,400
from reclaiming your father's assets.

73
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,639
I came

74
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,680
to ask

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,439
if you'd go abroad

76
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,079
with me.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,839
Or,

78
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,319
I could go with you.

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
Aren't you afraid of me?

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,199
I told you,

81
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,079
I don't think you're a bad person.

82
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:57,879
Su Luo,

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,959
you deserve better.

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,279
The world is big.

85
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
I'll find my place in it.

86
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,319
I'm leaving.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,839
Feeling down?

88
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,360
Um...

89
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,199
What?

90
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,879
Can you leave me alone?

91
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,480
Wei Shiting turned you down?

92
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:12,959
Shut up.

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,560
Why are you laughing?

94
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't worry,

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
if any man rejected you

96
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,920
for breaking off the engagement...

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,839
What?

98
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,920
Are you saying

99
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,800
you'd marry me?

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
I suggest my sister say I eloped.

101
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:41,879
It saves

102
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,959
her trouble with the head family.

103
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm going abroad for years anyway.

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,480
No one wanting to marry me is perfect.

105
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,199
[More freedom!]

106
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,959
Su Luo!

107
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,759
This is for you.

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
What's this?

109
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,319
You'll need it while studying abroad.

110
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,879
Why?

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,240
I...

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,720
[Sir!]

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,639
The General is looking for you.

114
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,759
I think... you're great.

115
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,879
[He Zixiu is talking nonsense again.]

116
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,879
We...

117
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,000
You still have it?

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,959
Of course.

119
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
I've kept it with me

120
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,279
since you gave it to me.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,279
Su Mei,

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,319
thank you

123
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,920
for bringing light into my life.

124
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,199
And thank you

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
for bringing light into mine.

126
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,480
Why is it so quiet?

127
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,519
Maybe there's a power outage?

128
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,279
You idiot.

129
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,399
The General asked me to cut the power

130
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,959
to make his confession romantic.

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
We should all learn

132
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
from him well.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,680
Sir!

134
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,120
I've fixed the power!

135
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,399
You...

136
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:51,559
No wonder you can't get a wife!

137
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll sleep in the study tonight.

138
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,480
We're married now.

139
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,919
We should act like a normal couple.

140
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,759
A normal couple?

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,399
Like this?

142
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,399
If you want to.

143
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,759
If it were

144
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,799
any other man

145
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,120
in front of you now,

146
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,720
would you agree too?

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,519
Why do you always ask

148
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,480
such strange questions?

149
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,559
Su Mei,

150
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,279
you don't have to force yourself.

151
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm willing to wait

152
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
until

153
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,759
you love me.

154
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
What if I say

155
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,279
I've fallen in love with you?

156
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,399
Do you know

157
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,919
what happened to Miss Su Luo

158
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
who went missing

159
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,960
in her wedding dress after

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,679
several brides died?

161
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,080
♪The new bride,♪

162
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,039
♪the new bride,♪

163
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,240

♪She dreams beneath the river's tail.♪

166
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,879
That night,

167
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,919
she's wearing her wedding dress,

168
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
humming a sad tune on a boat,

169
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,559
and suddenly...

170
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,039
Guess what happened?

171
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,279
Sir!

172
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,879
You scared me.

173
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,879
What nonsense are you making up?

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,080
Be careful, or Miss Su Luo will sue you.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
C'mon,

176
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,679
just got back and already arguing?

177
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,720
So what?

178
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,360
If you don't like it, don't tag along.

179
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,399
I never said that.

180
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,480
It's getting late.

181
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,039
Your sister is waiting for you.

182
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh, yes.

183
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:08,840
Let's go.

184
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
Let's continue the story...

185
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,000
[Stop showing off,]

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,639
[hurry up!]

187
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,600
Don't move!

188
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,679
Please,

189
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,639
get ready!

190
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,000
Be careful.

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,919
Mrs. He,

192
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,799
happy birthday.
