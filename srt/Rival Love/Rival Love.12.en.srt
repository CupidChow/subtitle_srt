[EP12]

3
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,359
Mr. Su!

4
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:01,359
Due to multiple

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,759
murder cases occurred in town,

6
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,280
no one is allowed in

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,239
or out of the City.

8
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:07,840
We appreciate

9
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,600
your cooperation.

10
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,039
Deputy He,

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
I can't be

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,640
the murderer, right?

13
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,359
I have business to attend to in Yunjing.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,559
Please

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,519
make an exception.

16
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:33,559
Sorry, I can't.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,919
Report!

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,160
Sir,

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,519
we found the butler Li.

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,519
Mr. Su,

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,319
please go back.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,719
No need to look.

23
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,760
He's already dead.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
The soldiers said

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,240
he was screaming all night,

26
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,040
telling Biyun to stop talking.

27
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,600
He must have been hallucinating,

28
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,840
thinking Biyun was after him.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,159
He couldn't bear it and killed himself.

30
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,199
He got off easy.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll

32
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,799
handle the rest.

33
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,639
You...

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,120
Alright,

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,639
let's go.

36
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,879
[Father,]

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,159
[Biyun,]

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,319
[the butler Li has confessed.]

39
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,439
[I hope your spirits]

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
[can rest in peace.]

41
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,640
General He,

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,039
since I started down this path,

43
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,319
I won't stop.

44
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,319
You know what I mean.

45
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,999
Just let me go with you.

46
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,999
May I ask you a question?

47
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:24,800
Of course.

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,439
Last night,

49
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,159
you took good care of me when I was drunk.

50
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,559
Today,

51
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,759
you helped capture Li.

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,559
Why are you willing

53
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,999
to help me like this?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Su Mei,

55
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,200
you've prepared

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,800
so much for revenge,

57
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,719
aren't you tired?

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,999
In these war-torn times,

59
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,719
many people struggle just to survive.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,999
I can't complain about being tired.

61
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,360
I know

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,559
you're looking for the Necklace

63
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,319
to stay ahead in these

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,759
changing times.

65
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:17,800
That's right.

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,999
You're...

67
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,559
the leader of

68
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,319
the Eclipse, aren't you?

69
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,439
You seem to already know.

70
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm sorry

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,559
for using false information to lure you.

72
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,520
The Necklace

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,999
isn't in the city, right?

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,719
Back then,

75
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,439
Su Qiping killed my dad

76
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,520
before the treasure was found.

77
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,479
Even if

78
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,920
he hadn't been called over for the proposal,

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,400
he'd have come for trade routes.

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
I know.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,719
I had another reason

82
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,119
for calling you here.

83
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,039
Supported by the Eclipse,

84
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,400
I found out

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
his businesses are just a front.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,119
He actually

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,279
has caused many murder cases

88
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,760
behind the scenes.

89
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:18,400
Miss Su,

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
what is your intention?

91
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,760
He Jingyao,

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
how about we make a deal?

93
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,599
Su Qiping likes to carry his dirty money

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,799
in banknotes with him.

95
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,039
When done,

96
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,200
you can have them all.

97
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,000
Then your trip here

98
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,159
won't be in vain.

99
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,200
Then,

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,599
what do you want me to do?

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,159
Get engaged to Luo.

102
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,520
General He,

103
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:00,520
this is...

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,799
The murderer of the brides.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,840
Who is it?

106
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:06,960
Butler Li.

107
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,560
What?

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,799
How?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,599
He burned himself to death in guilt.

110
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,159
No further discussion needed.

111
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,039
Mr. Su,

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
since he was your servant,

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,960
you can handle his body.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,119
No wonder

115
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,119
he seemed off after the incident

116
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,840
at the dock days ago.

117
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,119
He always looked so honest.

118
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,159
Men indeed can't be judged by looks.

119
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:37,719
Sir,

120
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,960
since the murderer has been found,

121
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,919
can I leave the city now?

122
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,719
But you haven't agreed

123
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,119
to my marriage with Su Luo.

124
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,359
Why do you insist on marrying her?

125
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,640
No, I don't.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,200
Then, what do you think

127
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,599
of me marrying Su Mei?

128
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,599
Mei,

129
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,919
ignore that madman.

130
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,799
The boat is ready,

131
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,760
You can leave tonight.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
Now you're done using me,

133
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,239
you want to get rid of me.

134
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,599
Since I can find out

135
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,840
that you're Biyun's brother,

136
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,039
Su Qiping can do it too.

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,200
By then,

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,320
he'll definitely link

139
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,159
Biyun's connection with my father

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
and suspect you killed butler Li.

141
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,239
So you're worried

142
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:48,599
Su Qiping will come after me.

143
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,640
Live well from now on.

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,919
With your talents,

145
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
you don't need to be stuck here.

146
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Leave

147
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,599
and do what you truly want to do.

148
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,320
Let me stay and help you.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
[He Jingyao!]

150
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,200
I've made up my mind.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,760
I'll marry you.

152
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,119
But even so,

153
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
you won't have my heart.

154
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,840
As you wish.

155
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,000
I know,

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,520
if I don't marry you,

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
my sister has to do it.

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,599
She and Wei Shiting are well-matched.

159
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,799
I don't want her to sacrifice for me again.

160
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,919
Well-matched?

161
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,239
Don't worry,

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,599
I won't mess with Luo again.

163
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,640
She's just childish,

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,279
being

165
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,359
curious about me.

166
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,760
But General He

167
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,880
seems to have fallen deeply for you.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,799
Is that so?

169
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Men understand men best,

170
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,879
and

171
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
love making

172
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
other men jealous the most.

173
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,359
Where are you going?

174
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,440
Behave yourself,

175
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,399
Wei Shiting.

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Don't be rude

177
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
to disturb them.

178
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,800
Though I'll never love you,

179
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,920
since we're to be married,

180
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,399
I have to be by your side often.

181
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,560
From today on,

182
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,920
I will try to spend

183
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,960
more time with you.

184
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,999
Hopefully, we can become friends.

185
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,080
No need.

186
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,599
[Where are they?]

187
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,320
Sir,

188
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,999
the body has been examined.

189
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,440
He indeed died by suicide.

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,519
Many saw him acting suspiciously

191
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,519
at the dock,

192
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,119
so his suicide

193
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,440
makes sense.

194
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,320
No,

195
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,759
he had no reason to kill those brides,

196
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,800
and at the place

197
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,759
where Biyun died 10 years ago.

198
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
Is it possible

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,399
that Biyun was killed by him?

200
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,800
He told me that

201
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,119
he only killed Qi'an

202
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,599
and no one else was involved.

203
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,920
The shop on Greenstone Island

204
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,399
suddenly lost many orders to Zhen.

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,719
And Li died mysteriously.

206
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,599
I suspect someone

207
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,800
is targeting you.

208
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,280
For safety,

209
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,160
shouldn't you leave here for now?

210
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,560
What's the point of running?

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,680
Such being the case,

212
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,119
digging out the mastermind behind

213
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,399
makes it funnier.
