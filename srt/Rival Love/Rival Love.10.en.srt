[Rival Love]
[EP10]

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,359
Father!

4
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,280
Mei.

5
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,239
Father!

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,440
Father!

7
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:23,839
Father!

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
It's my fault!

9
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,479
I shouldn't have you go for treasure!

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,080
It's my fault!

11
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,479
Father!

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,519
Father!

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,599
I miss you!

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,559
[My daughter is the bravest girl!]

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,159
[Even braver than a man!]

16
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,039
Father,

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,159
wait for it.

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,879
Soon,

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,959
we'll be back home in Yunjing.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
But...

21
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,480
what a

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,319
long way

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,119
back home!

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
[Ten years ago,]

25
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,959
[Miss Su Mei was still a playful girl.]

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,160
[She wanted her dad to find treasure.]

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,679
[So he went to sea.]

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,559
[He didn't expect to be shipwrecked.]

29
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,480
[From then on,]

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,439
[her mom couldn't]

31
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,439
[get close to her.]

32
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,040
[And she's also]

33
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,959
[changed a lot]

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
[to be heartbreakingly obedient.]

35
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,080
[It's rare for Her Lady]

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,439
[to go to bed so early.]

37
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,800
[She hasn't even had bedtime soup.]

38
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,480
[Poor girl.]

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,920
[She's had such a hard life.]

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,119
Jiu.

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm too late.

42
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Where is he?

43
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't worry.

44
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,040
He's still alive.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,119
He'll live the rest of his life here.

46
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,679
It's worse than death.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,160
You stopped me from killing him.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,679
I don't know it's because you're soft,

49
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,160
or you're callous.

50
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,320
Not kind, after all.

51
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,320
[Shut up!]

52
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,320
[Shut up!]

53
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,439
[It's Su Qiping!]

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,640
You should blame Su Qiping!

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
It's his fault!

56
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:55,880
Shut up!

57
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,959
[Shut up!]

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,439
[You should blame Su Qiping!]

59
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,119
Here.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,279
Let's celebrate.

61
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,999
[Shut up!]

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
[It's his fault!]

63
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
[It's his fault!]

64
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,840
[Shut up!]

65
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,239
What?

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,559
Afraid I'll poison you?

67
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,600
[You should blame Su Qiping!]

68
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,439
General.

69
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,400
It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

70
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
Miss Su Mei hasn't returned yet.

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,600
Neither has Li.

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,079
Su Qiping is the only one in the mansion.

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,600
You can leave now.

74
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,520
Yes.

75
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,999
Sir, you're right.

76
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,559
Wei Shiting is a pseudonym.

77
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,679
Before he came to Crescent City,

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
he's a famous prodigal son in Yunjing.

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,360
Shen Mochen.

80
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,400
For his knowledge of photography

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,040
and foreign languages,

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,920
he was a favorite among the rich ladies.

83
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,160
Biyun was his sister,

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,400
and was killed while salvaging

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Crescent Necklace for Su Qi'an.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,119
I think,

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,639
Su Mei is working with him.

88
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,960
He probably knows about the treasure, too.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
That's my biggest concern right now.

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm afraid he's with Su Mei right now.

91
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,480
She's in danger!

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,079
What's next for you?

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,559
This is the end of our partnership.

94
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,559
You don't have to worry

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,319
about what happens after this.

96
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,160
Su Qiping is also my enemy.

97
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
I don't want Luo to have anything

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
to do with this.

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
Leave here as soon as you can.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
What?

101
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,520
Am I not good enough for you sister?

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,360
Or am I too flirtatious?

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,119
After my sister's death,

104
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
the bully who was going to marry her

105
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,400
took everything of value

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
from our house.

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,079
He wanted me to do hard labor for him.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
The Su's head family

109
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,280
is as shameless as this.

110
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,079
After I escaped,

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,879
I was going to commit suicide.

112
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,280
But I was saved.

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,199
Years later,

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,960
I've finally made it to the top.

115
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,239
I found out that it's Su Qi'an

116
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,639
who came to Crescent City for treasure.

117
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,879
So you came back here,

118
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,280
making your way to Su mansion

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,679
to investigate the truth of...

120
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:48,639
Su Mei.

121
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:50,679
Hello?

122
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,319
Su Mei!

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
What did you do to her?

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,079
General!

125
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,639
You...

126
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,119
Sit down!

127
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,840
Take him!

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,920
How is she?

129
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Is she poisoned?

130
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,920
She is...

131
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,239
What?

132
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,639
She's just drunk!

133
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,040
Are you sure?

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,559
If you still worry about her,

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll make some hangover soup.

136
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,239
Xi.

137
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,759
Water.

138
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,079
Xi.

139
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:52,759
Zixiu.

140
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,079
See the doctor out.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,400
Water!

142
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:57,999
This way.

143
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,999
Water!

144
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
Xi.

145
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,439
Your shoulder is so stiff.

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,839
Get some rest.

147
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,839
General?

148
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,319
You're awake.

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,959
You were drunk.

150
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,199
Your clothes were changed by Granny Wang.

151
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll send you back tomorrow.

152
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,359
I did drink.

153
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
It was so sweet.

154
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,319
Of course.

155
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,319
It's sweet.

156
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,760
Get some rest.
