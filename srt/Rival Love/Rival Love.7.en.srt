3
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,560
Cousin Mei!

4
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,370
Cousin Mei, where have you been?

5
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,290
We couldn't find you anywhere

6
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,440
after this horrible thing.

7
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,240
If I hadn't been here,

8
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,530
everyone in the city would go mad.

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,530
I appreciate it.

10
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,530
How did you end up like this?

11
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,080
That's why I always say

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,280
that women can't be in charge.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,560
When people are expecting you...

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,720
She was with me.

15
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,890
Cousin Mei.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
You two, in the middle of the night...

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,360
General.

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,770
Here.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,130
Exactly the same.

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,680
Li.

21
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,890
What's wrong with you?

22
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you okay?

23
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,370
I'm fine.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,450
I'm fine.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,760
Where's the forensics?

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,010
They are on their way.

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,320
With General He in the city,

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,200
I feel much more relieved.

29
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,170
Father!

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,090
I heard from Li that tomorrow is

31
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,890
Uncle Qi'an's death anniversary.

32
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,370
Why are you asking?

33
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,600
It's such an unlucky time,

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,890
combining with all of these.

35
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,200
I've heard if one dies in red,

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,760
they'll become a devil!

37
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,090
I just heard people say

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
that ten years ago,

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,890
a bride also died.

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,090
And

41
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,450
They also said

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
the murder in the boat

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,840
was by the devil of the previous dead bride!

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,810
Don't be paranoid.

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,570
Li.

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,450
You find out

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,680
where Su Mei and He Jingyao

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,650
have been tonight.

49
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,450
Li!

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,890
Yes!

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Here.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,410
Why?

53
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,410
Your face.

54
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,800
Did I just meet people with this face?

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,250
Why didn't you tell me?

56
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,250
This must have something to do with Biyun.

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,480
The murder could avoid soldiers' patrols

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,450
to set up the scene,

59
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,250
which means they are familiar with the city.

60
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,600
What about the one who trapped us?

61
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,600
Did they trap us

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
so we couldn't be the first

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
to find the bride, nor could we

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,520
keep to ourselves like before?

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,410
That's right.

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,690
They did this just to make sure

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,600
that everyone in the city would know this.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
Biyun.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Did she still have family in the city?

70
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,970
Tomorrow I'll send my men

71
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,410
to ask the elders in the city.

72
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,690
They should know something.

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
You scraped it when you were helping me.

74
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
It's alright.

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,800
Don't move.

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,970
Don't misread it.

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,690
I just don't like to owe people.

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,410
If you really appreciate me,

79
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,450
can you withdraw the troops,

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,080
bringing back our peace?

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,040
No.

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,600
How did you know

83
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,040
that Lao Gong point can relieve me?

84
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,760
Mei.

85
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,450
Here is Lao Gong point.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,600
Later,

87
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,760
if you get scared,

88
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,320
but I can't be there with you,

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,930
just press it,

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,250
and you won't be afraid any more.

91
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,640
I am so brave!

92
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,050
I won't be scared!

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,050
Yes!

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,370
My daughter is the bravest girl!

95
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,050
Even braver than the men!

96
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,810
Miss Su.

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,010
Could you please tell me

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,280
how did you know about Lao Gong point?

99
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
No.

100
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,610
I can see

101
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,010
there are many secrets in you.

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,490
It's getting late.

103
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,640
We can talk about the case after I ask people around.

104
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,640
General.

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,450
She...

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,810
How do you think of her?

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,320
She's composed.

108
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,280
Cool-headed.

109
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,370
She has managed Crescent City

110
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,520
to become what it is today

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,490
in just a few years.

112
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,200
She should be clever and sophisticated.

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,450
Right.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
She's so different from the girl I knew.

115
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,890
She shouldn't be that girl.

116
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,810
The girl?

117
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,370
What girl?

118
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,810
The girl who once saved my life.

119
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,160
When I was a child,

120
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,400
I was once kidnapped by my father's enemies.

121
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,490
I was left in wasteland and nearly died.

122
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,840
I was lucky that she found me.

123
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,050
And then,

124
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,450
she took me home and took after me,

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,050
until my father's men found me.

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,010
What,

127
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
what is your name?

128
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,720
Jiu.

129
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,720
My name is Jiu.

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
Later on, I went back, trying to find her.

131
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,840
But she's already moved out with her family.

132
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,010
I presume "Jiu" was a pseudonym.

133
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,810
Maybe it's her father's suggestion.

134
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,200
He's afraid of getting into trouble

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,890
just because they had saved me.

136
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,690
General.

137
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,050
In my opinion,

138
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,050
this Miss Su

139
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,810
is not the girl you are looking for.

140
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,450
According to what you said,

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
this Jiu was adorable,

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
kind and smart.

143
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,610
But Miss Su...

144
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,200
She

145
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,960
I don't think she's that Jiu.

146
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,010
Well,

147
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,200
how do you think where Jiu is now?

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Maybe the forensics need this.

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,050
Take this.

150
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm sure the light can comfort you.

151
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
Miss Su Luo!

152
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
Miss Su Mei knows you love picture books.

153
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
She asked me to buy these for you

154
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,010
from the Tomato Bookstore.

155
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,010
I know she loves me!

156
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,250
By the way,

157
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,450
have you heard about

158
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,400
the dead bride in red wedding dress,

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,250
found in a boat last night?

160
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,200
Miss Su Mei has specially exhorted

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,130
that you shouldn't go out at night recently.

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,890
There's,

163
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,200
there's a dead bride in a boat?

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Yes.

165
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
There's been troubles in town lately.

166
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,810
We can't be too careful.

167
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,810
Miss Su Luo?

168
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,400
Where are you going?

169
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,760
What brings you here?

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
Someone rose to the bait.

171
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,080
Well done.

172
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,130
Who is it?

173
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,450
Li, the butler.

174
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,450
I knew it had something to do with Su Qiping.

175
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,560
I suggest you hold back right now.

176
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,610
What?

177
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
Are you worried I would kill them now?

178
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,610
The head family is on the way.

179
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,010
The one who killed your sister

180
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,680
must be one of them.

181
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,730
He's one of Su Qiping's men.

182
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,680
You could just tie him up.

183
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,680
Why did you kill him?

184
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,370
Miss Su.

185
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,210
You were the bait.

186
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,640
You wouldn't like to be bitten.

187
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,160
Besides,

188
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,970
he's one of the scum.

189
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,130
It's completely justified.

190
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,210
Dump his body on the dock.

191
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,730
No one would suspect us.

192
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
A lightning bolt pattern on the neck.

193
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,440
A crossbow wound to the chest.

194
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,440
It's estimated

195
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,640
he bled to death at 1 to 3 last night.

196
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,640
You've always been so soft.

197
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,800
Don't tell me you dare not take revenge

198
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,400
even though you long for it?

199
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,400
Mr. Wei.

200
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,400
I choose to cooperate

201
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,850
just to avenge my father's death

202
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,010
and to protect the townspeople,

203
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,490
not for you to slaughter whoever you want.

204
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
Wei Shiting!

205
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,210
It's Su Luo.

206
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,250
She mustn't see me here.

207
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,210
Wei Shiting!

208
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,130
Wei Shiting!
