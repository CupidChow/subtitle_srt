[Rival Love]
[EP08]

3
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,440
Wei Shiting!

4
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,119
Wei Shiting!

5
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:27,719
How?

6
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,559
She mustn't know any of these.

7
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,679
You protect her so well,

8
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,440
from all the dirty deed.

9
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,319
You think she would thank you if she knows?

10
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:02,679
It's none of your business.

11
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,119
After the work is done,

12
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,440
you keep away from Luo.

13
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,880
What about you?

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,199
Can I see you again?

15
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,599
I don't think it is necessary.

16
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,319
The two brides didn't die

17
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,199
from the same cause.

18
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,520
One was drowned.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,560
The other hanged herself.

20
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,759
We can't identify

21
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,000
if it's the same murderer.

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,360
Did you find the source of the rhyme?

23
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,640
The nursery rhyme is "The New Bride".

24
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,080
It's quite popular among kids of Crescent City.

25
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,679
What about Biyun?

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Did she have family?

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
She had a little brother.

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,000
But after Biyun's death,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the brother died as well.

30
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,000
Died?

31
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:57,479
Did you find out who's behind Eclipse?

32
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,280
We should have results soon.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,679
Su Qiping recently

34
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,800
deployed additional manpower in town

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,839
to search for Crescent Necklace.

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Shouldn't we speed up?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
We don't need to.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,240
From now on,

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,599
we can search the city under the excuse

40
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,160
of searching for the murder.

41
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:17,880
We won't be left behind.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,519
By the way,

43
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,240
is there anything strange

44
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,000
about Su Mei's recent track record?

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,039
No.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,720
Today is Su Qi'an's death anniversary.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,079
The Su family should all go visiting the cemetery.

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
I've sent my men to Su mansion for secret rooms.

49
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,039
Today is the winter solstice.

50
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,240
It's on the same day

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
that Biyun and Su Qi'an died.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,079
Qi'an!

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
I come here to visit you.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,000
Mother.

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Don't worry.

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,680
I'll take care of your wife and daughters.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,840
[Father, please be patient.]

58
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
[I'll make these hypocrites]

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
[suffer from the karma.]

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,880
General.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,039
We've found it.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,599
The one behind Eclipse

63
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,039
is Su Mei.

64
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
Su Mei established Eclipse

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,039
when she was 18.

66
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,600
After few years,

67
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,839
it has become the largest information agent.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
The case of The Brides.

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
All the things show connections

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,880
to Biyun's case ten years ago.

71
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,959
Biyun and Su Qi'an.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
They both died on winter solstice

73
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,399
ten years ago.

74
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,519
They two

75
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,839
might be related.

76
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,639
The man in black on the beach,

77
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,040
and the man in black at Su Qian's grave.

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,120
They were Su Qiping's men,

79
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,839
searching for Crescent Necklace.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
The necklace

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,480
contains the secret of treasures.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,159
The information was from Su Mei's Eclipse.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,319
She's tempting you and Su Qiping

84
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,399
to come to the city!

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
That's right.

86
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,279
But what is she trying to do

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
by setting up such a big game?

88
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,560
Revenge.

89
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,159
[Wei Shiting.]

90
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,959
[Do you have anything]

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,079
[to do with the case of The Bride?]

92
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Why don't you come in?

93
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,880
I...

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,159
You look terrible.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,199
Bad sleep?

96
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you know there was a dead bride on the dock?

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
So?

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
Do you suspect that I killed her?

99
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
Silly!

100
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,040
How could I kill?

101
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,159
Hocus pocus!

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Heaven and Spirits!

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Please protect me!

104
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,399
[Master Su!]

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,240
[Biyun!]

106
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,800
[Please don't blame me!]

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,839
[Don't blame me!]

108
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,560
[Don't blame me!]

109
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,120
General He.

110
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,079
The case of The Brides.

111
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,040
You are involved, aren't you?

112
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,480
Miss Su Mei.

113
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,240
You don't deny it.

114
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,040
I don't have to explain to you

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,440
the things you've already decided.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Su Mei.

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,279
What are you trying to do

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,040
with the fuss of this case?

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,440
I don't know what you are talking about.

120
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,440
Please let go of me.

121
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,519
I'm going for dinner.

122
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,079
[Why don't we go together?]

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,199
Mei.

124
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,199
Any luck

125
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,480
on the case of The Bride?

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,639
No.

127
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,319
There's been a lot of trouble

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,199
in the city lately.

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,079
You must be terrified.

130
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,600
Thank you for your concern.

131
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
I can handle it.

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,079
Thanks to General He!

133
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,480
I have heard,

134
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,639
before the dead bride we found last night,

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,639
another bride

136
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,000
was found dead there.

137
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,240
Another one?

138
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Yes.

139
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
Another bride was found dead

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
in the storm before.

141
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,399
Miss Su and I

142
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
keep the information from the public

143
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,440
to avoid panic.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,040
But I wonder, since I've blocked the news,

145
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,199
Mr. Su,

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,399
how do you know it?

147
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,279
I heard it from a fisherman.

148
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,920
I thought it was just nonsense.

149
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,600
I didn't think it was true.

150
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,360
Two dead brides.

151
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,120
Is it possible

152
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,480
the bride from ten years ago

153
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
is back for revenge?

154
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,000
What's her name?

155
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,440
Bi...

156
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,320
Biyun.

157
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,080
What happened?

158
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

159
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,880
Are you alright?

160
00:09:58,439 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

161
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:05,960
Miss.

162
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,439
The rainstorm might

163
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,639
have damaged the cables.

164
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,679
The whole city is out of power.

165
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,080
General.

166
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,519
I'm sorry

167
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,960
that I can't serve you a proper dinner.

168
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,679
I'll walk you out.

169
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,240
I know you have many doubts.

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,679
But it's not the time to talk.

171
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,200
Later,

172
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
I'll explain everything to you.

173
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,439
Besides,

174
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,240
would you please help me

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
get Su Xue out of here for a minute?

176
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
Why are you following me?

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,399
Please don't misunderstand me!

178
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,000
I just want a chance

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
to talk with you.

180
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,159
I've heard you returned from abroad.

181
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,200
So?

182
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,159
I also just returned from study abroad.

183
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm sure

184
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,840
you and I

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
have a lot in common.

186
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,039
From now on,

187
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,799
stay away from me.

188
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,240
Biyun!

189
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,720
Biyun!

190
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm here to visit you!

191
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,600
It's not my fault back then!

192
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,080
Biyun!

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
