[Rival Love]
[EP15]

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
How are you?

4
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,440
Feeling

5
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,840
better now?

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,519
I didn't expect you

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,360
to have such a gentle side.

8
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,319
It depends.

9
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,800
Thanks.

10
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,279
Let's hurry back.

11
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,439
General, you don't allow others to leave the city,

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,480
but where did you go with Mei?

13
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Do I need to explain

14
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,040
where I went

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,199
and what I did to others?

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,760
I didn't mean it.

17
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,999
Please forgive me.

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
Before Qi'an passed away,

19
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,600
he entrusted Mei and the family to me.

20
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,600
Mei,

21
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,840
where have you been

22
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,799
all day with General He?

23
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,279
I invited Miss Su out.

24
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,719
Uncle,

25
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,400
General He and I went to Greenstone Island.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,279
General He came

27
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,240
to propose to Luo,

28
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,680
but it was postponed

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,960
due to the ongoing troubles in the city.

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,799
So the General asked me

31
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,639
to go to the market with him

32
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,400
to buy an engagement gift for Luo.

33
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,279
Luo always likes Western items,

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,879
but she's already shopped

35
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,400
through Crescent City's stores,

36
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,640
so we went outside

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,159
to pick something for her.

38
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,879
Such being the case,

39
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
why didn't you tell us earlier?

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,039
We wanted to surprise Luo,

41
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,240
so we kept it a secret.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,200
We thought

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,599
being out for half a day wouldn't be a problem,

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,719
but didn't expect you

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,719
to worry so much.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,599
Xi,

47
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,759
take these things

48
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,960
to Luo's room.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,719
Yes.

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,599
Ms. Zhang, help out.

51
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,200
General, you're so considerate.

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,439
I think

53
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
we should set the wedding date

54
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,400
for you and Luo.

55
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,039
Please have tea.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,719
Recently,

57
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,240
there have been constant troubles here.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,039
I feel like

59
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,759
someone is deliberately targeting us.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,719
Sir,

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,159
do you suspect me?

62
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,599
Of course not.

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,999
Then what are you trying to say?

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
You came to the Crescent City

65
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,759
for the Crescent Necklace, right?

66
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,879
You are well-informed.

67
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,279
To be honest, General,

68
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,240
my younger brother died in a shipwreck

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,759
while searching for that necklace.

70
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,520
For years,

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,879
I've always thought

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,039
if I could find the necklace,

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,680
it would be closure for Qi'an.

74
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,279
General,

75
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,879
since we're both

76
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,559
looking for the necklace,

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,319
why not cooperate?

78
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,439
Why should I cooperate with you?

79
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,960
Once Luo marries you,

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
we'll be family.

81
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,599
I'll use all my resources

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,159
to help you find the necklace.

83
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,000
If we're lucky enough to find it,

84
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,400
the treasure will naturally be yours.

85
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,080
I just hope

86
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,599
that when you succeed,

87
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,840
you won't forget the Su family.

88
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,359
About the engagement banquet...

89
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,679
It's up to you.

90
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,200
He Jingyao is insane,

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,440
buying such expensive shoes.

92
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,760
I don't like white ones.

93
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,080
Mei,

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,840
you weren't home last night.

95
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,400
A masked person went to your study

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,440
and I ran into him.

97
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
Were you hurt?

98
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,960
Don't worry,

99
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm fine.

100
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,960
Last night, I wanted

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,679
to shout and wake everyone up

102
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,880
to catch that person,

103
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,239
but Wei Shiting stopped me.

104
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,400
Mei,

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,159
what are you and Wei Shiting

106
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,880
hiding from me?

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Mother,

108
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,080
what are you doing?

109
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,599
Why are you hitting her?

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Luo,

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,400
go out.

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,599
You promised not to marry Luo off far away,

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,200
why did you

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
go with General He to choose an engagement gift?

115
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,239
Mother,

116
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,159
please let me explain, I...

117
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,279
I entrusted this family to you,

118
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,880
not to let you

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,840
be bullied by others again and again.

120
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,479
What's on your mind

121
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,080
to send Luo away?

122
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Mother,

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,599
I'm willing to marry him.

124
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,359
It has nothing to do with Mei.

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,599
You don't want a father,

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
you don't want a sister,

127
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,440
it seems you don't

128
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,679
want this family at all.

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,760
Mei,

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
I'll go talk to Mother.

131
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,039
Why are you sitting here alone?

132
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,520
How many spies do you have

133
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,640
around me?

134
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:21,760
No,

135
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,960
I just wanted to...

136
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,479
Do what?

137
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,880
To see what trick I'm up to next?

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
Waiting for me to slip up

139
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
or seeing me humiliated?

140
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,679
Now that you see it,

141
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,400
are you happy?

142
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,080
What happened to your face?

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,159
It's nothing.

144
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Su Qiping has talked to you, I guess.

145
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,599
Mrs. Su hit you?

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,479
That's my business,

147
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,359
nothing to do with you.

148
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,080
Su Mei,

149
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,279
crying will make you feel better.

150
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,119
Too bad

151
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,840
I can't cry.

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,759
When I was little,

153
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,040
my mother told me

154
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,599
to make a wish to the stars

155
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,639
whenever I'm sad.

156
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,879
Among so many stars,

157
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,719
one will

158
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,080
hear your wish.

159
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,440
General, having fought many battles,

160
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,800
you'd believe in fairy tales?

161
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,759
Because it did

162
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,399
grant me a wish.

163
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,519
Really?

164
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,239
[They helped me find you.]

165
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
You said,

166
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,599
when one is sad,

167
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,280
should make a wish to the stars.

168
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
I just made a wish,

169
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,359
why didn't it come true?

170
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,639
Your wish

171
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,040
is...

172
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
To go ten years back.

173
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,359
Why don't you tell

174
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,960
Mrs. Su and Su Luo the truth?

175
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,080
Me alone falling into the abyss is enough.

176
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,800
Mother is frail

177
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,960
and can't handle any shock,

178
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,800
as for Luo...

179
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,960
I want her

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
to stay innocent and happy.

181
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,239
Isn't that good?

182
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,399
Besides,

183
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,560
I asked Father to set sail that day,

184
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,399
so I should bear all of this.

185
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,160
Su Mei,

186
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,879
your father's death

187
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,960
wasn't your fault.

188
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,999
Surprise,

189
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,879
you can comport people.

190
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,040
Su Qiping had long held murderous intent

191
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,160
to seize the family head position.

192
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,239
Whether your father went to

193
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,599
treasure hunt that day or not,

194
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,800
he would have acted.

195
