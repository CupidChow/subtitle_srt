[EP20]

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,880
Luo?

4
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,599
It's so late. What's wrong?

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,199
Uncle,

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
Mei hasn't

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,559
come back yet.

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,120
Till now?

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,000
Xue,

10
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:09,879
wake up

11
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,039
the servants

12
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,120
to find her now.

13
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,600
We must ensure her safety.

14
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,679
Yes, father.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
When did you recognize me?

16
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,120
When you told me

17
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,160
the Lao Gong point at the old house,

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,279
when I saw the necklace

19
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:40,559
I gave you in the secret chamber,

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,959
and when you

21
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,040
gave me the light.

22
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,879
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

23
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,559
I'm afraid...

24
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,840
you've forgotten me.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,359
How could I?

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,799
I just never thought

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
we'd meet again.

28
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,600
Su Mei,

29
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:17,760
you've endured so much

30
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,799
all these years.

31
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm afraid Su Qiping

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,719
already knows my plan.

33
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,999
Finding his banknotes

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,919
will be incredibly difficult now.

35
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm sorry

36
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,799
for getting you hurt

37
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,960
and sending you back empty-handed.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,639
It's all right.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
There's no such thing as a dead end.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,999
If no way out,

41
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,719
forge a new one.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
What did you say?

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
While fishing, I did see

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,719
Miss Su Mei and a man

45
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,200
fall from the cliff into the sea.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,279
With such strong winds and waves,

47
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,599
I'm afraid they...

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Mother!

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,759
It can't be...

50
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,559
[Wu,]

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,520
[I will burn extra paper money for you.]

52
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,960
You don't need

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,520
to make an effort to win my heart.

54
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,120
[Su Mei,]

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
[how can I]

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,159
[make you]

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,200
[truly trust me?]

58
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:55,759
You're awake?

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Thanks to you,

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,999
last night was the best sleep

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,200
I've had in years.

62
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,520
Qi'an,

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,960
I hope your spirit in heaven

64
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,640
watches over Mei and keeps her safe.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Mother,

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,120
she will be all right.

67
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,039
She has worked so hard

68
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,319
for this family,

69
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,200
and I've been so harsh on her.

70
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,800
I've treated her

71
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,719
like a boy all these years,

72
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,559
not because I don't love her,

73
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:48,840
but because I know

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,439
my health is falling,

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,800
and our family needs a backbone.

76
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,120
Mother,

77
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,200
why didn't you explain this to her?

78
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,159
All of you,

79
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,559
the family,

80
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,719
and the City needs her.

81
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,400
But it's been so unfair to her.

82
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,719
The more she endures,

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,560
the more my heart aches.

84
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,880
This is the book

85
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,200
your sister loves to read.

86
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:31,760
Get out of my way!

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,359
He Zixiu...

88
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,640
my sister...

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,239
was probably killed by Su Qiping!

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Where's He Jingyao?

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,919
Didn't he say he liked my sister?

92
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,159
Get him

93
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,599
to find her!

94
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,200
Don't cry, okay?

95
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,599
You're right,

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
I shouldn't cry.

97
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,159
I need to be strong

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
and avenge my father and sister.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,919
But how can I get revenge?

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
You sure know how to cry.

101
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,159
Can you let me finish?

102
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,640
Your sister is right behind you.

103
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,479
Luo.

104
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,719
Mei!

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,560
It's okay,

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,359
I'm fine.

107
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't cry.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,320
General,

109
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,119
the men in black have all been captured.

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,239
They confessed

111
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,440
to helping Su Qiping with his schemes

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,919
over the years.

113
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,520
It's time to end this.

114
00:06:58,599 --> 00:06:59,440
Congrats!

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,159
You're the master of the City.

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,799
You did well this time.

117
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,599
In the past,

118
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,640
I was too harsh on you.

119
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
I can share your burdens, father.

120
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,400
Send a letter to the head family,

121
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,599
saying Su Mei drowned by accident.

122
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:19,719
Yes.

123
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,279
What I have,

124
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,479
I won't deprive you of, Xue.

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Thank you, father.

126
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,840
Wu?

127
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,080
Sir.

128
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,599
What happened?

129
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,440
I fought with Su Mei over the Necklace

130
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,919
and fell into the water with her.

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,400
Is this the Necklace?

132
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,520
It really has a treasure map.

133
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,479
Qi'an,

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,880
what you risked your life searching for

135
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:04,239
has ended up in my hands.

136
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,560
Wu,

137
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,279
see where this is.

138
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,159
Beneath the Changming Pavilion.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
You can row a boat in from the sea.

140
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:15,760
Fancy!

141
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,919
There's no time to lose,

142
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,840
let's go now.

143
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:21,719
Xue,

145
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,159
wait here

146
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,200
for us to return with the treasure.

147
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,200
Yes!

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Wu,

149
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,080
I've treated you like my son ever since

150
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,479
I brought you out of the mass grave.

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,359
Now,

152
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,000
you're the only one left by my side.

153
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,599
Once we find the treasure,

154
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,200
we'll leave

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,279
this wretched place

156
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,560
and start anew.

157
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
Sir, here we go.

158
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,919
Where's the treasure?

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
Did Su Mei take it?

160
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,119
Wu!

161
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Wu?

162
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,159
He's already inside.
