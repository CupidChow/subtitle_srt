[EP23]

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Su Mei

4
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:56,841
hasn't been here?

5
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,600
No,

6
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,040
haven't seen her.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,721
You're not even married yet,

8
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,961
but already being led around.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,720
Spoil her now,

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,240
and you'll pay for it later.

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,080
I don't mind.

12
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:15,720
Uh...

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
Miss Le, right?

14
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,520
Where's Miss Su Mei?

15
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm Xi.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,721
Her Lady isn't home.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,880
Where did she go?

18
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,280
[She went to find the General.]

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,520
[Haven't you seen her?]

20
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:29,681
When did she leave?

21
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:31,721
Right after lunch.

22
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:32,920
If she didn't go to the camp,

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,560
she might have been held up in town.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,161
I'll go find her.

25
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:46,880
Su Mei,

26
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:49,560
you'll be free soon.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,160
General.

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:00,920
Did you find her?

29
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,000
Our men searched the entire city

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,841
but didn't find her.

31
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,160
But one of them saw

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,640
Wei Shiting driving out of town.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Block all the checkpoints now!

34
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:10,961
Yes, sir!

35
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:22,401
[Stop the car!]

36
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,841
Routine check.

37
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,321
Turn around.

38
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:40,881
Let them pass.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,601
Get out of the car.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,121
General He,

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
long time no see.

42
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:08,880
General,

43
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,320
Miss Su is here!

44
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:16,040
Su Mei!

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,401
Su Mei!

46
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,681
He Jingyao, go!

47
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:29,641
Mei!

48
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,121
Don't move!

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,361
Mei,

50
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:37,720
it seems fate has us alive

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,961
but never together.

52
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,040
Wei Shiting,

53
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,880
what are you doing?

54
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,720
Put the gun down.

55
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,040
Put it down!

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,401
I told you,

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,320
I want Mei to die with me.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,801
Wei Shiting,

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
what do you want

60
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,681
to let her go?

61
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,320
What do I want?

62
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,280
If it weren't for you,

63
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:35,361
she would have loved me!

64
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,401
He Jingyao,

65
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:38,801
I want you dead!

66
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,000
Have you lost your mind?

67
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,280
Only if he dies,

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,521
can you be with me.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,880
Come here.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,201
Hurry!

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
Or I'll kill him!

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,320
Mei!

73
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:02,961
Don't move!

74
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:19,081
I heard

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
he once took a bullet for you.

76
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,521
Let's see

77
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,360
if he'll do it again.

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Are you alright?

79
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,480
Wei Shiting!

80
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,321
General!

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Why?

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,401
You always like to ask questions.

83
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:04,720
You never intended

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
to kill me or He Jingyao, did you?

85
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:09,160
Those blank shots

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
and fake bombs

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,321
are just for show.

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
What are you really after?

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
You're always...

90
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:21,641
so clever.

91
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:23,920
You're right.

92
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:28,641
Su Mei,

93
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:32,881
I just wanted you

94
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,521
to see your true feelings.

95
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:40,800
Wei Shiting?

96
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,321
Wei Shiting!

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
[Wei Shiting!]

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,761
[Wei Shiting!]

99
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:57,480
[Wei Shiting!]

100
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,240
Luo, are you here to mock me?

101
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,761
That day when you shot He Jingyao,

102
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,480
you were testing my sister's

103
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,961
feelings for him, right?

104
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Your sister

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
sees through everything

106
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,521
except her own heart.

107
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,201
Seeing her worry for He Jingyao,

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
she likes him but doesn't know it.

109
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,280
Su Mei,

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,841
I'm willing to stand by you to fight

111
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,521
against your head family,

112
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,201
take care

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,841
of your family,

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,081
and settle the townspeople.

115
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:53,641
But you don't have to

116
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
marry me for these reasons.

117
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,881
I'm sorry,

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,600
I shouldn't...

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,881
Whether we marry or not,

120
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:01,761
I can help you

121
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,240
achieve your goals.

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
I was too hasty before,

123
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,401
proposing without

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,280
understanding your feelings.

125
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:13,761
At tomorrow's wedding,

126
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,160
I'll announce that

127
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
I broke off the engagement,

128
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,521
so the Sus won't face any disgrace.

129
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,360
He Jingyao,

130
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,441
I truly want to marry you.

131
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,240
Su Mei,

132
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,561
I don't want you

133
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,561
to choose me just out of necessity.

134
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,561
If

135
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,280
you regret it later,

136
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,561
I won't let you go.
