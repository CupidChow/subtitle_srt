[Rival Love]
[EP03]

3
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,400
Let them go.

4
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,681
General,

5
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:34,640
who do you think they are?

6
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,200
The dead man in black on the wharf

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,161
was one of them.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,521
Are you going to explain

9
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,560
what you were doing at my father's grave

10
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,961
at this hour?

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,161
I was taking a walk.

12
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:47,881
Heard something.

13
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,480
So I came to check.

14
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,480
Is that so?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,640
You were incredibly calm, Miss Su.

16
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,881
Did you already find out

17
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,601
the identity of the man in black?

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,721
Ten years ago,

19
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,601
my father was lost to the sea.

20
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,200
We could only bury his clothes.

21
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,241
Even so,

22
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,801
people just can't leave him alone.

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,721
Not even his grave.

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,681
General,

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,881
may I have a word?

26
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,041
General,

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,281
what do you think of Crescent City?

28
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,480
Busy and peaceful.

29
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,281
Festive and fun.

30
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,960
Today is the Moon-worshipping Day.

31
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,480
Folks gather together

32
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,480
and pray to the moon

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,561
for a peace life.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,601
I won't bother asking

35
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,041
why you are really here.

36
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,480
But whatever you are after

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,800
we

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
do not have it.

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
I've no idea what you're talking about.

40
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,281
Then I wish you get

41
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,601
what you're here for, general.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,321
Crescent City and my family

43
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,360
are everything to me.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,360
I won't let anyone harm them.

45
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,281
You're forgetting something, Miss Su.

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,841
You're in no position

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,401
to threaten me.

48
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,841
Is that so?

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,281
Different forces

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,841
are at play.

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,881
One mistake

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,200
and you

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,841
are eaten alive.

54
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,041
You were supposed to be fighting in a battle.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,960
Why the sudden urgency

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,760
to marry someone

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,121
you've never met on your father's orders?

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Apparently,

59
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,800
it's not because you didn't want to go to war

60
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,360
but because you couldn't.

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm surprised

62
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,360
you know so much

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
living in a remote place like this.

64
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm just curious what in this small town

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,640
is keeping you here.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,001
But since you're here,

67
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,841
there's something you're after.

68
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:42,640
Perhaps

69
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,440
we don't have to be enemies.

70
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,161
The wedding is still on.

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
Miss Su,

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
you'd better hurry

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
and get your sister's dowry ready.

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,081
[Father,]

75
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,961
[it's all starting soon.]

76
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,560
Please forgive me, Luo.

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,601
Are you really that mad?

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,841
You missed your class.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm fine with you

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
liking my sister.

81
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,120
What are you doing talking to me?

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,521
Come on.

83
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't be mad.

84
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,161
Your sister and I are just good friends.

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,521
Luo,

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,081
let me see

87
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,841
if you have learned anything in class.

88
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,920
If not,

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,161
your sister will probably fire me.

90
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,201
I'm a fast learner.

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,240
Don't believe me?

92
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,721
Test me.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,601
You sure?

94
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,920
All right. Tell me about

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,240
your favorite English poem.

96
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,201
[I seem to have loved you in numberless forms.]

97
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,320
[My spell-bound heart]

98
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,601
[has made and remade the necklace of songs.]

99
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:24,081
[That you take as a gift.]

100
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,721
You know this poem?

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,041
I do.

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
"Unending Love" by Rabindranath Tagore.

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,281
You like it too?

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,841
I like a folk song from my childhood.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,320
What song is it?

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,961
Come on.

107
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's hear it.

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,521
Forget it.

109
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:53,161
You know I can't sing.

110
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,560
I don't care.

111
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,041
I'll get mad if you don't sing.

113
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,041

♪The groom searches in vain for his bride.♪

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
You know the song too?

118
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,880
Let's sing together then.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay.

120
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,641
Come on.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,120
Luo,

125
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,240
you like Mr. Wei, right?

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,480
Sis,

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,320
do you?

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Never.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,081
There is nothing romantic

130
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,841
between me and Mr. Wei.

131
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:43,961
You mean it?

132
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,880
When have I ever lied to you?

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,480
If you don't want him to teach you any more,

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll ask him to leave.

135
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,521
Sis,

136
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,440
I don't want to marry that villain He.

137
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,240
I said yes out of spite.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,401
I know.

139
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll think of something.

140
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,201
Sir,

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
we didn't find Crescent Necklace

142
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,480
in Su Qi'an's grave.

143
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,761
Eclipse's intelligence can't be false.

144
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,601
Keep digging secret chambers in town.

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,521
But with He Jingyao in town,

146
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,841
our hands are tied.

147
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:21,560
Sheng's body was found at the beach.

148
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,000
Probably He's handywork.

149
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
We even ran into them last night.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,201
You weren't supposed to tip them off.

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,401
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,320
General,

153
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:36,401
why

154
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,120
didn't you arrest those men in black

155
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,201
last night but let them go?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,800
Because

157
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:44,000
the more forces at play

158
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:46,680
in town the merrier.

159
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
Our intelligence says

160
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,721
the head family hasn't been in touch

161
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,360
with the Su sisters for 10 years.

162
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,240
Why would Su Qi'ping come all the way

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,560
for Su Luo's marriage?

164
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,960
What if he doesn't ...

165
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,481
I knew

166
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,401
Su Mei would use him as an excuse to stall.

167
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:05,800
So

168
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
I got in touch with Su Qi'ping weeks ago.

169
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,281
That patriarch

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,761
couldn't wait to be in-laws

171
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,641
with the Hes.

172
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,281
He should be here by today.

173
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,320
General He.

174
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,320
Such an honor

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,481
to see you in Crescent City.

176
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,720
The honor

177
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:37,840
is mine.

178
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,680
Sis.

179
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,241
Xue.

180
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:40,521
Aren't they

181
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,161
the ones that kicked us out?

182
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,080
This is my daughter, Su Xue.

183
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,481
She just got back from abroad.

184
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,440
[Nice to meet you, General He.]

185
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,001
[You should]

186
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
[spend some time with General He in future.]

187
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
[I will, Father.]

188
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,881
Master,

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
master.

190
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:01,641
Mother.

191
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,001
[Qi'an died in the sea.]

192
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,641
[And you didn't bear a son.]

193
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,041
