[Rival Love]
[EP06]

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
General He.

4
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,200
Wait!

5
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,080
General He!

6
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,910
Miss Su.

7
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,120
General He is...

8
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,520
It's alright.

9
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,880
Leave us.

10
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,910
Yes, Miss.

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
General He.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,440
Don't you think it's a little rude

13
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,640
to barge in like this?

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
So you do know it's not polite

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,030
to break into people's house.

16
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,230
Are you here to tell me

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,920
you have identified the bride?

18
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,920
I suppose Miss Su

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,950
is a book lover.

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,390
I read some

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,470
in my spare time.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,950
General.

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,110
Please have a cup pf tea.

24
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,030
This old edition is from eight years ago.

25
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,830
You should be only 14 then.

26
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,350
It was too obscure for that age.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
I suppose you had planned for future

28
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,440
long before Crescent City was open

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
to maritime commerce.

30
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,030
I started learning business by then.

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,750
Maritime shipping is well connected.

32
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,560
I wondered if Crescent City

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,030
could have a place in these routes.

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,560
So I learned a few things about shipping.

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
It's hard to identify the bride

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,590
without alerting people.

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
That's why I need your help.

38
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,000
Would you please find people you trust

39
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,280
to ask around

40
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,240
if there are

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,030
missing girls recently.

42
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,630
My pleasure.

43
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,070
Those townspeople wouldn't lie to me.

44
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,440
No one should have been here last night.

45
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,750
Why did the murderer tie the body here?

46
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,590
If they want to dispose of the body,

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,510
letting the boat go with the flow

48
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,470
would be a better idea.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,350
Maybe they deliberately wanted the body

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,630
to be found.

51
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,280
Since when did this dock fall into disuse?

52
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,590
Before I moved here.

53
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,880
It's not me!

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,190
I didn't do this!

55
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,590
I have nothing to do with this!

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
If you were innocent,

57
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,070
why did you

58
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,030
keep following us by stealth?

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,590
I meant to tell you something.

60
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,510
But I'm afraid I would get in trouble.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,750
Uncle Qiang.

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,070
You can tell me.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
I trust you are innocent.

64
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,840
Ten years ago on the winter solstice,

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,270
before your settlement,

66
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,680
there were a dead bride

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,070
just on that dock.

68
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,440
Her body was on a rotten boat,

69
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,150
just like the girl found last night.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,440
How come I never knew about this?

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,150
People feared that

72
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,480
if your family had learned this,

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
you would be unwilling to settle.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
So we've been keeping it as a secret.

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,150
Ten years ago,

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,310
the name of the dead girl?

77
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,360
Her name

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,600
was Biyun.

79
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,000
This is

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
where Biyun used to live.

81
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,440
I, I'd better keep out.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
To avoid the bad luck.

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
You, you can go without me.

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Be careful.

85
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,310
The murderer was imitating Biyun's death

86
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,270
to frighten people.

87
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,680
She must have had something to do with it.

88
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,800
Why don't we come back tomorrow morning?

89
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,950
Miss Su.

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,440
Are you afraid of ghosts?

91
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
It's too dark

92
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,310
in this old shed

93
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,390
to identify valuable leads.

94
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
We'd better...

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,750
Uncle Qiang said she disappeared

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
from the bridal chamber

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,240
on the wedding night after the ceremony.

98
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,000
Early next morning,

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
she was found in a boat next to the dock,

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,120
shot in the heart.

101
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,600
Seems it's been locked from the outside.

102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,710
What's wrong?

103
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,270
Why are they all blocked?

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Can't we get out?

105
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,190
General He!

106
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,510
Are you okay?

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm fine.

108
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
Watch out.

109
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,560
Mind your step.

110
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,800
We'd better get out of here now.

111
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,150
Be careful.

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,270
Here.

113
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm sure the light can comfort you.

114
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,710
Are you afraid of the dark?

115
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,680
Here.

116
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,600
The light can save you.

117
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,150
Let's go home.

118
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,680
Slow down.

119
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,550
Leave this to me.

120
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,240
We can do it together.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,390
It's rare to see Miss Su

122
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
to be in such a state.

123
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,550
It's also rare to see General

124
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,550
can be so bedraggled.

125
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
The perpetrator

126
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,790
must know the lock won't hold us.

127
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,430
I think it's just to stall for time.

128
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,840
Let's go back to the mansion.

129
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,550
General.

130
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,030
I've heard of a disease that patients

131
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
are triggered in a small and confined place.

132
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,080
Is that...

133
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,720
Could you please

134
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,430
keep it as a secret

135
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,960
of what happened at that time?

136
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,790
Yes.

137
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
I thought you would be surprised

138
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,270
at this ridiculous illness.

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,670
Everyone in this world

140
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,720
has to live with two faces.

141
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,390
One is to show other people.

142
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,670
The other one is for themselves.

143
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,430
Please don't worry.

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,000
I saw nothing today.

145
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,670
Here is the Lao Gong point.

146
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,880
If it happens again,

147
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,840
press here to alleviate the symptoms.

148
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,000
Here is the Lao Gong point.

149
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,880
Press it and you won't be afraid again.

150
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,200
General!

151
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
There you are.

152
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,000
Another dead bride was found at the dock.
