How is it you're asking her hand in marriage?

113
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
18 years ago,

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,839

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440

00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,599
Um,

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
general,

121
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
I've never heard of this from his lordship.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
General,

123
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,399
My father passed away ten years ago.

124
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,039
We truly aren't aware of the betrothal.

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
It's indeed his lordship's handwriting.

126
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,839
Times have changed. We can choose whom to marry.

127
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,520
You've studied abroad yourself, general.

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,880

129

130
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
my father's wish.

132
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,440
Why stick to

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,000
outdated feudal costumes, general?

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,599
Miss Su Luo's beauty is one of a kind.

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
To marry her

136
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,719
would be a blessing.

137
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,000
My sister is still a child,

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
wayward and spoiled.

139
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,719
I'm afraid she isn't qualified to be your wife, general.

140
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,799
Crescent City should've been mine long time ago.

141
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,640
The residents still have their homes because my father,

142
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,719
sentimental as he is, allows it.

143
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,479
And you, my lady, gets to do trade here.

144
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,560
So you're saying

145
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,560
if we don't agree to the marriage,

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,479
you will take away

147
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,039
our control over Crescent City.

148
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,080
Correct.

149
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,359

00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,159

158
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,239

159
00:07:59,359 --> 00:07:59,960
Plus,

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
General He is from a prestigious family,

161
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,799
a military genius

162
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,719
and one with integrity.

163
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,120
Isn't he a good choice for a husband?

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Do you really want me to marry him?

165
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,000
Why not?

166
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,440
Fine.

167
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm telling him yes right now.

168
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,399
Luo.

169
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:17,839
Mei,

170
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,279
Luo is too young and vulnerable

171
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,760
to marry off to some remote city.

172
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,159
What if

173
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,120
she gets in trouble?

174
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,799
General, I don't know

175
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,760
your real intention for this marriage.

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,359
But, if all you want

177
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,719
is a marriage with the Su family,

178
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,640
then,

179
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,039
I will marry you.

180
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,960
No.

181
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,900
Wei Shiting,

182
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,780
Wei Shiting,

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,540
You

184
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,180
you and my sister.

185
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,180
You can't marry him.

186
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:22,379
Mr. Wei,

187
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:23,619
I know you mean well.

188
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,459
But this is family business.

189
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,660
I know.

190
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,459
The Sus have always been kind to me.

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,260
How can I let this happen?

192
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,260
I don't suppose General He would be so crazy

193
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,820
as to kill innocent people for a betrothal.

194
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,099
Wei Shiting.

195
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,140
Is this

196
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,859
how you treat the family of the girl you are marrying?

197
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,260
Everything in town, big or small,

198
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:10,060
goes through you, Miss Su Mei.

199
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,260
Let's set the wedding with Miss Su Luo

200
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,379
ten days from now,

201
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,459
shall we?

202
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,739
Your family is known to keep up with time.

203
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,260
Yet, here you are, so backward

204
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,020
as to stick to what's said

205
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,540
in a piece of paper.

206
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,940
Who the hell are you?

207
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,859
Mind your own business.

208
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,699
You

209
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,940
Let's go.

210
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,459
Leave, I dare you.

211
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,739
What are you doing?

212
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,020
Miss Su, you haven't answered.

213
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,699
Wedding in ten days.

214
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,619
Is that a yes?
