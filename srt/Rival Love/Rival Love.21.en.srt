[EP21]

3
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,841
[Uncle, what are you looking for?]

4
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,200
You're not dead?

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,641
Sorry to disappoint you.

6
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,681
All this time,

7
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,640
I saw Su Qiping

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,121
as my savior

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
and was

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,721
loyal to him.

11
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,000
I didn't know

12
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:30,841
he was the one

13
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,441
who killed my parents.

14
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you for telling me the truth.

15
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,280
I'll do

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,841
whatever you need.

17
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,200
So, you were all in this together.

18
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,640
General He,

19
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,200
you and Su Mei took the treasure

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
and watched me

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,520
searching for nothing!

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,080
Su Qiping,

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,601
there's no treasure at all.

24
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,041
Before my father

25
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,841
found the Crescent Necklace,

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,241
you killed him.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,841
No treasure?

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,241
The Eclipse was also your doing?

29
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,000
I see,

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,440
coming to the city was all a setup!

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,761
Su Mei,

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
you're so cunning!

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,521
Su Qiping,

34
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,841
over the years,

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,401
you've killed your brother,

36
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,321
seized the family fortune,

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
and committed

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
countless crimes.

39
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,761
Your death

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,241
would not expiate them.

41
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,601
Do you remember

42
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,000
these stolen cash, Uncle?

43
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,321
How?

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,961
How did you find them?

45
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,521
[That day, Luo noticed]

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,760
[the chandelier was tampered with.]

47
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,961
[She snuck into your room]

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,280
[and found the stolen cash hidden there.]

49
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,320
[The assassins you sent after Su Mei]

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
[are captured,]

51
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:23,600
and we have all the evidence.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,600
Do you still think you can get away with it?

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,921
My father never wanted to

54
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,440
compete with you for the family fortune

55
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,521
or the position of family head.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,801
He planned to

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
establish his own legacy.

58
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:47,600
But you...

59
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:50,720
you killed him!

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
Impossible!

61
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,401
No way!

62
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:01,560
He always

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,801
competed with me over everything!

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,961
Read it yourself.

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,241
[Brother can be rest assured,]

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
[I believe you are the most suitable]

67
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,801
[for the position of family head.]

68
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:32,961
[I know]

69
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,521
[that without you, I could]

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,961
[never have lived the life I wanted.]

71
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:38,720
[After the Mid-Autumn Festival,]

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
[I will take my wife and daughter]

73
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,081
[to Crescent City to settle.]

74
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,641
[If you are ever]

75
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,121
[troubled by matters in Yunjing,]

76
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,720
[come find me to relax.]

77
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,720
[We can fish,]

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,201
[play chess,]

79
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,320
[and talk about old times.]

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
[Wouldn't that be wonderful?]

81
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,480
How could this be?

82
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:58,641
[Brother,]

83
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,600
[soon]

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,801
[I will leave Yunjing with my family]

85
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,921
[and won't be involved in family affairs.]

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,441
[The future of the Su family]

87
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,720
[will be]

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,600
[in your hands.]

89
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,720
Fake...

90
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:22,680
it's all fake!

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,401
All of it is fake!

92
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,841
No!

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
Brother,

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,401
you wanted a bamboo grasshopper.

95
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,001
I learned how to make one.

96
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,641
This is for you.

97
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,561
Leave me alone!

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,001
Always like this...

99
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,881
always like this.

100
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,680
Su Qi'an!

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,641
You always made yourself look so noble,

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,081
making me so vile.

103
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,160
So vile...

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,961
I thought

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,081
I'd be happy to see him died,

106
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,160
but now...

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Don't be sad.

108
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,720
This was Su Qiping's

109
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,321
own doing.

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
Well,

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,521
it's over now.

112
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,360
Yes,

113
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,561
it's all over.

114
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:38,120
Mei,

115
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,160
are you okay?

116
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,441
Mother,

117
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,641
I avenged

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,841
father.

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,081
Mei,

120
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,081
I know I was wrong.

121
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,521
I saw everything

122
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,680
in the secret chamber.

123
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,641
Mother,

124
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,561
I'm so tired.

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,761
I know.

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,920
You've suffered all these years.

127
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:36,120
It's all my fault.

128
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,441
Thank you for helping me.

129
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,641
Su Mei,

130
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,441
I promised you

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,641
with this necklace as a token.

132
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,401
When I become a general,

133
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,321
I'll come back for you.

134
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,640
Today,

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,760
let this necklace be the witness.

136
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,561
Su Mei,

137
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,640
will

138
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,120
you

139
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,961
marry me?

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,161
You don't want to?

141
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
He Jingyao,

142
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,561
do you like Su Mei

143
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,201
or do you like Jiu?

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,520
If you like Jiu,

145
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,520
I am no longer...

146
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
I like you.

147
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,441
I like Jiu

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,961
and Su Mei

149
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,720
because they are both you.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
I think...

151
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,120
Don't rush to refuse.

152
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,921
Think it over carefully.

153
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,640
I think

154
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,720
the wedding can go on as planned.

155
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,561
Okay.

156
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,720
Aren't you going to ask with whom?

157
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,321
It doesn't matter.

158
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,240
Whatever

159
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,520
Miss Su

160
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,161
decides.

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,081
Well,

162
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,760
you should ask.

163
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,321
Then,

164
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,801
may I ask

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
whom I will marry

166
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,000
on the wedding in three days?
