[Rival Love]
[EP14]

3
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,360
Where did he go?

4
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,880
Three,

5
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,320
two,

6
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,401
one.

7
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,841
Su... Su Qiping.

8
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:33,960
Go on.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,841
Recently,

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Zhen's Trading House

11
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
stole a lot of orders from Master Su,

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,640
so he ordered us

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
to investigate

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
who's behind Zhen's Trading House.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,401
She just came out from a noodle shop.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,240
What's that to do with the Zhen's Trading House?

17
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,200
We've found out

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,081
that noodle shop

19
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,841
is a base for Zhen's Trading House.

20
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,000
A few days ago,

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,601
Master Su was going to investigate it himself,

22
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,200
but he got stuck in the Crescent City.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,521
So he ordered me

24
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,800
to guard there,

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,241
and bring back anyone

26
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,720
suspicious for questioning.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,881
Do you recognize her?

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,961
Yes.

29
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,000
Master Su gave us pictures

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,681
of all the Su family members,

31
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,560
ordering us

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,761
to keep him informed

33
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,640
if we see any

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,321
of them nearby.

35
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,440
How many people are watching the streets?

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,841
About

37
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,720
a dozen.

38
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,241
[Su Qiping must not find out]

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,761
[about Su Mei's connection to the Zhen's.]

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,681
Too many people here,

41
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,440
you'd better disguise yourself.

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,801
How did you find me?

43
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,921
Is everything done?

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't you want to know what I did?

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,841
Su Qiping

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,521
is investigating Zhen's Trading House.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,801
Don't come to Greenstone Island for a while.

48
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:35,401
How did you know?

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,081
The man tracking me

50
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,201
was handled by you?

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,081
I said

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,521
I'd protect you.

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,521
Thank you.

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,280
Do you like it?

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,921
This doesn't fit me.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,201
We should hurry back.

58
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,600
You always

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
dress too plainly.

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,000
Try wearing

61
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,040
something more stylish and bright.

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
He Jingyao, what are you doing?

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
I don't want it.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,081
We should leave.

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,921
Sir,

66
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:13,641
Miss,

67
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:14,480
can I help you?

68
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:16,280
The second pair at the entrance.

69
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,320
Okay.

70
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,040
Try them on yourself,

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
or should I help you?

72
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,320
I'll do it myself.

73
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,440
You don't have to be this way.

74
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,440
You can go get anything

75
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,040
and do anything you want.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,241
What's the fun of doing

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
things against your will?

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,320
You two really match each other.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,521
Miss,

80
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,480
I've never seen

81
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,920
such an attentive gentleman before.

82
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,841
You're really lucky.

83
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:08,920
He's going to be my brother-in-law.

84
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,800
That makes your relationship

85
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,240
quite unique.

86
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:24,680
What...

87
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,360
Miss,

88
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,641
you don't want it?

89
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:32,600
You know you like it,

90
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
why don't you take it?

91
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,401
I need to get back now.

92
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
General, what do you mean?

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,561
My lord.

94
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,120
He Jingyao is damn arrogant.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,881
I waited on him all morning,

96
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,001
but he wouldn't see me.

97
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,641
I'm afraid He Jingyao isn't here.

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Get in the car.

99
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,441
Your car?

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,521
Thought you're in a hurry back home.

101
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,561
The water route is too slow.

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,081
I'll be your driver.

103
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,240
Miss.

104
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:16,561
Miss,

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
your shoes.

106
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,641
I don't know your shoe size,

107
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,081
so I bought them all.

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,081
Why must you give me these shoes?

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,401
A gift for the partner.

110
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,240
Are you behind

111
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,441
Zhen's Trading House?

112
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,441
Not me,

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,720
my father did.

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Since I was born,

115
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,720
my father established Zhen's Trading House,

116
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,201
assigning trusted aides to oversee it secretly.

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
His wish was

118
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,600
if he ever left one day,

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,720
our family would live a well-off life.

120
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:12,561
Unfortunately,

121
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,160
Zhen's Trading House hadn't fully developed

122
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:17,841
before my father passed away.

123
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,040
Sorry,

124
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,040
I didn't mean to bring up your sadness.

125
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,081
When I first came to the Crescent City,

126
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,641
all I could think about was revenge,

127
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:30,720
but I had no leads.

128
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,680
It wasn't until Zhen's Trading House found me

129
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,040
and put me in charge,

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,641
that I started to have a plan.

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
I began using Zhen's power

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,641
to set up Eclipse,

133
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,800
gathering information.

134
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,401
General, rest assured,

135
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,641
since we agreed to cooperate,

136
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,680
I won't let you leave empty-handed.

137
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,201
Where did Miss Su Mei go?

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,841
Father...

139
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:29,920
You had a nightmare?

140
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,001
It's fine.

141
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,920
I'm used to it.

142
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,641
You don't sleep well?

143
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,120
What's wrong?

144
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,001
Get off.

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Is the car broken?

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,641
Listen to the wind.

147
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:20,321
See

148
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,360
and listen.

149
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:24,640
When I was little,

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
my father was very strict to me.

151
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,281
Each time I felt tired of training,

152
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,520
I'd sneak into the wilderness on my own,

153
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,921
listening to the wind

154
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,321
and watching the sunset.

155
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,480
Have a try.

156
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,640
Feel it by your heart.
