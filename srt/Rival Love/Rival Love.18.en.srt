[Rival Love]
[EP18]

3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Is it bad?

4
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,760
Still alive.

5
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
[Give me that.]

6
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:27,999
Don't worry.

7
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,919
I didn't tell Su Qiping about you.

8
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:33,840
I know.

9
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,999
Thank you.

10
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Su Luo is looking for you.

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,279
I can take care of him.

12
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,360
Fine.

13
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,559
You get some rest.

14
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,599
I'll come back later.

15
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,680
You don't seem happy.

16
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,799
Jealous?

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,559
How could you put her in danger?

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
You seem to already know.

19
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,799
[If someone asks you,]

20
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,400
[say you saw me secretly practicing crossbow.]

21
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,680
[I understand.]

22
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,400
[If I don't come to you tomorrow.]

23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,799
[break the jade pendant in half]

24
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:36,799
[and give them to Miss Su Mei.]

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,559
[Tell her they're found in the garden.]

26
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,279
[Got it.]

27
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,079
No worries.

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,799
I won't hurt her.

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,159
I just wanna show her

30
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,760
my sincerity.

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Not to mention, have your protection.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,279
What would happen to Mei?

33
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,760
You don't deserve to call her that!

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,799
If you play this again

35
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,639
and make her scare,

36
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,879
I'll kill you!

37
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,240
Even you do marry her,

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,879
she may not fall in love with you.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,559
So what?

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,879
She won't love you anyhow.

41
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:24,920
Is he still awake?

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
Time to change the dressing.

43
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,200
You go.

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,479
[Hands of a man]

45
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,599

46
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,719
[instead of dealing]

47
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,680
with such trifles...

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,960
You weren't

49
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,439
exposed to Su Qiping.

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,999
But he's meticulous that much,

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,439
and is likely suspicious of you.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,200
From now on, don't be alone.

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,479
Lest in danger.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,400
This one is better than yours.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
Take it around you.

56
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,840
Don't know how to use it?

57
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,400
This is the safety.

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,759
While shooting,

59
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,279
straighten your arm,

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,999
make your eyes,

61

the sight, notch

62
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,240
and the bead sight

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,400
come to a line.

64
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,400
Then,

65
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,279
done.

66
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,640
Thanks.

67

[Even you do marry her,]

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
[she may not fall in love with you.]

69
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:44,879
Don't think too much.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Just for self-defense.

71
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,559
I'll do my best to protect you.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Give it a try.

73
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,840
[There's nothing to be afraid of.]

74
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,840
[Su Qiping's property is gonna be annexed.]

75
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,679
[I just need to wait for the silver note.]

76
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,200
[Then, all will be over.]

77
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:13,000
Trash!

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,279
You can't even watch a weak bookworm!

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,760
Forgive me, sir.

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,400
Where are our people?

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,679
Should be taken away

82
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,520
by the man who saved him.

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,440
[Well...]

84
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,239
interesting.

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,919
I can't believe

86
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
there's such a powerful man in town.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,679
Sir.

88
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,840
Would it be He Jingyao?

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,239
He...

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,279
He's just for the Necklace.

91
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,159
There's no reason to get into this.

92
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,440
Or those pedantic old men

93
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,799

94
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,840

95

from Wei Shiting,

96
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,080
and planned to control me

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
with Su Qi'an's death.

98
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,039
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,799
Go find him!

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,159
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,239
No access for

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
unauthorized personnel!

103
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,239
How could you

104
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,520
be so rude to a vulnerable girl

105
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,560
like me?

106
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,479
Vulnerable?

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,440
Stop! Go to your sister first!

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
You aren't allowed in!

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,799
Let her in.

110
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,039
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,440
She's really

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
more horrible than her sister.

113
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,880
Her sister doesn't want

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,159
her to know, innit?

115
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,080
She should know

116
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400
how hard her sister works.

117
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,640
What's more...

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
What?

119
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,479
Her sister

120
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,760
likes Wei Shiting.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,400
If he fell in love with her,

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,599
I would have one less rival.

123
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh, crafty.

124
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,960
Say it again.

125
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,359
I mean, calculating.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,919
You come with me

127
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,359
to visit Su Qiping.

128
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
My Lady,

129
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,080
please allow me to take a look.

130
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,200
Xi,

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,599
take it easy.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,640
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

133
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,200
I still don't understand.

134
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,039
Why did you still go alone when you knew

135
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,919
it's dangerous to go to the warehouse?

136
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,440
As written in the picture book

137
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
of Tomato Bookstore,

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,560
before winning a man's love,

139
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,880
try to make him worry about you.

140
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,400
So, you've known

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,760
that General He would save you.

142
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,799
[My Lady,]

143
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,560
[don't take a risk like this anymore.]

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,159
If he's late,

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,039
you'd have been hurt.

146
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:52,880
Then what should we do?

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
No worries, I'm fine.

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
So,

149
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
do you

150
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,159
have some feelings for him?

151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,119
I invited you over

152
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,000
for something crucial.

153
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,080
Sir.

154
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm listening.

155
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,359
Yesterday I sent out

156
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,159
some men to search for the Necklace.

157
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,080
But they all went missing.

158
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I suspect

159
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,400
that there're other people

160
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,159
who also know about the Necklace

161
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,400
and put every obstacle in my way.

162
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,919
Sir.

163
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,000
Please rest assured.

164
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,960
I'll arrange a check on the

165
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,400
recent floating population

166
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,479
and try to bring your men back.

167
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,159
Thanks a lot.

168
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Additionally,

169
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,840
Luo's mother and I have decided

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,159
to hold your wedding

171
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,640
on the eighth of next month.

172
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,599
There are 10 days left.

173
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,679
General...

174
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,599
No objection.

175
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
Mr. Su.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm busy.

177
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,279
I gotta go.

178
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,599
Take care.

179
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,239
Xue.

180
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,800
If you worked harder,

181
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,399
the Hes' support and the Necklace

182
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,160
would be mine.

183
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:41,800
Father.

184
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,239
In the engagement party,

185
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,399
I found that Su Mei

186
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,479
has a close relationship with Wei Shiting,

187
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,599
Su Luo's teacher.

188
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
Su Mei and Wei Shiting?

189
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,800
Is it possible that she is

190
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,999
his accomplice?

191
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,960
I really underestimated her.

192
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,560
Daddy, don't worry.

193
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,599
I have an inspiration

194
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,800
to help you get everything you want.

195
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:12,800
I'll never

196
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
let you down again, Daddy.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,960
If I hadn't brought

198
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
the jade pendant to the General last night,

199
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,759
you'd have been beaten to death.

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,119
Thanks.

201
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,359
Keep in mind.

202
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,639
I'm your life savior.

203
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,399
Is it hurt so much?

204
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,800
I'll get the doctor.

205
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,479
No need.

206
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,399
Where's your sister?

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,599
She's pestered by my mom

208
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,160
to buy me wedding supplies.

209
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,599
She couldn't get away

210
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,160
to visit you.

211
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,999
I have asked her.

212
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,599
She said...

213
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,759
she doesn't have feelings for you.

214
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,200
Is that so?

215
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,759
If...

216
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,560
I say

217
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,800
I like you...

218
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,960
Why?

219
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
Fond of my face

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,680
or

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
the elegance I put on?

222
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:22,759
Or, do the girls

223
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,239
in Yunjing like me,

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,280
so you just follow them?

225
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,399
Do you really know

226
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,399
what kind of person

227
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,560
I and your sister are?

228
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,399
Wei Shiting.

229
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,599
You tell me.

230
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,759
I want to know everything.

231
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,639
You see.

232
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,080
Luo is still young.

233
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
You should take more care

234
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,800
of her wedding.

235
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,560
Don't worry, mom.

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,440
All settled down.

237
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,599
She won't suffer any injustice.

238
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,639
You've always been thoughtful.

239
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,599
I trust you.

240
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,359
I'm so sorry.

241
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,800
[Sorry.]

242
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Pardon me.

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,399
[Big trouble. Old place at sunset.]

244
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:33,759
Sir.

245
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,879
Su Qiping

246
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,639
has hidden his safe.

247
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,119
There's something wrong.

248
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,920
Is the Necklace really inside?

249
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,519
The safe may just be

250
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,200
deceiving the public.

251
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,999
Go check out all the places

252
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,639
he has been to recently.

253
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,680
Yes, sir.

254
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,440
Where's Su Mei?

255
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,359
She's called out

256
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,080
by her mom to go shopping,

257
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,320
and has not returned yet.

258
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,080
General He.

259
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,560
Where's Su Mei?

260
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,840
She's gone

261
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,160
to the dock to deal with

262
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,719
the urgent matters

263
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,879
of merchant ships and business.
