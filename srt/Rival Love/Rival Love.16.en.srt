00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:39,611
[Rival Love]
[EP16]

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,401
[Qi'an.]

4
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,200
It would be so great if you were still alive.

5
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:03,520
You could protect Mei and Luo.

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm weak and powerless,

7
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,801
throwing the whole family's responsibilities to Mei.

8
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,040
Made her a prison.

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,121
Without any options.

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,841
Even Luo's marriage

11
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,400
was manipulated.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
She can't follow her heart.

13
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:19,761
Mom.

14
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,240
You have known it well.

15
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:25,520
Sister agreed to the marriage.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,721
There's nothing we can do about it.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,121
However.

18
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,801
I'm willing to marry him.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,801
You silly girl.

20
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,401
The times is turbulent.

21
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,161
General He will go into battle sooner or later.

22
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,121
No soldiers would know when the death will come.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,121
I just want you

24
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:43,801
to marry the ordinary

25
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,240
[and have a peaceful life.]

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,041
But, mom.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,761
How does sister

28
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:52,121
live like that though.

29
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:56,640
[It's all my fault.]

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
In my lifetime,

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
between your sisters,

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,241
I haven't been given even-handed treatments.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,241
Mom.

34
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,041
After I marry in Yunjing.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,160
I will take you and sister with me.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,440
We will never be apart.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,481
Later, send for Zhang to get

38
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,681
some ice packs to your sister.

39
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,961
For swelling.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,321
Mom have taken the edge off anger?

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,800
I was not mad at her.

42
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm mad at myself.

43
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,401
My lady, welcome back.

44
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,761
Please put some for the swelling.

45
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:46,280
It was General He

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
asking me to bring this to you.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm fine.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
[This is also from him.]

49
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,401
[And he said.]

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,801
What?

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,121
He said,

52
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,401
the things he gives you in the future

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,241
are not allowed to give it away.

54
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:33,320
General.

55
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,961
The engagement invitations of you and Su Luo

56
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,880
have all sent out.

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,401
Finally almost done.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,641
You are in a good mood.

59
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:50,841
[Has Su Mei recognized you?]

60
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,521
Not yet.

61
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,560
But I'm pretty sure

62
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,000
she remembers me.

63
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,880
[Just.]

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
I don't know why she's unwilling to bring that up.

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,401
What can it be.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,401
She must dislike you.

67
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,641
[That would rather not]

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
She has talked to me lots of pasts.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,401
Should have had

70
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,720
something to me.

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
[I don't think so.]

72
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,961
If she really liked you, General,

73
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,801
Why would she

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,201
make you marry someone else.

75
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,921
I'm not really going to marry Su Luo,

76
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,241
just for making a deal with Su Qiping

77
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,921
that he can let his guard down on me.

78
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,201
So I can get the Yinpiao.

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Then, the Miss Su Mei.

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,201
Aren't she using you again, General?

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,401
[Ugh] You have nothing to do?

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,921
[Welcome, ladies and gentlemen]

83
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,361
[to attend the engagement party of Miss Su Luo]

84
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:52,201
[and General He Jingyao.]

85
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:53,880
The two surnames bound together.

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
Take vows in the room,

87
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,320
United forever,

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,961
Well match of two.

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,521
Cheers.

90
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:00,760
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,241
-Congratulations,
-Congratulations.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
The gift from you.

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,401
I don't like it.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,521
What does that mean?

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
I don't know how to dance.

96
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,321
Come, I'll show you.

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
Why did Miss Su Mei

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,401
agree to the marriage now?

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Or.

100
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,014
Are you planning to replace your sister again?

101
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,401
What if yes?

102
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,600
What if not?

103
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:06,961
Why are you still leery of me?

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,401
I thought we were friends now.

105
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:22,001
Why do you keep staring at my sister?

106
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,401
You like her, don't you?

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
If you marry He Jingyao,

108
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,841
I'll be sad.

109
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,280
Why does Mr. Wei always

110
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,800
flirt to me?

111
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,561
What if I'm meaning it?

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
You look beautiful today.

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,201
General better suit in uniforms.

114
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,280
He Jingyao and Sister.

115
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,441
How could...

116
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,081
What?

117
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
Did you just realize it?

118
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,441
I...I'm done.

119
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,961
The key has been duplicated.

120
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,561
He didn't notice.

121
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:55,401
And I have returned the original.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,401
Thanks.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,401
The call of Miss Su Mei

124
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,841
must be answered.

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,280
Now.

126
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Would you focus on dancing with me?

127
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Can't believe He Jingyao is into sister.

128
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:41,160
Then why did he insist on engaging with me?

129
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:51,600
[That's wired?]

130
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
[Where are they?]

131
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:05,881
Keys are wrong.

132
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,641
Is it possible the safe key

133
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:10,641
is right here in the room?

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,841
We have to go.

135
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,680
Can not leave for too long.

136
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,761
What should we do?

137
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,240
Li.

138
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,720
Water.

139
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,240
[Oh, yeah.]

140
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,640
You've died.

141
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,600
[Good to be dead.]

142
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:49,921
You dead.

143
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,760
Then no one will know

144
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,640
how Qi'an died.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,801
Don't be afraid.
