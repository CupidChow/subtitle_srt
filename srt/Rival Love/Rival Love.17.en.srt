1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:39,889
[Rival Love]
[EP17]

3
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:06,522
[Uncle.]

4
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,522
[Uncle, are you in there?]

5
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:13,763
What is it?

6
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,003
Why are you staying in there?

7
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:17,443
This is my engagement party.

8
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:17,922
Hurry up.

9
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:20,202
My mom are waiting for you to discuss the details.

10
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:25,803
I know.

11
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,322
I'm coming.

12
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,322
I should have killed him.

13
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:55,523
We talked about that.

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,362
I'll deal with

15
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,123
what happens next.

16
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:01,802
To avenge my father's death,

17
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,523
how could  I leave it to others?

18
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,403
Are you sure that

19
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,843
this is the foreign language teacher's?

20
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:27,442
Yes.

21
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,123
Su Mei.

22
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:08,963
You know what I said

23
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:09,923
was not a joke.

24
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:12,843
We are not right for each other.

25
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:22,722
Because of my family background?

26
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:27,403
Whatever you want,

27
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,643
I can do it for you, too.

28
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:31,042
Mr. Wei.

29
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,442
I hope we can still be friends.

30
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,243
[Su Mei and Wei Shiting.]

31
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,882
[How could they get so intimate?]

32
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,363
Friends.

33
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,683
But I want more than that.

34
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:14,482
[Take it.]

35
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,002
[For preventing your poetry wet.]

36
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,282
In fact, that day under the roof

37
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:47,923
is our first met.

38
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,963
Where is Su Qiping?

39
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,602
Haven't we made a pact?

40
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,722
To discuss Luo's wedding date.

41
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:09,643
[Why still not see him?]

42
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,802
[Mr. Su left the house for some business this early morning.]

43
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:13,003
Not coming back yet.

44
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,883
My daughter's wedding is

45
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,722
no need to bother him.

46
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:19,643
[You wait here.]

47
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:20,922
I ask the fortune teller

48
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:22,042
to pick an auspicious day.

49
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,203
[Luo, let's go over there.]

50
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:33,922
Sister.

51
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:35,682
This is

52
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,003
the Yuanyue Tree well-known in town.

53
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:40,443
Yuanyue Tree is

54
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,963
love tree of the Crescent City.

55
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,242
[Only need to pray to it devoutly.]

56
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,682
The prayer must be able to

57
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:46,922
turn gray with beloved.

58
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:52,362
Miss Su Mei believes in this?

59
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,122
If the three is really as magical as you says,

60
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:56,203
Why do so many people be separated

61
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,403
in the whole world?

62
00:05:59,042 --> 00:05:59,963
Yeah.

63
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:01,963
General never believes in such things.

64
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,282
[Besides.]

65
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:04,883
The tree looks so unreal.

66
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:08,523
Sincere wishes come true.

67
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,563
[Wish Luo met the good.]

68
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,122
[Have a beautiful ending.]

69
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,083
[Wrote by Su Mei.]

70
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,602
[Wish sister married to the greatest man in the world.]

71
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:30,482
[Wrote by Su Luo.]

72
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:41,563
Sister.

73
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:42,963
Why were some wish knots

74
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,042
tied together?

75
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:45,323
There's a saying that

76
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,763
if people tie their wish knot

77
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,203
with their lover's on the tree,

78
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,802
they'll be forever

79
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,122
[accompany each other.]

80
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:07,482
[Mei.]

81
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,722
[You come in.]

82
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:09,763
I'm coming.

83
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:27,323
General, Why do you...?

84
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:30,922
I'll write one, too.

85
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:39,883
Yeah.

86
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:41,362
[Get a wife soon.]

87
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,323
[Wrote by He Zixiu.]

88
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,083
[Why did He Jingyao]

89
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,443
[tie his knot to sister's together?]

90
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,883
[He said he likes sister,]

91
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:54,922
[but is going to marry me instead.]

92
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,042
[Told me about this at the engagement party on purpose.]

93
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,122
[Is he not just wants me?]

94
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,362
[But my sister?]

95
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:01,922
[A wife]

96
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,242
[and a concubine.]

97
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:05,682
Shameless.

98
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:06,523
You jerk!

99
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:30,563
Sir.

100
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:31,563
It's pretty sure that

101
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,682
he is Biyun's little brother.

102
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,362
[But he said nothing.]

103
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:36,802
Can't believe I've been looking for so long.

104
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:38,282
The one who killed Li

105
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,443
is you.

106
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,203
You murdered those brides

107
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:46,763
just for finding out Li

108
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:49,083
who killed your sister.

109
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,083
And after that,

110
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,443
you killed him,

111
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,403
pretending him suicide for guilt.

112
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:55,802
Am I right?

113
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,122
He killed my sister.

114
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,443
So I did him.

115
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:02,282
There's nothing to talk about.

116
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,162
On your own?

117
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,203
you cannot make so many waves.

118
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:09,563
So,

119
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:11,763
who else is with you?

120
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,602
Just me.

121
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:16,362
Is that so?

122
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,283
Tell me.

123
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,482
It's someone in the Su mansion,

124
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,163
or right from the Su family?

125
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:33,482
You guess.

126
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,602
[Why are you so angry?]

127
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,522
Sister,

128
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,683
today, He Jingyao told me

129
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,283
that he likes you.

130
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:50,843
[Tying his knot shamelessly]

131
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,843
[with yours.]

132
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:54,283
He obviously

133
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,843
want to marry both of us.

134
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:02,762
Sister?

135
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,043
You knew it, didn't you?

136
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,402
He likes you.

137
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:12,323
Luo.

138
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:13,642
About the engagement,

139
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:14,602
you don't take it seriously.

140
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:16,083
[In a few days,]

141
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,642
[General He will find an excuse]

142
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,402
to leave you at the altar.

143
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:19,642
At that time,

144
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,522
you can study abroad.

145
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:24,163
You are about to marry him instead of me?

146
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:27,722
Were you always saying that

147
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,642
you are longing to see the bigger world?

148
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:31,122
I don't agree with that.

149
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:31,882
[My lady.]

150
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:33,722
What's wrong?

151
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,043
I found this jade pendant

152
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,002
when cleaning up the garden.

153
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,923
[It must belong to a guest]

154
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,043
[who came to the party last night.]

155
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,642
[Isn't this Wei Shiting's?]

156
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,242
[He carries it all the time.]

157
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,203
So cherishes.

158
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,362
How did it break?

159
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,683
[But he did leave]

160
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,163
[without saying anything.]

161
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:53,882
[Oh, no.]

162
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:55,683
Couldn't it be revenge

163
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:56,683
from the man in black?

164
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:58,163
What should we do, sister?

165
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:00,482
You take the jade pendant

166
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:01,323
and find He Jingyao quickly.

167
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:02,563
I'm going to find Mr. Wei.

168
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:03,203
[Go!]

169
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,163
Toast!

170
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,163
What are you doing here?

171
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,443
Leave! Su Mei!

172
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,323
I have the crescent necklace.

173
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:29,602
Let him go.

174
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:30,882
Don't come over, Su Mei.

175
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:32,002
Even if you gave them the necklace.

176
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:32,482
They would not...

177
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:32,762
Shut up!

178
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,522
Looking good.

179
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:47,683
Say it!

180
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:48,843
Where's the necklace?

181
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:49,803
Say it!

182
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,323
You OK?

183
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:19,963
Be careful.

184
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:32,602
Take them all.

185
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:33,122
[Yes, sir.]

186
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,002
[Get up.]

187
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,323
[Don't move.]

188
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,722
How did you come alone?

189
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,602
You got a lot of nerve, Miss Su Mei.

190
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,843
If I had not known from Su Luo,

191
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:44,522
or came a little late,

192
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,283
I knew.

193
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,283
