[Rival Love]
[EP05]

3
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,399
Hurry!

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,559
Report this!

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,079
Miss Su.

6
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,040
Miss Su.

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,480
The general asked me to give you this.

8
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,520
Thanks.

9
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,039
Sir!

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,120
Sir, I have news.

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,279
A body was found

12
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,400
at the old wharf southeast of the city gate.

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
We haven't touched the body

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,959
since we pulled the boat up.

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,400
General,

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,039
I...

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Scared?

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,599
Find out

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,839
who are having weddings in town.

20
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,920
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,280
The dead man's identity is still a mystery.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,199
Now a dead bride.

23
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,599
General, please keep this secret for now.

24
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't want to scare the people.

25
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,039
You're inviting me to work

26
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,560
with you on the case, right?

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,920
With your help,

28
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,479
we will crack the case in no time.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
About the proposal,

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
could you postpone it

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
till further discussion?

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,520
Don't you think you are asking a lot?

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,720
It's late and raining.

34
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:48,920
Zixiu,

35
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,199
take Miss Su home.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,199
This way,

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,640
please.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
I was just asking about the trade permits.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,880
Who knew

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
she'd empty that cup of tea on my face?

41
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,960
And now she's acting

42
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,120
like I'm the one who's done wrong.

43
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,319
Luo.

44
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,440
Apologize.

45
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,960
Mei,

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,560
she's the brazen one

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
coveting the control over the City.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,519
Why do I have to apologize?

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,799
Forgive us, uncle.

50
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,880
I apologize to you and Xue for Luo.

51
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,840
Mei,

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,639
handle this with care.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,519
Don't give grounds for talk.

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,680
I will, mother.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,359
All right, Xue,

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,199
you're older than Luo.

57
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
You shouldn't hold a grudge.

58
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,720
Mei,

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
Luo was still a kid then

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,680
and didn't know about the trade.

61
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,720
But you should know

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,759
that Crescent City

63
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,880
has always been property of the Sus.

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,799
So there's no such thing as "coveting".

65
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:08,560
Uncle,

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,199
you gave the land deed

67
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,680
to my mother

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,160
10 years ago.

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,240
You say

70
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,599
Crescent City belongs to you.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you have any legal proof of that?

72
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,560
This is well-known

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
to everyone.

74
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,599
What evidence do we need?

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,199
Luo and I are from the Sus too.

76
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,400
Water trades

77
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,960
have never been controlled by a woman.

78
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,479
The land deed can only grant you the right

79
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,319
of residence, instead of management.

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,280
Plus,

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,799
how can a girl like you handle it well?

82
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,000
I must remind you

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,359
that you have been separated long ago.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,919
You cannot seize any property of the Sus.

85
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,079
I can handle the trade just fine.

86
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,199
Since you mentioned this,

87
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,960
I guess you have no say

88
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,799
in the marriage with He Jingyao.

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,560
How dare you talk to your uncle

90
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,079
with such insolence?

91
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,399
I'll see you around,

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,959
uncle.

93
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,440
[Luo, be patient.]

94
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,880
[I will make them pay.]

95
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,240
You should focus on the relationship

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,079
between Su Luo

97
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,759
and the Hes as I said.

98
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,680
Why on trade?

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
How could you possibly get the answer?

100
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,240
They could be so arrogant,

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,959
even without the Hes' support.

102
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,600
Think about

103
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,680
how you can

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,279
contact General He more.

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,480
Don't worry about the rest.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, father.

107
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,040
Bride?

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,079
Let's see

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
what he's hiding in here.

110
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,920
[A dead bride on the boat?]

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
[Why did Wei Shiting take pictures of that?]

112
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,519
Wei Shiting.

113
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,800
Yes?

114
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,120
As I said,

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,360
don't act on your own

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
if you wanna work with me.

117
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:08,959
Copy that.

118
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,199
My Lady.

119
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,399
Stop messing with Luo.

120
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,120
She's too innocent

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
to be with someone like you.

122
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,920
Someone like me?

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,680
You and I are not that different, miss.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,959
No wonder

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,719
you walled that room off.

126
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
Where did you get

127
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,399
those scary photos from?

128
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,759
[I'm telling all the girls]

129
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,880
[who like you]

130
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,120
[about your secret habits.]

131
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,920
[They'll all be scared off.]

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,600
I know we are the same.

133
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,440
that's exactly why I don't want you

134
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,279
near Luo.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
You have nothing to worry.

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,719
I am not interested in your sister.

137
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:03,680
Good to know.

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
My Lady,

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,959
Mr. Wei is expecting you in class.

140
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
[Glad we had that cleared up.]

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,000
Perhaps,

142
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,600
they are meant for each other.

143
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,120
Bullseye!

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,560
General...

145
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,040
Speak.

146
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,360
No weddings lately

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,159
or reports of missing girls.

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,279
Last night, people were trapped

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,560
at home in heavy rain.

150
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,959
I'm afraid no witnesses.

151
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,920
Catching the killer would be tricky.

152
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,199
We searched all the hills and woods in town,

153
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,079
but didn't find the pass

154
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,519
to the secret chamber Eclipse mentioned.

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm guessing

156
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,159
it's inside the Su mansion.

157
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,319
But

158
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,480
if Su Mei knew

159
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,719
about the Necklace,

160
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,360
she'd keep it close

161
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
and out of sight.

162
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,639
Her study.

163
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,719
I'm on it.

164
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,279
No need.

165
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,800
I'll go myself.
