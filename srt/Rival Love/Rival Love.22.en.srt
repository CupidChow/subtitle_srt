3
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,921
Don't wait anymore.

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,841
Your father won't be back.

5
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,440
What do you mean?

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,200
Su Qiping has committed suicide.

7
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,240
It will be announced in the newspapers.

8
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,040
You murdered my father?

9
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,920
The family...

10
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes!

11
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:20,360
The head family

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,721
will stand up for us!

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,280
Still dreaming?

14
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,960
You think I don't know

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,841
what you and your sister are up to?

16
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,560
Your sister pretends

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
to be righteous

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but has been

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,320
planning to kill

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,081
my father

21
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,441
and reclaim the family property!

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,481
Say one more word about my sister,

23
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,041
and you'll pay!

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,320
You...

25
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,161
Soldier,

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,121
take her!

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,721
Yes, Sir!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,520
Wait!

29
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:53,800
What are you doing?

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,681
Let go of me!

31
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:55,720
Su Luo,

32
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:56,920
what are you doing?

33
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,280
Your father dislodged us

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,080
to this desolate town

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,200
struggling.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Today,

37
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,041
we will send you to a similar place

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
to experience

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,881
what we went through.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,440
No!

41
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:07,920
Please!

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,881
Let me go!

43
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,000
Move!

44
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:09,601
Su Luo!

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
[I'll talk to head family!]

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,401
[Let go of me!]

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,881
You are really noisy.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,041
What's it to you?

49
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,761
Mind your own business.

50
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:19,241
I...

51
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:20,560
this...

52
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,601
changing faces faster than the weather.

53
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:32,121
Father,

54
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm going to marry He Jingyao.

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
He's the boy I saved

56
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,521
from being buried alive.

57
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you remember?

58
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,200
Uncle,

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
I promise to take good care of Mei

60
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,640
and never let her

61
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,481
suffer again.

62
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:43,760
That's enough.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,641
Why are you here?

64
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,641
Do you really like my sister?

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,521
Yes.

66
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,841
She doesn't love He Jingyao.

67
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,081
She just wants to use

68
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,641
the title of General's wife

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,320
to reclaim your family's assets.

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
I have a way to stop

71
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,681
my sister from marrying He Jingyao.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
You're willing to help me?

73
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,440
Not to help you,

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
but to help my sister.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,040
She has sacrificed

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,280
so much for us.

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,040
She deserves to live for herself now.

78
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,241
General, you rarely smile

79
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,720
before,

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
but now...

81
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,480
love

82
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,321
really changes people.

83
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:14,480
Do you have something to say?

84
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:17,321
I...

85
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,600
I wanted to ask about your engagement.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,001
Your engagement

87
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,480
was with the Miss Su Luo.

88
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,641
If you marry Miss Su Mei,

89
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:26,920
it means to break your promise

90
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,720
to Su Luo?

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Since when

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
do you care about this?

93
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:33,561
I...

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,201
heard that

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,280
breaking an engagement

96
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,800
can ruin

97
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,441
a noble lady's reputation,

98
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,441
making it hard

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,720
for her to marry well in the future.

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,841
Are you concerned about Su Luo?

101
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,120
Just asking casually.

102
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll check

103
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,641
on the troops now.

104
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,321
Sister,

105
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,321
do you really want to marry He Jingyao?

106
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:05,680
Mother and I

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,441
don't need wealth.

108
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:09,201
We're happy living peacefully

109
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,881
in Crescent City.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,841
Luo,

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,841
we can't stay here any longer.

112
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,720
With the ongoing war,

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
our only safe place

114
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,201
is back with the head family.

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,441
But you don't need to

116
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,401
marry He Jingyao to protect us.

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,521
The political situation is volatile.

118
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,040
Things are

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,081
changing rapidly.

120
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,001
Miss Su Luo is acting all mysterious,

121
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,441
insisting you to come here.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,201
What is she up to?

123
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,040
With He's support,

124
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,641
I can challenge

125
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,881
the head family and reclaim

126
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,321
what belongs to father.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Sister,

128
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:44,641
do you love him?

129
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,081
If you don't say,

130
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,401
it means you don't.

131
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,040
Luo,

132
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,240
to control

133
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,280
our fate,

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,441
we must use every resource

135
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,641
and take every possible action.

136
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:09,920
As for He Jingyao...

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,641
General!

138
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,441
Sister,

139
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,001
scold me.

140
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,881
I'm the one who called He Jingyao here.

141
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,841
You don't want me to marry him?

142
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,641
I don't want you

143
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,641
to sacrifice love and freedom

144
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,441
for an ideal life.

145
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,040
Sister,

146
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,521
are you mad at me?

147
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,800
Luo,

148
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,441
if I don't reclaim

149
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,081
our family's assets,

150
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,800
I can't relocate the citizens

151
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,841
of Crescent City.

152
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,081
We could

153
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:48,800
escape by sailing far,

154
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,841
but what about

155
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,881
the poor people here?

156
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:54,321
I...

157
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,201
just want you

158
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,401
to marry someone you truly love.

159
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,280
Love...

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,641
Love is like

161
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,920
holding a torch against the wind.

162
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,720
For me,

163
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,120
it's better

164
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,240
not to love.

165
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:21,641
Sister, where are you going?

166
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
To apologize.

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Scheming woman!

168
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Enough,

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,201
let's not

170
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
talk about this anymore.

171
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,040
General, you've done so much for her,

172
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,441
yet she only uses and manipulates you.

173
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,441
Aren't you angry?

174
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,841
I am,

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
so I plan to not

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,680
speak to her today.

177
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,201
I think

178
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,360
Su Mei is just

179
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,521
after the wealth and power of Yunjing.

180
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:54,480
She doesn't understand love

181
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
and doesn't deserve your affection...

182
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
He Zixiu,

183
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,001
she is not a vain

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
or selfish person.

185
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,401
She is my future wife.

186
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,001
Please respect her.

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
But I think...

188
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,040
Think what?

189
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,441
There are

190
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,001
so many people in this world,

191
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,641
yet she only manipulates me.

192
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:16,800
Why?

193
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,201
Because she knows you'll do

194
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,201
anything for her.

195
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:22,081
Because she only trusts me,

196
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,000
and that's enough.

197
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,321
General,

198
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,640
can we...

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,360
And

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,841
she does

201
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,281
understand love.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,081
She's just afraid to love.

203
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,201
And if she's afraid,

204
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,201
it's my fault.

205
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
General,

206
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:39,640
you're hopeless.

207
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,321
Alright,

208
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,281
leave now.

209
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:45,561
Wait,

210
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,360
if she comes looking for me,

211
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,201
tell the guards

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
not to stop her.

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,281
Wei Shiting?

214
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,640
What is it?

215
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,281
Trying to apologize to He Jingyao?

216
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,880
How did you know?

217
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:31,720
Right now, in his eyes,

218
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,480
you're just

219
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,281
a scheming woman who loves wealth.

220
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,681
Using his feelings

221
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,600
was wrong of me.

222
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,281
If he's angry,

223
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:43,480
he has every right to be.

224
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,720
Since you can't be the General's wife,

225
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,201
why not come with me?

226
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,640
We can travel the world,

227
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,720
watch the sunrise over the North Sea,

228
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,201
see fireworks in Liucheng.

229
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,441
You love piano music, right?

230
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,081
We could go to Europe

231
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:02,961
and listen to the best orchestras!

232
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:03,681
Wei Shiting,

233
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,041
thank you,

234
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,561
but...

235
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,281
Please, don't reject me again, okay?

236
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,921
Please?

237
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,600
You once said

239
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,801
that to control

240
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,240
your fate,

241
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,480
you must use every resource

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,480
and do whatever it takes.

243
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,961
Luo told you that?

244
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Well said, I must admit.

245
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,041
As you said,

246
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,041
keeping the one

247
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,441
you love close

248
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,640
and doing whatever it takes

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
isn't wrong, is it?
