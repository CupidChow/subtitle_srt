[English subtitles are available]

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,378
[Rival Love]
[EP11]

3
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
What's wrong?

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,879
He Jingyao,

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,800
I've told you.

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,679
I need to

7
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,440
make everything clear with you.

8
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:28,879
You're not sober right now.

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,680
Let's talk tomorrow.

10
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,559
Alright?

11
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:32,800
No.

12
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,800
Do we have to stay in this position?

13
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,639
I thought you would

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
like it this way.

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
You used to

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,720
always talk to me like this.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
Holding grudges now?

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,919
You were so hard on me.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Don't you just wanna know

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,480
where the Necklace is?

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,040
What are you doing?

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Put me down.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,600
Don't drink at will

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,199
and flirt with other men like this.

25
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,480
Do you care?

26
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,359
Yes,

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
I do.

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,279
By the way,

29
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,999
Su Qiping has earned

30
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,240
far more money than the value

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,479
of the Necklace and treasures.

32
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,080
He Jingyao,

33
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,319
how about

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
cooperating with me?

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
On what?

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Killing Su Qiping.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Why are you silent?

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Is this what you want?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Alright then,

40
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,800
it's a deal.

41
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,680
Jiu.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,159
Your General

43
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
is so good at capturing people without

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
distinguishing right from wrong.

45
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,120
Did you kill these two brides?

46
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,840
No, I didn't.

47
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,439
Still denying?

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,759
I just dressed two bodies in wedding clothes,

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,520
and placed them on a boat.

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,479
What crime is there?

51
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,800
If you don't trust me,

52
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,439
She can testify for me.

53
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,360
[He Jingyao,]

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
[all of this is part of my plan,]

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,200
[including our reunion.]

56
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,360
[My Lady,]

57
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,439
[the head family's boat is about to dock.]

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,719
[Okay.]

59
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,440
[Xi,]

60
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,039
[what would you do]

61
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,679
[if you discover]

62
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,200
[that the person you wanna use]

63
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,640
[has saved you before?]

64
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,719
[I would tell him the truth,]

65
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:16,919
[so he can repay the debt.]

66
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,520
[That's too boring.]

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,640
[Making him fall in love]

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
[with his savior]

69
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,000
[is the best way to repay.]

70
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,440
[Why do you ask me]

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,039
[to lock you and He Jingyao]

72
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,960
[in my sister's house?]

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,279
[For better cooperation,]

74
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,400
[don't ask questions.]

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,359
He Jingyao,

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,239
I want you to fall in love with me.

77
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,159
Sir,

78
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,000
about the...

79
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,119
She's sleeping.

80
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,159
Alright.

81
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,799
Sir,

82
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,000
I feel like

83
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:22,520
you've changed a lot after knowing

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,919
that Su Mei is Jiu.

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
What's wrong?

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
It's just...

87
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,239
You don't seem as sharp.

88
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,479
How do I look in this outfit?

89
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,159
This outfit?

90
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,039
Haven't you always worn like this?

91
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,599
[General He.]

92
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,200
[Even heroes fall for beauties.]

93
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
Why am I here?

94
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,520
You really don't remember?

95
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,239
It's fine.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,799
Anyway,

97
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,840
don't drink at will from now on,

98
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,640
especially in front of men.

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
[Since you care about me so much,]

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,159
[why not confess my identity?]

101
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,880
[Doesn't it work?]

102
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I know about

103
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,119
your alliance with Wei Shiting

104
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,039
for revenge.

105
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:30,799
Were those women

106
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,400
really not killed by him?

107
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,799
He brought the bodies from the funeral home.

108
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,919
Damn it!

109
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,359
Damn!

110
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,599
Father,

111
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,200
why are you so angry?

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,799
I was informed that

113
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,080
many trade routes to Yunjing

114
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
have been raided by Zhen's Trading House.

115
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,479
And Li hasn't

116
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
come back all night.

117
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,039
Father, don't worry.

118
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,840
Maybe he

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,640
went out on business.

120
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,679
He never leaves my side.

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,039
This is bad.

122
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,840
Very bad.

123
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,919
I said it's a mistake,

124
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,239
but you still kept me handcuffed all night.

125
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,119
Isn't putting wedding dress

126
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:51,679
on bodies

127
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,960
something righteous, is it?

128
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,919
Last night, you even thought

129
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,440
I was gonna poison Miss Su Mei.

130
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,599
Do you all think

131
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,840
so badly of me?

132
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,599
Report!

133
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,520
Sir,

134
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,320
the old man we brought back last night

135
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,080
escaped.

136
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,840
It's the butler Li.

137
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,479
We mustn't let him report to Su Qiping.

138
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,719
Go after him now!

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,159
Yes, sir!
