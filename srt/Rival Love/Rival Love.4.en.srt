[English subtitles are available]

00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:39,811
[Rival Love]
[EP04]

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,439
It's been 10 years.

4
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,759
Mei, Luo,

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,719
you girls have grown into beautiful women.

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
You haven't aged a day, uncle.

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,440
Still as handsome as ever.

8
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,200
Where is your mother?

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,000
She's indisposed.

10
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,200
You'll have to excuse her.

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,279
Luo,

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,119
come.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,759
Let me

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,680
have a closer look at you.

15
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:30,399
My Lord.

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,480
My apologies, uncle.

17
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,959
I'm fine. No worries.

18
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:44,520
Mr. Su,

19
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,279
I invite you over

20
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:50,080
to discuss my proposal to Miss Su Luo.

21
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,679
I'm afraid I have to turn it down.

22
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,120
Not trying to be rude,

23
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,239
but it's been a rule of the Sus

24
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,039
that we honor seniority.

25
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,039
The younger sister

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,160
must not marry before her older sister.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,759
Does that mean

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,560
you would approve if I were to propose

29
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,440
to Miss Su Mei?

30
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,440
Um...

31
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,479
that is not what I mean either.

32
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,119
I see you want to be

33
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,520
on the opposite side of the Hes.

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,039
There is no such thing, general.

35
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,360
Marriages are major affairs of a family.

36
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,479
I've had a long trip today

37
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,679
and am exhausted.

38
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,160
Why don't we

39
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,640
discuss it another time?

40
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,199
Why would Su Qiping suddenly

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,959
change his mind?

42
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,800
He's got his hands on Su Qi'an's property

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,319
when Su Qi'an died.

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,119
He must be worried that the two girls

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,479
will use my power to make a comeback.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Why would he come here

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
if he wanna refuse the marriage?

48
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm afraid

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,479
he plans to shove his own daughter my way.

50
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,240
Someone came in here.

51
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,880
[Su Qiping has sent someone for the Necklace.]

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,599
The men in black from the other night

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,680
and the dead man at the wharf

54
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,479
were sent by Su Qiping

55
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,120
to look for the Necklace.

56
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,880
This Eclipse certainly

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,199
lives up to its reputation.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,359
Dug it out

59
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,519
within half a day.

60
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,160
They even managed to

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,639
send the message to my room.

62
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,880
This means Eclipse

63
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,639
has its men planted in Crescent City.

64
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,280
Xue, find out what the deal is

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,359
between Su Luo and He Jingyao

66
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,880
and the sudden marriage proposal.

67
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,479
Yes, father.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,079
Xue,

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,240
you go and get some rest.

70
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,440
My Lord,

71
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,479
no secret chambers found in the Su mansion.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,479
Keep going.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,639
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,400
Li,

75
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,560
do you think the Necklace really

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,479
has a treasure map in it?

77
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,799
Beats me, sir.

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Cost me a fortune

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,799
to buy the information off Eclipse,

80
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,960
saying it hidden in the secret chamber.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,079
They wouldn't

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,240
dare to fool me, their livelihood

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,079
depends on selling information.

84
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,479
Then the Necklace

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,359
must be in town.

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,960
Even it's not,

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,039
I can use this trip

88
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,639
for the business here

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,079
and build relations with the Hes.

90
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:33,560
Wei Shiting.

91
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,880
I've told you many times.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
Knock before you enter.

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,279
You're hurt.

94
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,240
That's a lot of blood.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,839
It's not mine.

96
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,600
You slaughtered a chicken?

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
No.

98
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,839
I killed a man.

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,959
Enough with your jokes.

100
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,839
It was paint last time.

101
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm not falling for it this time.

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,759
Didn't fool you, I guess.

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,279
Laugh at me all you want.

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
Listen, the head family

105
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,279
didn't approve of the marriage.

106
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,880
So even if I wanna marry He Jingyao,

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm not allowed to.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,839
I know who you're worried about.

109
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,440
Mei doesn't have to marry him either.

110
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,560
Cool.

111
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,399
Happy now?

112
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,759
Luo,

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,240
I've said many times.

114
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,800
I stood up for Mei that day

115
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,959
because she is a good friend.

116
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,839
I don't want her

117
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,440
to sacrifice her marriage for the family.

118
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
That's it.

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,759
Then can you stay here

120
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
and continue teaching me?

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't get any ideas.

122
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,759
I'm not in love with you.

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
Why would I?

124
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,480
How could you do so with

125
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
a lousy teacher like me?

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,399
Yesterday,

127
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,680
I was just mad at you

128
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,560
wanting me to marry that villain.

129
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,399
We've

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,199
spent time together.

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,680
But you only cared about my sister,

132
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,079
and didn't care what happened to me.

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Wei Shiting.

134
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,959
It's going to rain.

135
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,440
Let me take you home.

136
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,759
Miss Su.

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
No explanation?

138
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,839
You're sneaking around my dad's grave

139
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,040
last night

140
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
but said you're taking a walk.

141
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,480
Didn't expect me to believe you, did you?

142
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,839
Since you weren't honest with me,

143
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,880
I have to check it out myself.

144
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,360
What did you find then?

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,560
Untie me first.

146
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,279
Sneaking into a man's room

147
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,000
at midnight.

148
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,040
You've quite the audacity.

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Are you from Eclipse?

150
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

151
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
Then let's bring all people here

152
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,319
and show them

153
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,839
your performance as a thief.

154
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
I've never heard of Eclipse.

155
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,399
You humiliated me.

156
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,840
That gun

157
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
is empty.

158
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,039
You want to bet on it?

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,759
General!

160
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Get out.

161
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
Scarier than the thunder.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
So annoying.

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
Rain again.

164
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,600
Luo...

165
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,399
Zhang.

166
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,679
Hurry.

167
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,480
In the wardrobe.

168
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,240
Get the best one.

169
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
What is it you want?

170
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,240
C'mon, can't see you unless I want something?

171
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,799
Cut to the chase, please.

172
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,720
This morning,

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
I had a walk around the wharf,

174
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,439
and found many western trade ships.

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,799
I'm wondering how we can get

176
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,639
trade permits around here?

177
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,039
Come on,

178
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,639
let's be clear.

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,639
We're not in the same boat!

180
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,200
Luo,

181
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,200
Crescent City

182
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,679
has always been property of the Sus.

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,840
When Uncle passed in the accident,

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,439
my father was kind enough

185
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:06,480
to let you live here.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Now that

187
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,759
you've become age,

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
it's time

189
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,120
to return the City to us.

190
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,679
Get lost!

191
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,240
You...

192
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,559
Shut up.

193
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Get the hell out.

194
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Now!

195
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,480
Don't try to cotton up to me.

196
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,080
Stupid.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
Just wait and see.

198
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,720
The gun

199
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,159
is too heavy for you.

200
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,080
A gun is a gun.

201
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,439
I'll level with you, general.

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
I came to

203
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,679
find out why you want to marry a Su

204
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,600
and what it has to do with my father.

205
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
So, what have you

206
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,039
found out?

207
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,159
All planned down to the smallest detail.

208
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,559
I didn't find anything.

209
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,200
Rest assured.

210
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,519
I have no interest

211
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,799
in the Sus

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,559
or your father's grave.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Then cancel the proposal

214
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,639
and leave Luo alone.

215
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,600
So,

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
you're not surprised that Su Qiping

217
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,439
would say no.

218
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,799
It's my bad for visiting the grave

219
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,559
last night.

220
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,439
So I won't hold you accountable

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,799
for your actions today.

222
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,240
However,

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,480
you won't

224
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,159
get off this easy

225
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,919
next time.
