3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,759
Let's go.

4
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,240
Leave, if you dare.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,040
What are you doing?

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,479
Miss Su, you haven't answered.

7
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,199
Wedding in ten days.

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,920
Is that a yes?

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,399
Madame.

10
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,479
Madame.

11
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,160
I will marry you.

12
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,359
Good answer,

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,399
my lady.

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,960
We're leaving.

15
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,080
My lady.

16
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:56,080
My Lady.

17
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:56,999
Bad news.

18
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,080
There's a dead body at the wharf.

19
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,080
I passed here on my way home from fishing

20
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,559
and found him here,

21
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,359
covered in blood

22
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,559
and dead.

23
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,279
A lightning bolt mark on his neck.

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,040
Chest penetrated by an arrow.

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,359
Estimated

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,440
time of death is between 1 to 3 am.

27
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,639
Is he local?

28
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,240
[Never]

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,479
[Never seen him.]

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,800
[I can't say for sure.]

31
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,160
[There're a few thousand people in town.]

32
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,359
[I can't know all of them.]

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,199
You may go.

34
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,600
Yes.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
You're not scared?

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,399
He's not from here.

37
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,240
And you know everyone in town?

38
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:39,120
There're 2632 people in this town.

39
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,079
I know all the faces

40
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,400
of the regular boat crews passing through.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,239
Him

42
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,000
I've never seen before.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,720
Nor does he have calluses in his hands

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
from pulling towropes.

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,280
He's not a boatman.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,479
General, do your men

47
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,639
keep records of shifts?

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,679
Did anyone leave the troop at any point?

49
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,759
You suspect my men?

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,679
Crescent City folks live a simple life.

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,919
Before you showed up,

52
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,560
there had never been murders.

53
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,479
Men,

54
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,880
take the body back for thorough examination.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
So we can offer Miss Su here

56
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,479
an answer.

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,880
Wait.

58
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,239
Crescent City is under my jurisdiction.

59
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,040
Murder cases

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,160
naturally are my responsibility.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
Carry the body away.

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,160
Yes.

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
General He,

64
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,120
if I may ask,

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,239
why are you here?

66
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,560
To marry my sister or investigate murders?

67
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,440
Both.

68
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,239
The Sus are no

69
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
prestigious family.

70
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,840
But we will not be trampled on.

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,639
Meaning?

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
Marriages

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
of the Su families

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,519
have always been decided by the head family.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,199
If you truly want to marry Su Luo,

76
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,040
you must discuss it with the head family.

77
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,160
Zixiu.

78
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,479
Yes.

79
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,639
Send a letter to the Su head family.

80
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,440
Ask them to come here for a discussion.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Yes.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,359
Wei Shiting,

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,040
explain it to me.

84
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,440
Why didn't you care

85
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,759
if I married He Jingyao

86
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,280
but you wouldn't let my sister marry him?

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,079
It's late.

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,519
You should get some rest, Luo.

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,959
You're not going anywhere until you talk.

90
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,040
Because you are willful and headstrong

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,359
and never does anything you don't want to.

92
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,639
Even if He were to point a gun

93
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,600
at you,

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
you wouldn't yield if you don't want to.

95
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,239
But your sister

96
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,040
What about my sister?

97
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,999
She's gentle, humble,

98
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,439
restraint and proper.

99
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,999
Always

100
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,400
has our family's honor in mind.

101
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,799
Always doing things she doesn't like.

102
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,160
Always sacrificing herself

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,239
for me and Mother.

104
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,400
Even if it means

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,439
to marry someone she loathes.

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
You like my sister.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,559
Mei

108
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,280
Do you know

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,799
why I'm punishing you?

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,799
I do, mother.

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,600
You must remember at all times

112
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,239
that you are the head of the family.

113
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,160
That means always keep your family

114
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,799
as top priority

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
through good times or bad.

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,679
You should never be held back by your emotions.

117
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,479
That is a dangerous road.

118
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,799
Mother,

119
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,840
There is nothing

120
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,200
between me and Mr. Wei.

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
We're just friends.

122
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,359
The marriage is not a done deal yet.

123
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,960
I've told He Jingyao

124
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,080
the marriage must be approved by the head family.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
You know how much I hate the head family.

126
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,720
Why would you

127
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
involve them in Luo's marriage?

128
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,999
I have a plan

129
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,799
I would never marry Luo

130
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:04,999
to someone she doesn't love.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,479
My lady.

132
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,679
Are you ok?

133
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,679
Her ladyship is not being fair.

134
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,879
You have done so much

135
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,239
for this family.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,640
Yet she didn't have anything nice to say.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,280
Xi,

138
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
you shouldn't say that about Mother.

139
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,280
What's all the fuss down there?

140
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,040
It's the Moon-worshipping Day of Crescent City.

141
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,239
The folks come to worship the moon, making sacrifices.

142
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
Who'd think a murder would pop up.

143
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,840
General, who do you think

144
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,439
is behind this?

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Seems Crescent City is under

146
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,840
many watchful eyes.

147
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,720
Crescent City.

148
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:00,640
Crescent Necklace.

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,559
[Our intelligence says after Su Qi'an died]

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,400
Crescent City is left

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
with vast treasure.

152
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,760
Did Su Mei turn down the marriage proposal

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,999
because the treasure is in the Su mansion

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,960
and she knew

155
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,280
you were here for it?

156
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,080
What's that?

157
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Su Mei's study.

158
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,760
Word is its light burns throughout the night.

159
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,760
Passing boats

160
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,799
use it as a road sign

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
and nicknamed it Eternal Light Pavilion.

162
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,840
It's gained quite a name for itself.

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Word on the street is

164
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,679
Miss Su is a gentle soft soul.

165
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,439
But she seems to me a calm and sharp woman.

166
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,760
Very intelligent.

167
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,239
It's a shame.

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
What is?

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,760
She is weighed down by family affairs,

170
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,679
confining herself,

171
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,679
rather than seeing the big picture.

172
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,760
I've always wanted to ask.

173
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Why would your ladyship

174
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
keep the light on in the study every night?

175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
For the ships on the sea,

176
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,239
the light

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,840
provides hope.

178
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,879
When in the dark,

179
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,799
all we need is a little light.

180
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,679
My lady, you've worked so hard today.

181
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,840
Rest now.

182
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,799
You shouldn't stay up late again.

183
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,799
Fine.

184
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll sleep after I finish reading the accounts of the ships.

185
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,960
You go and get some rest.

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,879
General,

187
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,079
we have less than month.

188
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,000
Where is Su Qi'an's grave?

189
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,319
[It's all coming together.]

190
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,760
[That's not good.]

191
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,199
[It's father's grave.]

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,319
Who's there?
