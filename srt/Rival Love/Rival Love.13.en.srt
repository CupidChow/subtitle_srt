[Rival Love]
[EP13]

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,559
My Lady,

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,439
the bedtime soup.

5
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,080
Thanks.

6
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,400
You can go back to rest.

7
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:04,759
My Lady,

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,120
why are you also attracted

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,879
to the picture books of Tomato Bookstore?

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
For study.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,480
Sir, why not admit her identity to her

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,559
and confess your affection?

13
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,160
She doesn't have feelings for me now,

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,080
and she has worries to deal with.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,919
I don't wanna

16
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,440
add more trouble to her.

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,519
Do you

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,279
really plan to get engaged to Su Luo?

19
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:36,999
Yes.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,760
Su Qiping is

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,480
meticulous.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,279
The dirty money he's earned

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,319
must be

24
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,279
in the safe he carries with him.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,720
Su Mei

26
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,519
can't get close enough to check.

27
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm the best person to do it.

28
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,799
What does this have to do

29
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,680
with the engagement?

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,919
Why so many questions?

31
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,880
Find a way to tell Su Qiping

32
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,120
that I'm marrying Su Luo for

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,199
the Crescent Necklace.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,159
Understood.

35
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,919
You may go.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,520
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,439
Does she really like Wei Shiting?

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,040
Does she

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
have any feelings for me now?

40
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,520
My Lord,

41
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,439
we've got nothing about secret chambers.

42
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,320
Could the information

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
from the Eclipse be wrong?

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,480
Impossible.

45
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,520
That can never happen.

46
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,039
Could it be

47
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,960
that Su Qi'an had found the treasure

48
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,999
and hidden it secretly in the city?

49
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,920
Searched the Su mansion already?

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,999
General He's soldiers are guarding there,

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,479
making it hard to search.

52
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,159
Try looking in Su Mei's study.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
I didn't expect

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,840
to find any treasure during this visit.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
But Su Mei's attitude

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,240
is quite tough.

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,279
In a few days,

59
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,439
if she still doesn't comply,

60
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,240
just end her.

61
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,439
Got it.

62
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,279
How can here be nothing?

63
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,279
Mei.

64
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,120
Someone!

65
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,080
Keep it down.

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,559
If you want to live, be quiet.

67
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,240
Wei Shiting,

68
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,120
someone just tried to kill me.

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Alright,

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,759
it's fine now.

71
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,080
No,

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
we must catch him.

73
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,319
We need to keep this a secret.

74
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:52,920
[My Lady,]

75
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,039
[you really don't like anyone?]

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,479
[Xi,]

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,439
[when you're burdened with too much,]

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,080
[you can't relax even for a moment.]

79
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,679
[My mind is always calculating,]

80
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
[seemingly controlling everything,]

81
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,599
[but in fact, I'm like a bird in a cage.]

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,320
[If I could enjoy a moment of freedom,]

83
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,000
[that would be fortunate enough.]

84
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,560
[How could I dare to love someone?]

85
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,039
Sir,

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,679
please row faster.

87
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:25,960
Alright.

88
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,200
[The voice sounds familiar.]

89
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,119
Who are you?

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,239
Where's Mr. Zhang?

91
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,159
Why are you here?

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,359
I've already ordered to lock the city,

93
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,719
yet you're

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,919
still trying to sneak out at night.

95
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,919
Do you always like

96
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,479
to follow your partners?

97
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,239
Greenstone Island

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
is full of Su Qiping's spies.

99
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,880
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

100
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,039
Since we're partners,

101
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,320
I must ensure your safety.

102
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,560
How many spies do you have in the Sus?

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,679
What about you?

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Why do you

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,279
secretly go to Greenstone Island

106
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,760
every half month?

107
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,919
He Jingyao,

108
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,880
are you okay?

109
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:44,479
Were you

110
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,320
just worried about me?

111
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,200
My illness

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,599
only flares up

113
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,760
in confined spaces.

114
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,119
Alright.

115
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,279
Let's keep going.

116
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,799
Why didn't you let me call for help?

117
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,279
It's nothing.

118
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,080
I just didn't want to alarm anyone.

119
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,159
You're afraid that if the situation blew up,

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,400
Mei would be found out not here, right?

121
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm not as foolish as you think.

122
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,599
I went to Mei's room first.

123
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,560
She wasn't there, so I went to the study.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,840
Yes,

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
you're quite clever.

126
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,560
Where did Mei go?

127
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,880
How could I know?

128
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,840
You both are hiding something from me.

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
It's nothing good.

130
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
Mei doesn't want you to know.

131
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:30,640
It's late now,

132
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,520
get some rest.

133
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:32,919
I'll ask just once.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,520
What?

135
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,440
Are your feelings

136
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,520
for my sister real?

137
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:42,919
Yes.

138
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,679
Well then.

139
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,320
Go now.

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,840
It's not safe

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
for you to go alone at night.

142
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't

143
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:13,880
do that

144
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
again.

145
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
You still don't trust me.

146
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,639
My Lord,

147
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,399
the arrows that killed our men earlier

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,359
were the same type with this.

149
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,719
It turns out

150
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,879
someone in the Su mansion is behind this.

151
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,879
Did you see the face?

152
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:48,999
No.

153
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,519
If it's someone in the mansion,

154
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,879
we'll find out soon.

155
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,160
Nothing unusual in Su Mei's study?

156
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,840
Have you checked it all?

157
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,759
Yes,

158
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,719
nothing at all.

159
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,719
Could the chamber not be in the mansion?

160
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Just got news,

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,239
He Jingyao is also

162
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,040
after the Crescent Necklace.

163
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,999
No wonder I feel he's been targeting me.

164
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,119
He's afraid I'll take what he wants.

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,879
Then we'll see

166
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,040
who gets it first.
