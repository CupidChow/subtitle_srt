1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:39,811
[Rival Love]
[EP19]

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,640
Guo.

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
What's going on?

5
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,959
My Lady.

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,039
When I took over Zhen from your father,

7
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:08,919
[I've been doing the job]

8
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,239
[conscientiously.]

9
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,640
I haven't failed him, have I?

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,399
Sure.

11
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,640
Thanks to you all these years.

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Su Xue was right.

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,120
You're the one who stands

14
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,519
behind Zhen.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,639
[My Lady.]

16
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,879
[They've taken away my wife and son.]

17
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,199
I'm at my wit's end.

18
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,800
The same style as 10 years ago.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,239
Is that all he's got?

20
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,239
You've got some balls

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,240
[to mess around with Wei Shiting]

22
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,320
and tangle deliberately with Mr. Su

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,760
in the name of Zhen.

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,559
What?

25
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,279
Do you think

26
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,439
you can avenge your father like this?

27
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,880
You have the Necklace, don't you?

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,999
Hand over.

29
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,199
I'll spare your life.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,240
Don't move.

31
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,999
He Jingyao!

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
We must kill him,

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,439
or we won't be able to survive!

34
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,159
Go!

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,719
[He Jingyao!]

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
Do you trust me?

37
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,479
General!

38
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,159
Live or death.

39
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,240
Take them all.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Daddy.

41
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,279
Good news!

42
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,360
What

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,279
for?

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,200
I've been following Su Mei for long

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
and found that she often secretly

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
travels back and forth to the Island.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,240
I speculate

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,759
that she has close relations with Zhen.

49
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,800
Su Mei and Zhen?

50
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,360
How can that be?

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,800
Yesterday I contacted

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Zhen's steward.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
As expected,

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,039
after being scared,

55
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,479
he confessed everything.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,479
[She's been]

57
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,400
[hiding behind for years,]

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,999
instigating Zhen to snatch many orders.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,279
I seem to underestimate her.

60
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,360
Taking over the control of the city

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,879
should be no picnic.

62
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,479
Don't worry, Daddy.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
I've sent Wu

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,479
to clean that up.

65
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,439
He Jingyao.

66
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,599
Hold on!

67
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:55,400
He Jingyao.

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,640
He Jingyao!

69
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:58,800
Calm down.

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm fine.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,599
Hang in there.

72
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,800
I have to get the bullet out first.

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,599
Hold on!

74
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Are you hurt?

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
No.

76
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,479
Good.

77
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,520
Where are we?

78
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,119
A cave under my study.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,239
So,

80
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,679
you're planning to come here

81
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,760
before jumping off the cliff?

82
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,679
My study

83
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,640
was built when my father was alive.

84
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,799
There is a secret passage

85
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,799
inside the cave

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,719
connecting to the sea.

87
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,039
It's for emergencies.

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,799
No wonder your family

89
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,760
has thrived until now.

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,479
But most people

91
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,760
have forgotten the family motto.

92
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:54,799
Wait a minute.

93
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,039
Almost done.

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,119
What's that?

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,279
There's no such thing as a dead end.

96
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,679
If no way out,

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,560
forge a new one.

98
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:18,919
[Luo.]

99
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
I'm worrying about you!

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,440
Why did you come back

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,159
so late?

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,239
Mom.

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,719
Where's my sister?

104
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,279
This is what I'm about to ask.

105
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,880
She's not back.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,119
[Su Qiping killed my sister]

107
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,039
[and your father.]

108
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,440
[He wants this city,]

109
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,000
[guess who]

110
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,560
[he's gonna kill next?]

111
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
[Something happened.]

112
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,320
These wounds

113
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,440
are all from the battle?

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
It's nothing.

115
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
Normal occurrence

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,760
on the battlefield.

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,560
Aren't you curious

118
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,000
Why did I take a bullet for you?

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,080
Tell me the reason.

120
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,400
You don't know that?

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,239
Jiu.

122
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,200
You intentionally trapped us both

123
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,760
in the old house

124
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,200
and pretended

125
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,799
to be drunk, right?

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,560
Su Mei.

127
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,640
You don't have to do so.

128
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,679
I'm willing to be used by you,

129
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,840
even die for you if you want.

130
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,279
Why?

131
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,719
Because I love you.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
What's wrong?

133
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,440
If there were

134
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,039
any other man

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
instead of me today,

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,640
would you choose the same way?

137
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Are you angry?

138
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,479
Go change the dress

139
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,320
to avoid catching a cold.

140
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,520
Why hasn't Wu come back yet?

141
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,280
Done or not?

142
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,280
Daddy.

143
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,560
Take it easy.

144
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
Wu is always reliable.

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,840
Never goes wrong.

146
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
And

147
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,200
how can a weak girl

148
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,440
like Su Mei resist?

149
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,399
Su Mei built Zhen

150
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,080
and has worked with Wei Shiting

151
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
for long...

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
If these were all aimed at me,

153
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,440
would she

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,200
have known

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,999
how her father died and

156
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
lured me into the city on purpose?

157
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,560
It must be!

158
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
She's hidden the ambitions so deep.

159
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,999
I'm afraid

160
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,840
she's planning to take away

161
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,399
not only our business,

162
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,160
but the head family's property in Yunjing.

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,999
But

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,560
her plan

165
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,879
is no longer important.

166
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,759
Wu hasn't come back,

167
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,879
he must be...

168
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,160
Who is there?

169
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,519
[I am]

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,599
[Su Luo.]
