00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
I guarantee their skills.

9
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,560
And they can start right away from next week.

10
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,333
Okay, I'll report this.

11
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,760
Anyway, are you dropping out for real?

12
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm sorry, sir.

13
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
For troubling you that time.

14
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
And thank you.

15
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,080
Thanks to you, I might pay off my debt in no time.

16
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,240
Have a safe trip home.

17
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's grab a meal together before we wrap up.

Wait!

29
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Hello.

30
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
Boss isn't here.

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,600
I see.

32
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

33
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,960
Gosh.

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Han Beom-jae.

36
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm sleepy.

37
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
I stayed up all night,
and I'm about to die.

38
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,880
I wonder how much they're making.

39
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,720
Who knows?

40
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,960
The Yuseong Gang members...

41
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
do all the charging and exchanging work.

42
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,760
What about the number of users?

43
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Even Si-deok can't access the database these days.

44
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,480
They've installed a firewall and security program.

45
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,560
Why? What is it?

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Think about it.

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,600
We both received double the amount promised.

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,440
- That means...
- The sales must be twice higher.

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,360
We worked hard for nothing.

50
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
But what can we do?

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,520
Take it away from them? Fight them?

52
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,775
There's nothing we can do.

53
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,007
We'll just take the money they give
and leave quietly.

54
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm going back to sleep.

55
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,800
THE CENTRAL CRUISE HOTEL

56
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
When is the gambling house scheduled to open?

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
We'll have to postpone it a little.

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,080
We're not getting as many
customers these days.

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Is it because of the inspection?

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,120
Gosh, darn it.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
- Assemblyman Park, congratulations. - Gosh.

62
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,480
Thank you.

63
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,480
- Have you been well? - Yes.

64
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,960
- Gosh. - Congratulations.

65
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
Goodness.

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Congratulations on winning, Assemblyman Park.

67
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,280
I've been elected a long time ago.

68
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
You're quite slow...

69
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
when it comes to these things.

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,640
MARINE RESORT COMPLEX BUSINESS

71
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,920
Anyway, will it be realized this time?
The resort.

72
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,520
Don't worry.

73
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,280
The marine development industry...

74
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
...will be pushed ahead within this year.

75
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
Then, the tourist industry...

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
...will definitely benefit along with it.

77
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,080
It will be smooth sailing.

78
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
That's nice.

79
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, Mr. Seo.

80
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,160
Say hello.

81
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,472
This is President Seo Do-young.

82
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
He runs a consulting company.

83
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,270
It's nice to meet you. I'm Seo Do-young.

84
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,295
What a young business owner.
It's nice to meet you.

85
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Assemblyman Park.

86
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,640
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, madam.

87
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
Long time no see, sir.

88
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,520
Are you acquainted with each other?

89
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
We have a long history.

90
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,320
I used to learn how to work under him.

91
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
We used to be business partners for a bit too.

92
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Business partners? What business?

93
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
House.

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
House?

95
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,040
House... You mean housing development?

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,840
Did you do work in that field too?

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,880
Let's talk for a bit, Mr. Seo.

98
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,560
Go on ahead.

99
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,480
What's gotten into you, coming here?

100
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,280
Your share for the nightclub business.

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,560
It's heavy.

102
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,880
Did I put in too much?

103
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
Let's part ways now.

104
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
Are you behind what happened to Hae-jun?

105
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
It's you, right?

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
And you joined hands with Park Choong-ho.

107
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,440
It has me wondering too.

108
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,480
Was it me or not?

109
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,960
I hope it's not too heavy for you to carry.

110
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,920
MARINE RESORT COMPLEX BUSINESS BRIEFING

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,000
HAN DONG-SOO

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,560
Are you home?

113
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,320
Could I visit you right now?

114
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Sure, come.

115
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>First...</i>

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

117
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
What?

118
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,040
No. Don't.

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Doesn't it feel like a dream?

120
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
You know, there are times when you wish...

121
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
...what you caused were a dream.

122
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,200
Here's information on the new programmers.

123
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,720
Si-deok recommended them.

124
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,880
They're quite skilled too.

125
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,280
I always wanted to know how much
Kim Jae-yeol made.

126
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
It seemed like I was doing all the work.

127
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Everyone is the same.

128
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,080
Well, I'll get going.

129
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,880
The takeover process will be over next week.

130
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
Then my brother and I will drop out.

131
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Tell me if you need anything.

132
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,800
You're moving to another country.

133
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
We're friends.

134
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
I want to help.

135
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
Right.

136
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,440
Bye, then.

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,880
Keep a close eye on Han Dong-soo.

138
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,920
Welcome.

139
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SMOKING CANDY

140
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
Just a moment.

141
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Give me a pack of Wild Plus...

142
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
...and a lighter, please.

143
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Gosh.

144
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I didn't know you smoked.

145
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,360
Well, I was torn on whether to smoke or not.

146
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,560
It's been two years.

147
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,200
That won't do.

148
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Let me help you.

149
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
We're in the same situation.

150
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,960
I quit smoking six months ago too.

151
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,960
Gosh, I'm swayed many times a day.

152
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,360
Whether to smoke or not.

153
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,920
Is something bothering you?

154
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
An acquaintance I know...

155
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,960
...won the lottery.

156
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,120
I didn't care when I didn't know who won.

157
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,400
But to know it was my acquaintance,

158
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,560
it felt strange.

159
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,200
I pushed him...

160
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,360
...to buy that lottery ticket.

161
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
I gave him the numbers too.

162
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,200
Oh, dear.

163
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
I felt...

164
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
...a little jealous.

165
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,320
And later on,

166
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,640
it felt...

167
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,520
...inexplicably empty.

168
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,040
I thought I had lived my life to the fullest,

169
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
but it felt like nothing.

170
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
As if my life...

171
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,480
...was worth less than a lottery ticket.

172
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,200
I feel the same way sometimes.

173
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
When I confiscate the proceeds of crime.

174
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
It's several times bigger than my salary,

175
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,040
which is a huge downer.

176
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
There are tons of people...

177
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,960
...who earn and spend money so easily.

178
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
It has me wondering what I'm doing.

179
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,880
But most people struggle in life like us.

180
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,560
They are the ones who support this world.

181
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
Well, why don't we get going?

182
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,640
If we stay longer,
we might really want to smoke.

183
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,360
Sure.

184
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,840
Oh, right.

185
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,480
Here.

186
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
If it's a winning ticket, treat me.

187
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,600
This is the fun of living, isn't it?

188
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,160
And if you have any concerns,
tell me anytime.

189
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,240
Pardon?

190
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
You know, like the noisy neighbor...

191
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,160
...you mentioned the other day.

192
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,280
Sure.

193
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Not to mention my payment,

194
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm worried about her.

195
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,520
Yes, I know.

196
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,920
But only immediate family
can report someone missing.

197
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,320
Wait patiently for now.

198
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
We'll look into it and give you a call.

199
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,640
All right.

200
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,360
- Have a good day.
- You too.

201
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,560
Goodness, this is not good.

202
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,880
What was that about?

204
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Her boss isn't opening
the store without any notice.

205
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,720
She won't answer her phone either.

206
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Which store is it?

207
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
It's a bar.

208
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
Misty Purple?

209
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,520
How did it go?

210
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,440
You were right.

211
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
It's certain...

212
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,480
Seo Do-young made a connection with Park Choong-ho.

213
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,200
Did you look into why Han Dong-soo...

214
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,840
...and Seo Do-young joined hands?

215
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
That...

216
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,863
I'm not sure.

217
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
First,

218
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,640
stop Seo Do-young's money source.

219
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,120
So he can't move.

220
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,840
And keep looking into how they joined hands.

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
What is it? Darn...

222
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,600
Seo Do-young runs an Internet cafe?

223
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes.

224
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,760
It opened a month ago.

225
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Rumors say it's doing really well.

226
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,560
An Internet cafe is his way
of raking in all the money?

227
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,120
Hey, you moron.

228
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,560
This is why you can't beat Seo Do-young.

229
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
How much could you make
by running an Internet cafe?

230
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,920
Look properly into it.

231
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,000
What his money source is,

232
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,680
and why he opened an Internet cafe.

233
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Do you understand?

234
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
If I get caught,

235
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,640
he won't even let me collect money.

236
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
I need some kind of insurance.

237
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,960
Hey, are you trying to bargain with me?

238
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,200
It's not that, sir.

239
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,560
Why do you think Seo Do-young kept you alive?

240
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Because he adores you? No.

241
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
If you weren't Kim Yu-seong's nephew,

242
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,320
he'd have killed you already.

243
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,160
You remember, right?

244
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,200
You came to me first.

245
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,480
What do you think will happen...

246
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,640
if Do-young finds that out?

247
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,120
I don't think he'll keep you alive twice.

248
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,440
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

249
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,080
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

250
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,880
- Happy birthday - Happy birthday

251
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
- Dear Granny - Dear Granny

252
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

253
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Mom.

254
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Mom, you have to blow out the candles.

255
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
Right.

256
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,520
Wait, Mother. You have to make a wish.

257
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,840
If you make a wish...

258
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
...before blowing them out, it'll come true.

259
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,400
A wish?

260
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
A wish...

261
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
I know what your wish is.

262
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,720
A hundred bags of yakgwa.

263
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,800
I hear a rat squeaking again.

264
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm not a rat. I'm Min-hee.

265
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,680
Stay quiet.

266
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,840
My wish...

267
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,960
...is for Dong-soo...

268
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,160
...to live comfortably.

269
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,680
Not doing anything hard...

270
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
...and making a lot of money...

271
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,327
...so he can live in comfort.

272
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
That's all I need.

273
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,480
And this brat coming to his senses.

274
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,040
What? What kind of wish is that?

275
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,680
Is this some kind of discrimination?

276
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,920
- Gosh, you.
- Come on.

277
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,800
Hurry up and blow them out.

278
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
Otherwise, all your wishes won't come true.

279
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
It's good, right?

280
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
It's better than yakgwa, right?

281
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,560
You can have a cake like this every day...

282
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
...until you get sick of it
once we move to Australia.

283
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,360
Gosh, I can't wait to go.

284
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,800
I'll get to see kangaroos and koalas.

285
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,520
It'll be so much fun.

286
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,160
Come on, Grandma!

287
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,360
Mister.

288
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,840
Try this.

289
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,520
It's really good.

290
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
Here.

291
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
Thank you.

292
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,800
Darn it!

293
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
Seriously...

294
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,520
What will you do about this? Gosh.

295
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
It's good, right?

296
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,720
Darn it.

297
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
You told Seo Do-young that we're quitting, right?

298
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes.

299
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
You've really made up your mind, right?

300
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
It seemed like you were hesitating.

301
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,520
When?

302
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,040
You did.

303
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
I'm glad Min Hee seems to like the idea.

304
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
But will Mom be okay there?

305
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,320
What if she sets things on fire in Australia too?

306
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,960
It's warm there.

307
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,160
She only does it when it's cold.

308
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Dong-soo.

309
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
I got you red bean buns.

310
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
<i>The house we used to live in.</i>

311
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,840
<i>It was heated with briquettes.</i>

312
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
<i>Back then, I was young too.</i>

313
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,120
<i>I didn't know what briquettes could do,</i>

314
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,560
<i>so every time she went to work,</i>

315
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
<i>it must've weighed on her mind.</i>

316
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
<i>Once it went out,</i>

317
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,840
<i>I had to stay in the cold room the whole day.</i>

318
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,240
That's why...

319
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
she always carried around a matchbox in her pocket.

320
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,320
Honey!

321
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,880
Her discharge next week.

322
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,400
They need your signature.

323
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,880
Okay.

Give a card each.

327
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000

I'll meet them first...

I'll meet them myself.

345
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
I need to choose one who's as good as you.

346
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I'll set the date.

347
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,520
Are you sure?

348
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,560
That we can avoid
the inspection within five minutes?

349
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
Without leaving any evidence?

350
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes. You don't have to worry about it.

351
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,960
...until it happens.

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,360
I need to check on that...

354
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
to be able to keep my word.

355
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,560

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,000
Move the car! How many times must I say it?

373
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
- Move!
- What are you doing?

374
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
If you moved it earlier,

375
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,600
this wouldn't have happened.

376
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,240
- Darn it. We're busy as is.
- Move it.

377
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,400
- Will you move each one?
- Let's get in!

378
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,120
How can you park your car here and leave?

379
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,240
Hey!

380
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,800
Even if it's online gambling,

381
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
there could be inspections.

382
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,800
But you don't have to worry.

383
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,600
They won't be able to find the evidence...

384
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,240
...that we planned this
and transfused them.

385
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,560
Then, do we just do nothing?

386
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
We'll have to erase the records...

387
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,720
...of accessing the exchange site.

388
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
ACCESS HISTORY

389
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,280
Will it take longer?

390
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
Stop talking to me.

391
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,600
DELETED SERVER DATA

392
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,400
In the meantime, the server managing team...

393
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,600
...will change the domain address...

394
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,840
...and hide the hard disks as a whole.

395
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,800
Then, all the evidence will be gone.

396
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,600
How much time will it take?

397
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,040
Five minutes.

398
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
PAGE NOT FOUND

399
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,680
Is there a problem?

400
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Give us more time.

401
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,560
POLICE

402
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,240
PROCESSING

403
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
It's done.

404
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,080
The carrier just left.

405
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,040
GAME OF CARDS

406
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,000
WILL YOU LOG OUT?

407
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,960
What is this?

408
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,200
Hey.

409
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
What is it?

410
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,240
Oh, we got a report.

411
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,200
What is this about?

412
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
I'd like to check the inside.

413
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,840
Let me through.

414
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,320
You can't do this!

415
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,480
You can't do this.

416
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,080
Are you going to search the office...

417
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,360
...without a warrant?

418
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,840
We got a report.

419
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,320
What kind of report and how?

420
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,880
Let them in.

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

422
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,720
I don't think this is a gambling house.

423
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
No matter how much we search,

424
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
we can't find a single card.

425
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,880
Maybe it's like a gambling Internet cafe.

426
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,280
They're all legal sites.

427
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,360
I don't see any gift cards either.

428
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,480
We didn't find anything.

429
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,480
Yes.

430
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,000
Okay.

431
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,920
It's over.

432
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,320
Attorney Han, this actually worked.

433
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
Gosh, what a great day.

434
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,320
When I first moved into this place,

435
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,320
the weather was just like this.

436
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,360
When was that?

437
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Ten years ago?

438
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
As soon as I saw this place, I was amazed.

439
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
That's why I picked it.

440
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,400
In the end, you owned it.

441
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,760
Everything you wanted.

442
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,120
That's not true.

443
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm still far from done.

444
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,640
What more do you want to own?

445
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
I'm not sure.

446
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
A baseball team?

447
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,600
Is that even possible?

448
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,680
Unless you're super rich.

449
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,920
It's not impossible...

450
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,080
...if I continue running
the business like this.

451
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,200
I'll buy one one day.

452
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,200
I never miss out on anything I pick.

453
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,960
Whatever that is.

454
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,040
Take it.

455
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
What is this?

456
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
A severance pay.

457
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,920
Goodbye.

458
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,400
You stupid fool.

459
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
You should just...

460
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,760
...get out of here...

461
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,240
...and drown yourself
in the waters of Shinnam.

462
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,480
I'll be sure to find out.

463
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,480
Please give me another chance.

464
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,640
MOON SANG-GUK

465
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

466
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,920
What must I tell him?

467
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
Gosh, you scared me.

468
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,320
What's with this jerk?

469
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,800
Isn't he a zombie?

470
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,760
It's tomorrow, right?

471
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,120
- Han Dong-soo's nursing home.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,800
SHINNAM FERRY

473
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,320
What brings you here?

474
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
The gambling house must not be busy.

475
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,720
Are you working on something with Kim Jae-yeol?

476
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,960
Why? You want in?

477
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
Is collecting interests from karaoke rooms...

478
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,920
...quite tiring?

479
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,360
You jerk!

480
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
Darn it!

481
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,360
Learn when to butt in, jerk.

482
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,480
Let's go.

483
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,680
Gosh, there are so many things to throw out.

484
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,720
Leave it. I'll do it.

485
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,200
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

486
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,120
Hey, Seon-kyo.

487
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,560
Is the preparation going well?

488
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,000
We're just packing and throwing things out.

489
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,160
Let me see you before you go.

490
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Okay. Let's grab a meal.

491
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,880
- Call me.
- Okay.

492
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Boss.

493
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,560
Going somewhere far?

494
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,520
Darn it.

495
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,400
Today's my lucky day.

496
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,280
I'm sorry, boss.

497
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,240
Please cut me some slack.

498
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
I had no choice.

499
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,280
Kim Jae-yeol told me...

500
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,000
...that he'd kill me
if I didn't listen to him.

501
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,520
Please spare me, boss.

502
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,120
Get rid of him.

503
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,480
Han Dong-soo!

504
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,080
It's about Han Dong-soo!

505
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,320
I heard that the Family Gang members...

506
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,440
...are making a move on.

507
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,240
Attorney Han Dong-soo.

508
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,520
I definitely heard it.

509
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,520
Boss, please spare my life.

510
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm Chang-yong, Boss.

511
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:24,487
I want to go back to...

512
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,960
...being your little brother Chang-yong.

513
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Boss.

514
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Tonight, the Family Gang members are making a move.

515
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,160
I'll gather more information and take action.

516
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,080
What about Attorney Han?

517
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,840
Let's see.

518
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
Darn it.

519
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,040
Hey. Did you send the men?

520
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,040
Yes, they're on their way.

Thank you.

529
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,560
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

HYE-YOUNG

534
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,480
What are you doing?

535
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,360
Did Seo Do-young order you to do this?

536
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,480
He wants to kill me...

537
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,920
...and my family now?

538
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,760
No, it's not that.

539
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,400
We heard that Moon Sang-guk...

540
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,200
...and Kim Jae-yeol are targeting you.

541
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,160
We observed the movements of the Family Gang members.

542
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,640
But it seems like they weren't after you.

543
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,280
- Fire!
- I see her!

544
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,240
Go in!

545
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
Lee Hye-ja.

546
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,080
Have you seen Lee Hye-ja of Unit 202?

547
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,560
I am not sure.

548
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,080
Hello. Where's my mom?

549
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Oh, dear.

550
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Mom.

551
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,240
Mom!

552
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,080
- Are you the guardian?
- I'm her son.

553
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,240
Get in quickly.

555
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,200

Dong-soo.

557
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:25,151
It's me, Dong-soo.

558
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,160
Can you recognize me?

559
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Yes.

560
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,800
My baby.

561
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,720
It's not too cold today, is it?

562
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,440
It's not cold.

563
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,520
Goodness, my son.

564
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,440
You got old.

565
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,800
You've got wrinkles.

566
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,840
Where has the time gone?

567
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,480
You know I've always had a lot of wrinkles.

568
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,640
My son.

569
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,960
Next time,

570
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,640
be born into a good family...

571
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,280
...and live a comfortable life.

572
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,520
Don't suffer.

573
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,720
Why...

574
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,920
Why next time?

575
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,200
We can live comfortably now.

576
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,480
I am rich now.

577
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,920
So,

578
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,560
let's eat good food...

579
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,440
...and go on trips together.

580
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
We will do that.

581
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
Okay.

582
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,320
Let's do that.

583
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,360
Dong-soo.

584
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,760
I am sorry.

585
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,360
Why? About what?

586
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,080
Just everything.

587
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,720
Dong-soo.

588
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,240
My son.

589
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,440
In the next life,

590
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,000
you must...

591
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Mom.

592
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Mom.

593
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,080
Mom!

594
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,720
- She's in cardiac arrest!
- Start CPR.

595
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,040
Mom!

596
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,880
No!

597
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,800
Mom.

598
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,800
Mom.

599
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,880
Oh, no.

600
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,440
Mom...

601
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,520
No, Mom.

602
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,760
AND A BEAUTIFUL ENDING

603
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,400
WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF YOU

604
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,400
Thank you.

605
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,480
It must be tough, but I hope you get through this well.

606
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,520
Honey.

607
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,400
Can I talk to you?

608
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Go.

609
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,320
EVERY DOCTOR COMPUTER

610
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,080
BLOOMING BASE

611
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,840
Excuse me.

612
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,000
What are all these?

613
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,200
These all came for Mr. Han Dong-soo, the chief mourner.

614
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,560
YUSEONG MAN POWER AGENCY

615
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,320
WITH HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES

616
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,280
How did you know I was here?

617
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,120
It's your routine.

618
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,320
Going for a jog on this path every morning.

619
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,120
Right. We've run together a few times.

620
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,200
How many people...

621
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,360
have you killed so far?

622
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,440
How many people...

623
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,960
...did you kill like this?

624
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,400
How am I supposed to know that?

625
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,040
Am I supposed to count them one by one?

626
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,000
I heard you are emigrating.

627
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,920
It might be a good idea
to change your flight schedule.

628
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,360
I don't know what connection you have with that thug,

629
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,120
but we'll uncover everything.

630
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,880
You'll have to pay for your sins.

631
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,960
Sit.

632
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,200
I'm not done.

633
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,160
You little punk.

634
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,520
What are you doing?

635
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,920
I...

636
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,200
I am not leaving.

637
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,440
It's you...

638
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,320
...who should be leaving.

639
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,560
You murderer.

640
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,920
You rat!

641
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,680
Let go!

642
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,360
Feel it.

643
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,320
Feel what it's like to be the victim,

644
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,760
to be stepped on.

645
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,800
Feel it for once.

646
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,440
I didn't know you smoked.

647
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,480
Thanks to you,

648
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,920
I was able to send my mother off well.

649
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,360
Thank you.

650
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,040
You look a lot like Mother,

651
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,440
especially your eyes.

652
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,040
What's wrong?

653
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,720
Well...

654
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,640
...I can't call my friend's mom
Ms. Lee. It's too formal.

655
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,360
I am curious about something.

656
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,600
Can I ask you a question?

657
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,440
I've seen you...

658
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,640
...on TV before.

659
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,320
In the 1989 high school baseball finals.

660
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,240
Why...

661
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,480
...did you do that then?

662
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,680
BONGJU HIGH

663
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,080
If it weren't for that incident,

664
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,320
you could have
become a national baseball player.

665
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,400
You might have been
the first Korean major leaguer.

666
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,200
Perhaps it could've been you,

667
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,400
not Park Chan-ho.

668
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,480
He was a bought-out umpire.

669
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,120
The baseball field was such a mess.

670
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,080
That's all?

671
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,360
Then what else could there be?

672
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,280
I don't know.

673
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,560
Well, I don't think that's all there is to it.

674
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,160
I admit there might have been bias.

675
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,400
The umpire might have possibly been bought out.

676
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,480
But ultimately,

677
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,800
wasn't it you who made that decision?

678
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,440
I'm not curious about why you got angry...

679
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,800
...but rather why you made that choice.

680
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,320
That's what I want to know.

681
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,960
That game.

682
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,000
It was the last game I could play.

683
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,720
I was injured.

684
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,160
But I don't regret it.

685
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,480
The timing was just right.

686
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,320
The timing?

687
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,400
"I quit baseball because of my injuries."

688
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,200
That sounds bad, you know.

689
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,880
It was the right time,

690
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,080
so I had to go for it.

691
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,840
Is what we talked about last time...

692
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,440
still...

693
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,680
valid?

694
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,360
You will go after Kim Jae-yeol,

695
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,920
and I'll go after Moon Sang-guk.

696
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,640
I thought it was a ridiculous idea,

697
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,320
but I want to try now.

698
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,080
You look much better without glasses.

699
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,320
EVILIVE

700
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,760
<i>Attorney Han became much more involved.</i>

701
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,120
<i>You will end it with Seo Do-young...</i>

702
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,760
<i>once you take down Moon Sang-guk, right?</i>

703
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,640
<i>We are headed towards victory,</i>

704
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,840
<i>so don't you worry.</i>

705
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,120
<i>It won't be easy to separate...</i>

706
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,800
<i>Moon Sang-guk from Kim Jae-yeol.</i>

707
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,760
<i>He will come to his senses if he goes broke.</i>

708
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,920
<i>You've done enough.</i>

709
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,080
<i>Something might happen to you too.</i>

710
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,520
<i>Did you think having a thug by your side...</i>

711
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,840
<i>would change things?</i>

712
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,360
<i>Once cornered, he will be busy to spare himself.</i>

713
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,880
<i>We got a report.</i>

714
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,760
<i>I thought it might help the investigation.</i>
