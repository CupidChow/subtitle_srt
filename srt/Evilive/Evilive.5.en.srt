INCIDENTS, GROUPS,

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,046
IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Cheers.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,520
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,191
Good work today.

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,376
- No problem, sir.
- No problem, sir.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,320
Let's eat.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,040
That's right, sir.

12
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,343
You're really good.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,940
Have you worked at a sashimi place before?

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,300
My old man...

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,400
was a fisherman.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,360
When he was busy selling fish by auction,

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
I'd take a few in secret...

18
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:12,362
...and gave it to the coach.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,200
I thought he'd beat me up less then.

20
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,449
I see.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,560
So, did it work?

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,520
He beat me up more...

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,040
for giving him squids all the time.

24
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,240
How did you become a baseball player?

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Was it...

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,780
in 1983?

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
The Haitai Tigers won
the Korean baseball league.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,240
Kim Bong-yeon became an MVP...

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
...and received a car.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,360
That's why.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,920
Congrats on winning the lawsuit.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Oh, well...

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,660
What happened to Moon Hae-jun?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,700
He was arrested for rape.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,575
Don't worry.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,580
You won't get roped into it.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,620
We only brought him to an inn.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
What?

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,740
His father isn't an easy deal.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,540
He'll do whatever it takes
to silence the media...

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,180
and get his son in the election somehow.

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,980
So, we need a closing pitcher.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,100
A closing pitcher?

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,560
That's not bad.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,060
How about Park Choong-ho?

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,800
He'd want Moon Hae-jun
gone more than anyone.

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,840
He has the power to move
the public sentiment too.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Do you perhaps...

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
...have a way to get to him?

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Well,

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,480
I can make my own way.

52
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,493
Then now,

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,140
should we discuss business?

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, I'll start working tomorrow.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,380
But under one condition.

56
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:41,917
After this,

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,740
it will be over between us.

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,260
I'll leave this neighborhood
once I get paid.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,540
So, promise me...

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,920
...that you'll never come
to me and my family.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
That's all...

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,200
...I want.

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,960
EVILIVE

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
EPISODE 5

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
Dong-soo?

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you insane?

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
That's a crime. It's illegal.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,040
Tailing and spy cameras.

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Those were all illegal too.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,680
But this is on a whole another level.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,100
As soon as it's settled, we'll back out.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
It'll only take two to three months.

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
He tried to kill us...

74
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,685
...only a few days ago.

75
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,240
And you'll work with him?

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
He offered 300 million won.

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,100
That's enough to pay off our debt at once.

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,820
We can support our mom more with ease.

79
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,182
Even so...

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm so lost.

81
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,960
Even if he offers three billion won,

82
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,332
this isn't right.

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,640
Help me out.

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,000
This is the money Seo Do-young gave me.

85
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,480
I took half, and it's 20 million won.

86
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
We need a money exchange website.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,180
I want you to make one.

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,900
Then you'll have your
share of the money too.

89
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,620
When we get paid,

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,840
let's leave this neighborhood altogether.

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,640
Dong-soo.

92
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm sick and tired of this city.

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm disgusted to see those...

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,944
...who abuse their power
in this tiny neighborhood.

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,935
I'm tired of visiting prison...

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,780
...just to get myself a gig.

97
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,580
I want to go somewhere full of strangers...

98
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,160
...and make a fresh start again.

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,780
Do this for me, Beom-jae.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,040
Please.

101
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:50,880
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING,
PRESIDENT SEO DO-YOUNG

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,717
Thank you for offering
support in the election.

103
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
But I gave up on running for it.

104
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,375
If I go against my party's decision...

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,560
...and leave,

106
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,620
people will only call me a betrayer.

107
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
Don't give up.

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,215
All candidates will be
registered in two days.

109
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
My party has already
decided on its player.

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
We will...

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,640
...change players.

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,260
The tables will be turned as of today.

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
Trust me on this.

114
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:50,673
Gosh.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,880
Attorney Moon.

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,040
How did it go?

117
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
Well, I'm working to make a settlement.

118
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Why?

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,495
I told you! I didn't do it!

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,960
I know, but I needed to bail you out first.

121
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,120
Goodness.

122
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,160
What about the security camera footage?

123
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,735
I got it, but it's said to be fake.

124
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,584
Just for show, you know...

125
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,360
Darn it.

126
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,200
Anyway,

127
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,040
do you really not remember
anything? Not even a thing?

128
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,980
No! I don't remember anything!

129
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,440
Darn it!

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,440
SHINNAM POLICE STATION

131
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
Goodness.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,360
<i>Then you'll have your</i>
<i>share of the money too.</i>

133
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
<i>When we get paid,</i>

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,760
<i>let's leave this neighborhood altogether.</i>

135
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
Beom-jae.

136
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,600
Gosh.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

138
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,720
- Eat it.
- Gosh.

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
Are you sure about the promise?

140
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,975
- Just three months, okay?
- Two months.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Let's finish it in two months.

142
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
There's no need to drag it out.

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,480
- Are you sure?
- Of course!

144
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,535
I'm not crazy enough...

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,020
...to stick to this ridiculous business.

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,500
Is that a yes?

147
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,180
Let's use this as our
office for the time being.

148
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,640
What is this?

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
A programmer who will
make the website with you.

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,680
He's skilled.

151
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,840
It'll be good for you to learn from him.

152
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
NAME : PARK SI-DEOK

153
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
The Game of Cards?

154
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,660
Why do we need someone
who works at a place like this?

155
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
I have some debt.

156
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,680
I took out a private loan.

157
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,620
The interest rate was 47 percent.

158
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,311
It was too tough on me...

159
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,380
...that I even looked into
filing for bankruptcy.

160
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,420
But then he helped me with the return suit.

161
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,420
Thanks to that, I felt
like I could breathe again.

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,135
I got back what I paid that exceeded...

163
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,140
...the legal interest limit
for dishonest profit.

164
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,480
He has work to do,

165
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
so he will come only on weekends.

166
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,200
We'll mostly communicate via e-mail.

167
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,420
I see.

168
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,495
Once we're done structuring it,

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,220
it won't be that difficult.

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,400
I see.

171
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,240
Attorney Han.

172
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
Are you sure this is all right, though?

173
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Of course.

174
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,225
It will only be a slight involvement.

175
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Just for a moment, and we'll back out.

176
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Oh, right.

177
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,770
Right.

178
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:31,505
PERSONAL INFORMATION

179
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,880
We need it for marketing.

180
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,695
I'll see you on the weekend, then.

181
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,680
See you.

182
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
What are you waiting for? Come.

183
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,960
Check where Hae-jun is right away.

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
ARRESTED FOR RAPE

185
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,680
Darn it.

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
Attorney Moon.

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Attorney Moon.

188
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,625
- Gosh.
- Attorney Moon.

189
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,480
Please leave me alone!

190
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,705
That's not it.

191
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Your father is on the way here.

192
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,280
Darn it!

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
Darn you...

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,280
It wasn't me.

195
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:51,145
Well,

196
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,354
the party made a call.

197
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,000
They decided to re-evaluate
your qualifications.

198
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,320
What?

199
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,800
Mr. Lee, will you give us some room?

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,020
Well...

201
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
Sure.

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
It's a misunderstanding, Father.

203
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,989
I'd never do such a thing...

204
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,440
...at a crucial time like this.

205
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,360
This was a trap.

206
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm sure someone was behind it.

207
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,280
Who?

208
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,568
Pardon?

209
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:39,340
Who set up that trap?

210
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,468
I thought you finally
turned over a new leaf,

211
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,140
but you're still not in your right mind!

212
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,460
Stay low for the time being.

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,140
I'll try to take care of it somehow.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Hello, Mr. Kim.

215
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I need to see you for a bit.

216
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,120
Sir, what's going on?

217
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,440
I heard about the
re-evaluation. Is it true?

218
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,180
Don't make a fuss and sit down.

219
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
Okay.

220
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,560
SHINNAM FERRY

221
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:28,722
Did you look into it?

222
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,286
The truck...

223
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,535
didn't have a license
plate, so I couldn't find it.

224
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,575
The compact car was scrapped in Busan.

225
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,920
But I couldn't find its owner.

226
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,640
It seems the car was
stolen a few years ago,

227
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,287
and the person changed its license plate.

228
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,500
It was scrapped by a third person too.

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
What about Park Choong-ho?

230
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,800
That guy is...

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
...just all talk. He has
nobody to do such a thing.

232
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,040
Find out who was behind it, no matter what.

233
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,160
Check every repair shop
in the country if you must.

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes, sir.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,920
And prepare some more money.

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,760
We need to stop the re-evaluation somehow.

237
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,280
You're right about that,

238
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
but how...

239
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,895
Once Hae-jun's out the window,

240
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,575
my minister position
will be in danger as well.

241
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,960
Then the marine casino
will fall through too.

242
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't you get it?

243
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:16,905
Call me when it's ready.

244
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,480
Hurry and check the repair shops.

245
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,572
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Sir.

247
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,640
Who was that just now?

248
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,063
Wasn't it one of Mr. Kim's men?

249
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
He came to ask something.

250
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,640
Ask what?

251
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,760
He was looking for a car.

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,720
A silver car.

253
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,680
A model that was discontinued
ten years ago.

254
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
How is it...

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,520
...to be the number two instead of me?

256
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Knock it off.

257
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,800
The boys are watching.

258
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,260
Answer me, you darn son of a gun!

259
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,360
Is this the car?

260
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,680

YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

262
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,880
What is it?

263
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,880
There was an accident at one of the stores.

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Some men were making
a scene, so I sent him.

265
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,280
Were they customers?

266
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
No, they're Family Gang members.

267
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
They must've thought
Kim Jae-yeol had their back.

268
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,015
With a gambling house under control,

269
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,180
I bet they're after taking over clubs too.

270
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
Did he open a gambling house?

271
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
It started last week.

272
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
Family Gang is playing a key role,

273
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,712
but they seem to have
brought a lot of guys from Busan.

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,120
We're short on money
without the gambling business.

275
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,100
And it's quite costly to
invest in the new business.

276
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,460
What about Han Dong-soo?

277
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,440
He's already set up the resources.

278
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
The briefing is tomorrow.

279
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,720
Let's wrap it up.

280
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
What in the world...

281
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,249
Darn...

282
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,080
You little...

283
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,840
You scumbags.

284
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,240
Are you kidding me?

285
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,015
Hey, I heard what happened at the club.

286
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,280
My boys made an oblivious mistake.

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm sorry about that, okay?

288
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,460
I'll make sure to keep them under control.

289
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,760
Okay?

290
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,760
This is the compensation for damages.

291
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,815
- Fine.
- We've written down...

292
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,560
the repair cost and the loss in detail.

293
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Wire the amount.

294
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,640
Fine, I'll pay you.

295
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,760
How much...

296
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
One, two, three...

297
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Is that 370 million won?

298
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,700
Are you kidding me?

299
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:00,231
I'm not kidding.

Do-young.

301
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,460
Is it because of bad blood
between you and Mr. Kim?

302
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,561
Because he abandoned you?

303
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,540
Tell him to bring the money.

304
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,493
Move it away, you jerk!

305
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,527
I don't have any money, you idiot.

306
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
It'll be one every five seconds.

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,920
Count.

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
Five, four,

309
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,320
- three, two,
- Don't do it, jerk.

310
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,458
- one.
- Hey!

311
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,260
Darn it! You scumbag!

312
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,840
Count.

313
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
- Five,
- Let go.

314
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,600
- four, three,
- Let go of me, jerk!

315
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,640
two, one.

Include another 100 million won.

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
You wanted to kill me.

319
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
- Count.
- Darn it!

- Five, four,
- You scum.

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,840
- Okay! Fine!
- three...

322
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Send the money.

323
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360

...of Korea's biggest game

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,800
Considering the number of users,

340
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,080
it's as big as a casino in Las Vegas.

But considering the stake only,

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,640
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

371
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,815
The distributor that promotes the site...

372
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
...and recruit members.

373
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,360
And the store.

374
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,015
The store will be...

375
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,975
...the biggest Internet cafe
for Game of Cards only.

376
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,720
MAKE IT BIG IN SHINANAM!

377
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,960
Of course, it's not a
regular Internet cafe.

378
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Thanks.

379
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,695
It'll be an exchange counter...

380
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,080
...that help purchase
and exchange game money.

381
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,461
We're going to purchase
the Game of Cards money...

382
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,575
...at a rate that's ten percent cheaper...

383
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
...and sell it for a more expensive price.

384
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,860
The margin from that will be our sales.

385
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,600
Oh, my. It's the same card.

386
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
Darn it. It's the same card.

387
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
GAME OF CARDS

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,055
Hello?

389
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,015
Yes. Gold Seven deposited the money.

390
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,160
Start the work.

391
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,160
<i>Godori alert.</i>

392
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,574
The way of dealing is simple.

393
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,575
Once we check the deposit,

394
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,095
the user and the money exchanger...

395
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
...will meet at the online exchange booth.

396
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:11,557
And depending on the amount dealt,

397
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:12,735
the exchanger will lose...

398
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,840
...to the user unilaterally.

399
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,000
This is called "transfusion."

400
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,160
The way the money is
purchased will be the same.

401
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Hold on.

402
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,620
To resell the game money,

403
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
we need to secure a certain amount.

404
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
Where do we get all that?

405
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,720
That's right. The amount
one can purchase...

406
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,870
...is limited to 300,000 won per month.

407
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
We won't have enough.

408
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,215
We have hundreds of thousands...

409
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,600
...of personal information.

410
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,980
If we make use of these, we can make...

411
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,680
...up to millions of accounts.

412
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,583
Problem solved, right?

413
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,820
Is something the matter?

414
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,500
I called you yesterday.

415
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,820
Let's advance the opening date.

416
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,040
Let's make it happen in 20 days.

417
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,855
I'm afraid it'll be difficult.

418
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,375
There's a lot to do.

419
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,335
We don't have enough manpower yet.

420
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,575
I'm not asking you.

421
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,980
The target sales will be one billion won.

422
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,935
The most you can make...

423
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,500
...from the gambling house
is a few hundred million.

424
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,501
How can we increase
the sales by fivefold...

425
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:58,980
...all of a sudden?

426
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,000
I wouldn't have started it...

427
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,300
...if I were to make the same amount.

428
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,340
Get it started.

429
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,220
Wait.

430
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,644
Aren't we in this together?

431
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
We are partners.

432
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,220
What is it again? What did he say?

433
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,338
He wants to advance the opening date...

434
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:51,535
...to the beginning of next month.

435
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Why?

436
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,240
No idea.

437
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,540
Gosh, this is crazy.

438
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,240
By the way,

439
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,015
are you really confident?

440
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:07,962
It's your first time
doing things like this.

441
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
You're home.

442
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,520
Why are you still up?

443
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,780
I'm keeping the ledger.

444
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,220
I hope things will be
as good as these days.

445
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,175
The stuff at the supermarket went well,

446
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,745
and you're getting more work.

447
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,460
- Hye-young.
- Yes?

448
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,012
Let's move to another country.

449
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,200
What did you say?

450
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,574
You know Young-kyo, right?

451
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,000
The one living in Australia.

452
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,800
I called him the other day,

453
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,880
and his farm is doing well.

454
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,520
It'll be hard at first.

455
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,560
But if we get used to it...

456
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,800
Wait.

457
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,700
Why would we suddenly
move to another country?

458
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:44,790
Everything went well.

459
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
Things are getting better, so why?

460
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,420
If we continue living here,

461
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,600
our lives will be the same forever.

462
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,120
I don't like it.

463
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:57,920
I really don't like...

464
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,448
...this town.

465
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,480
Once I'm done with the work I'm doing,

466
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,020
I'll be able to make
enough for us to settle there.

467
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,560
Before it's too late,

468
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,480
let's begin a new life there.

469
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,048
The party leader can't make it.

470
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:49,200
The general election is around the corner.
He won't be able to make time.

471
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,260
I don't think this is the right place
for you to be, Assemblyman Park.

472
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Why not?

473
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm a candidate too,

474
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,960
thanks to Hae-jun.

475
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,940
What will you do, though?

476
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,680
At this rate,

477
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,400
you might lose your place too.

478
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,580
Minister of Justice.

479
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,840
I helped you serve two terms,

480
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,280
but you're still hopeless.

481
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
You still can't get the hang of it.

482
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,600
You should know your opponent.

483
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,440
It looks like you want to be cocky with me.

484
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,320
Do you want to be kicked out of politics?

485
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,100
Tomorrow,

486
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,455
the outcome of the
re-evaluation will be announced.

487
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,655
And I'll be the official candidate.

488
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,720
Even without you,

489
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,740
I can finally make it.

490
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:36,508
I did it.

491
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,560
Why don't you...

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,600
...use this chance
to look back on your life?

493
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:51,180
Whether you've done
anything to hurt others.

494
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:52,615
Using people when they're needed...

495
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,335
...but discarding them
once they become useless.

496
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Isn't that what you usually do?

497
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Do people play Game
of Cards a lot these days?

498
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Of course.

499
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:10,280
Seven out of ten computers here...

500
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:11,371
...are playing Game of Cards.

501
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,360
People play Go-Stop a lot during holidays.

502
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,895
It's easy, and they're used to it,

503
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,840
so many people play it regardless of age.

504
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,960
Hey, Beom-jae.

505
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,400
What?

506
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,844
His phone has been off since yesterday.

507
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,975
I had a bad feeling,
so I called Game of Cards,

508
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
and Park Si-deok was fired a month ago.

509
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,295
He ran after getting the advance payment.

510
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,600
We were duped.

511
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,720
Shouldn't we look for someone else?

512
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,320
I'll ask Seo Do-young...

513
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,040
...to push the date a week.

514
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,900
You should look for Park Si-deok.

515
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,920
How would I know where he is?

516
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,680
Hold 'em pub.

517
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,680
What?

518
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,760
He must be playing poker.

519
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,640
That's why he took out private loans.

520
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,000
What happened?

521
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,535
He's the minion of the Yuseong Gang,

522
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,575
and he saw that car...

523
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
a few days before Hae-jun's accident.

524
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,400
I think Seo Do-young is behind it.

525
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,160
Seo Do-young?

526
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:13,255
He used to work for Kim Yoo-sung,

527
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
and now, he's the boss.

528
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,575
Last year, Moon Law Firm...

529
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,215
...defended him,

530
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,240
and he must've gotten a long-term then.

531
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
Are you saying it's a revenge?

532
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,040
There can't be another reason.

533
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
He should've taken revenge
on the attorney...

534
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,000
...who was in charge.

535
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,680
Why mess with Hae-jun?

536
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,320
He's quite unpredictable, so...

537
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,849
Where is this guy?

538
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,000
- Sorry?
- The guy who saw the car.

539
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480
You're going to...

540
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,200
...see him in person?

541
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,160
You know me, right?

542
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,280
He's Mr. Moon of Moon Law Firm.

543
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,440
It's an honor, Mr. Moon.

544
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,400
Is it true that you saw that car?

545
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,520
Of course, sir.

546
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,960
I wouldn't dare to lie to you.

547
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm certain that
Seo Do-young was behind it.

548
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,295
I clearly heard him saying that he would...

549
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,000
destroy Moon Law Firm once he was out.

550
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Any proof?

551
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,415
You don't even need more.

552
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,960
He's more than capable of...

553
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,760
Do you find me easy?

554
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,800
No, sir.

555
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,680
So how dare you try to mess with me?

556
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
Do you think...

557
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll give you the money with a few lies?

558
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,040
It's not that...

559
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,440
You jerk!

560
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,615
I worked...

561
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,455
...as a Public Security prosecutor
for 20 years.

562
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,280
I've seen so many
good-for-nothing jerks like you.

563
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,600
You jerk.

564
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm telling you the truth.
Trust me, Mr. Moon.

565
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm sure it was Seo Do-young.

566
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,800
He refused all attorneys...

567
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,760
...because he didn't like Moon Law Firm...

568
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,600
...and got himself
a new attorney to run errands.

569
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,640
An attorney who runs errands?

570
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,960
Yes.

571
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,760
And who is that?

572
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,320
Han Dong... Darn it. What was it again?

573
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,655
Han Dong-soo... Han Dong-joo.

574
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,800
- Han Jong-soo...
- Han Dong-soo?

575
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes, sir. It's Han Dong-soo.

576
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,600
It's him.

577
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,015
There's a supervisory
team within Game of Cards...

578
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,935
that monitor illegal gambling.

579
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
And we hired two from the team.

580
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,560
They'll constantly tell us the intel...

581
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,045
...on the standard of inspection.

582
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,417
Are they trustable?

583
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,975
They're in urgent need of money.

584
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,080
Once we give them money,
they'll keep it quiet.

585
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,201
Then give them the money.

586
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
Actually...

587
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:12,761
About the opening date.

588
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,281
Could you give me more time?

589
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,895
For it to work properly...

590
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,200
Didn't I tell you?

591
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,080
To advance the date, no matter what.

592
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,334
What is...

593
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,720
...the reason?

594
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,920
I need to know.

595
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,560
I bet my everything on this.

596
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,440
If this goes wrong,

597
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
my life will be over too.

598
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,320
There's a man who gets on my nerves.

599
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,240
But I can't get rid of him.

600
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,640
You know Kim Jae-yeol, right?

601
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,840
The president of Shinnam Ferry.

602
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,360
He's the real owner of the gambling house.

603
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,680
A lowly loan shark...

604
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,200
became a successful businessman.

605
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Goodness.

606
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

607
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm here, sir.

608
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,360
- Hey, Hae-jun.
- Congratulations.

609
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,600
Every part of this town
is run with his money.

610
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,840
And I lost his trust recently.

611
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,880
The report on the gambling
house played a big part.

612
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,400
Then...

613
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
...what happens...

614
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,360
if this business fails?

615
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,240
ASSEMBLYMAN PARK
BECOMES THE FINAL CANDIDATE

616
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,720
FOR THE 18TH GENERAL ELECTION

617
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,880
We'll both be dead.

618
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,800
I kept my word.

619
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,320
It's your turn.

620
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,840
What is this?

621
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,520
What are you doing?

622
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,680
That's cheating.

623
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,280
- Let me play it just once more.
- No.

624
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
It's so obvious.

625
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,800
What?

626
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,360
You shouldn't scam people like that.

627
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,160
It's all ruined.

628
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
How about this one?

629
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,560
It's 38,000 won and...

630
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,600
Hey.

631
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,160
Did you find Park Si-deok?

632
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,520
I've searched all day, but he's not here.

633
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm on my way now. Keep looking.

634
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
All right.

635
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
I got two.

636
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Scumbag.

637
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,240
U STAR INTERNET CAFE

638
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,440
It's just one day before the grand opening.

639
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,920
There's not much time left,
so let's work a bit harder.

640
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,680
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

641
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,160
BUS ROUTE

642
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,680
Gosh.

643

KANGSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

644
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,880
Dong-soo.

645
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
Excuse me, Attorney Han.

646
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
I didn't run.

647
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,600
I was going to call you,

648
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,640
but I really didn't have time, you see.

649
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,200
Do you think this is a joke?

650
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,280
We're staking our lives...

651
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,240
...on this bet.

652
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,920
The moment we decided
to go through with this,

653
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,200
our families became part of it too.

654
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,480
Your little sister...

655
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
...who goes to a commercial high school.

656
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,200
Your mom who runs a street stall.

657
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,320
I'm so sorry, Attorney Han.

658
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,120
I am sorry.

659
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,560
Si-deok.

660
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,200
Yes?

661
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,280
If something like this
happens one more time,

662
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
I won't be able to protect you.

663
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,360
The Yuseong Gang will come after you.

664
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,120
You understand what I mean, right?

665
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
Yes.

666
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
Get in.

667
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Coming.

668
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,600
Join Internet cafes with...

669
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,120
...over a hundred thousand members...

670
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,695
...and send group messages.

671
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,440
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS EXISTED.
IT'S EASY MONEY.

KNOW-HOW OF MAKING MONEY?

677
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,040
How much did this guy spend on this?

RATE, 60 TRILLION WON EQUALS 118,000 WON

YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

680
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
The more phone numbers, the better.

681
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,255
It creates...

682
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,680
...the illusion of multiple businesses.

683
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,959
How about the money withdrawal?

684
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,490
We are working on it.

685
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,600
Hello. I'm here for that
money withdrawal job...

686
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,440
Once the money is deposited in the account,

687
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,640
withdraw it immediately.

688
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,120
Deduct a ten percent fee...

689
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,120
and deposit the rest. Okay?

690
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,520
Let's have a drink.

691
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,400
You did well.

692
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,600
How do you think it'll go tomorrow?

693
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,200
Who knows?

694
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
But in any case, I did my best.

695
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,320
Doing your best isn't important.

696
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,680
Being the best is.

697
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,880
You should get in too, Attorney Han.

698
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,280
I will go with my brother.

699
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,520
There will be a lot of
nervous people tomorrow.

700
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,880
I've told you about Kim
Jae-yeol before, right?

701
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,040
Kim Jae-yeol was the manager,

702
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,720
and I was the player.

703
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,440
Don't you want to know
who the team owner was?

704
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,160
Moon Sang-guk.

705
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,440
If Park Choong-ho wins...

706
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,680
Darn it.

707
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,640
I'll start a baseball team too.

708
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,480
Are you in?

709
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,720
I'll take care of Kim Jae-yeol,

710
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,640
and you'll handle Moon Sang-gook.

711
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,520
You promised me this.

712
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,040
Once this is over...

713
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,680
Think about it.

714
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,120
It finally feels like my home.

715
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,560
CURRENT NUMBER OF USERS
ONLINE AND OPERATIONS

716
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,000
INFLUX RATE, PURCHASE
RATE, NUMBER OF LOGIN GRAPH

717
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,520
We've got someone.

718
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,360
What's going on?

719
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,560
This is the user influx.

720
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,880
About 20 users have entered,

721
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,560
but we'll have to see how
much they'll exchange.

722
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,800
It's frustrating not being
able to see the customers.

723
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,080
We aim to recruit a hundred members today.

724
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,960
If we secure more than
300 members in a month,

725
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,320
we'll consider it a success.

726
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,480
What?

727
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,040
What's happening? What's the problem?

728
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,120
Hold on a second.

729
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,840
SHUTDOWN

730
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Beom-jae, just a moment.

731
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,960
DOUBLE MONEY

732
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,040
A TEMPORARY SERVICE INTERRUPTION

733
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,880
This is strange.

734
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,080
I can't seem to log in.

735
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,800
What's going on?

736
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,480
It seems like a server issue.

737
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
What is it?

738
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,640
What's the problem?

739
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,120
Well...

740
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,440
So,

741
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,120
it's not really a problem.

742
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
We just need some time.

743
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,804
The server.

744
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
It looks like...

745
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:11,789
...the server crashed.

746
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
The site experienced a
sudden surge in traffic.

747
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:19,505
It's like everyone's trying
to access the site at once.

748
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,429
Hey.

749
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,640
Okay.

750
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,200
Boss.

751
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,560
We're getting flooded with calls...

752
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,520
about currency exchange inquiries.

753
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,520
Yes!

754
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,160
Is the site a massive hit now?

755
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
It's amazing.

756
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
It's worth staying up all night, isn't it?

757
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,400
Now, let's hurry and restore the server.

758
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,640
Okay.

759
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,880
Hello.

760
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,920
- Hello there.
- Yes.

761
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,600
- You've been well?
- I have.

762
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,680
Did anything good happen?

763
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,120
- Pardon?
- Your face.

764
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,040
All right.

765
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,960
Gosh, my phone.

766
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,040
Goodness. Let me help you.

767
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,680
I'll carry this for you.

768
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,840
- Thank you so much.
- I'll carry it.

769
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,600
What floor do you live on?

770
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,960
I live on the eighth floor.

771
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,960
Unit 803.

772
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,920
You have a son, don't you?

773
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,400
I do.

774
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,360
He seems close to the
people who live below me.

775
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,480
You live above Min-hee's unit?

776
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,480
Yes.

777
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,760
There's someone who bothers me.

778
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,800
In short, he's a lunatic.

779
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Ma'am.

780
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,080
Do you live with your grandchildren?

781
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,080
Goodness, who does that these days?

782
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,360
I've been living alone since
my husband passed away.

783
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,920
I see.

784
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,200
Come on.

785
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,280
Please.

786
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,960
- I'll steal it.
- There.

787
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,840
Let's go.

788
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,800
Let's do this.

789
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,280
Okay.

790
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,560
Let's go.

791
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
We will open.

792
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,720
What?

793
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,880
It's eight ggeut.

794
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,000
- It's five ggeut.
- Yes!

795
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,400
It's two ggeut.

796
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,920
Last one.

797
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,160
Come on.

798
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,880
It's five ggeut.

799
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,680
Darn it!

800
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,760
Darn it.

801
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,480
Where are you going?

802
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,840
Can't I go pee?

803
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,760
What's going on here these days?

804
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,880
This place is a rathole.

805
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,160
There's not even a toilet inside.

806
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,400
It wasn't like this before.

807
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,400
Enough of that. There's
a portable toilet there.

808
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,560
Go hurry and take care of your business.

809
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,200
Gosh, this is so annoying.

810
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,440
Gosh.

811
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Lady,

812
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,480
keep the lantern on.

813
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,600
I didn't turn it off.

814
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,320
It's the battery.

815
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,680
Tap it like this.

816
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,400
Darn it.

817
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,240
Gosh. Here.

818
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,600
- Here.
- Come on, lady.

819
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,400
Who is it?

820
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,320
Let's go in!

821
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,920
Boss, I'll take care of Kim
Jae-yeol's house cleanup.

822
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,640
Are we there yet?

823
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,480
We are almost there.

824
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,560
Seo Do-young, you scumbag!

825
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,120
<i>As we pass midnight,</i>
<i>the outline of the winners...</i>

826
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,800
<i>...in each region is becoming clear.</i>

827
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,720
<i>In the conservative</i>
<i>stronghold of Shinnam-si,</i>

828
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,840
<i>Park Choong-ho has</i>
<i>safely secured his third term.</i>

829
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,600
<i>To all the citizens of Shinnam-si,</i>

830
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,495
<i>thank you.</i>

831
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,415
THE 18TH GENERAL ELECTION:
PARK CHOONG-HO, SHINNAM-SI

832
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,280
A THREE-TIME VICTORY AS
A UNIFIED PARTY CANDIDATE

833
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,895
<i>Your desire for capable</i>
<i>and honest politics,</i>

834
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,600
<i>as well as your support,</i>
<i>has led to my nomination...</i>

835
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,920
You sent it to Attorney Han, right?

836
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,880
Yes, it will be there soon.

837
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,690
<i>I will listen to the</i>
<i>voices of the people...</i>

838
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,920
<i>with more humility...</i>

839
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,840
<i>...and a lower posture.</i>

840
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,880
<i>Thank you!</i>

841
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,920
<i>Here's the news from the next constituency.</i>

842
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,186
<i>In Juwon-si, the Unified Party's candidate,</i>

843
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:34,815
<i>Kim Min-ho, who is running for re-election,</i>

844
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,240
<i>is leading over 73.8 percent of the votes,</i>

845
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,320
<i>with more than a</i>
<i>50,000-vote margin ahead of...</i>

846
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,120
I received the gift.

847
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,160
But I think there's been a mistake.

848
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,080
It's a bonus.

849
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,320
EVILIVE

850
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,080
<i>I wonder how much they earned.</i>

851
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,640
<i>We both received double</i>
<i>the amount promised.</i>

852
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:33,105
<i>We're friends.</i>

853
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,495
<i>I want to help.</i>

854
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,240
<i>We worked hard for nothing.</i>

855
00:59:36,537 --> 00:59:38,857
<i>What was this report about?</i>

856
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:41,039
<i>Give me a little more time.</i>

857
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,295
<i>You told Seo Do-young</i>
<i>you're quitting, right?</i>

858
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,455
<i>I never let go of what I pick.</i>

859
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,415
<i>Whatever that may be.</i>

860
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,935
<i>Did Seo Do-young make you do this?</i>

861
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,920
<i>Was it me or not?</i>

862
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,080
<i>You want to kill me and my family now?</i>
