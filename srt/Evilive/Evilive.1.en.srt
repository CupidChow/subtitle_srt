PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY...

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,960
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, AND TOURISM

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,960
ALL FIGURES, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,920
INCIDENTS, GROUPS,
OCCUPATIONS, AND OTHERS...

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,920
IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

8
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,960
I shouldn't have done it.

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,240
I shouldn't have...

10
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
...even stepped foot in here...

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,160
...in the first place.

12
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,320
I really shouldn't have.

13
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,960
EVILIVE

14
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,680
Moving on to the next report.

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Illegal game rooms died down...

16
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
...after the Fish and Cash incident...

17
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,215
...that caused controversy
with illegal games,

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,200
but they're thriving
again across the country.

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,560
The police raided and caught...

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,214
...more than 200 game rooms in Seoul...

21
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,600
...just over a month.

22
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,295
To avoid police inspection,

23
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,287
- Number 2754.
- they disguised their entrances...

24
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
- Please wait by room number two.
- ...as walls,

25
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,440
installed CCTV cameras,

26
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:07,912
had people stand guard,

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,360
or made use of other expedients...

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,320
...to run their businesses in secret.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Look here.

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,120
Your number was called several times.

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,480
Gosh, thank you.

32
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,680
Goodness. Take it easy.

33
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:34,015
This is no place you should
be coming to every day.

34
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:34,920
Alright.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
"Lee Young-hoon, 38 years old."

36
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,785
He's a first-time offender...

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,120
Mr. Lee Young-hoon?

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Who are you?

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm Attorney Han Dong-soo.

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
There's no time, so let
me go straight to the point.

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
You were sentenced to
three years for theft, right?

42
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:04,727
You're unconvicted until this week,

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,480
but from next week, you will be.

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,120
That means your sentence will be confirmed.

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,335
For your information,

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,600
you must lodge an appeal before then.

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,815
You have good conditions.

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,895
You're a first-time offender,
to begin with...

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
No, this is my second time.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,276
There was a misunderstanding.

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
Well, it's fine.

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
The amount wasn't so big.

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
Nor did you rob...

54
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,048
HE WIELDED A KNIFE TO THREATEN LEE.

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
Did you carry a knife?

56
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,990
Some try to attack me
when I go without a weapon.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm more timid than I look, you see.

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Well...

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,987
A NINE-YEAR-OLD SON, A SICK OLD MOTHER

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
You have a son. He's nine years old...

61
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
And your old mother is sick.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Right.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,360
Good.

64
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
This gives us hope.

65
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,169
If we stress that you're
the head of a family in need,

66
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,175
your sentence could be reduced by a year.

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
Really?

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Thank you.

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
I'll be counting on you, then.

70
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:19,574
Just a moment.

71
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,023
Wait. Aren't you a public defender?

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
No, I just seem like a public defender.

73
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,215
I provide a high-quality service...

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,480
...at a relatively low price.

75
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,014
Time is up.

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,640
Mr. Lee.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,080
You get a discount for
the third time onwards.

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,840
Like mileages, you know.

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,360
What's with that guy?

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't even know him,
and he called me out.

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,360
Everyone in Shinnam-si knows him.

82
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,335
You know him?

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,695
Regardless of detention
centers and prisons,

84
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,775
he goes around everywhere, so of course.

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,880
He's notorious.

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
Mr. Han.

87
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Just make it 500,000 won already.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,400
If I say yes to this,

89
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,255
I won't be able to
keep even the least bit...

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
...of my pride as an attorney.

91
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,520
You say you'll set me
up with two prisoners...

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,411
...and that you'll have
me as your attorney...

93
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,836
- ...instead of a public defender...
- Forget it then.

94
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:16,353
No, wait! Wait!

95
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:17,814
Like an anxious pup,

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,320
he visits jailhouses all day.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,015
Whether he knows you or not,

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
he just gives it a go.

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
I am sorry.

100
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,545
Shinnam-si...

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,800
Reducing a sentence,
settling with a victim.

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
That's all basic stuff that he does.

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
If you throw him a 10,000 won bill,

104
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:35,077
he even writes a letter of apology for you.

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Moon Law Firm takes...

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,680
...all the major lawsuits in Shinnam.

107
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,320
And the leftover crumbs.

108
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:42,655
Attorney Han takes what's left.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
At least, he has his pride.

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
He doesn't take cases
where children are the victims.

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
- Guess what you call it.
- What?

112
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:48,637
A shame.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,960
- A shame!
- You're right.

114
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,821
PLEASE WIRE THE MONEY BY 5 P.M. TOMORROW.

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,200
CIVIL SERVICE OFFICE

116
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,254
Dong-soo?

117
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:53,255
It's you, right? Han Dong-soo.

118
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,055
- Sir.
- Hey.

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
Look, it's Manager Han.

120
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
- Pardon?
- Oh, right.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,000
Sorry, I'm used to calling you a manager.

122
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:06,615
I've heard rumors,

123
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,560
but you're really back in the field.

124
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:10,055
How long has it been?

125
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Three years, maybe?

126
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,517
What... Did you know?

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
We've run into each other here and there.

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,280
Then why didn't you tell me?

129
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
This is so weird of you.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,960
It's not something to hide.

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,188
He's proudly back after
three years of suspension.

132
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,493
It should be celebrated everywhere.

133
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,020
Congrats. Here.

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,935
Oh, we aren't close enough...

135
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
...to shake hands, are we?

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,160
- Bye.
- Oh, wait.

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
Give me a Bar Association pamphlet.

138
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,999
- Hurry up.
- Oh, right...

139
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,501
You know, right? Our next general assembly.

140
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:01,566
Make sure you come.

141
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:04,911
I'll think about it.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
Oh, come on.

143
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,375
You're back after a long time.

144
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,760
You should say hi to everyone.

145
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:11,215
Who knows? Court staff will be there too.

146
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,320
You might get to take a few criminal cases.

147
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,580
Here.

148
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,375
Oh, right.

149
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,480
Don't make your service too cheap.

150
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,678
Other attorneys are unhappy about it.

151
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,520
I get you're in a rush,

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,080
but let's not abandon our dignity.

153
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:32,534
I'm rooting for you.

154
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,910
ELECTRONICS SHOPPING CENTER

155
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,880
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

156
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,159
I'm back.

157
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,600
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

158
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
I couldn't sleep much last night.

159
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,640
Bye.

160
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

161
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay.

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Excuse me.

163
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:20,791
Welcome.

164
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,960
I see you play games a lot.

165
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,880
Goodness.

166
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:33,744
This has low specs.
It must've been hard.

167
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:36,104
You just need to change its graphic card...

168
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,920
...and a few other parts.

169
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,240
But...

170
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Is it expensive?

171
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,639
It's better to buy a new computer.

172
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,952
I have a good one.
Would you like to take a look?

173
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,280
Yes.

174
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,895
This has the best specs.

175
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
An up-to-date graphic card...

176
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,840
...and a reasonable price.

177
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
It's only 400,000 won.

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
Then why is it...

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
Is it second-hand?

180
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,415
It's second-hand,

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,080
but it was used for less than a month.

182
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,599
Goodness, whatever.

183
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:16,120
Okay.

184
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,480
If you pay in cash,
I'll make it 370,000 won.

185
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,791
Thanks.

186
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,480
Goodbye.

187
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,176
- Bye.
- Enjoy your games.

188
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,680
- You gangster.
- Oh, gosh.

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
You startled me.

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,215
So why bother acting like a kid?

191
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
It's so degrading.

192
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,135
Boss, your employee is
stealing the store's money!

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
Hurry up and get over here! Now!

194
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,760
Hey, you little...

195
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
You're a total nutjob.

196
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,655
What brought you here at this hour?

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,640
Shouldn't you go to work?

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
I should.

199
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,440
The store can't go without
its general manager.

200
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,640
A general manager, my foot.
You're only a waiter.

201
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,801
Look who's talking, Mr. Parttimer.
I'm much better...

202
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:10,566
Hey, I'm fully booked today,
but I'm here...

203
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
...to help you earn money.

204
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,520
As if. It was totally
fruitless last time too.

205
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,015
I got told off so much...

206
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,320
Gosh, it's different this time.

207
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,640
He's a regular at my bar.

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,240
He's loaded. That's for sure.

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
Thank you, ma'am.

210
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,425
Uncle.

211
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
Be careful.

212
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Bye.

213
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Where's Auntie?

214
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,080
We're supposed to visit
Grandma together today.

215
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Something came up at the supermarket.

216
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,999
So I came alone.

217
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,640
And we'll meet your
dad at the nursing home.

218
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,840
That's okay, right?

219
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm okay,

220
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,550
but my dad might not be.

221
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,920
He will be. I told him to buy some yakgwa.

222
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,452
SHINNAM NURSING HOME

223
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
Why did you want to see me?

224
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,200
- That witch.
- Why don't you stop hitting...

225
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:14,213
- ...on someone else's man?
- How shameless...

226
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,320
...for someone who seduced
someone else's husband.

227
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
What are you saying?

228
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,720
She's a pregnant woman,
but she may have things to say.

229
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm here.

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,960
Who is he?

231
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,159
What's wrong with you?

232
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
He's your son.

233
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,160
You bragged so much
about him being a lawyer.

234
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,561
Did you have lunch?

235
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
What did you have?

236
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,280
Dried radish leaf soup.

237
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:45,455
You had something delicious.

238
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,695
It's your favorite, Mom.

239
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
It's not.

240
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,240
It was because there
was nothing else to eat.

241
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,320
I don't like dried radish leaves.

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,040
That's a lie. I know you like them.

243
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,480
You have them seasoned, blenched,
and stir-fried.

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
You say they make the best side dishes.

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
I keep hearing a mouse squeaking.

246
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm not a mouse. I'm Min-hee.

247
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,080
Yes, Min-hee.

248
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,400
Minnie, like the mouse.

249
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Mom.

250
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
- Hi, Dad.
- It's my baby girl.

251
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,183
- You!
- Not again!

252
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,560
I told you not to come here.

253
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,840
Didn't I say I'd kill
you if you came again?

254
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,400
Let me go before you continue!

255
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:29,465
You rotten punk! I'm not your mom.

256
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,480
Song Ae-sook is.

257
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,280
That darn witch.

258
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,880
- Mom.
- She deserves to die!

259
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,945
This is enough. Stop.

260
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,215
Stop it.

261
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
Right, Grandma. Leave Dad alone.

262
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
Good job, my daughter.

263
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Mister...

264
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Do you know what kind of jerk he is?

265
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,920
The darn witch who stole
my one and only husband...

266
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,040
That darn witch's son,

267
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,120
right?

268
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:58,606
Still,

269
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,455
for 20 years, I...

270
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,800
You fed and raised me. And I'm so grateful.

271
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,000
I know that, Mom.

272
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,302
I know it all.

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
So how about we have this?

274
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
Is it good?

275
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,200
Strange, isn't it?

276
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,920
She recognizes you and Min-hee,

277
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,240
but why doesn't she recognize me?

278
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:38,783
You should've been good to her.

279
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
What?

280
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,040
You have something for me.

281
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
Not this.

282
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,680
Why is it 30,000 won?
You said it was 50,000.

283
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,320
You should've done a proper job.

284
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,261
- You said he was a first offender.
- He wasn't?

285
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,360
First or second, it's almost the same.

286
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
He didn't seem like a jerk.

287
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
You're not the judge here.

288
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
He had a knife.

289
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,800
Special theft is way different from theft.

290
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,800
He simply tried to scare people.

291
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,840
- No one got hurt anyway.
- Why you...

292
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,313
Forget it.

293
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,518
Why do I even bother arguing with you?

294
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Keep doing a sloppy job.

295
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,920
And I'll fire you for real.

296
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:31,598
I doubt you can.

297
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Because I got a case.

298
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,223
Someone certainly loaded.

299
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,240
You always talk big.

300
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,560
It's real this time.

301
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,800
Make sure you give me a decent commission.

302
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,320
Mom!

303
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,600
Peel it for me.

304
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:53,815
TAEKWONDO SCHOOL

305
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,920
Let's go.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,280
Here.

307
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,280
Go straight to your uncle's
house after class, okay?

308
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm not you, you know.

309
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,240
Min-hee.

310
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,855
See you at home later.

311
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
- Okay, see you.
- Bye

312
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,545
Stop behaving like this,
or I'll call you a mouse too.

313
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,840
Whatever.

314
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Should we start talking business now?

315
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Ta-da.

316
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,520
What? I thought he was loaded.

317
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,560
He's just a kid.

318
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't worry. He's not anymore.

319
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,440
This was taken 20 years ago.

320
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,360
Well, 19 years, to be exact.

321
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
You brought an old picture? What for?

322
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,720
It suddenly brought back old memories.

323
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,320
Don't you remember him? It's Seo Do-young.

324
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
He was really famous.

325
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,135
BONGJU HIGH

326
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,095
The long-awaited final match...

327
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,295
...of the High School
Baseball Championships is...

328
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,680
...between Bongju
High and Sangjin High.

329
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,880
The current score is 4 to 3.

330
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,720
Seo Do-young is a
monstrous high school pitcher.

331
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,800
I wonder how he will pitch this time.

332
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,920
He throws.

333
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,000
A straight throw toward the batter.

334
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Strike.

335
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,720
Three strikes, and out!

336
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Yes!

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
That's him?

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
From that live broadcast?

339
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,560
Yes, it's that total psycho.

340
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,680
Bongju High is a step away from winning.

341
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
But the next batter isn't an easy deal.

342
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,960
It's Park Hyuk-soo.

343
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,520
He knows how to wage a
war of nerves with a pitcher.

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,880
Right. He could be the last batter,
and Seo Do-young...

345
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
Oh, he got hit.

346
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,800
Park Hyuk-soo's leg came in a little.

347
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,520
This should be a strike, not a dead ball.

348
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Why is this a dead ball?

349
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:14,344
Darn it. He lifted his leg.

350
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, this is not good.

351
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,920
Ejection.

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Seo Do-young is very angry to get ejected.

353
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
This shouldn't happen
in high school baseball.

354
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
He should be stopped.

355
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,840
His teammates and coaches
must hurry and stop him.

356
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,320
Bongju High's coach is coming belatedly...

357
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
SEO DO-YOUNG BEATS UP A REFEREE...

358
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,520
WHO DECLARES A DEAD BALL

359
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,480
Everyone could tell it was the wrong call,

360
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,400
but who knew he'd beat
him to a pulp over it?

361
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
And it was aired nationwide
in real-time at that.

362
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
So, what does he do now?

363
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
You know the Yuseong Gang, right?

364
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
He's their number two.

365
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
They say he's practically the boss.

366
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,920
Their boss had a stroke two years ago.

367
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,200
Goodness. In the end, he became a gangster.

368
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
Not just a gangster.

369
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,920
This is the Yuseong
Gang we're talking about.

370
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,800
Over there.

371
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Stop over there.

372
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,655
The clubs,

373
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,895
karaokes, and hostess bars over there...

374
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
...are all managed by the Yuseong Gang.

375
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,840
Just seven years ago,
it was the Family Gang's area,

376
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,760
but Seo Do-young cleared it in six months.

377
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
It's still Shinnam, nonetheless.

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,335
It's such a small neighborhood.

379
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,760
Is there anything to mooch off of?

380
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
There's an actual source of money.

381
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,320
Hey. How far are you going?

382
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,040
We're almost there.

383
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,320
You said that earlier.

384
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Hey!

385
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,320
Forget it. You go ahead.

386
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm going home.

387
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,640
You'll regret it if you miss this.

388
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,840
I clearly told you.

389
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
He'd better be there.

390
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,247
- Lower yourself!
- What?

391
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
ELECTRICAL STORE

392
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,760
Look.

393
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
What am I supposed to look at?

394
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
There are mountains.

395
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
No, the kindergarten.

396
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
A kindergarten?

397
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,680
What is that? At this hour?

398
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,640
A gambling house.

399
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
They picked...

400
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,375
...the closed stores
that didn't sell off...

401
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,960
...to rent the whole place for four days.

402
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,520
A kindergarten, nursery,

403
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
reading room, and sauna.

404
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,760
Only those places that
seem unrelated to gambling.

405
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,040
An exchange shop is a given,

406
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,680
and they even hire a lady to cook...

407
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,240
...to take care of their basic needs.

408
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,600
A one-stop system...

409
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,843
...where everything can be taken care of.

410
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,040
Once you're in there, you can't leave,

411
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,225
so they can maintain security.

412
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,480
People only play cards there,

413
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,840
so their profit increases.

414
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,480
It's killing two birds with one stone.

415
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,440
I bet they earn hundreds
of millions of won...

416
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:53,545
...once they start a game.

417
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
Last year,
the places in Busan were all busted.

418
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,640
All the gamblers are coming here now.

419
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,200
Isn't that too unguarded?

420
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,975
If rumors spread,

421
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,480
they'll be caught at once.

422
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,040
Don't you worry about that.

423
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,320
Did you think they'd
gamble without protection?

424
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,117
What do you think?

425
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:21,822
They're really loaded, aren't they?

426
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
What's with your face?

427
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:27,511
Why me?

428
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,560
I mean, he specifically picked me.

429
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:33,751
So why me?

430
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,000
When he's such a hotshot?

431
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,000
It's strange, no matter
how much I think about it.

432
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:39,534
Goodness.

433
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,960
You're complicating things again.

434
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,935
He's a member of a gang.

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,160
There's no way he has common sense.

436
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,255
Just go and see him.

437
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,680
We don't have any cases anyway.

438
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:54,597
Dong-soo.

439
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
We'll give up...

440
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,945
...if he doesn't seem like the right guy.

441
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,557
Okay.

442
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
I'll accept the deal, then.

443
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm home.

444
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
What are you doing?

445
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,591
Gosh, you scared me.

446
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,671
What's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?

447
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,560
I sprained my wrist a bit.

448
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
Doing what?

449
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,080
Gosh, it's nothing.

450
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,830
How's Mother?

451
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,920
Well, she's the same.

452
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,800
Don't mind her.

453
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,526
I have to wash up.

454
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:50,757
Right.

455
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,655
Attorney Moon Hae-jun of Moon Law Firm...

456
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,760
...held a press conference...

457
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,880
...and declared his candidacy.

458
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,360
Attorney Moon is...

459
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,320
...the 26th batch...

460
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,480
...of the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

461
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,280
He's working in Moon Law Firm,

462
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,160
the biggest law firm in the Yeongnam area.

463
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,720
He's also the son of Moon Sang-guk,

464
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,481
the prominent minister
of the Ministry of Justice,

465
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:29,786
drawing people's attention to him.

466
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,218
BONGJU HIGH

467
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:19,260
REGARDING VIOLENCE AND ITS PUNISHMENT...

468
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,320
What?

469
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,000
Gosh.

470
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,439
Thank you.

471
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:54,573
SEO DO-YOUNG

472
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,920
RELEASE DATE: FEBRUARY 20

473
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:04,262
I'm serious!

474
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,015
He told you to come this morning.

475
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:07,694
That's why it's strange.

476
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,534
Do you know why he was imprisoned?

477
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,695
Drunk driving...

478
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,200
...and beating a few police officers.
That's all.

479
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,695
He even hired Moon Law Firm...

480
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,320
...and the trial was done neatly.

481
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,040
He'll serve out his sentence in two weeks.

482
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,560
So why does he want to see me?

483
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,760
When it's all over?

484
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
Just go and see him.

485
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
You have nothing to lose.

486
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,615
If you don't think you can do it,

487
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
just make excuses and quit it later.

488
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,320
Come on.

489
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:46,596
NO TALKING DURING MOVEMENT

490
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,542
Dong-soo, don't be intimidated.

491
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,255
Have a fierce look in your eyes...

492
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,920
...and look at him until the end.

493
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,975
You should never lose a war of nerves...

494
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,080
...with guys like him.

495
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,365
Mr. Seo Do-young?

496
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,167
I'm Attorney Han Dong-soo.

497
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,520
I hate flies.

498
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
You have kids?

499
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,420
No.

500
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,360
Oh, that?

501
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,640
I have a niece.

502
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,760
You wanted to see me.

503
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,160
I believe your charge is dealt with.

504
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
You'll be released soon.

505
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,560
I was bored.

506
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,600
If you want a lawyer to do your errands,

507
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,065
you can ask the one who took your case.

508
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
They're no fun.

509
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,300
Your background is interesting.

510
00:32:19,547 --> 00:32:21,340
A lawyer who used to
be a law office manager...

511
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,176
...and took disciplinary action.

512
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,880
It feels lousy, right?

513
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
Sorry?

514
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,400
What? You're a lawyer, after all,

515
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,280
and you have to deal with a jerk like me.

516
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,720
"Darn it. This is ridiculous."

517
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,600
Right?

518
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,040
I like you, Attorney Han.

519
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,872
What about you?

520
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,143
MEAT SECTION

521
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,440
Does it still hurt?

522
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,600
- This won't do. Go see a doctor.
- No.

523
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,840
Sir.

524
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
- Sir.
- Hey!

525
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
Hye-young's wrist hurts. She can't work.

526
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,000
You should let her off early.

527
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,560
I heard you were hurt.

528
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,640
I hurt my wrist.

529
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,320
You should go, then.

530
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,560
You should go home.

531
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:05,175
I'll take care of the afternoon shift.

532
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,160
You should go.

533
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,720
Wait.

534
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,240
Things are good between us, right?

535
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:14,360
Sorry?

536
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,440
I mean, as long as we're all good,
it's fine.

537
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,640
You should go.

538
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,020
Bye.

539
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,783
Oh, wait.

540
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
You're Unit 601, right?

541
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,520
- Yes.
- Hold on.

542
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,000
Someone left this for you.

543
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,440
Thank you.

544
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:57,894
UNIT 601

545
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,920
VITAMINS

546
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,040
Let's go. Just give me one.

547
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,680
Where's the boss? Did he leave?

548
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,920
Yes, he left early.
He said something came up.

549
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
I see.

550
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:20,545
Darn it. I got the same card again.

551
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
What? I'm broke again?

552
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
Gosh, you always use your money for games.

553
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,495
Isn't 10,000 won worth 6 trillion?

554
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,760
How come you lost it
all in less than an hour?

555
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,760
Six trillion won is nothing.

556
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:36,318
You don't know anything.

557
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,631
If you win a big game,
you can win it all back at once.

558
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,080
Don't do it.

559
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,825
What is this, anyway? It's not real money.

560
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,400
It is real money.

561
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Six trillion won in the
game is worth 100,000 won.

562
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,640
They exchange the game
money for real money?

563
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Yes.

564
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,600
Move.

565
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:57,638
- What are you doing?
- Let me play a round.

566
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,440
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Let me play around.

567
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,400
Beom-jae.

568
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
You're doing well.

569
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,920
Dong-soo.

570
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,840
You hit the jackpot!

571
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,760
You should've called.
I could've gone to you.

572
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,320
Did you meet Seo Do-young?

573
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,920
You're still in touch with that guy, right?

574
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
Your waiter friend.

575
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,040
What about him?

576
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,640
He needs to return
something to Seo Do-young.

577
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,133
What is it?

578
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,880
It's just something.

579
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,286
What is that?

580
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,411
Nothing.

581
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,647
- Come on.
- It's nothing!

582
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:35,560
Fifty million won for half a day?

583
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,800
Why wouldn't you do it?

584
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,320
You just need to sit back and chat.

585
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,360
It doesn't feel good.

586
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,520
What do you mean?

587
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I don't know.

588
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm not sure how I should put it, but...

589
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,600
He has a knack for
making others feel crappy.

590
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:56,078
He's a gangster.

591
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,120
You should just humor him.
You're good at that.

592
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
It's not like that.

593
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,640
I don't know, really.

594
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:08,671
It's not the time to be picky, to be frank.

595
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,015
How long will you hop around
to jobs without an office?

596
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,480
Aren't you sick of visiting prisons?

597
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,920
I know. I know how hard it's been for you.

598
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,215
You were suspended...

599
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,075
...because of those jerks at Moon Law Firm.

600
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,420
I know how hard things have been.

601
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,960
So you should get back on your feet.

602
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:26,752
With this kind of money,
you can rent an office.

603
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:30,054
Then you can hang a
sign with your name on it.

604
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
You'll get more clients. Okay?

605
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,671
Forget it if you don't want to.

606
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,720
But I won't work with you either.

607
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,800
Hey!

608
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Hey!

609
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,560
- Hey!
- It's not like...

610
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,800
I introduced him for a few pennies.

611
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,145
It was all for you.

612
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:51,213
I did it for you, but you're
throwing your chance.

613
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,920
Hey, Beom-jae.

614
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
What? What do you want?

615
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,800
It wasn't just a consultation.

616
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,640
This wasn't a consultation.

617
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,760
He wants me to keep an eye on his woman.

618
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,000
That Seo Do-young.

619
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:14,911
I think she found a new man.

620
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,960
You want me...

621
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,080
...to keep an eye on her?

622
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:25,800
Why?

623
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:29,680
You can't?

624
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:32,727
I think...

625
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,200
...there are a lot of people
who'll be up for that.

626
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:42,839
Fifty million won.

627
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,720
I'll give you 10 million in advance.

628
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,840
If you find her before I'm released,

629
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,080
I'll give you the rest.

630
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,960
Why can't you do it?

631
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:56,975
He didn't ask you to steal or kill.

632
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,400
He just wants you to keep an eye on her.

633
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,480
She could get hurt.

634
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,920
Do you think he'll leave her alone?

635
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,407
We shouldn't...

636
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,400
...be so greedy.

637
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
I know we're short on money,
but we can't do this...

638
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:11,880
...when we know someone's going to be hurt.

639
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,080
This isn't right.

640
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:15,334
What about us, then?

641
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,280
Is it okay for us to
continue living like this?

642
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:21,240
Anyway, whether it's us or someone else,
it's going to get done.

643
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:22,735
If that's the case,
we might as well be the ones...

644
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,400
When you get in touch with your friend,
give me a call.

645
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:25,497
All right?

646
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,360
- I'm leaving.
- Dong-soo.

647
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,453
Dong-soo!

648
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,800
Darn it.

649
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,020
Seriously.

650
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,040
Your background is interesting.

651
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,280
A lawyer who used to
be a law office manager...

652
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,480
...and took disciplinary action.

653
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,480
It feels lousy, right?

654
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:05,501
What? You're a lawyer, after all,

655
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,960
and you have to deal with a jerk like me.

656
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,560
"Darn it. This is ridiculous."

657
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,090
MOON LAW FIRM

658
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,441
HOTEL PURPLE

659
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,720
- You're home.
- Yes.

660
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,807
What happened? Is it broken?

661
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
A slight fracture.

662
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,080
Goodness. You should've been more careful.

663
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,104
Thanks to this, I get to take a day off.

664
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,720
- Honey.
- Yes?

665
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,038
Should I get another job?

666
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:05,640
What?

667
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:07,726
I feel like...

668
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:10,927
I'm putting you through so much.

669
00:43:16,878 --> 00:43:18,798
It hasn't even been half a
year since you restarted.

670
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,720
Even if you eventually quit,

671
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:22,358
you should stick with it for a year.

672
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,920
If it still doesn't work out, then...

673
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,040
Well, we will open a fried chicken joint.

674
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,400
I got it.

675
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,821
Do Min-hee's clothes
go in the bottom drawer?

676
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:41,520
Yes. Put everything in the bottom drawer.

677
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,880
SHINNAM KR MART

678
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,440
- You got a text message.
- What?

679
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:56,351
I think it's from the supermarket.

680
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,359
What does it say?

681
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,567
- Should I check it?
- Yes.

682
00:43:59,935 --> 00:44:01,560
YOU GOT A MESSAGE.

683
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:03,514
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
CASE HAS BEEN CANCELED.

684
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:04,579
KR MART, THE AUDIT TEAM

685
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:12,422
What's this about?

686
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:16,877
What is it?

687
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,086
I went to the store manager's place.

688
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:25,940
What?

689
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:29,415
The lady who works there suddenly quit.

690
00:44:29,486 --> 00:44:31,380
So he asked me to look
after the house for a few days.

691
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:37,765
So you went?

692
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:40,255
He lives there alone.

693
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,520
He was on a business trip.

694
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,566
I thought it was an empty house.

695
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,160
It is continuing...

696
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,680
...to rebound.

697
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,560
But as time passes,

698
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,280
it will gradually start to...

699
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:31,689
Hye-young.

700
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:33,598
Hye-young, wait.

701
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:43,200
Where's his place?

702
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,174
Nothing happened.

703
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,760
That's the truth.

704
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,180
If this isn't a big deal, what is?

705
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,580
So...

706
00:45:52,654 --> 00:45:55,094
...is that why you
canceled the audit request?

707
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:56,645
Because it's nothing?

708
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:02,461
He's the kind of person
who uses his power at work...

709
00:46:02,486 --> 00:46:03,335
...to get what he wants.

710
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,280
But how can you do it
just because he asked?

711
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,604
How could you do that,
even if he's your boss?

712
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,386
There's something more to it,

713
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,800
isn't there?

714
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,400
I borrowed money.

715
00:46:19,998 --> 00:46:20,998
Ten million won.

716
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,100
What?

717
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,749
I applied for a loan at work,
and they said...

718
00:46:25,774 --> 00:46:27,254
...it would take two
months for the assessment.

719
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,710
He offered to lend me his money first.

720
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:35,920
What was...

721
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:38,813
...the money for?

722
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
Why did you...

723
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:45,880
...need the money?

724
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:48,840
It's for your mother's settlement.

725
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,486
She set fire to the nursing home again.

726
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:58,856
I think it won't come off easily.

727
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:01,160
Gosh, look at the state of this kitchen.

728
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:02,335
When will we clean this all up?

729
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,000
It's going to take forever.

730
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,760
Unbelievable.

731
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,360
It will take so long.

732
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,120
Tell me about it.

733
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,360
Let's clean this up.

734
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,680
This is bad.

735
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:24,720
MATCHES

736
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,160
I think it started there.

737
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:31,935
Fortunately, nobody got hurt.

738
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,360
And your mother is okay.

739
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,280
But they're pushing for
her immediate discharge.

740
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:38,015
If she gets kicked out of there,

741
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,440
she'll have nowhere else to go.

742
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,935
You should've told me this happened.

743
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,840
Why did you make the decision on your own?

744
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:49,320
You looked so overwhelmed.

745
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,360
You seemed...

746
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,156
...really overwhelmed. That's why.

747
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,935
Trying to make a living one way or another,

748
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,480
you were running about here and there.

749
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,600
Your brother's still unsettled.

750
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,893
Min-hee is young.

751
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:08,862
I couldn't let your mother's
problem add to that.

752
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:15,886
Honey.

753
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,680
Let me handle the case
with the store manager.

754
00:48:21,455 --> 00:48:24,215
I'll figure out the money somehow too.

755
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:25,295
Honey.

756
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:27,231
Please.

757
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:32,919
It's not your fault.

758
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,637
So, let me handle it.

759
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:16,767
I want to meet...

760
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,880
Store Manager Seo Chun-ki, is he around?

761
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,975
The store manager?

762
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,501
Mr. Seo.

763
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,776
STORE MANAGER SEO CHUN-KI, KR MART

764
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,077
I am Ms. Jung Hye-young's husband.

765
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,646
I want to talk to you.

766
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,109
Right.

767
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,854
But I'm doing the store check right now.

768
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,525
It'll just be a moment.

769
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,830
Well, go ahead, then.

770
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:00,509
Would you be okay if we talked here?

771
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,510
Would you like some green tea?

772
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,790
Please, have a seat.

773
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,200
You called my wife a few days ago, right?

774
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,760
To your apartment.

775
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,264
What?

776
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,936
Oh, that.

777
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,880
There was a bit of a misunderstanding.

778
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:47,214
A business trip was scheduled that day.

779
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,800
Look.

780
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,120
Here.

781
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,800
But suddenly, it got canceled, so...

782
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,040
Save the long excuses for the audit team.

783
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,920
What do you mean?

784
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,360
I'll formally raise this
issue within the company.

785
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,240
You already know what
happened at the apartment.

786
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,800
You know it's a violation of labor laws...

787
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,840
...to involve subordinates
in personal matters. Right?

788
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,160
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

789
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,400
It's a warning.

790
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:22,951
Don't attempt a half-hearted settlement.

791
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,735
If you do,
I'll consider it secondary harassment,

792
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,080
and I'll raise the issue.

793
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,320
I will see you at the audit committee.

794
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,280
You are not a lawyer, are you?

795
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:38,680
HAN DONG-SOO

796
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:41,960
You can make a business card
if you pay money for it.

797
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Aren't I right?

798
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,000
Why would a lawyer make his wife work here?

799
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:54,183
It's also very strange
that she has to go around...

800
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:55,949
...begging to borrow just 10 million won.

801
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:00,551
Tell me honestly.

802
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,800
This is a show, isn't it?

803
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,160
You are trying to swindle money from me.

804
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:06,335
Your wife isn't the only con artist.

805
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,040
Are you a marital fraud ring?

806
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,880
You pests.

807
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,120
What did you say?

808
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:14,722
Excuse me...

809
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,760
No. Come in.

810
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,720
I'll send you my bank details.
Send me the money.

811
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:24,213
I'll trust you, then.

812
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,520
You're a lawyer, right?

813
00:53:43,911 --> 00:53:45,951
Thank you for the offer,

814
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,640
but I don't think I am cut out for the job.

815
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,000
I am sorry.

816
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,880
How come?

817
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,720
Isn't it better than
doing sales to prisoners?

818
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,480
There's a line I shouldn't cross, you see.

819
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,400
A line?

820
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:01,712
The line is there to cross.

821
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,873
You haven't seen the bottom enough yet.

822
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,520
Mr. Seo Do-young.

823
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,640
Does this hurt your ego?

824
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:13,327
Then, keep living on pathetically.

825
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,920
All right. Okay.

826
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,840
Ten million won.

827
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:00,686
It's all there.

828
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,240
You've...

829
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,520
What?

830
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,000
You've already checked my identity.

831
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:08,022
Now, it's time for the audit committee.

832
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,360
I told you.

833
00:55:09,688 --> 00:55:11,968
- The business trip was canceled...
- Say that again!

834
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,680
I won't let it slide.

835
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,200
What will you do if you won't let it slide?

836
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,160
Will you hit me?
Will you kill me?

837
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,600
I will never get laid off from here.

838
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,640
The higher-ups put me here.

839
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,400
So stop wasting your
time and watch your wife.

840
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,400
Who knows which guy
she's flirting with now?

841
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,480
Darn it. I got so unlucky.

842
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:47,528
A line?

843
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,600
The line is there to cross.

844
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,160
What's this?

845
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,080
What are you doing?

846
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:24,015
I am sorry.

847
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,960
I am terribly sorry.

848
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:31,057
It's easier than you think.

849
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,520
You get excited.

850
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,120
You feel superior.

851
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,151
Report me if you will,

852
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,720
and sue me if you will.

853
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,520
But...

854
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,040
...you will have to pay for...

855
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,240
...what you have done.

856
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,760
I am sorry.

857
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,480
But nothing happened.

858
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,520
I only took off my clothes.

859
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,480
What can I do?

860
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,080
I will give you a week.

861
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,240
Either transfer or quit.

862
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,400
Do whatever you can...

863
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,800
...to remove yourself
from this supermarket.

864
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,880
But that's...

865
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,960
I heard you're going
through a divorce suit.

866
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,440
You want to pay a huge alimony...

867
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,600
...and lose child custody too?

868
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,056
Then, I will trust you to it and leave.

869
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,260
I will take the job.

870
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,600
I accept...

871
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,320
...your offer, Mr. Seo.

872
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,480
EVILIVE

873
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,520
Seo Do-young doesn't have a girl?

874
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,960
I heard he lives with a bar hostess.

875
00:59:59,040 --> 00:59:59,880
Did you find him?

876
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:02,665
He obsesses over a man
who is practically a shadow.

877
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,510
But he's not interested
in Park Je-yi at all.

878
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,080
You want to take my money for free?

879
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,280
The gang members
were fighting for the rank.

880
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,920
He's not looking for his
girl's lover but a betrayer.

881
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:13,792
You can't make a mistake.

882
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,640
Maybe we're going to
get caught in the crossfire?

883
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,800
We shouldn't leave any traces of us.

884
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,600
I can breathe now that
Seo Do-young might be dead.

885
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,265
Seo Do-young might be dead.
