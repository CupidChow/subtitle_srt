00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:29,800
EVILIVE

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,840
PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY...

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,840
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, AND TOURISM

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
ALL FIGURES, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,960
INCIDENTS, GROUPS,
OCCUPATIONS, AND OTHERS...

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
IN THIS DRAMA ARE
ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

7
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:38,204
A thick sea fog is covering
the whole Shinnam.

8
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,046
<i>Shinnam Bridge is</i>
<i>completely buried in the fog.</i>

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,590
<i>High buildings are...</i>

10
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:44,375
<i>...barely visible.</i>

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,320
<i>Traffic accidents are</i>
<i>occurring one after another.</i>

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,520
CHANG-YONG

13
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,631
How did it go with Seo Do-young?

14
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:53,877
<i>He's been taken care of, sir.</i>

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,880
Yes!

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,280
Darn, yes!

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,640
Good job.

18
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,855
I'll be off to the
Philippines for a few days.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,160
Keep the others under control.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,200
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,400
Gosh.

22
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,981
It's nice to enter through the front gate.

23
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,293
I'm finally not embarrassed.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,800
EPISODE 3

25
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:58,895
Darn, yes.

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,950
I bought a fine bottle of wine!

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
It's from France...

28
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,879
Who are you?

29
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,569
No...

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,460
Who are you, darn punks?

31
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,453
He says no.

32
00:02:58,503 --> 00:02:59,503
Heo Yang-ho,

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
you little rat.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
Do-young?

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
What?

36
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:11,919
Did you see a ghost or something?

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,480
You son of a...

38
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,942
<i>Did you handle Seo Do-young?</i>

39
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:39,685
<i>Answer me.</i>

40
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,631
Don't worry.

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,520
He's been taken care of.

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay, good job.

43
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:57,974
Liquid meth?

44
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,539
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Forgive me.

46
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:38,366
I shouldn't have done it.

47
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,006
I lost my mind for a bit.

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,960
You didn't trust me,

49
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,200
and Je-yi, that darn wench,

50
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,640
kept egging me on. I
wasn't in the right mind.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Do-young...

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,440
Please...

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
This once.

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
Just this once,

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
spare me.

56
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:03,118
I don't want to.

57
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,063
No.

58
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:12,542
Don't.

59
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
Not anymore.

60
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,320
The more people die,

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
the worse it will work against you.

62
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,527
If you get caught, you could
be sentenced to 20 years.

63
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,999
No, to life imprisonment.

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,200
To death at worst.

65
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,480
Oh, really?

66
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,280
Yes, of course.

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
So...

68
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,110
Oh, dear.

69
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,820
I just shot him.

70
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:04,101
We won't tell anyone
about what happened today.

71
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,491
I swear.

72
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:10,077
An obligation to keep
information confidential.

73
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
If an attorney discloses
his client's secret,

74
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,605
he will be sentenced to
less than three years in jail.

75
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,869
What about him then? He's not a lawyer.

76
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,215
Just leave without him.

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Then I'll let you go.

78
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,391
Please.... Please don't do this.

79
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,210
I beg of you.

80
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,701
I gave you...

81
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,630
the spy cam footage.

82
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,856
We practically saved your life.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Did you forget?

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
I know.

85
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,021
So I'll finish you quickly in one go.

86
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
C-Can you handle it?

87
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:16,213
This situation. Can you handle it all?

88
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,925
If you kill us too, there
will be four bodies.

89
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,120
Do you think...

90
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,960
it's even possible to take
care of four bodies alone?

91
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,239
If I were you, I'd never do that.

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
So,

93
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,120
what do you suggest?

94
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:40,757
Accomplices.

95
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,590
I'd make accomplices.

96
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,453
I'd have them take care of the bodies...

97
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,335
...and figure out a way out of this.

98
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,431
An alibi?

99
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,760
Yes.

100
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,480
Fine, then.

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,240
But if we're going to do it,

102
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,400
let's do it right.

103
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's hurry.

104
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,173
We must move while it's still foggy.

105
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,132
Beom-jae.

106
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:27,054
Beom-jae.

107
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,520
<i>From now on, we'll</i>
<i>take care of the bodies.</i>

108
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:17,762
<i>You have one thing to do in the meantime.</i>

109
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,760
<i>Make as many people</i>
<i>remember you as possible.</i>

110
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960
<i>To make that happen,</i>

111
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
<i>you'll need a strong,</i>
<i>unforgettable situation.</i>

112
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,640
What?

113
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
Excuse me.

114
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,328
What's with you?

115
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
- What are you doing?
- <i>Instead..</i>.

116
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,795
<i>...you must not cause</i>
<i>an accident or a conflict.</i>

117
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,520
I came to the wrong room.

119
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,000
Gosh, be careful.

120
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,519
Dong-soo.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,680
I-I can't do this.

122
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:15,798
Drink this.

123
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,678
We must do it.

124
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,040
Only then can we survive.

125
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,280
Dong-soo,

126
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,551
we'll burn in the inferno, won't we?

127
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:30,960
No!

128
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,520
What...

129
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
Min-hee?

130
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>Right.</i>

131
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:13,398
<i>It was a dream.</i>

132
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,960
<i>A dream.</i>

133
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,694
<i>I had a horrible nightmare.</i>

134
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:37,894
Aren't you going to work today?

135
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,613
No.

136
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:42,757
The rice is in the cooker. I'm off.

137
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
- Hye-young.
- Yes?

138
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,520
I'll drive you.

139
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
What?

140
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,200
It's nice to have a personal driver.

141
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
Bye.

142
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,505
When you leave work,

143
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
take a taxi home.

144
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,400
Don't travel by foot to save money.

145
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,760
Actually, why don't
I come pick you up?

146
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
Is anything going on?

147
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
As if.

148
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,000
I have a team dinner today.

149
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,440
It's been a while since I
had beer, so leave me alone.

150
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,880
Bye.

151
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Aren't you...

152
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,880
...going in today?

153
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
Well,

154
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
I should.

155
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
VISITATION REQUEST FORM

156
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,400
VISITATION REQUEST FORM

157
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
What are you doing?

158
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,360
What are you doing?

159
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
Where's the spy cam?

160
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
The spy cam from yesterday. Where is it?

161
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,000
Why are you looking for it?

162
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
I'm going to give it to the police.

163
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
What?

164
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
I'm going to report it.

165
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,106
Are you insane?

166
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:17,006
Seo Do-young won't stay still about it.

167
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:18,837
If we don't give it to the police,

168
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
will he leave us be?

169
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,080
He must be arrested for us to survive.

170
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,200
That's the best way we have right now.

171
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,920
We were captured in the footage.

172
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,240
We're his accomplices.

173
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,734
We were forced to dump
the bodies, so we aren't.

174
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,621
Our lives were being threatened,

175
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,006
and we had no choice.

176
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,880
Then what about the spy cams and tailing?

177
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:43,406
Once the investigation
begins, it'll all be revealed.

178
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,800
People died.

179
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,079
Can you forget what happened
yesterday and move on?

180
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
- Here.
- Okay.

181
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,640
Is everything in here?

182
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,120
Yes.

183
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,080
Say you didn't know anything...

184
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,000
...about the spy cams and tailing.

185
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,760
You broke into that house
because I asked, okay?

186
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,040
What are you saying?

187
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
You'll take the blame alone?

188
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
Dong-soo.

189
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I'll go.

190
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,359
If either of us has to go, I will.

191
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,560
This is worth a sentence in jail.

192
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,055
You'll lose your license for good.

193
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
You're Min-hee's dad.

194
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,623
You don't want to break her heart for life.

195
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Don't get any other ideas.

196
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:50,654
Just think about one thing.

197
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,880
Min-hee.

198
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
Dong-soo.

199
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,344
SHINNAM POLICE STATION

200
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,000
We won't tell anyone
about what happened today.

201
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,040
I swear.

202
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,760
An obligation to keep
information confidential.

203
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,480
If an attorney discloses
his client's secret,

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,120
he will be sentenced to
less than three years in jail.

205
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:08,906
Hello?

206
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:23,338
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

208
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,800
You must be in a rush for something.

209
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
Yes, I'm a little...

210
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,080
Oh, okay. Just a moment.

211
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
All right.

212
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,320
- Stuffed dolls!
- Do you want these?

213
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,960
- Yes!
- Yes!

214
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
- I'll throw them at the count to three.
- Okay.

215
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
One, two, three!

216
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,280
- Yes!
- There you go.

217
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,840
Let's go.

218
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
- Let's go.
- Let me open this.

219
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,240
I don't know how to do it.

220
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,400
Hey!

221
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,879
There was a spy cam
we didn't get to retrieve.

222
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,583
The whole thing was
captured yesterday.

223
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
I will...

224
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,508
...give it to you.

225
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:56,840
With this gone,

226
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
there won't be any evidence...

227
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
...about what happened yesterday.

228
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,562
Deal.

229
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:07,765
But you think this is...

230
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,734
...what I really want?

231
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,845
There's just one thing
that's necessary to be friends.

232
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:19,606
Friendship.

233
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,840
Is it that hard?

234
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
I went to the police
station for something else.

235
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,520
You know...

236
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,840
...most of my clients
are at such places.

237
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
What is this?

238
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:49,469
A gift of our friendship.

239
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,773
Make sure you pick up when it rings.

240
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,480
Why are you doing this?

241
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,160
I told you...

242
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,600
I wouldn't tell anyone.

243
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
That I'd take it to the grave.

244
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Please.

245
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
I beg you.

246
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,151
Please let me go.

247
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't want to.

248
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,013
I like you.

249
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,638
Let's keep this going while we're at it.

250
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:30,245
Rather than visiting prisons,

251
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,160
being a legal advisor...

252
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,360
...is cool.

253
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,880
Give it some thought.

254
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
I'm open to it.

255
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,501
Oh, right.

256
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,852
Your niece's name is Min-hee, right?

257
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,589
I'll give her some pocket
money when I meet her.

258
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm practically her uncle now.

259
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,263
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

260
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,960
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

261
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,664
PRESIDENT HEO YANG-HO

262
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,120
This is Chang-yong, sir.

263
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,327
Please call me when you get this message.

264
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,480
<i>Your message has been saved.</i>

265
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,453
I just tried calling you...

266
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:51,982
Sir.

267
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,120
PRESIDENT HEO YANG-HO

268
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
"President?"

269
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:12,245
I'll order a new one
tomorrow right away, sir.

270
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:15,382
Apologies, sir.

271
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:17,597
You scumbags.

272
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Won't you do your jobs right?

273
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,840
Didn't you check his release date?

274
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:23,615
Didn't you?

275
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,800
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

276
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Apologies, sir.

277
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,960
Hey.

278
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,493
Weren't you one of Du-sik's minions?

279
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,840
After we lost contact with him,

280
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,243
I joined the guys here.

281
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,925
Then you can go up to replace him.

282
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,600
Sir.

283
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,880
He's my subordinate.

284
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,920
Then fight him and prove your worth.

285
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,774
What? You don't think you can do it?

286
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,549
All right, go inside.

287
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,407
- Take a seat.
- What's this?

288
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:37,775
Is everyone in and seated?

289
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,840
- Yes! - Yes!

290
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
Excuse me.

291
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,960
Hello, Min-hee...

292
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,840
I heard she didn't need a ride today.

293
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:48,975
That she'd go separately.

294
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,240
She left just a while ago.

295
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,160
Oh, over there.

296
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,680
Min-hee!

297
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
- Min-hee.
- Uncle?

298
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,720
24 HOURS TOP

299
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
24 HOURS TOP

300
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:28,327
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

301
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:32,958
- I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it.

302
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,880
I should've let you know in advance.

303
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,480
I knew we lived in the
same apartment building,

304
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,983
so I felt bad taking just my son.

305
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:41,662
The same apartment building?

306
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,959
Oh, it's been a little more than 10 days...

307
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:45,188
...since we moved from Seoul.

308
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,333
I see.

309
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:51,588
Things have been hectic for me these days.

310
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:56,397
Anyway, what brought you
to the police station earlier?

311
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:58,260
Pardon?

312
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,910
Don't you remember?

313
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,814
We almost bumped into each other.

314
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,231
I'm sorry.

315
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
You must be in a rush for something.

316
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,037
Oh, right.

317
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,480
You have a sharp eye.

318
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,120
Thanks to the job I have.

319
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,350
I'm a detective.

320
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,240
I see.

321
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,854
It seemed like you were
there to report something.

322
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:29,558
Are you perhaps in a difficult situation?

323
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:33,677
Well, we have such
people from time to time.

324
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,184
They come all the way
to the police station...

325
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,289
...and turn around at the front gate.

326
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,560
It could be a simple change of mind,

327
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:42,078
but a lot of them give up on reporting.

328
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:43,925
For instance,

329
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:47,351
because they're threatened or conciliated.

330
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,248
Well...

331
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:55,391
The thing is...

332
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:57,809
Truth be told,

333
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,560
there's someone who bothers me.

334
00:28:05,414 --> 00:28:06,454
You darn little rat!

335
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,160
Are you trying to take my money for free?

336
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,960
He's violent...

337
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,560
...and merciless.

338
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,943
Oh, dear.

339
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,480
I just shot him.

340
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
He acts incomprehensibly on impulse.

341
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,280
He has zero decency towards people.

342
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:28,703
Not even the slightest bit.

343
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,359
In short, he's a lunatic.

344
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:35,477
I won't be able to escape from him...

345
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:37,702
...forever at this rate.

346
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,470
Who is that?

347
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,855
It's okay. Tell me.

348
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
I may be able to help you.

349
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,470
The neighbor upstairs.

350
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:53,438
Excuse me?

351
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,480
The noise from upstairs
is driving me crazy.

352
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,600
Oh, I see.

353
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:04,925
Yes, the noise between
floors. It drives you crazy.

354
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,160
Right.

355
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,920
It's delicious.

356
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,240
I'm not going to have it.

357
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:19,775
- Well, then.
- Okay.

358
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,840
- See you around.
- Right.

359
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,320
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

360
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,520
Bye.

361
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:28,928
Uncle.

362
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,319
Yes?

363
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:34,735
Isn't it pretty?

364
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,279
Gosh, it's pretty.

365
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:39,375
Who bought it for you?

366
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:41,423
Your auntie? Your dad?

367
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:43,557
No, Uncle.

368
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:45,646
Uncle?

369
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,398
Your friend. Uncle Do-young.

370
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:04,626
Boss!

371
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,160
Congratulations on your release.

372
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,720
He has finally returned after eight months.

373
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,400
Now we just have to trust him.

374
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,800
But first, we have some
business to take care of.

375
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
<i>Do-young received his verdict.</i>

376
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
<i>He won't be released.</i>

377
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,080
- Who's that?
- Isn't that Yang-ho?

378
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,560
<i>I will keep him there forever.</i>

379
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,480
<i>This is the true face of Heo Yang-ho,</i>

380
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,760
<i>whom we once considered a boss.</i>

381
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
He made a fool of the big brother.

382
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,000
He took advantage of
the organization's money,

383
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,545
and pushed it into the casino.

384
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:42,335
And even dared to threaten Do-young's life.

385
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,640
He even intended to
sell off this nightclub too.

386
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,160
- That jerk!
- Scumbag!

387
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,040
<i>In other words, he played</i>
<i>with our organization.</i>

388
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,800
<i>We're putting a bounty</i>
<i>on Heo Yang-ho's head.</i>

389
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:56,832
You can either capture
him and bring him to us...

390
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,680
...or kill him yourself.

391
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:01,775
Those who dared to have
other thoughts must be...

392
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,520
...shaking like crazy right about now.

393
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Am I right?

394
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,000
I'll pour you a drink, boss.

395
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
Cheers!

396
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

397
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,760
Darn it! We can't just sit around!

398
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,480
- Relax.
- How can I relax about this?

399
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,560
This guy's gone too
far. Now, even Min-hee...

400
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,120
What should we do?

401
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,786
Are we going to be...

402
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,080
Seo Do-young's toys
for the rest of our lives?

403
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:27,374
We should take action before that happens.

404
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:30,607
Let's...

405
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,158
...report the casino.

406
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:34,053
But what if we get caught?

407
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,551
We can make an anonymous report.

408
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,960
Think about it.

409
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,200
All sorts of people go there.

410
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
There are people who've
lost their entire fortune.

411
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,879
Mothers who came
chasing after their husbands.

412
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:46,935
Even if anyone reports it,

413
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,560
it won't seem suspicious at all.

414
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:53,718
What happens when
Seo Do-young comes out?

415
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:58,111
First, we'll get him
with the casino,

416
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,190
and then we'll tie
him to a murder case.

417
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,854
Planned murder, evidence
tampering, body disposal,

418
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,040
and on top of that,

419
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,479
coercion charges
will all be established.

420
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,439
Put together, it might
lead to a life sentence...

421
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:12,096
or even a possible
death penalty.

422
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,269
No matter how much he
tries to use connections,

423
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,319
he won't get out of prison...

424
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:19,718
for life.

425
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,760
How can we report it...

426
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:23,825
...when we don't even
know where the casino is?

427
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,720
They inform only the
heads a day before opening.

428
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,160
To enter, you have to
surrender your ID and phone.

429
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:32,343
What about the kindergarten?

430
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,381
Seok found it through the
gang members he knew.

431
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:38,646
But they've been all ousted.
He's got no connections.

432
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,333
I will figure it out.

433
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,154
What?

434
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,269
I'll ask...

435
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:52,351
Seo Do-young directly.

436
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,160
What's up?

437
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,292
It's about the offer
we discussed last time.

438
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,600
Working together.

439
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,320
Is that still on the table?

440
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,640
You're interested?

441
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,160
Well, since it's already a mess,

442
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,080
I thought I'd make some money.

443
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,520
You aren't going to let
me go anyway, are you?

444
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,391
You're smart.

445
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,000
There are conditions, though.

446
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,253
I need to personally inspect...

447
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:56,655
all the businesses you manage.

448
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,360
The types of businesses,
their scale, revenue,

449
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:00,527
and operating profits, all of it.

450
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,480
Only after that will I
make a final decision.

451
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,040
Those are quite demanding conditions.

452
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,720
If I'm handling just one case,

453
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
it wouldn't be this complicated.

454
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
But I assume your request to me...

455
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,800
...goes beyond...

456
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
...the role of a lawyer, right?

457
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:28,802
Okay.

458
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:31,142
Come to Gilbin-dong tomorrow.

459
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,687
All the businesses are gathered there.

460
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:35,614
But you know your main
business is separate, right?

461
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,980
"The House."

462
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:46,503
Is it not possible for me...

463
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,840
...to go there?

464
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,472
I'll have my people contact you.

465
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,160
Did Yang-ho really run?

466
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,480
Seo Do-young didn't kill him?

467
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,800
He could have, but
there's no way to confirm it.

468
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,614
If Yang-ho calls, contact me.

469
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:45,046
Boss.

470
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:48,798
What should I do now?

471
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,239
Why are you asking me that?

472
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
Darn it.

473
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,400
IN FRONT OF MIRAM

<i>Don't be late. 1 p.m.</i>

477
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,520
<i>Meet me in front of Miram</i>
<i>Supermarket, Jangdo-dong.</i>

478
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,754
I need to use the toilet.

479
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,359
Where are you going?

480
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
DACOM ZONE

481
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,080
Hey!

MIRAM SUPERMARKET

483
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
<i>They will confiscate</i>
<i>the phone at the casino.</i>

484
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,192
<i>I will get you a faux phone.</i>

486
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,120
What?

487
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
Right. That's me.

488
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,128
Get in.

489
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,680
MIRAM SUPERMARKET

490
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,120
<i>You need a tracking device.</i>

491
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,320
<i>Get a good one out.</i>

492
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,320
You and I will move together.

493
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,240
I'll enter "The House"
following Seo Do-young,

494
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,280
and you'll tail us from the outside.

495
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,360
Once we confirm the location,

496
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
contact the police immediately.

497
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,120
What happens next?

498
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,840
It's good that Seo
Do-young is getting arrested.

499
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,200
But you might get arrested too.

500
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
Once his arrest is confirmed,

501
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,440
I will get myself out of it.

502
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:10,463
It's going to be a mess...

503
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,680
once the police arrive.

504
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,960
There has to be a way.

505
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:18,046
Darn it.

506
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,480
We've arrived.

507
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Take it off.

508
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,480
Where is it?

509
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
Be careful.

510
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,320
Be careful.

511
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:48,053
The women wear medium,

512
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
and the men wear large.

513
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,640
Make sure it fits snugly.

514
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,879
Why are we wearing this?

515
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,991
Can you swim well?

516
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,920
If you can swim well, you
don't need to wear one.

517
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:14,751
<i>I'll plant a tracking device on your belt.</i>

I've been circling the same spot.

523
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:44,263
Darn it.

524
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,120
No way.

525
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,400
Come here, show your IDs,

526
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,720

...come to meet Mr. Seo Do-young.

You are just like everyone else.

530
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,240
Let me see your ID.

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,640
All right, people.

535
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,160
Come this way.

536
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,640
You're here.

537
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,240
Is this how you always
bring in the customers?

538
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,200
Only those who aren't verified.

539
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Let's go in.

540
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,640
<i>Come on.</i>

541
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,360
<i>Go!</i>

542
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,680
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

543
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,480
Look around.

544
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,080
<i>That's not right.</i>

545
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,360
<i>Did you see that?</i>

546
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,960
<i>- Yes!</i>
<i>- Nice.</i>

547
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,600
<i>Go.</i>

548
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,520
I won! Yes!

549
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,973
What? That's...

550
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,280
...fish And Cash, right?

551
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,520
Darn it.

552
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,920
We only operate it in places like this.

553
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,400
The earnings are dwindling,

554
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,440

555
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm worried about the crackdown.

557

...a 40-minute boat

Hello? Dong-soo?

586
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:10,385
I said it's about a 40-minute boat ride.

A 40-minute boat ride from Haejang Port.

590
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,720
Okay. An island.

591

I don't know. There's nothing here.

594
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,440
I think it's a deserted island.

595
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Right.

596
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,640
There's a lighthouse over there.

597
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,400
It's a white lighthouse.

598
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,440
Okay.

599
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,040
I'll call the police,

00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:54,606

I want to report an illegal gambling den.

615

It's an island.
