EPISODE 4

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
You came.

8
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:27,160
What do you think of this
place as a gambling den?

9
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:31,935
It brings back old times...

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
...to be here after a while.

11
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,080
I didn't see you around that day.

12
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:41,080
Did you go somewhere?

13
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:46,859
We're on the same side, right?

14
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,099
I didn't want us to get
arrested all together.

15
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,339
If you got caught,

16
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,139
you'd need an attorney.

17
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,979
I risked my life to run away from there.

18
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,619
For you.

19
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:03,819
Oh, really?

20
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,553
Anyway, well...

21
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,219
I'm glad you're safe.

22
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,979
But what happened?

23
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,321
Well, we go by our manual.

24
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,579
Quiet down!

25
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,259
<i>Don't be intimidated,</i>

26
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:29,554
<i>and do as you're told.</i>

27
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,739
<i>Everything will be all right.</i>

2008 DESERTED ISLAND TOUR

30
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:54,100
WELCOME TO THE DESERTED ISLAND TOUR.

31
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,779
Whoever it was,

32
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,680
they probably thought we were too easy.

33
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,280
Well...

34
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,739
Let's go clean things up, then.

35
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,801
This way, please.

36
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,040
Come in.

37
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,739
Goodness.

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,939
Dong-soo.

39
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:03,146
- Beom-jae?
- Dong-soo.

40
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:04,899
Why is my brother here?

41
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,099
He hasn't even seen the gambling den!

42
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,339
The alibi you like.

43
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,659
He doesn't have it.

44
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,187
Wait, no.

45
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,899
Please...

46
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,979
Don't do this.

47
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,859
Sir, no!

48
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:31,579
It's not me.

49
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,219
Sir, please!

50
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,219
It's not me.

51
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,779
It's not me!

52
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,579
Goodness...

53
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,899
What are you doing?

54
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,520
They have to pay the price.

55
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,659
This is all part of the manual.

56
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,499
Are you saying they all made a report?

57
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,080
That would make no sense.

58
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,820
I'm just cutting all their fingers.

59
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:16,760
Hurry up.

60
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,099
- Dong-soo!
- No!

61
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,539
- No!
- Dong-soo.

62
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,619
Don't!

63
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,499
Beom-jae.

64
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,139
Please.

65
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,579
Dong-soo.

66
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,459
- Let go.
- No.

67
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:51,779
- I said, let go.
- No.

68
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:07,979
Beom-jae!

69
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,419
- Dong-soo.
- Beom-jae.

70
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,539
You or him?

71
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:27,810
You decide.

72
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,800
Or I can take one each to be fair.

73
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,834
Why are you laughing?

74
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,720
I get how low you people are.

75
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:59,188
You say it's a business,

76
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,040
but you're just neighborhood thugs.

77
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,337
Say that again.

78
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,979
This is no business.

79
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,499
Even a small store isn't run like this.

80
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:20,348
Just what do you gain...

81
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,019
...by doing this?

82
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,299
A reputation as a gangster? Influence?

83
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:26,914
But what's the use of all that?

84
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,739
You don't get money out of cutting fingers.

85
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,520
It wasn't the first inspection, was it?

86
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,394
- No.
- How many inspections...

87
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,699
...did you go through last winter?

88
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,419
- Twice?
- Why?

89
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,699
You must've cut tens...

90
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,204
No, hundreds of fingers.

91
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:46,819
How long will it last this time?

92
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,084
Three months? Four months?

93
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,619
This will continue to happen.

94
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,899
Whether you cut fingers or wrists,

95
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,459
it will happen again.

96
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,339
Fear isn't a strategy.

97
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,619
It's only first aid.

98
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,809
So, what's your point?

99
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,219
You need an operation.

100
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,059
A fundamental operation...

101
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,840
...to make this a sustainable business.

102
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,019
A sustainable business...

103
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,800
I like how you put it.

104
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:28,980
But...

105
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,819
...do you think it never crossed my mind?

106
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,059
I'll take care of my own business.

107
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,179
Do-Dong-soo...

108
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,779
Dong-soo.

109
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:50,760
What if that operation is possible?

110
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,619
You better be cautious.

111
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,680
Or your tongue will be cut out too.

112
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,619
Online gambling.

113
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,939
<i>It's a kind of online gambling...</i>

114
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,404
<i>...where people bet on sports games.</i>

115
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,300
<i>Because it takes place online</i>
<i>instead of off-line at gambling sites,</i>

116
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,845
<i>its harmful effect is much bigger.</i>

117
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,339
It's about betting on sports games.

118
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,339
It takes place online,

119
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,899
so it'd have bigger market power.

120
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:22,859
In terms of scale,

121
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:25,355
it wouldn't even be
compared to house gambling.

122
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,579
<i>About 1.26 million dollars.</i>

123
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:29,794
<i>In Korean won, it's as</i>
<i>big as 16 trillion won.</i>

124
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,754
<i>In the UK, an online gambling company...</i>

125
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,939
<i>...even managed to go public.</i>

126
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,619
What's important is,

127
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:39,093
there isn't anything
like this in Korea yet.

128
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:02,796
Gosh, thank you.

129
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,000
The Game of Cards.

130
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,859
Don't do it.

131
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,637
What is this, anyway?
It's not real money.

132
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,339
It is real money.

133
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:19,252
Six trillion won in the
game is worth 100,000 won.

134
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,579
They exchange the game
money for real money?

135
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,779
Yes.

136
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:23,979
Move.

137
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,219
- What are you doing?
- Let me play a round.

138
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,099
- Come on. Let me play around.
- Beom-jae.

139
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,019
Dong-soo.

140
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,379
You hit the jackpot!

141
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,331
You all know the Game of Cards, right?

142
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,939
What if you can do real gambling with it?

143
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,739
Exchange game money...

144
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,059
...with cash.

145
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,219
R-Right.

146
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,379
Everyone plays the
Game of Cards these days.

147
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,819
It'll be a hit for sure
if you can make one.

148
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,259
What does it have to do
with preventing reports?

149
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,874
This game can be played on legal websites.

150
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,539
It's not on the police watch list.

151
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,339
It should be much safer...

152
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,320
...than gambling dens.

153
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,539
It's easier to run away too.

154
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,299
You simply have to log out.

155
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,379
- Wait.
- Stay still.

156
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,979
- Goodness.
- What is it?

157
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,307
We got the scumbag who made the report.

158
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,019
He lost a big sum at the
kindergarten gambling den.

159
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:35,139
He confessed that he
reported us on impulse.

160
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,490
I'm sorry!

161
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,739
I know I don't deserve forgiveness!

162
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,484
But spare me just this once!

163
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,084
Please spare me!

164
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,051
Please...

165
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:46,619
Don't kill me.

166
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:49,124
Sir! Please just this once!

167
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm sorry! Please...

168
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,539
Attorney Han.

169
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,259
Yes?

170
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:14,285
You know what to say
at the hospital, right?

171
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,154
Welcome aboard on New Kronos,

172
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,659
the biggest luxurious cruise in Korea.

173
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:42,555
NEW KRONOS SERVICE OPENING CEREMONY

174
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:47,043
New Kronos will depart
from Shinnam tomorrow...

175
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,899
...and begin its long journey to Japan,
Russia, and China.

176
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,219
Goodness.

177
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,659
Gosh, I'm sorry.

178
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,020
I'm a little late.

179
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,739
Did you drink?

180
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:13,436
Too many people want me here and there.

181
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,245
Shouldn't we get started now?

182
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:19,760
The election.

183
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,539
I've decided...

184
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,299
...to run as an independent.

185
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,490
I want to stand on my own.

186
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,099
Will Mr. Moon stay still about this?

187
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,667
That's what I mean.
Let's bring it on...

188
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,763
...and see if the experienced
current assemblyman wins...

189
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:42,830
...or if it will be the greenhorn...

190
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:47,299
...whose only strength
is his father backing him.

191
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:48,659
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

192
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:53,920
What was that?

193
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:55,859
After the election,

194
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,659
Mr. Moon will be at the
government office in Gwacheon.

195
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,259
As the new Minister of Justice.

196
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:04,139
Will you please read the air?

197
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,004
I see you're mistaken about something,

198
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,619
but I'm not the same
Park Choong-ho as before.

199
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,259
I've strengthened my position for 10 years.

200
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:15,497
Complex 3, Unit 1502.

201
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,139
Complex 5, Unit 2101.

202
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,339
You got only the penthouses.

203
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,813
They say rich people are even worse.

204
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,811
You took 10 redevelopment apartment houses.

205
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,779
Are you digesting them all fine?

206
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,299
It wasn't just me.

207
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,779
You all...

208
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:35,019
Yes, you and I took them for ourselves.

209
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,939
Once Hae-jun becomes an assemblyman...

210
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:41,899
...and joins the Judiciary Committee,

211
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,699
it'll be a direct solution...

212
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,964
...to the Marine Resort Complex...

213
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,280
...that has been floating
for nothing for years.

214
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:51,939
Then I...

215
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,979
I will take over the marine casino.

216
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,979
So if you're to get some rake-offs,

217
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,139
please stay put already.

218
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,339
Goodness.

219
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,339
Here you go.

220
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,979
Gosh, thanks.

221
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,899
It's good.

222
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,659
So, how is it?

223
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,339
Did you get used to things a little?

224
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,819
I barely finished grasping my work.

225
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,739
Someone reported a
gambling den, didn't they?

226
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,099
How did it go?

227
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,299
A gambling den?

228
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,099
Oh, that?

229
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,939
It wasn't really anything.

230
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,939
I heard there was a misunderstanding.

231
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:38,699
They were having a deserted island tour.

232
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,259
A deserted island tour on a weekday,

233
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,659
not even on the weekend?

234
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,939
More than 100 people at that.

235
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,179
There was no evidence, so that was it.

236
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:51,892
I see there are gangsters
in this neighborhood.

237
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,859
The Yuseong Gang and the Family Gang.

238
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,379
Could it have something to do with them?

239
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,019
What? Are you getting itchy...

240
00:15:58,099 --> 00:15:59,979
...to catch those bad guys?

241
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,339
Well, that's not it.

242
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:05,579
You don't have to mind them at all.

243
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,259
There's a strict order
within the neighborhood.

244
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,314
They run different
businesses in different districts,

245
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:11,579
so they hardly get into conflicts.

246
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,459
And the Yuseong Gang clearly
has the upper hand,

247
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,179
so fighting is not an option.

248
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,659
They voluntarily avoid...

249
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,819
...getting involved with the police.

250
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,899
So, Detective Ma,

251
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,521
take it easy.

252
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,339
An easy-going...

253
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,059
...and indifferent attitude.

254
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,819
That's our strength, okay?

255
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,308
Yes, right.

256
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:53,200
SHINNAM FERRY

257
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:14,243
Hey, handle them with care.

258
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,428
These are expensive.

259
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,874
Put the musks and gall bladders by size,

260
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,939
and wrap those leaves by type.

261
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,779
This old geezer must be on a roll.

262
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,960
It's a gift for your new business.

263
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,379
Aren't you proud of me?

264
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,404
I didn't even get invited
because I was a thug.

265
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,739
These leaves look nice and fresh.

266
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:56,979
Too bad, though.

267
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,843
This pot annoys me.

268
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,141
Plant it in another pot.

269
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,299
No matter how fine a tree is,

270
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:06,874
if it's planted in a sharp and small pot,

271
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,379
it can't live long.

272
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,419
What is with you?

273
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,482
And what is with you?

274
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,539
I told you to watch people gamble quietly,

275
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,939
so was it that hard?

276
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,947
I caught the one who made the report...

277
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,532
...and got compensation for the machines.

278
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,939
Do the calculations right.

279
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:26,954
The business should've lasted three days,

280
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,219
but it lasted less than half a day.

281
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,579
The cost of the machines isn't the issue.

282
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:33,859
The sales and labor
costs to attract clients...

283
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,259
Don't worry.

284
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,204
I covered all the losses.

285
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,379
What about the police?

286
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,739
What are you going to do about them?

287
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,019
The report history will remain,

288
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,604
so will they just stay still?

289
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,100
Isn't that your job?

290
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:55,457
Seo Do-young, you've lost your touch...

291
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:56,962
...after your time in prison.

292
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:59,682
This is no ordinary time.

293
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,442
It's more like war.

294
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:02,817
When you watch the news,

295
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,682
more than half the reports are...

296
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:06,187
...about illegal gambling inspections.

297
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,562
The police need to mind the higher-ups.

298
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:11,910
We've decided to take
a break for a few months.

299
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,415
So, for the time being,

300
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,242
focus on managing the bars.

301
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,459
It was you, wasn't it?

302
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,482
The one behind the report.

303
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,362
I get what's going on here.

304
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:30,922
The spy you planted.

305
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,537
Are you insane?

306
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,600
You knew that Yang-ho
betrayed me, didn't you?

307
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:40,362
In return for turning a blind eye,

308
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,267
you were to take more shares
of the gambling business.

309
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:48,202
This is why I adore you.

310
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,122
There isn't anyone like you in this field.

311
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,882
But unfortunately,

312
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,122
you've become so arrogant...

313
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,400
...that you don't even listen
to your superior anymore.

314
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,002
Thanks for your hard work thus far.

315
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:05,042
You can take a break now.

316
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,840
Do you have a replacement?

317
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,642
I'll figure it out on my own.

318
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,962
So you should find a way to survive.

319
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:20,808
Otherwise,

320
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:25,571
you can live quietly and
take rake-offs under me.

321
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,200
Is that all you have to say?

322
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:46,992
I'm leaving.

323
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,402
Are you all right?

324
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:34,632
What about you?

325
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,815
Why do you think they let us go?

326
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,177
Do you really think Seo
Do-young doesn't know...

327
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,282
...that we reported him?

328
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,042
It went by smoothly.

329
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,223
It'll be okay.

330
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,551
That woman keeps
appearing in my dreams.

331
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:09,080
The exact same way she looked that day.

332
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:11,863
I'm scared, Dong-soo.

333
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,309
That we might end up like her too.

334
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:18,909
Did you hear about Jung Hye-young?

335
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,564
About what?

336
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,364
She hit on the store manager...

337
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:23,760
...so she could extort money from him.

338
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,440
She didn't get assaulted by him?

339
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,389
Come on. You believe that?

340
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,316
Why would she go to
his place in the first place?

341
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,989
She clearly knew he lived there alone.

342
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,195
- That's true.
- You never know...

343
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,069
...how they are from the outside.

344
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:36,349
Honey!

345
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,364
Come here.

346
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,571
You got rid of the cast.

347
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:02,680
Yes.

348
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,340
But you got hurt.

349
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:08,428
Oh, this?

350
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:12,724
I was at the house with Beom-jae.

351
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:14,335
We were trying to fix something.

352
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,669
You should've been careful.

353
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:20,492
Were you holding back until now...

354
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:22,476
...while hearing that stuff?

355
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:25,669
They love talking about others.

356
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:28,579
They're everywhere.

357
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,140
Let's sue them.

358
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:35,508
If we don't do anything now,

359
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:37,360
it just means we're admitting it.

360
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,980
You could turn out to be an assailant.

361
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,549
We should first...

362
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:47,015
What is this?

363
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,124
The store manager...

364
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:53,149
SUMMONS

365
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:54,720
He didn't resign.

366
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,275
He took sick leave for a month.

367
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:01,564
So I submitted the report...

368
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,069
...that was supposedly canceled.

369
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:05,532
And then...

370
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,299
SUMMONS

371
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,939
What do you think?

372
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,890
What Han Dong-soo said.

373
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,349
I'm not so sure.

374
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,749
It does make sense, but our situation...

375
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,980
What if we don't consider our situation?

376
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:49,069
It doesn't sound like a bad item,

377
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,480
but its plan seems to be a problem.

378
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,940
Do you think Han Dong-soo can do it?

379
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:56,869
It seems like he was competent...

380
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,374
...when he was a law office manager.

381
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,309
He was the youngest senior
manager of Moon Law Firm.

382
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,749
He was supposedly better than any lawyer.

383
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,640
He had a good reputation among clients...

384
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:08,949
...for his meticulous way of handling work.

385
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:14,789
Whatever you see, you will find...

386
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:16,749
...the man you are looking for.

387
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,229
It seems he's more
competitive than he seems.

388
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:22,749
Considering his win rate, he's not so bad.

389
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:24,669
If I were you, I'd never do that.

390
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:26,709
Accomplices.

391
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:27,917
I'd...

392
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:30,140
...make accomplices.

393
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:31,309
On top of everything else,

394
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,004
he makes sure to keep his promise.

395
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:37,549
But I don't get it.

396
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,549
Why does he go to see inmates in prison?

397
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:53,608
It's Attorney Han's disciplinary report.

398
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,028
I didn't know about this before,

399
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,451
but something bothers me.

400
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:59,509
It began with one of his clients...

401
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,989
...filing a complaint
to the bar association.

402
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,469
For the case I've accepted,

403
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,069
I've diligently spoken for my client.

404
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,324
I only asked for reimbursement
for the individual debt...

405
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:11,629
...that occurred during the process.

406
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:14,508
How does this behavior harm...

407
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,709
...the dignity and honor of lawyers?

408
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:18,629
<i>It was a client who</i>
<i>lacked settlement money.</i>

409
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,044
He borrowed some from Attorney Han,

410
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:21,029
and he got out on probation.

411
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:22,949
But the problem is,

412
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,069
the client didn't pay him back and ran.

413
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,852
Attorney Han found him
and got the money back,

414
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:32,069
but he got a disciplinary
measure for such an act.

415
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,469
For failing to maintain
the dignity of attorneys.

416
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,229
He must've felt so wrongly accused.

417
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:39,294
It hadn't been long since
he opened his law office.

418
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,720
So he must've suffered greatly.

419
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,520
What about the disciplinary
committee from then?

420
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,229
MOON SANG-GUK,
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

421
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,117
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE,
MOON SANG-GUK

422
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,764
<i>The senior partner of Moon Law firm,</i>
<i>Chairman Moon.</i>

423
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,460
So he got duped by Moon Law Firm twice?

424
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,660
Sir. Do you think Han Dong-soo would do it?

425
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,365
From what I see,

426
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:06,957
I don't think he'd budge no matter
how much we give him.

427
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,524
But we just found it.

428
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,083
His revengeful spirit.

429
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,320
Let's provoke it.

430
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:28,720
His pride must've been hurt a lot.

431
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,749
SUMMONS

432
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Open it. Open the door.

433
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,829
What a fool.

434
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:13,229
Hey, wait...

435
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:16,909
Oh, gosh.

436
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:33,309
Hey!

437
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,189
I...

438
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,694
I told you I'd bring you down.

439
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,109
What? Defamation?

440
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,484
I thought it was unfair no matter
how hard I thought.

441
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,429
Did I touch her or what?

442
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:49,524
If anyone were to be punished with that,

443
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,989
no guy in this country would be innocent.

444
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:53,195
Okay, fine!

445
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:56,444
If she quits working at the supermarket,

446
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:57,509
I'll drop the charges.

447
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,454
You're not even sure if you'd win anyway.

448
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,614
You!

449
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:01,909
You're famous among the attorneys.

450
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,804
The law office manager turned attorney...

451
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:05,749
...who was reprimanded.
I heard you go to prison often.

452
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:07,789
Why are you so strong?

453
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,629
"Yes, I'm an attorney."
You take solace in that...

454
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,149
...and force your way through life.

455
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:13,861
What if you crumble in front of your wife?

456
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,069
Do you think you can bear that, you jerk?

457
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,470
What are you doing?

458
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:20,869
Don't! No!

459
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:27,389
What is this?

460
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:28,509
What are you doing?

461
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:29,589
Sir!

462
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:31,069
Call the police!

463
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:32,549
Hurry!

464
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:24,175
<i>I'm going to see a client in Yeongcheon.</i>

465
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,244
<i>Don't worry about me and go to bed first.</i>

466
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,509
SENDING MESSAGE TO HYE-YOUNG

467
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,040
Dong-soo.

468
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,469
- Dong-soo.
- Yes.

469
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,238
Yes.

470
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:47,149
Seon-kyo. What brings you here?

471
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,040
Hi.

472
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:56,829
Hey.

473
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:58,549
It's Attorney Moon,

474
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,109
Mr. Seo Chun-ki's representative.

475
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:06,949
Ta-da.

476
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,549
A restraining order.

477
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,611
Don't ever hang around Mr. Seo.

478
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:12,243
You're not allowed to call or text him.

479
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,626
So talk to me if you have
anything to say to him.

480
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,131
He's seeing a psychiatrist...

481
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,389
...because he developed a trauma.

482
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:17,509
SHINNAM PATROL STATION

483
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,852
You don't do stuff that doesn't make money.

484
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,875
I'm a lawyer.

485
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,789
The sense of duty as a lawyer.

486
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:25,534
You're not the only one who feels that.

487
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:29,349
I mean, it's not like I'm
not totally uninterested.

488
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,844
Hey, wait.

489
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,909
- Wait. Dong-soo.
- My goodness.

490
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,164
He must've lost his touch...

491
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,629
...after leaving this
field for a few years.

492
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:38,909
Are you confused about your identity?

493
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,869
If you're a lawyer or a thug?

494
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,229
You'd better be ready for defense.

495
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:47,189
It's going to be a difficult fight.

496
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,293
This is my last trial
before I run for office.

497
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:53,749
I'm going to have a
great start with a victory.

498
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:55,829
I'm here to report sexual assault.

499
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,549
Where am I supposed to go?

500
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,229
Honey.

501
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:05,084
Ma'am. If you've been sued for defamation,

502
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,789
you should lay low.

503
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,164
You don't have concrete evidence on that.

504
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,589
If you have anything to say,

505
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,549
say it in court.

506
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,269
You're supposed to run for office,

507
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:14,724
but how can you look down on someone...

508
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:16,099
...who claims she's
been sexually assaulted?

509
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:16,884
Ma'am.

510
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:18,589
Do you want to see how your campaign...

511
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:21,044
...will turn out if this goes
viral among married women?

512
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,509
- How can you say such...
- Sir.

513
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:23,469
- Wait.
- No, don't.

514
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:25,044
I'm an attorney too!
I can speak for myself!

515
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:27,317
- People are watching.
- I can defend myself.

516
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,164
It's nothing.

517
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,509
I'm Moon Hae-jun.

518
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,294
Let's shake hands.

519
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,549
Here you go.

520
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:35,174
Yes. Thank you.

521
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,182
The trial won't be easy.

522
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:57,020
I know.

523
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,309
We could lose.

524
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:09,149
Still, let's give it a try.

525
00:34:09,661 --> 00:34:11,701
I don't want to give up just like this.

526
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,549
Even more, now that it's Moon Law Firm.

527
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,376
Let's go.

528
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,229
I have to go back to the supermarket.

529
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:32,580
I'm sorry.

530
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:36,309
Just give it your best try.

531
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:38,269
Use any means necessary.

532
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,749
Just like what Moon Law Firm did to us.

533
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,349
Where to?

534
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:58,509
Shinnam Complex Two.

535
00:34:58,589 --> 00:34:59,480
Okay.

536
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:23,549
Please help me, sir.

537
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,563
My mom collapsed.

538
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:30,349
I still haven't paid
back the loan I took...

539
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:31,534
...when I opened my office.

540
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:34,079
You're putting me in a difficult situation.

541
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:35,429
The disciplinary act.

542
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:37,444
I'm not the only one who decided on that.

543
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,829
I worked for you for seven years.

544
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,109
I gave up on my weekends and holidays...

545
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:43,829
...and did everything you told me.

546
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:46,749
I worked really hard
with Hae-jun's studies.

547
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,309
File an administrative litigation.

548
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:50,869
There's quite a few people
who relief through that.

549
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,709
You're on that again.

550
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,949
"Follow the law. It'll protect us all."

551
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:56,160
But...

552
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:59,069
...how am I supposed to fight...

553
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:03,309
...against a huge law firm?

554
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,949
If it puts you at ease...

555
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,869
...if you blame me for everything,
then go ahead,

556
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:10,949
although nothing will change.

557
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,629
Is this about Ms. Park Ji-eun?

558
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,069
Suicide?

559
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,068
It wasn't suicide.

560
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:25,989
She had no intention of committing suicide.

561
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:30,469
Help me.

562
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:33,382
Help me, Mr. Han.

563
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:40,324
Sir. Don't you feel bad for Ms. Park?

564
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,517
Why must I?

565
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:46,589
She stole five billion
won from our company...

566
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:48,589
...when she's merely a high
school graduate accountant.

567
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,534
She must've felt ecstatic at first.

568
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,309
But she must've gotten scared gradually.

569
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,509
She must've realized it
wasn't the type of size...

570
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,149
...she could handle.

571
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,909
When she realized she
had nowhere else to hide,

572
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:01,789
what do you think she chose to do?

573
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,400
What do you think?

574
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,629
That money wasn't from the company.

575
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:08,709
It was illegal political funds.

576
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:11,335
And you used Ms. Park as a carrier.

577
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:12,869
Who...

578
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:15,069
...would believe your story?

579
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,069
The truth doesn't matter.

580
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:20,469
What matters is power.

581
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,829
The CEO of a prestigious law firm...

582
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,164
...versus a law office
manager turned lawyer...

583
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:26,269
...who was reprimanded.

584
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:31,349
Who would the public trust more?

585
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,029
Darn it!

586
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,229
What was that?

587
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,229
Hey, I was just playing around.

588
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,549
Gosh, you're so sensitive.

589
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,349
What's up with your face?

590
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,189
I fell after drinking.

591
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,269
Gosh, that's because you drank without me.

592
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,040
How nice.

593
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:26,229
Aren't you going to work?

594
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,709
If only there's somewhere I can be.

595
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:30,789
The store closed.

596
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,174
Because the boss ran.

597
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,996
Doesn't anyone know where he went?

598
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:40,236
If we knew,

599
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,229
the Yuseong Gang
would've caught him already.

600
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:44,229
What do you mean?

601
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,709
You know, Park Je-yi.

602
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,709
She was the Yuseong Gang's boss' lover.

603
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:52,309
But she cheated with his underling.

604
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,909
So she just ran.

605
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:55,429
She was afraid she'd die.

606
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,229
Gosh, seriously...

607
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:18,709
Hey, Seon-kyo.

608
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,749
Hey.

609
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,029
Are you all right?

610
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,700
Hey.

611
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:32,109
Should I talk to them?

612
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,268
About what?

613
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:37,031
A settlement.

614
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:40,542
I know you're wrongfully accused.

615
00:39:40,884 --> 00:39:42,004
But it won't be easy.

616
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,189
Even if it turns out in your favor,

617
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,429
they'd just think he's
your average pervert.

618
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,949
You know how judges are.

619
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:50,069
And you're up against Moon Law Firm.

620
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,067
Look away just this once.

621
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,460
Just this once, please.

622
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:03,269
This once?

623
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:09,412
I've endured long enough.

624
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:14,667
When is it going to end?

625
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,356
Why just me?

626
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:21,268
Why should I endure it alone?

627
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:25,404
Right. I know.

628
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:32,988
It's all because of that Park Ji-eun girl.

629
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:34,524
If it weren't for her, you'd probably be...

630
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:36,349
...a lawyer at Moon Law
Firm by now, you know?

631
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,349
Honestly, Mr. Moon...

632
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:40,909
...liked you.

633
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,444
You shouldn't have gotten involved...

634
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:43,829
...just because you wanted to help.

635
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:49,029
Darn it.

636
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,989
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:53,507
I didn't mean to...

638
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:17,404
<i>This is my last trial...</i>

639
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:18,869
<i>...before I run for office.</i>

640
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,349
<i>I'm going to have a great start...</i>

641
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,589
<i>...with a victory.</i>

642
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:26,068
<i>Just give it your best try.</i>

643
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:27,989
<i>Use any means necessary.</i>

644
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:31,731
<i>Just like what Moon Law Firm did to us.</i>

645
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:00,989
TRIAL

646
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:08,829
MOON LAW FIRM

647
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,260
Are you going home?

648
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,149
I need to be in good condition.

649
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:16,200
We already know what's going to happen.

650
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:18,940
I will see you at the court tomorrow.

651
00:42:22,051 --> 00:42:23,051
See you tomorrow.

652
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:32,749
Min-hee. Han Min-hee.

653
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:34,869
Daddy.

654
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:39,669
I've missed you so much, my baby.

655
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:42,229
Let's go. I'll buy you
the sushi that you like.

656
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,349
Let's get takeout and have it at Uncle's.

657
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,429
We can share it with Uncle and Auntie.

658
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,260
Let's just have it ourselves.
It's expensive.

659
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,389
Uncle Dong-soo has been
looking really down lately.

660
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:53,709
He doesn't smile much.

661
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,284
All right, then. I'll be generous.

662
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,469
I should listen to my daughter.

663
00:42:57,989 --> 00:42:58,800
Let's go.

664
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,469
I will carry it.

665
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,949
Isn't your bag heavy?

666
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:03,854
Okay.

667
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,493
BEOM-JAE

668
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,500
Hey.

669
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:46,200
<i>We're getting sushi.</i>
<i>What should I get?</i>

670
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:47,749
Anything, right?

671
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,980
Yes.

672
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,589
- One more assorted sushi, please.
- Okay.

673
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,629
- One more assorted sushi.
- Okay.

674
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,229
How are preparations
for the trial coming along?

675
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,389
It's going well.

676
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,533
<i>All right, then.</i>

677
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,235
Already?

678
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,240
You're here so quickly...

679
00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:12,109
What...

680
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:23,069
What brings you here?

681
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,060
I'll help you win.

682
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:36,829
The trial tomorrow.

683
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:41,000
What?

684
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,109
You got stepped on...

685
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:45,419
...by Moon Law Firm.

686
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:49,989
Getting stepped on a third time...

687
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:52,229
...doesn't sound right, does it?

688
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:55,189
Well...

689
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:00,629
How do you know all this?

690
00:46:02,397 --> 00:46:03,957
He seems like a simple guy.

691
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:06,388
Scratch the surface, and he breaks.

692
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:15,509
Darn it.

693
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:17,629
That scumbag.

694
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:20,869
If the opponent is weak, he stomps on him.

695
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,069
If the opponent is strong, he shuts up.

696
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:28,269
What are you talking about?

697
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:31,309
Where did he go? There he is.

698
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:33,509
I got you, you little rat.

699
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,389
I am Moon Hae-jun, you punk.

700
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:42,989
Hey! Darn it.

701
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,229
Gosh. That scumbag.

702
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:50,229
Gosh.

703
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:55,429
My gosh, you startled me there.

704
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:00,349
Gosh.

705
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:05,949
Let's fight, scumbag!

706
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:11,229
Take this!

707
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:18,989
Moon Hae-jun won't
even make it to the trial.

708
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,140
It serves you right!

709
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:29,549
He will drive recklessly out of anger...

710
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,377
...and seek revenge,
then end up in an accident.

711
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:41,989
What does that...

712
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,909
That's impossible.

713
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:46,389
No.

714
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:48,629
Too bad.

715
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:52,163
The damage is already done.

716
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,349
That sustainable business.

717
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:18,949
Let's do it.

718
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:23,829
I will give you 300 million won.

719
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:26,549
Opening the website and one
month of after-sales service.

720
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:28,880
What do you say?

721
00:48:34,836 --> 00:48:36,636
But...

722
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:40,029
...I think you should go.

723
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:42,964
My family should be here any moment.

724
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:46,829
Aren't you tired of it?

725
00:48:46,987 --> 00:48:48,187
Losing every day?

726
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,669
Don't you want to win for once?

727
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:56,719
Don't you want to stomp on
someone without restraint?

728
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:05,909
I don't...

729
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:08,789
...want to win like that.

730
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:14,892
It's become a habit.

731
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:17,925
Losing is a habit too.

732
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:21,989
The feeling of humiliation you've endured.

733
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,429
And the sense of inferiority
rooted deep in your heart.

734
00:49:28,116 --> 00:49:29,876
I'll those take away at once.

735
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,260
Moon Hae-jun.

736
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:38,852
What will you do about him?

737
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,629
You decide, Attorney Han.

738
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,371
Whether you should release him...

739
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:48,549
...before the trial or after.

740
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:55,349
Choose whether to fight fairly and lose,

741
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:58,567
or fight without restraint and win.

742
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:02,189
You make the call.

743
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:19,180
Call me.

744
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:52,800
Let's eat sushi.

745
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:02,240
Dad.

746
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,400
Yes? Right.

747
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:23,684
Aren't you tired of it?
Losing every day?

748
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,160
Don't you want to win for once?

749
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:31,149
Don't you want to stomp on
someone without restraint?

750
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:06,269
Unit 504.

751
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:15,469
COURT

752
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,760
FIRST FLOOR, CAFE

753
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:49,476
<i>Release Moon Hae-jun.</i>

754
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,989
<i>I have to do it my way in court...</i>

755
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:53,924
<i>...and make sure...</i>

756
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,149
<i>- ...to win...</i>
- Who are they?

757
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,989
Moon Law Firm's associates.

758
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,949
They came to watch Hae-jun's trial.

759
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,749
He must be very confident.

760
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,589
Judge Lee Jae-yoon is presiding.

761
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,229
He's got a temper,

762
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,709
but he doesn't make
judgments based on name value.

763
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:13,069
Still, he brought a bunch
of associates with him.

764
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:15,982
He must be pretty confident.

765
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:18,143
It means it's going
to be an easy victory...

766
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,869
...as long as he doesn't annoy the judge.

767
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,429
Why is a guy who's running for election...

768
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:24,368
...even participating in
a trial? He must be busy.

769
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:27,109
Well, he's fighting against Han Dong-soo.

770
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,997
Is that right?

771
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:31,869
He wants to show it very clearly.

772
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:34,989
This is what happens if you
mess with Moon Law Firm.

773
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:57,120
Honey.

774
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,922
Let's go in.

775
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:07,669
Wait.

776
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:21,581
It will be all right.

777
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,669
I believe in you.

778
00:54:34,892 --> 00:54:36,132
You go in first.

779
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:37,869
I need to make a phone call.

780
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:14,509
Make sure Moon Hae-jun is detained.

781
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:17,789
Let's finish this...

782
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,389
...not just for this trial, but also...

783
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:25,219
...to ensure he can't run
in the general election.

784
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,549
COURT

785
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:48,309
Hold on. I'm calling him now.

786
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:50,229
I am calling.

787
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:52,349
He's not answering.

788
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:05,564
I apologize.
Attorney Moon has been tied up...

789
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:07,429
...in personal matters,
so I'll be taking his place.

790
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:09,749
Very well, proceed.

791
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:12,796
PLAINTIFF

792
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:16,164
DEFENDANT

793
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:43,349
Gosh.

794
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:49,909
Who...

795
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:51,829
Who are you?

796
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:54,149
Who are you?

797
00:56:57,629 --> 00:56:59,589
- Where's the girl?
- What?

798
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,229
What...

799
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:13,044
<i>The defendant reported the plaintiff's...</i>

800
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:15,229
...sexual harassment
allegations to the company...

801
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:18,702
...in accordance with internal regulations.

802
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:22,709
During this process,
some colleagues became aware,

803
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,500
but it was not the defendant's intention...

804
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:27,549
...to directly defame the plaintiff.

805
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:29,404
The defendant's statements...

806
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:30,629
...about the sexual
harassment allegations...

807
00:57:30,804 --> 00:57:33,124
...were relatively specific and consistent.

808
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:34,974
Therefore, this court dismisses...

809
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:39,149
...the plaintiff's claim for defamation.

810
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,362
PLAINTIFF

811
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,679
I need to call the supermarket.

812
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:16,029
Hold on.

813
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,149
Hello?

814
00:58:25,396 --> 00:58:29,316
FAIR AND TRUSTED, SHINNAM COURT

815
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:32,229
Attorney Han.

816
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:39,637
It's a nice day.
Let's go for some sashimi.

817
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:37,109
EVILIVE

818
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:39,189
<i>Aren't we in this together?</i>

819
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:40,164
<i>Business partners.</i>

820
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,284
<i>He was trying to kill us.</i>

821
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:42,669
<i>How can you do business with him?</i>

822
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,349
<i>This is going to be fine, right?</i>

823
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:46,229
<i>I'm going to dip my</i>
<i>toe slightly and get out.</i>

824
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:47,229
<i>Very slightly.</i>

825
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:48,949
<i>A billion won is our goal.</i>

826
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:51,829
<i>What if this business fails?</i>

827
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:53,229
<i>I guess we will both die.</i>

828
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:55,149
<i>Once I get the money,</i>
<i>I will leave this town.</i>

829
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:57,149
<i>The momentum will shift starting today.</i>

830
00:59:57,229 --> 00:59:58,469
<i>Trust me.</i>

831
00:59:58,549 --> 01:00:00,269
<i>Are you confident about this, Dong-soo?</i>

832
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:03,349
<i>We're betting our lives on this.</i>
