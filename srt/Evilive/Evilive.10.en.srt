00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,299
THIS DRAMA IS FOR AGES 18 AND UP

2
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,101
EVILIVE

3
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,141
PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY...

4
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,101
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, AND TOURISM

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,061
ALL FIGURES, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

6
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:34,061
INCIDENTS, GROUPS,
OCCUPATIONS, AND OTHERS...

7
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,085
IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,876
Don't worry.

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,316
They need to release you...

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,480
if they can't issue an arrest
warrant within 48 hours.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,280
They neither have hard
evidence nor justification.

12
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,960
Were you aware that Moon Sang-guk was dead?

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,800
I met Seo Do-young earlier today.

14
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,560
He told me to ask you who killed him.

15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,360
Why ask me?

16
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,160
How am I supposed to know?

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,560
Do you believe what that jerk says?

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,840
Be honest with me.

19
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,000
You didn't do it, did you?

20
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,760
Leave. You don't have to bail me out.

21
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,880
I'll say I killed Moon Sang-guk.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,200
What?

23
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:26,366
It has to be me or you.

24
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,935
That's what Seo Do-young is after.

25
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,316
Don't get any silly ideas.

26
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,760
Remain silence.

27
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,440
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

28
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,996
I'll get you out somehow.

29
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,000
All this happened because of me.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,196
If only I hadn't gotten
you that visitation offer,

31
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,640
we wouldn't have come this far.

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,440
So, don't ever turn yourself in.

33
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,236
The marine casino,
scheduled to open in 2011,

34
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,276
will be equipped with 450 slot machines,

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,316
370 game tables,

36
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,400
and more than 50 VIP rooms.

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,196
And this man is taking the lead...

38
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,320
...of bringing the business in.

39
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,276
Let me introduce you...

40
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,320
...to President Seo
Do-young of Shinnam Ferry.

41
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,620
SHINNAM FERRY

42
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,760
Please don't block the
entrance. Move a little.

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,800
We need to do our jobs.

44
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,356
We're doing our jobs too.

45
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,800
- How many hours has it been?
- Goodness.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,840
- Please move.
- Come on.

47
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,551
<i>So why did you do that?</i>

48
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>You should've just done what I told you to.</i>

49
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,760
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

50
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,680
Han Beom-jae was sent
to a holding cell just now.

51
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,040
His arrest will probably
be decided in two days.

52
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,516
What about Han Dong-soo?

53
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,120
He's not making any particular moves.

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
Will he turn himself in?

55
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,680
If he holds out until the end...

56
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,840
Today's an important day.

57
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,360
What happened to your brother?

58
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,560
Something went wrong, right?

59
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,520
Honey.

60
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,600
Let's talk tomorrow.

61
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,094
I'm exhausted.

62
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,436
Why aren't you telling me anything?

63
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,280
What if Min-hee finds out?

64
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't tell me...

65
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,160
...you're involved in this case too.

66
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,600
Stay at your sister's
house for the time being.

67
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,320
Things will die down after a few days.

68
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,302
I'll come and get you then.

69
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,320
Let's wait inside the car.

70
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm off.

71
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,560
We need to talk.

72
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:12,894
Can you help me?

73
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,160
Well,

74
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,240
I'm not sure.

75
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,840
Moon Sang-guk's dead body was found...

76
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,120
...in the yard of Han Beom-jae's house.

77
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,640
My brother didn't do it.

78
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,600
It was all Seo Do-young's doing.

79
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:37,205
No one would possibly
believe that in this situation.

80
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:42,473
I also think he wouldn't do such a thing.

81
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:44,957
But there's nothing I can do to help.

82
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:46,797
Park Je-yi.

83
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:50,357
Seo Do-young killed her.

84
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,637
Heo Yang-ho too.

85
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,757
We were asked to follow a woman.

86
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:59,197
So we...

87
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,353
...installed spy cameras in that house.

88
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,917
We went to retrieve one of them...

89
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,277
...and witnessed the scene.

90
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:09,873
What? Then...

91
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:11,517
We came up with...

92
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,597
Seo Do-young's alibi.

93
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,717
We took care of the bodies too.

94
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,237
I know.

95
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,997
We shouldn't have done that.

96
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,077
But...

97
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:34,757
...we had no choice then.

98
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,197
Why now?

99
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,877
You had plenty of chances to tell me.

100
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,237
I am...

101
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:49,837
...eager to get Seo Do-young,

102
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,753
but I can't believe you as is.

103
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,193
Depending on how people see it,

104
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,757
this could be seen as an
attempt to muddy the waters.

105
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,677
If you really want to turn yourself in,

106
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:07,677
come to the police station...

107
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:09,877
...and make an official report.

108
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:13,917
I killed Moon Sang-guk.

109
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,877
I was forced to do it,

110
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:27,957
but in any case,

111
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,837
I'm the one who killed him.

112
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:37,717
Seo Do-young...

113
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,757
...forced you to kill him?

114
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:42,117
I'll pay the price.

115
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,753
I'll turn myself in.

116
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,317
But before then,

117
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,717
I need to get Seo Do-young first.

118
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:53,837
Help me.

119
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:11,873
Detective Ma.

120
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:12,897
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

121
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:14,877
Detective Ma.

122
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,473
- Yes?
- Mr. Han Beom-jae...

123
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,117
...wants to see you.

124
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,378
Mr. Han.

125
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:30,342
I killed Moon Sang-guk.

126
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:39,660
Where did you do it?

127
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,746
A mountain.

128
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:51,062
You killed him in a mountain
and brought the body...

129
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,746
...to your house?

130
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,893
It must've been tough.
You don't even have a car.

131
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,053
Where did you get the weapon?

132
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,453
Home.

133
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,413
You use that kind of knife at home?

134
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:13,009
The marks on Moon Sang-guk's body say...

135
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,453
...he was killed with a sashimi
knife that gangsters use.

136
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,489
It'll be more certain...

137
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:18,733
...once the autopsy
result is out tomorrow.

138
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,689
You could be punished
for a false confession.

139
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,973
It's true. I killed him.

140
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:29,493
Are you really going to take all the blame?

141
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,369
Gosh.

142
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,929
Attorney Han confessed...

143
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,293
...that he killed Moon Sang-guk.

144

<i>Where is Heo Yang-ho's body?</i>

146
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,533
We need to secure evidence to arrest him.

147
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:56,893
It's in...

148
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,373
...Seo Do-young's house.

149
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01,573
Seo Do-young's house.

150
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,729
How did you take care
of Heo Yang-ho's body?

151
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,653
Tell me the exact location.

152
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,613
The pond in Seo Do-young's house.

153
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,373
It's sunk in there.

154
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,893
Han Beom-jae made a statement.

155
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,933
It seems he'll take the fall
on Attorney Han's behalf.

156
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,893
What about the Family Gang?

157
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,853
We found them.

158
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,453
Take care of them.

159
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,333
What about Attorney Han?

160
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,653
Get rid of him too.

161
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,733
- Hello?
<i>- This is Detective Ma.</i>

162
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,689
I don't think I can get a warrant...

163
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:24,649
...to search Seo Do-young's house.

164
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:27,213
He has no particular suspicions.

165
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,729
I bet.

166
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,089
<i>But...</i>

167
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,973
...the situation may change...

168
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,093
...if the body is confirmed to be there.

169
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:41,213
What if you catch him moving the body?

170
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,133
Excuse me?

171
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,493
I heard that Seo Do-young...

172
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:50,133
...was planning to move...

173
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:52,173
...Heo Yang-ho's body today.

174
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:56,813
Are you sure about that?

175
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:00,413
Yes, I'm sure.

176
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,453
Is there perhaps...

177
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,013
...a way to get inside?

178
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,649
There's a way...

179
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,213
...to deactivate the cameras
and security system.

00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,533
Pull out.

186
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,273
DO-YOUNG

187
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,673
OH-JAE

188
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:15,513
DO-YOUNG

189
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,053
Hey.

190
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,893
This is why you should
choose your strings wisely.

191
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:29,573
Or else, you can't last long, you idiot.

192
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:37,769
Give me the knife.

193
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:38,873
DO-YOUNG

194
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:54,253
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

195
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,293
Drop the knife.

196
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:52,453
Drop the knife!

197
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:13,813
Seo Do-young, you're
under arrest for murder.

198
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,533
You have the right to remain silent,

199
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,173
and you have the right to an attorney.

200
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:29,849
This is Lieutenant Ma Chul-jin...

201
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:31,293
...of Violent Crimes Team
One, Shinnam Police.

202
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:32,809
It's a murder case,

203
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,249
and the suspect is Seo Do-young.

204
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:35,613
As for victims,

205
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:39,013
There are just too many.

206
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,903
I sent the location,

207
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,867
so please hurry and send more dispatchers.

208
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,093
You scumbag.

209
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:51,893
You're caught red-handed.

210
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,853
Heo Yang-ho's body in the pond...

211
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:59,653
...will be the evidence
for additional crimes.

212
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,009
<i>About Heo Yang-ho's body.</i>

213
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,569
<i>You already moved it, didn't you?</i>

214
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,409
Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,289
Why do I have to tell you that?

216
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:11,813
I need to know.

217
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:15,573
That way, if there's
an issue, I can act on it.

218
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,333
Did Han Dong-soo tell you?

219
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,933
That Heo Yang-ho's body is here?

220
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:26,733
Then go ahead and dig.

221
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:30,680
What are you playing at?

222
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:35,933
You were fooled by Han Dong-soo.

223
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,253
What?

224
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,213
Darn!

225
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:17,093
Who are you?

226
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,133
Why did you kill a cop?

227
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:22,533
Please spare me.

228
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:26,213
Who put you up to this?

229
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:28,533
I don't know.

230
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,453
I just did what I was told.

231
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,493
I was told to kill the cop.

232
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,060
That's all I needed to do.

233
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,373
CALLER, BAE JONG-HA

234
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:54,213
<i>This is Bae Jong-ha.</i>

235
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:57,213
We're nearly done with
the Yuseong Gang guys.

236
00:25:57,953 --> 00:25:59,373
What about the cop?

237
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:03,213
I put a smart one up
to it, so don't you worry.

238
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:08,733
There's a way?

239
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,733
To kill Seo Do-young.

240
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:14,169
You'll have to figure it out.

241
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,773
I'll get myself ready in
case that doesn't work.

242
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,573
We'll have a cop involved.

243
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,693
It'd be best to kill Seo Do-young,

244
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,653
but if it doesn't work out,

245
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,729
we'll have to kill a cop.

246
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,213
Let's...

247
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:32,520
...make it look like Seo
Do-young killed a cop.

248
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:43,173
Han Dong-soo, that jerk.

249
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:46,562
POLICE

250
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,133
Hey, Chief Kim.

251
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,453
Choong-ho.

252
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:50,969
We're in trouble.

253
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:54,049
A bunch of people died
at Seo Do-young's place.

254
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,849
<i>A murder of a cop was reported too.</i>

255
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,329
<i>The cop reported it himself.</i>

256
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,769
The emergency response
team was dispatched too.

257
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,049
Forget about being a chief.

258
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:05,133
I can't do anything about it.

259
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,893
Let's ditch Seo Do-young.

260
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,173
As you know,

261
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:15,053
he's someone difficult to deal with.

262
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,173
You can't reason with him either.

263
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:21,053
Well, that's true.

264
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,453
But isn't it too much to ditch him?

265
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:28,653
He's at his peak.

266
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:34,013
Things will change from today onwards.

267
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:40,413
Assemblyman Park, you
just need to make a choice.

268
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,373
Between Seo Do-young and me.

269
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,853
You need to choose one of us.

270
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:49,773
<i>What do we do, Choong-ho?</i>

271
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:52,213
<i>Should we capture Seo Do-young or not?</i>

272
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,049
Just leave it.

273
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:56,293
Let's see how things go first.

274
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,369
But what if Seo Do-young gets caught?

275
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,649
What about the marine resort and casino?

276
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,649
We invested so much into it.

277
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:04,969
Even if Seo Do-young is still alive,

278
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:07,613
he won't be able to make it back. Then...

279
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,889
...we'll need a replacement.

280
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:12,013
Someone good.

281
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:17,329
A young star who grew up poor in Shinnam.

282
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:19,169
Now, he has a story...

283
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:23,853
...of fighting against Moon
Law Firm and gangsters.

284
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:28,773
Attorney Han?

285
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,933
Han Dong-soo?

286
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:43,169
There's no more evidence, right?

287
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,249
That's right.

288
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:47,209
I erased all data related to you,

289
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:50,253
and I left the site reopenable.

290
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,173
You should rest for a couple of days.

291
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:59,162
You'll be busy from now on...

292
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:00,726
...if you're to manage it.

293
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,413
I'm in your service.

294
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:39,673
POLICE

295
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:43,413
You're here.

296
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,813
What happened to Seo Do-young?

297
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,933
We haven't found him yet.

298
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,554
But he bled a lot,

299
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,318
so he wouldn't be
able to hold out for long.

300
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:57,609
Hello.

301
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:59,929
Hello. What would you like?

302
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:01,773
Squid fritters, please.

303
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:06,613
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

304
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:08,249
Let's watch a cartoon.

305
00:33:08,273 --> 00:33:09,969
<i>From what looks like a turf war,</i>

306
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:12,809
<i>including the police</i>
<i>officer who was on duty,</i>

307
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,529
<i>a total of eight people died.</i>

308
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:16,569
<i>- Mr. Seo,</i>
- Wait.

309
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,529
<i>who took over Shinnam</i>
<i>Ferry last month.</i>

310
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,569
<i>He also led the marine casino project,</i>

311
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,173
<i>which is to be open three years later.</i>

312
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:23,249
Mr. Seo, who used
to be in a violent gang,

313
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:24,209
<i>was involved in a gambling house,</i>

314
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,449
<i>as well as the money exchange business...</i>

315
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:27,809
<i>- for Game of Cards.</i>
- It's Uncle.

316
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,293
"Uncle?"

317
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,733
Yes, Uncle Dong-soo's friend.

318
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:47,733
Mr. Han Beom-jae.

319
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:02,013
Could I...

320
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:05,333
...talk to Detective Ma?

321
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,493
We'll barge into Seo
Do-young's place tonight.

322
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:32,733
Attorney Han will be helping from outside.

323
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,569
As soon as we find Heo Yang-ho's body,

324
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:39,253
we can arrest Seo Do-young right away.

325
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,333
Then what will happen to my brother?

326
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:50,093
Once we arrest Seo Do-young,

327
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:51,853
he'll turn himself in.

328
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:55,413
It'll be hard to avoid getting punished,

329
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,853
but I'll do my best to have it extenuated.

330
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:03,053
What happened?

331
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:14,993
SHINNAM POLICE WILL
STAND WITH THE PEOPLE...

332
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,513
...FOR A FAIR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

333
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:35,573
You went through a lot.

334
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:39,773
You must be hungry.

335
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:41,453
What do you want to eat?

336
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,293
Why did you tell him to go there?

337
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,573
What?

338
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,653
Why did you send that cop to that place?

339
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:53,253
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

340
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:56,849
What are you talking about out of the blue?

341
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:58,693
I heard it all!

342
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:02,129
How could you do that?

343
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:03,649
He tried to help us.

344
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,253
But you killed...

345
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:12,173
I hope we'll never see each other again.

346
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,013
It was all for you.

347
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,133
What?

348
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:22,889
Was I supposed to sit back...

349
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,173
...and watch you get imprisoned?

350
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:26,689
I had to get rid of Seo
Do-young to save you.

351
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:28,049
What was I supposed to do?

352
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,289
Then must I thank you?

353
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,253
When a man died because of me?

354
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:34,173
Don't use me as an
excuse. It was all for you.

355
00:36:34,353 --> 00:36:35,813
Tell me honestly.

356
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:37,973
You weren't going to turn yourself in
from the start, right?

357
00:36:48,313 --> 00:36:51,209
I thought it was Seo
Do-young that changed you.

358
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,493
But...

359
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:55,973
...I don't think it was.

360
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:12,753
SHINNAM POLICE STATION

361
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:32,573
Great work.

362
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:36,533
Attorney Han had something to say.

363
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,213
Thank you for helping my brother out.

364
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:51,809
Of course.

365
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,973
How could we arrest someone
who didn't do anything?

366
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,049
By the way, why on earth...

367
00:37:58,073 --> 00:37:59,893
did Seo Do-young do that?

368
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,253
He got to learn about it
while working with Seo.

369
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:04,969
That it was Seo...

370
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,893
...who killed both Park
Je-yi and Heo Yang-ho.

371
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,689
But Attorney Han...

372
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:13,049
...said he couldn't work
with Seo anymore...

373
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:14,209
...because he felt guilty...

374
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,893
...and he did something so hideous.

375
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,333
Don't worry.

376
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:23,853
We should put him behind bars.

377
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:28,129
By the way, based on the report...

378
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,693
...on his stab and gunshot wounds,

379
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:32,253
there are trails that I don't understand.

380
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,209
Once we get the results from the NFS,

381
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:37,249
we'll reinvestigate and wrap it up well.

382
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,893
He even killed a cop.

383
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:43,849
Shouldn't you wrap up
Moon Sang-guk's case too?

384
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:45,169
It's obvious what happened...

385
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,653
...based on what Seo Do-young did.

386
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:49,409
You're right.

387
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:52,013
Moon Sang-guk was
the biggest obstacle...

388
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:53,769
...for Seo Do-young
when he was trying...

389
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:55,253
...to take over Shinnam Ferry.

390
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:57,373
The marine casino as well.

391
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,733
When did you come?

392
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:37,369
You should've called.

393
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:38,933
I would've come and gotten you.

394
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:41,853
Where's Min-hee?

395
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,293
She's at Beom-jae's.

396
00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:49,413
He's emigrating, and he's taking Min-hee.

397
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:56,253
Tell me what all of this is about.

398
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:01,053
I want to hear it from you.

399
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:05,133
I don't know what Beom-jae might have said,

400
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,133
but don't believe everything.

401
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,809
That's why I'm asking you to tell me.

402
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,449
What's the connection between you...

403
00:40:12,473 --> 00:40:13,889
...and the man who killed Jae-yeong's dad?

404
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,973
What did you do with him to earn money...

405
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:19,293
...and even to open a law firm?

406
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:21,573
Let's talk about it later.

407
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,853
While Beom-jae gets ready,

408
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,129
I'll take care of Min-hee.

409
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:35,533
What are you doing?

410
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,813
Why are you doing this?

411
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:46,013
It's all over now. Okay?

412
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:49,580
You won't tell me anything again.

413
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,280
I need time to think.

414
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,333
It's the money I made in a week.

415
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,893
The warehouse is...

416
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:21,933
...packed with money like this.

417
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:26,813
We can move to a better place now,

418
00:41:27,593 --> 00:41:29,373
buy whatever we want,

419
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:31,373
eat whatever we want,

420
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,453
and do everything we couldn't do before.

421
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:38,213
We can be...

422
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,093
...happy now.

423
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,573
Happy how?

424
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,689
Be happy with the money earned...

425
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,493
...by joining hands with
criminals and deceiving people?

426
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,573
Did you start the law firm...

427
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:55,373
...with money earned like that?

428
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:59,253
Then what do you want?

429
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:02,249
Would you prefer I spend
my life paying off debts...

430
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:04,009
...and driving a junk car?

431
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,453
Would it be better if I
worked with petty criminals...

432
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:09,093
...in prison, flattering them
and living like a loser?

433
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:10,889
Think about what Moon Sang-guk did to us,

434
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,249
what that store manager did to you,

435
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:13,689
and Mom passing away.

436
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:15,329
It all happened because we were poor.

437
00:42:15,353 --> 00:42:16,649
Don't you get it?

438
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:18,409
We no longer have to suffer...

439
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:21,649
...and live miserably anymore!

440
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,649
But why can't you understand that?

441
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:26,613
Why don't Beom-jae or
you understand my feelings?

442
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,093
Hye-young.

443
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:40,173
We can...

444
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:44,093
...start over now. Right?

445
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:48,893
You've...

446
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:53,613
...changed too much.

447
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:30,000
There's no son like me. Am I right?

448
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,253
Mom.

449
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:39,953
LEE HYE-JA

450
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,173
Help Dong-soo, Mom.

451
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,649
Immigration options range
from investor immigration...

452
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:28,969
...to family sponsorship,
skilled worker programs,

453
00:44:28,993 --> 00:44:30,329
and employee
relocation, among others.

454
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:31,249
Canada is renowned for...

455
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:32,729
...its exceptional
educational environment...

456
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,713
DAEHAN TOUR

457
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:45,009
Yes, sir.

458
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:46,453
<i>Attorney Han.</i>

459
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:49,293
<i>They've captured all the</i>
<i>Yuseong Gang members.</i>

460
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,133
<i>I spoke with Chief Kim.</i>

461
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,533
That's a relief.

462
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:57,249
And what about Seo Do-young?

463
00:44:57,273 --> 00:44:58,529
He'll be caught soon.

464
00:44:58,553 --> 00:45:00,626
The arrest warrant has
already been issued, right?

465
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,009
He's a guy with no one on his side.

466
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,973
How's he going to escape?

467
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:08,693
Now,

468
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,453
shall we discuss our business?

469
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:07,093
Seo Do-young.

470
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:14,413
How did you...

471
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,133
This is what you get...

472
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,173
...for having the wrong
guy as your brother.

473
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:35,433
HAN LAW FIRM

474
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:41,073
BEOM-JAE

475
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:46,133
What is it?
You said you wouldn't see me.

476
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,213
Hello?

477
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:54,533
It's me, Attorney Han.

478
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:06,040
You haven't forgotten my
voice already, have you?

479
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:11,320
I'll send you the address.

480
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,000
Come over here.

481
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:14,653
Beom-jae.

482
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:18,180
What have you done to Beom-jae?

483
00:47:21,793 --> 00:47:23,380
He's right here.

484
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,420
He's not dead yet.

485
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:28,700
But who knows...

486
00:47:29,233 --> 00:47:30,773
...when he'll die?

487
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:38,553
A NEW MESSAGE ARRIVED. CHECK NOW?

488
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:48,793
10-79 AJO-DONG, BEOM-JAE

489
00:48:56,553 --> 00:48:59,133
Where are you? Get out here!

490
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,093
Beom-jae!

491
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,173
When I killed Heo Yang-ho,

492
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,289
I should've...

493
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:39,653
...killed this jerk too.

494
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:53,249
It's...

495
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,213
...between us.

496
00:49:58,473 --> 00:49:59,773
Beom-jae.

497
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,413
Let Beom-jae go.

498
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,813
Beom-jae didn't do anything wrong.

499
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:21,893
I don't think you deserve to say that.

500
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,723
What has that detective done wrong, then?

501
00:50:26,296 --> 00:50:27,436
What?

502
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:31,756
I can't just walk away...

503
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:35,476
...feeling unfairly treated.

504
00:50:36,896 --> 00:50:38,516
It'd be better...

505
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:41,836
...to kill everyone and leave.

506
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:00,716
Beom-jae.

507
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:04,716
- Beom-jae!
- You punk!

508
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:16,396
You scumbag.

509
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:22,236
It's all your fault.

510
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,916
If it weren't for you,

511
00:51:28,696 --> 00:51:30,836
I wouldn't have come this far.

512
00:51:35,496 --> 00:51:37,556
Do you really think so?

513
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:42,436
You still don't know yourself very well.

514
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,556
You've been...

515
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:52,236
...ignorant...

516
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:55,236
...of what a jerk you are.

517
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:06,916
Why did you do that?

518
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:08,952
It would have been better...

519
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:10,356
...f you just stayed quiet under me.

520
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,676
If you hadn't betrayed me,

521
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:17,436
we could've remained friends.

522
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:19,876
If that were the case,

523
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:24,916
you shouldn't have gotten me involved.

524
00:52:27,136 --> 00:52:30,356
You've just been using
me from the beginning.

525
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:36,076
If it weren't for me,

526
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,890
you would still just
be a low-life gangster.

527
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:42,974
How dare you say that to me?

528
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:55,636
Your little brother is...

529
00:52:56,936 --> 00:52:58,956
...dying because of you.

530
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:04,596
Experience what it feels
like to lose everything.

531
00:53:20,212 --> 00:53:21,032
Darn it!

532
00:53:50,176 --> 00:53:51,836
You ruined everything.

533
00:53:53,136 --> 00:53:54,596
It was almost finished,

534
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,023
and you ruined it!

535
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,596
It was you who ruined it.

536
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:42,236
It's all ruined because of you, you jerk.

537
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,756
Beom-jae.

538
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,196
Beom-jae, are you all right?

539
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:26,796
It's over now.

540
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:30,396
Come on. Get up.

541
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,032
Let's go to the hospital.

542
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:34,036
One, two.

543
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:41,796
Beom-jae.

544
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:45,236
Hey, come on.

545
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:49,716
Snap out of it!

546
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:52,476
No.

547
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,356
Dong-soo.

548
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,996
Don't live in anxiety.

549
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:13,316
Let it all go...

550
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:17,916
...and live comfortably.

551
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,116
Beom-jae.

552
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:43,676
Beom-jae!

553
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,836
Beom-jae!

554
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,076
Beom-jae!

555
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:08,736
3 YEARS LATER

556
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:11,872
The defendant,

557
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:14,472
harboring a grudge after being fired,

558
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:15,712
caused serious injury to the plaintiff...

559
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:17,232
...by throwing a chair,

560
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:19,112
and the plaintiff had to be hospitalized...

561
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:21,316
...for 20 weeks.

562
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:23,392
This act clearly constitutes
property damage...

563
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:25,636
...and aggravated assault,

564
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,996
for which I request a
two-year imprisonment.

565
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:33,676
Defense, please make your statement.

566
00:59:43,056 --> 00:59:46,236
The defendant's factory
often had overtime work...

567
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,592
...without additional pay.

568
00:59:48,616 --> 00:59:49,876
Even so,

569
00:59:50,136 --> 00:59:51,872
believing the company's promise...

570
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:53,632
...to convert the job to a
permanent contract...

571
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,152
after two years of employment,

572
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,916
the defendant worked diligently.

573
00:59:57,816 --> 00:59:58,992
However,

574
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:00,312
when just one month was left...

575
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:01,272
...before reaching the two-year mark,

576
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:03,832
the company unilaterally
sent a dismissal notice,

577
01:00:03,856 --> 01:00:06,796
and it was conveyed via text message.

578
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:09,792
Who could...

579
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:12,396
...endure such a situation?

580
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:16,076
The defendant admits the mistake.

581
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:19,156
The defendant committed an offense
that cannot be washed away...

582
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:21,956
...due to a moment of wrong judgment.

583
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,116
I will take the job.

584
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,956
I accept...

585
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:29,796
...your offer, Mr. Seo.

586
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,636
Back then,

587
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:34,876
he wouldn't have known...

588
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:38,516
...what kind of results...

589
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:40,916
...that choice would bring.

590
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:43,276
Don't...

591
01:00:44,496 --> 01:00:46,436
...live in anxiety.

592
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:49,156
Perhaps...

593
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,956
...he might have regrets.

594
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:56,476
Seriously...

595
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:00,783
...It's good, right?

596
01:01:03,296 --> 01:01:04,676
If only...

597
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,676
...he could go back to that time,

598
01:01:11,136 --> 01:01:12,716
he wishes he could...

599
01:01:15,216 --> 01:01:17,356
...put everything back in its place.

600
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:19,511
FAIR AND TRUSTED SHINNAM COURT

601
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:20,992
You received a proportional
representative proposal...

602
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:21,952
...from the ruling party. Is that true?

603
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,752
There's a possibility for
a regional constituency.

604
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:25,356
Any thoughts on running for office?

605
01:01:25,776 --> 01:01:28,996
I have no comments to offer yet.
I'm sorry.

606
01:01:29,656 --> 01:01:31,192
We understand that you're
involved in discovering...

607
01:01:31,216 --> 01:01:33,592
...illegal gambling sites
and aiding the victims.

608
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:35,632
I heard you often face threats...

609
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:37,272
...or coercion from gangsters due to this.

610
01:01:37,296 --> 01:01:38,636
Are you okay with this?

611
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:42,316
I'm not okay with it. I'm frightened.

612
01:01:45,256 --> 01:01:47,832
But someone has to do it, right?

613
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:51,112
In the past, gangsters were involved in...

614
01:01:51,136 --> 01:01:53,152
...crude crimes like
extortion and violence,

615
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,912
but now they're evolving
into corporate entities.

616
01:01:55,936 --> 01:01:58,636
A prime example is the
illegal gambling sites.

617
01:01:59,576 --> 01:02:01,152
These gangsters haven't vanished.

618
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,832
They've just hidden within the Internet.

619
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:05,316
Practically, there's no
way to monitor them.

620
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:08,161
If I enter parliament,

621
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:09,577
I will take the lead...

622
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,943
...in establishing
specific regulations.

623
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,236
Only then...

624
01:02:16,056 --> 01:02:17,476
...I will be able to prevent...

625
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:20,196
...more victims like my brother.

626
01:02:21,176 --> 01:02:22,552
Sorry, coming through.

627
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:23,992
- Coming through.
- Attorney Han.

628
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,952
- Coming through.
- Attorney Han.

629
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,432
Tell us more.

630
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,316
Please clear the way.

631
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:31,832
Move.

632
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:33,312
- Attorney Han.
- Move.

633
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:35,032
- Attorney Han.
- Attorney Han.

634
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:36,752
- Tell us more.
- Move.

635
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:38,512
- Attorney Han.
- Attorney Han.

636
01:02:38,536 --> 01:02:40,072
- Attorney Han.
- Attorney Han.

637
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:42,116
Please tell us more!

638
01:02:42,656 --> 01:02:44,396
- Attorney Han!
- Attorney Han!

639
01:02:58,496 --> 01:02:59,796
Hello, sir.

640
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:10,703
Hurry up.

641
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,836
He's not there?

642
01:03:14,976 --> 01:03:17,032
Stop slacking off and get to work!

643
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:18,476
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

644
01:03:20,736 --> 01:03:22,556
Gosh.

645
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:24,432
Well done.

646
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:25,916
Hello, sir.

647
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:28,512
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

648
01:03:28,536 --> 01:03:29,836
You are here.

649
01:03:38,256 --> 01:03:40,016
CEO HAN DONG-SOO

650
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:24,136
HYE-YOUNG

651
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:28,656
HYE-YOUNG

652
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:03,956
A person fighting a monster...

653
01:06:05,136 --> 01:06:08,076
...should be careful
not to become one.

654
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:13,596
When you gaze into the monster's heart,

655
01:06:14,696 --> 01:06:16,276
the monster...

656
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:19,116
...also gazes into you.

657
01:07:39,136 --> 01:07:41,056
EVILIVE

658
01:08:07,345 --> 01:08:10,065
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING EVILIVE.
