- ...on Moon Law Firm now.
- Step outside.

10
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,150
What is going on?

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,830
A search warrant was
issued all of a sudden.

12
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:33,112
My sister...

13
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:36,015
...was framed for what
Mr. Moon Sang-guk did...

14
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,139
...and faced an unjust death.

15
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:39,952
Nevertheless,

16
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,948
people only pointed their fingers at her.

I'm Attorney Han Dong-soo.

19
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:53,952
Ms. Park Ji-eun was...

20
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,232
...murdered and then
disguised as a suicide.

21
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,320
And it's clearly a crime...

22
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,401
...that Moon Sang-guk
illegally raised political funds...

23
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,325
...and abetted murder.

24
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,437
Let me demand the prosecution once again...

25
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,952
<i>...to follow the law and principles...</i>

26
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:10,388

<i>...was a personal revenge...</i>

30
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:18,908
<i>...done with power abuse.</i>

31
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,308
<i>Meanwhile, civic organizations are...</i>

32
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,268
<i>...strongly criticizing...</i>

33
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,908
<i>...the investigation without</i>
<i>the arrest of Mr. Moon...</i>

34
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:25,548
<i>...for being unfairly generous...</i>

35
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:28,348

41
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,792

case you'd be uncomfortable,

54
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:53,955
but I really wanted to tell you...

55
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,995
...to cheer up.

56
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:53,275
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,355
I didn't want to worry you.

58
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,395
Don't do that from now on.

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,940
You went through a lot.

Try it on.

67
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,875
What do you think? Do you like it?

68
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,431
We'll take this.

69
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,075
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,515
Is it really okay to take this?

71
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:24,355
You should wear something fancy too.

72
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,066
But it's way too expensive.

73
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,231
I told you.

74
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,515
I became a legal advisor for a company.

75
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,875
- That company from the other day?
- Yes.

76
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:36,875
We don't have to worry about money now.

77
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,795
Oh, honey.

78
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,921
You should get something nice too.

79
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:05,551
My goodness.

80
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,995
Hey!

81
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,351
What are you doing?

82
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,751
I just tried it on since we're here.

83
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:12,355
- Take it off!
- Fine!

84
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120

Hey, brother.

88
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,111
Why didn't you come in?

89
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,035
It's late at night.

90
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,035
I saw the news report.

91
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,955
Good work.

92
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,865
I feel so satisfied to think...

93
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,109
...of Moon Sang-guk
being locked up in jail.

94
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:05,955
Mom must be...

95
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:08,595
...happy too.

96
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,391
Should I do some house hunting?

97
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,075
You should move to a new place.

98
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,475
Well, I should.

99
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:22,711
After having Moon Sang-guk arrested first.

100
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,551
Well, aren't things going just fine?

101
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,751
The misunderstanding has been lifted too.

102
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,955
You should put up a
sign with your name on it!

103
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,835
Give me a commission raise.

104
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,551
Goodness.

105
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:35,115
Drive safely.

106
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,875
Okay, bye.

107
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,755
Good work.

108
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,475
- Be careful.
- Okay.

Doesn't it feel uncomfortable?

111
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,795
That outfit doesn't seem to suit you.

112
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,115
You look good in those.

113
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,395
So, are you here to see...

114
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,835
...how far I've fallen?

115
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,191
Shinnam Ferry will go bankrupt.

116
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:42,155
And I'll take it over.

117
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:48,112
Don't get any stupid
ideas if you want to survive.

118
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:53,835
Instead, I'll leave the others be.

119
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,755
Where did you get the money?

120
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:03,235
You should be broke
without the gambling business.

121
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:07,391
I can't tell you that.
It's my money source.

122
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,832
Is it Han Dong-soo's idea?

123
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,791
You're using him...

124
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:14,791
...to bring me and Moon
Sang-guk down all together...

125
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,235
...and take over Shinnam Ferry
and even the marine casino.

126
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,191
Then, like me,

127
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:24,595
you'll turn into an
entrepreneur from a thug?

128
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,951
You think I'll be satisfied...

129
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,475
...with that much?

130
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,915
Beware of Han Dong-soo.

131
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:43,955
He's not your average guy.

132
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,793
I'm telling you,

133
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:50,237
he'll be above your head one day.

134
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:55,511
I put in some pocket money for you.

135
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,595

I'm not sure what he's up to, though.

148
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:00,915
You know he won't stay still.

Look, I guess she wants to recruit you.

165
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,311
No way.

166
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,231
Why, punk?

167
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,475
It's plausible enough.

Hey, I'm serious.

171
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:07,355
Why don't you start a

172
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:10,511
Why do what's good for others?

173

Run one yourself.

174
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:13,631

00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,995
...that I had no intention of meeting you.

185
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:51,111
I got so many business cards in just today.

186
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:54,515
All of them came with a bag full of cash...

187
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,435
...to take over Shinnam Ferry.

188
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,871
But I'm not that kind of person.

189
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:03,915
Don't take me for a pushover.

190
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,951
I told you not to let anyone in.

191
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,635
Send security over.

192
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,315
Shouldn't you get promoted?

193
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,915
Are you worried about me?

194
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,955
I know...

195
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,795
that money can't sway you.

196
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:34,031
There will be a personnel
appointment next week.

197
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:37,035
You'll be appointed
as Director of Licensing.

198
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,755
Hold on.

199
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,275
What are you talking about?

200
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,435
Park Choong-ho isn't the
only assemblyman out there.

201
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:53,589
There are more than 15...

202
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,633
...just in the Maritime and
Fisheries Committee.

203
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:59,995
Apparently, they all like money.

204
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,275
I'll be counting on you.

205
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:47,791
<i>You're not the Han Dong-soo you used to be.</i>

206
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,831
You're famous and capable.

207
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,555
You don't lack of anything.

00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,422
Hello.

210
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,195
You must be going through a lot.

211
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,751
- How are things these days?
- Very good.

212
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,315
It's all thanks to the dummy room idea.

213
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,315
Keep up the good work.

Aren't you taking customers today?

217
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,511
We're working nights for
twice as many dummy rooms.

218
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,435
We haven't been open for a while.

219
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,315
Under whose orders?

220
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:26,835
Wrap it up.

221
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,075
- Pardon?
- The Internet cafe.

222
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,435
Open it back up like usual.

Running the Internet cafe...

...isn't for sales.

228
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,940
We need a disguise to avoid inspections.

229
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:07,035
I believe...

230
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:09,715
...I told you before.

231
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,115
Do as you please.

He's not your average guy.

00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:46,471
I'm telling you,

235
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:50,035
he'll be above your head one day.

Hello.

239
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,755
Oh, hello.

240
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:12,351
Thank you for the picture
report from the other day.

241
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,355
It helped handle the
smuggling case on a good note.

242
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,355
That's good to know.

243
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:21,151
Anyway, are you going to work at this hour?

244
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,755
Oh, yes.

245
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:25,697
There are so many accidents and cases...

246
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,591
...in this tiny city.

247
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,231
It's so hectic these days.

248
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,995
Oh, dear.

249
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:33,915
- Have a good one, then.
- Sure.

250
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,515
Look.

251
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,355
Do you perhaps know Seo Do-young?

252
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,071
I have something to investigate.

253
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,151
Back when he was in prison,

254
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,435
- you...
- Right.

255
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,555
I visited him as his attorney.

256
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,035
Right.

257
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,111
You did.

258
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:04,831
If you don't mind, could
we have a talk sometime?

259
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,791
Of course.

260
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:09,235
I'm not sure if I can help
you in any way, though.

261
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,995
Thank you.

262
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,747
How did it go?

263
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:41,275
The chief isn't...

264
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,631
He's now with...

265
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,795
...Park Choong-ho and Seo Do-young.

266
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,675
And I think it will be...

267
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:52,835
...neglected because of the murder case.

268
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,791
Make a separate move.

269
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,431
Disregard what the chief says.

270
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,911
What? But that's...

271
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:01,311
Don't think...

272
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:04,915
I'm doing this without any measures.

273
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:08,551
There will be a global shake-up...

274
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,795
...from the district attorney
to the police chief.

275
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,275
The whole thing will be reformed.

276
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,671
Who knows?

277
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:20,275
You might be given a chance too.

278
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,031
Sir.

279
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,395
Goodness, Attorney General Kim.

280
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:35,631
I'm sorry I couldn't help you in advance.

281
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:37,231
It was too late when I got the report.

282
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,631
Don't say that.

283
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:41,155
I know how busy you are.

284
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,755
SHINNAM SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

285
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,471
It was nice when I was still a prosecutor.

286
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:50,035
There was this tight bond.

287
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,511
Politicians...

288
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,151
...don't have a sense of community.

289
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:57,035
Well, people in that field...

290
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:00,355
...even stab their allies in the back.

291
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,395
No one can be trusted.

292
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,155
Speaking of which...

293
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,195
I'll appoint someone new...

294
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:12,675
...in the Shinnam district
attorney position.

295
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,115
Someone trustworthy.

296
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,311
So, 910 Hwagil-eup, Buk-gu...

297
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:33,431
Is this it?

298
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,515
Oh, it's here.

299
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:42,235
Gosh.

300
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:44,555
Darn it.

301
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,271
What?

302
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,751
Have you always been this hardworking?

303
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:51,395
Why you...

304
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:57,351
What? A new district
attorney was appointed?

305
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,231
It's not even the season
for personnel appointments.

306
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:00,511
Exactly.

307
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:02,631
I thought he was behaving himself,

308
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:03,711
but he must've frequented...

309
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:05,755
...the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

310
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:12,151
Can you look into the relationship...

311
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,151
...between Moon Sang-guk
and the new district attorney?

312
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:15,675
Well...

313
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,671
Hey, I have a meeting.

314
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:24,115
- I'll see you later
- Okay.

315
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:27,115
Hello?

316
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,195
Hello, Oh-jae.

317
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,555
Gosh.

318
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:47,395
This is no joke.

319
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:48,991
I should've...

320
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:51,955
...become a gangster too.

321
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,631
I contacted you regarding
Park Je-yi's death.

322
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,075
I'm Detective Ma Chul-jin
of Shinnam Police Station.

323
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,695
DETECTIVE MA CHUL-JIN

324
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,435
Gosh.

325
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,391
As it happened,

326
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:24,595
the day you left prison,

327
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,995
Park Je-yi died.

328
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,235
And you're currently living...

329
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,075
...in the house she used to live in.

330
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,631
This is Yu-seong's house.

331
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,235
As you know,

332
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:39,929
a patient can't be left alone.

333
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:45,275
You're well-acquainted
with Heo Yang-ho, right?

334
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,631
What happened?

335
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:48,355
He suddenly disappeared.

336
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,715
Well, isn't it your job to find people?

337
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:57,551
You were fighting over
the succession of the gang...

338
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:59,475
...until he suddenly disappeared.

339
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:01,795
Yet, you aren't so interested.

340
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:06,155
No, I'm not.

341
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,555
Didn't you kill him?

342
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,875
Didn't you already check his alibi?

343
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,915
We meet again.

344
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:27,755
I'm Han Dong-soo,
Mr. Seo's legal representative.

345
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,835
We live in the same apartment building.

346
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:44,515
Yes, we checked his alibi.

347
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:47,355
He did something quite unusual.

348
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,871
But a motive is...

349
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,591
...just as important as an alibi.

350
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:52,991
A person who benefits the most...

351
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:55,155
...from a victim's death.

352
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,355
Finding that...

353
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:59,071
...is the basics of an investigation.

354
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,031
Exactly my point.

355
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:03,551
If you had followed the basics,

356
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,591
you wouldn't have come all the way here.

357
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,431
The late Park Je-yi...

358
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,795
...was having an affair with Heo Yang-ho.

359
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:13,155
Chairman Kim Yu-seong...

360
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,431
...was in a common-law marriage...

361
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:17,315
...with Park Je-yi. You know that, right?

362
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:23,231
And?

363
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:24,671
A couple's quarrel...

364
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:27,831
...can lead to manslaughter sometimes.

365
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:30,995
Especially when it involves money.

366
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:33,595
Money?

367
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,271
Heo Yang-ho and Park Je-yi...

368
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,235
...embezzled company money.

369
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:41,035
If you want, I'll show
you the documentation.

370
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:49,355
Gosh.

371
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,435
Hey, let's go.

372
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,795
Let's go already.

373
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:03,035
Just as the rumors say,
you do a lot of good deeds.

374
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,595
Even defending gangsters.

375
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:10,311
Everyone...

376
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:13,195
...has the right to consult an attorney.

377
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,995
Right.

378
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,595
Let's go.

379
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,155
Chul-jin.

380
00:28:05,695 --> 00:28:08,835
Doesn't it seem like Seo
Do-young killed Heo Yang-ho?

381
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,595
But there is no evidence.

382
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:17,035
Only if Han Dong-soo hadn't shown up...

383
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:19,475
Darn it.

384
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,235
He's suspicious too, right?

385
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,555
Their relationship does
seem more than normal.

386
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:40,475
It's said a new district
attorney will be appointed.

387
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:43,235
And the detectives came at this timing.

388
00:28:47,695 --> 00:28:49,915
I think Moon Sang-guk is making a move.

389
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,595
Let's...

390
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,075
...move the bodies first.

391
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:58,311
The detectives came
all the way to your house.

392
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,115
This is too dangerous.

393
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,835
I'll take care of it.

394
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:11,431
What will you do and how?

395
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:13,475
I'm your accomplice.

396
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,991
What if everything goes south?

397
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,511
If we don't get Moon Sang-guk now,

398
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:20,031
all that we've done will go up in smoke.

399
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,555
It will affect the business too!

400
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:37,595
I apologize.

401
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,955
<i>You got rid of Yang-ho?</i>

402
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:14,911
I did.

403
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:17,555
<i>By the way,</i>

404
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,911
<i>isn't this too risky for us?</i>

405
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:24,915
You want to make Heo
Yang-ho the killer of Park Je-yi.

406
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,075
And yet, you want to bury
Heo Yang-ho in this house.

407
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:33,835
Hello?

408
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,795
Hello?

409
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:57,835
<i>It's said a new district</i>
<i>attorney will be appointed.</i>

410
00:30:58,455 --> 00:31:01,755
<i>I think Moon Sang-guk is making a move.</i>

411
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,391
Yes.

412
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,195
Mr. Seo.

413
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:16,591
I heard you met Mr. Yoo.

414
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:18,635
You're good, Mr. Seo.

415
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,951
<i>But you see,</i>

416
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,671
is it safe to move alone?

417
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,355
What is it that you want to say?

418
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,911
Let's not complicate
things and work together.

419
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,911
<i>Winning over one</i>
<i>person isn't enough, is it?</i>

420
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,355
<i>You know better, don't you?</i>

421
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:38,195
I will see you at the office.

422
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:41,231
I will see you later in the evening.

423
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:42,471
I have an appointment at the moment...

424
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:43,995
Come to my office.

425
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,931
What a rude scumbag.

426
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:54,335
CEO'S OFFICE

427
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,355
What happened?

428
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:11,631
Detective Lee Su-ho visited
Seo Do-young's house today.

429
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,551
And Han Dong-soo came as the legal advisor.

430
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,911
How funny is that?

431
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,591
He's still a lawyer,

432
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,311
so he must've gotten himself
out of trouble somehow.

433
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,391
But he must've gotten quite thrown off.

434
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:22,991
If we corner him a little more,

435
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:25,401
it will be a matter of
time before we establish...

436
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,365
...a connection between him
and that gangster.

437
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:30,195
Don't take it lightly.

438
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:35,435
Seo Do-young is no ordinary guy.

439
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:38,755
And Han Dong-soo trusted him.

440
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:41,675
Go straight at it.

441
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,195
Yes, Father.

442
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,035
Go straight at it.

443
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,391
Go straight at it.

444
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,795
Straight...

445
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:09,175
CEO SEO DO-YOUNG

446
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,315
I heard it from Chief Kim.

447
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,555
The police came?

448
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:31,751
What's the point of me
running around everywhere...

449
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:35,391
when you keep causing
trouble behind my back?

450
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,111
"I am a gangster."

451
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:38,635
Are you advertising it?

452
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:54,555
Assemblyman Park Choong-ho.

453
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,515
I am a gangster.

454
00:33:57,895 --> 00:33:59,355
Did you forget that?

455
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,235
No.

456
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,795
I just mean...

457
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:07,115
You won't be disappointed.

458
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,715
Well...

459
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:38,475
...I'll be...

460
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,715
...going then.

461
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:46,195
From now on, come get your
money whenever I call you.

462
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,795
Assemblyman.

463
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,755
Okay.

464
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:17,151
<i>But a motive is just</i>
<i>as important as an alibi.</i>

465
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:20,795
A person who benefits the
most from a victim's death.

466
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:24,235
Finding that is the
basics of an investigation.

467
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:37,275
Mr. Han Beom-jae.

468
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,555
I am Detective Ma Chul-jin
from Shinnam Police Station.

469
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:49,635
I've got some questions for you.

470
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,955
Lee Seok is your friend, right?

471
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,551
Yes. What about him?

472
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,591
The owner of the company
Lee Seok used to work for,

473
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,671
Park Je-yi died.

474
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:02,075
And I am investigating the case.

475
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:08,395
But I didn't work there, you see.

476
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,675
Do you know Seo Do-young well, then?

477
00:36:17,415 --> 00:36:19,115
Not really.

478
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,071
Didn't you link him with
Attorney Han Dong-soo?

479
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:24,875
You introduced him as
his legal counsel, right?

480
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:29,511
Right. I remember now.

481
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,951
What does that have to do with us?

482
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:33,635
Is it wrong to be his legal counsel?

483
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,675
It's not wrong.

484
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,631
But according to Lee Seok,

485
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:41,315
Attorney Han drove for Park Je-yi.

486
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,715
The day before Park Je-yi died.

487
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:59,035
Dong-soo, we need to talk.

488
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:06,591
A detective came to see me.

489
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,595
He's investigating Park Je-yi's case.

490
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:15,111
Did you know something about it?

491
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,355
So why didn't you tell me?

492
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,391
Don't worry about it.

493
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:24,551
He's got no evidence anyway.

494
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,475
But there is, in the
pond inside that house.

495
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:29,481
It's a matter of time
before they find it...

496
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:31,311
...once the search begins.

497
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:34,435
The moment they find Heo
Yang-ho's body, we're done.

498
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:38,915
Shouldn't we ask Seo Do-young to move it?

499
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:41,031
I already did.

500
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:42,871
- And?
- He said he would take care of it.

501
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,955
Is he out of his mind? This is urgent.

502
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:49,955
Does he perhaps have a
hidden agenda behind our backs?

503
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:14,355
If it can wait, let's talk
about it another time.

504
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:17,555
About Heo Yang-ho's body.

505
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:22,235
You already moved it, didn't you?

506
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,515
Why didn't you tell me?

507
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:36,688
Why do I have to tell you that?

508
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:38,252
I need to know.

509
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,075
That way, if there's
an issue, I can act on it.

510
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:45,231
Only three of us know...

511
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:47,435
...where Heo Yang-ho is buried.

512
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,431
Once they dig up the pond,

513
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:50,871
either Beom-jae or I would be...

514
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,791
...the one who reported it.

515
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,115
Isn't that why you asked
us to bury him there?

516
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,871
Right.

517
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:00,431
That was an understandable choice.

518
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,315
But now...

519
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:08,755
You could tell me, you know.

520
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,037
Where is the body?

521
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:19,595
Where did you move it?

522
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,335
IT'S ME, MOON SANG-GUK. CAN WE MEET?

523
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:34,395
Let's talk about it another time.

524
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,355
I'm busy.

525
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:56,175
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

526
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,195
<i>It's me, Moon Sang-guk.</i>

527
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,235
<i>Can we meet?</i>

528
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,415
MOON SANG-GUK, THE CEO OF MOON LAW FIRM...

529
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:18,175
FILES A COMPLAINT AGAINST
ATTORNEY HAN DONG-SOO

530
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:23,271
Honey.

531
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,795
Look at the news.

532
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,591
<i>Moon Sang-guk, who's under</i>
<i>prosecution investigation...</i>

533
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:31,831
<i>...for charges like arson and murder,</i>

534
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,191
<i>has filed a complaint against...</i>

535
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:34,751
<i>...Attorney Han Dong-soo.</i>

536
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:36,511
<i>Personal revenge?</i>

537
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,311
<i>Attorney Han was dismissed for misconduct.</i>

538
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,591
<i>He received disciplinary</i>
<i>action for violating dignity.</i>

539
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:45,275
<i>You might say that's personal animosity.</i>

540
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:48,631
<i>Should one use others' deaths...</i>

541
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,835
<i>...to cover up his own mistakes?</i>

542
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,631
<i>Isn't that a deceitful behavior?</i>

543
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:56,431
<i>Are you implying that</i>
<i>Attorney Han Dong-soo...</i>

544
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,151
<i>...was motivated by a personal grudge?</i>

545
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,111
<i>I couldn't say.</i>

546
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:03,631
<i>He might have been</i>
<i>very close to Park Ji-eun.</i>

547
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,711
<i>What? What do you mean by that?</i>

548
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,231
<i>Please tell us more.</i>

549
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,911
<i>- Tell us more.</i>
<i>- Tell us.</i>

550
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,031
<i>Moon Law Firm has filed a complaint...</i>

551
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,831
<i>...against Attorney Han</i>
<i>for false dissemination...</i>

552
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,635
<i>...of information and defamation</i>
<i>of character.</i>

553
00:41:58,455 --> 00:42:00,275
Are we meeting for the first time?

554
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:04,795
The first official meeting, I guess.

555
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,471
I guess we must've seen each other...

556
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:10,515
...since you used to work for Kim Yu-seong.

557
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:15,555
What do you want?

558
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:19,115
Why don't we work together?

559
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,595
I don't know.

560
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:24,915
I don't really care for
working for someone else.

561
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:27,351
Park Choong-ho is
going to be investigated...

562
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,035
...for election funding.

563
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:30,911
We'll push him hard to the brink...

564
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:32,915
...to strip him of
his parliamentary position.

565
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,675
So?

566
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:44,115
You want to take me down...

567
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,311
...and take over Shinnam
Ferry and the marine casino.

568
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:49,115
Is that enough to satisfy you?

569
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,311
You don't seem like the type...

570
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:53,835
...who would be satisfied with that.

571
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,915
But you are satisfied?

572
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:05,235
The prosecution's
investigation will end this month.

573
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:08,435
Then I'll be nominated as the Minister.

574
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:10,955
You know what that means, don't you?

575
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:14,595
If you join hands with me,

576
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:16,915
you can stand above the law.

577
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,671
No matter what you do,

578
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:22,115
nobody will be able to touch you.

579
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:37,195
What is it that you want?

580
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:42,835
Han Dong-soo.

581
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:54,155
You're giving up the lawsuit?

582
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:56,391
My family is strongly against it.

583
00:43:56,415 --> 00:43:59,351
It will only put Ji-eun on the hot seat.

584
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,031
I know.

585
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,271
But still, you're willing
to bury it like this?

586
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:04,995
Don't you feel upset?

587
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:07,875
I am sorry.

588
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:12,355
By any chance, did Moon
Law Firm send someone?

589
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:16,715
Did you settle?

590
00:44:27,455 --> 00:44:29,595
The truth doesn't matter.

591
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:32,395
What matters is power.

592
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:36,711
<i>The new district attorney</i>
<i>is Mr. Moon's friend.</i>

593
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,831
<i>What will you do?</i>

594
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,675
<i>It looks like the press is helping him too.</i>

595
00:44:45,095 --> 00:44:46,915
Darn it.

596
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:24,875
Park Ji-eun's family gave up the lawsuit.

597
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:28,235
Moon Sang-guk handled it.

598
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:31,795
Let's meet Park Choong-ho.

599
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,555
What if we meet him?

600
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:36,875
We have to do something.

601
00:45:37,855 --> 00:45:39,435
Moon Sang-guk.

602
00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:42,195
He will dig into Park Je-yi case.

603
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,755
Then you will be in danger too.

604
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:51,435
We should connect with Park Choong-ho.

605
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:54,595
Once the new district attorney comes,

606
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:57,675
Park Choong-ho will be done for.

607
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:03,035
So?

608
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,515
Shouldn't we do something about it?

609
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:13,955
Let me think about it.

610
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:24,875
Moon Sang-guk.

611
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:29,555
Let's kill him.

612
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:45,515
Can you really kill him?

613
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:49,835
We can find a clean man,

614
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:51,795
get him to kill Moon Sang-guk,

615
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,515
and make him turn himself in. Right?

616
00:46:55,975 --> 00:46:58,755
As long as we pay him
enough, he will do it.

617
00:46:59,455 --> 00:47:00,955
Isn't that...

618
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:05,835
...what you've always done?

619
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:11,195
You remove...

620
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:15,515
...anyone who bothers you.

621
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:40,831
<i>The prosecution's</i>
<i>investigation will end this month.</i>

622
00:47:40,855 --> 00:47:42,755
If you join hands with me,

623
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:44,751
you can stand above the law.

624
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,391
No matter what you do,

625
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:49,071
nobody will be able to touch you.

626
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:50,955
What is it that you want?

627
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:53,715
Han Dong-soo.

628
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:55,111
Moon Sang-guk.

629
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,435
Just get it done nicely.

630
00:47:57,655 --> 00:47:59,155
Let's kill him.

631
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:13,515
You said you needed
new running shoes, right?

632
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:18,715
What's wrong?

633
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:21,231
I won't play with Ma Jae-yeong anymore.

634
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:22,551
He's not my friend anymore.

635
00:48:22,575 --> 00:48:23,631
Why?

636
00:48:23,655 --> 00:48:26,631
We went to a stationery
store the other day.

637
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,231
He didn't buy me anything,

638
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,915
but he bought a hairpin for Kim Eun-chae.

639
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:34,951
- Auntie.
- Right. I'm sorry.

640
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:36,951
Jae-yeong is bad.

641
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:38,511
I will go and yell at him.

642
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:41,031
I bought him a slime the other time.

643
00:48:41,055 --> 00:48:43,231
I got him two capsule toys too.

644
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,831
- So why...
- Will you keep it down?

645
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,515
I'm driving.

646
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:04,715
- Park the car and come up.
- Okay.

647
00:50:09,335 --> 00:50:10,551
Where's Mr. Seo?

648
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,795
He's waiting nearby.

649
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:15,311
It takes about 30 minutes by car.

650
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:17,715
You go ahead. I will follow you.

651
00:50:18,055 --> 00:50:19,955
You can ride with us.

652
00:50:20,575 --> 00:50:22,875
We have to get it done
as quietly as we can.

653
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:31,475
I will drive you back after.

654
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,835
Wh... What are you doing?

655
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:41,955
Where is this place?

656
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:45,591
You will find out soon enough.

657
00:51:45,615 --> 00:51:47,555
When Moon Sang-guk arrives.

658
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:54,995
He made a request to me too.

659
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:02,355
To kill Han Dong-soo.

660
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:08,995
You met Moon Sang-guk?

661
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:41,955
Please spare my life.

662
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,315
You know what Moon Sang-guk is like.

663
00:52:47,135 --> 00:52:48,675
Just once.

664
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:50,591
Give me just one more chance.

665
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:54,555
I will do everything I can do.

666
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,315
Look at you. You got what you deserved.

667
00:53:19,855 --> 00:53:21,671
Don't resent me.

668
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:24,031
You dug your own grave.

669
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:25,595
Let's begin.

670
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:29,995
Sit.

671
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:33,955
I said, sit.

672
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:39,991
What are you doing?

673
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:41,711
I told you to come.

674
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:44,155
I didn't say who I was going to kill.

675
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,031
I thought hard about it,

676
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:49,355
but I couldn't make up my mind.

677
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:52,191
Shinnam Ferry is almost mine.

678
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:55,195
I just need to take over the marine casino.

679
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,675
I need a partner to take that over.

680
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,835
A legal advisor who will clean up the mess.

681
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,911
I can't decide who to pick between you two.

682
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:07,951
I told you I would give you everything.

683
00:54:07,975 --> 00:54:09,875
I'll give you everything.

684
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:11,951
The prosecution investigation is over.

685
00:54:11,975 --> 00:54:13,231
I will be the Minister soon.

686
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:14,351
What's the problem?

687
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:16,715
I can't become Kim Jae-yeol.

688
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:18,635
Right?

689
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:22,235
Attorney Han.

690
00:54:23,335 --> 00:54:25,355
We've been good partners.

691
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:31,035
I think this might bring us closer.

692
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:38,315
You two wanted to kill each other.

693
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,275
Only one of you will survive.

694
00:54:49,935 --> 00:54:51,915
I'll be outside.

695
00:54:54,335 --> 00:54:55,551
Mr. Seo!

696
00:54:55,575 --> 00:54:57,195
Mr. Seo!

697
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:39,995
This is your problem.

698
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:42,875
You always miss your chance.

699
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,755
You weakling.

700
00:56:24,775 --> 00:56:26,311
You think Seo Do-young
will keep you alive...

701
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:29,555
...after you kill me?

702
00:56:30,935 --> 00:56:32,675
Wait and see...

703
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,275
...who dies...

704
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:39,275
...and who lives.

705
00:57:59,255 --> 00:58:00,755
This makes us...

706
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:03,555
...true partners.

707
00:59:16,615 --> 00:59:18,855
EVILIVE

708
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,711
<i>I will do everything you tell me.</i>

709
00:59:20,735 --> 00:59:22,431
<i>That's what you want, right?</i>

710
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:24,991
<i>I will return everything.</i>
<i>Let my brother go.</i>

711
00:59:25,015 --> 00:59:27,231
<i>It's what I wanted. I chose it.</i>

712
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:30,111
<i>Thanks to you, I got this far.</i>

713
00:59:30,135 --> 00:59:32,151
<i>Give me a share of the business profit.</i>

714
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:34,031
<i>I am not trying to catch Han Dong-soo.</i>

715
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:35,151
<i>We need to stop Seo Do-young...</i>

716
00:59:35,175 --> 00:59:36,631
<i>...before things really get out of hand.</i>

717
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:38,311
<i>I couldn't stand what you're doing,</i>

718
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:40,631
<i>so I went to the police to expose you.</i>

719
00:59:40,655 --> 00:59:41,711
<i>Let's prepare.</i>

720
00:59:41,735 --> 00:59:43,311
<i>Seo Do-young will hit you.</i>

721
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:45,912
<i>There's no other choice.</i>
