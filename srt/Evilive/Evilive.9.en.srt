Congratulations, sir.

The staff will start
working from next week.

12
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,610
None of them are new,

13
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,814
so there won't be much
trouble in the office.

00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,574

EPISODE 9

52
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,099
Did you get some rest?

53
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,366
Thanks to you.

54
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,170
I had some time to wonder...

55
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,354
...why my life...

56
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:08,234
...ended up so twisted.

57
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,394
At first, I thought...

58
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,394
...it was all because of Moon Sang-guk.

59
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,394
It turned out it was because of me.

60
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,218
I didn't want to surrender
to people like him.

61
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,842
I withstood and challenged them.

62
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,754
But all I had left...

63
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,114
...were bank loans...

64
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:33,794
...and a junk car.

65
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,514
Now,

66
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,274
I want my life to be different.

67
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:46,274
What do you want me to do?

68
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,754
I'll do anything you ask.

69
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,975
That's what you want, isn't it?

70
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:05,314
A sustainable business.

71
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:10,530
You know the expected
sales of the marine casino.

72
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,610
It's 800 billion won a year.

73
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:15,330
What's crazy is that this is legal.

74
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:17,970
It's the same gambling, but one is legal...

75
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:19,330
while another is illegal.

76
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,234
It's a bit ridiculous.

77
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,594
But anyway with this,
everything will be over.

78
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,554
We will...

79
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,954
...start a law firm.

80
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,170
Get an office and hire attorneys.

81
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,050
I'll tell you...

82
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,114
...what you should do then.

83
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:48,130
Then, let's do the calculations sharp.

84
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,114
I want a share...

85
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:52,114
...of the company's profits.

86
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:58,634
You said we were partners.

87
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,434
Sure thing.

88
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,874
I'll start working tomorrow.

89
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,794
Dong-soo?

90
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,610
Why didn't you answer your phone?

91
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:41,474
Did something happen?

92
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,170
Don't come to work starting tomorrow.

93
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,890
Get some rest...

94
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:48,034
...and find a suitable job.

95
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,594
I told Seo Do-young.

96
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,154
What about you?

97
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:00,050
Well, I will...

98
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:03,234
...wrap things up eventually.

99
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,570
Dong-soo, let's move first.

100
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,130
I've given it some thought,

101
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,850
and I think we should do that first.

102
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,490
After we leave this city.

103
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,554
Let me sort things out first.

104
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,668
Got it.

105
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,188
Bye.

106
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,634
By the way, did Moon Sang-guk...

107
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,714
...really gone off the grid?

108
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,394
I don't know.

109
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:54,234
But it's good for us this way.

110
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,234
Sorry, Dong-soo.

111
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,474
All this happened because of me.

112
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,714
Only if I hadn't offered that visitation...

113
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,794
It's all over.

114
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,994
That's what matters.

115
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,903
SHINNAM POLICE STATION

116
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,832
What on earth are the police doing?

117
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,472
Why can't they find a single man?

118
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:46,112
We're mobilizing all the resources we have.

119
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,672
What else can we do?

120
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,192
Don't do what you can.

121
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,832
Do it right.

122
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,952
Did you investigate Han
Dong-soo and Seo Do-young?

123
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,112
Why should we investigate them...

124
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,792
...regarding Mr. Moon's case?

125
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,552
I keep telling you.

126
00:09:58,576 --> 00:09:59,592
They were in league with each other...

127
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,696
...and did something to my father.

128
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:08,672
Circumstances of abduction, witnesses,

129
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:10,672
or traces of physical contact.

130
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:13,392
Easily speaking, physical evidence.

131
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,792
We need that to change
it into a criminal case...

132
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,232
...and start investigating it.

133
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,232
Bravo.

134
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,936
So did you jump on their
bandwagon this time?

135
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,272
- Pardon?
- Wait and see.

136
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,992
I'll remember the two of you.

137
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:28,912
Brace yourselves.

138
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:31,376
Remember what?

139
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,519
I'm Moon Hae-jun, Moon Sang-guk's son.

140
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,077
How dare you...

141
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,981
Brace yourselves.

142
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,277
Attorney Moon.

143
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,061
Attorney Moon.

144
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,237
Attorney Moon.

145
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:52,557
Attorney Moon!

146
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:53,717
Attorney Moon.

147
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,621
Goodness.

148
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,717
Haven't you found Moon Sang-guk yet?

149
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,437
Are you sure he went off the grid?

150
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,957
There are no records of
him leaving the country.

151
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:06,797
Are you saying we're
feigning ignorance on purpose?

152
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,877
This city may be corrupted,

153
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,101
but it's not that bad.

154
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,157
Park Je-yi's case too.

155
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:15,941
Close it now.

156
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:20,101
Close it? I haven't even
started investigating it.

157
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,141
Is that right? Look.

158
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,541
INVESTIGATION REPORT

159
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:28,101
TEST RESULT

160
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,481
Heo Yang-ho's car was found,

161
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,721
covered with Park Je-yi's DNA everywhere.

162
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,237
Seo Do-young, that punk,

163
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,561
is water under the bridge, okay?

164
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,541
GERMAN-MADE CAR, SILVER, FROM REAR

165
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,394
TEST RESULT

166
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,637
Even in Seoul, when a
DNA test is requested,

167
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:06,877
it takes at least a week,

168
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,321
or three days in case of an emergency.

169
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,757
But all this came out...

170
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,281
...only a day after the car was found?

171
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,677
Goodness, gracious.

172
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,597
I guess all forensic
investigators are here in Shinnam.

173
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,521
What do you want me to do?

174
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,401
Just don't stop me.

175
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,561
I'll keep digging into it.

176
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,757
Goodness.

177
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,201
What are you, a no-man in a world of yes?

178
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,637
A law firm?

179
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,197
Yes, I got an office.

180
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,121
Seon-kyo will be joining too.

181
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,721
I guess it will be a big one.

182
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,917
Someone offered an investment.

183
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,921
I should seize the chance I'm given.

184
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,475
Hey.

185
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,677
Hey, Han Dong-soo.

186
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,437
- Han Dong-soo.
- What are you doing?

187
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,797
Where is this punk? Come out!

188
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,717
Goodness!

189
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,961
- Come out now!
- What is wrong with you?

190
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,757
- Move.
- What are you doing?

191
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:16,997
It was you, wasn't it?

192
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,077
You were behind this
with Seo Do-young again.

193
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,437
It was me the last time,
and this time, it's my father!

194
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,557
Stop this, or I'll call the police!

195
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,957
Lady, do you know what
your husband is up to?

196
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,921
- Do you?
- Go inside.

197
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:31,281
What? Do you feel guilty?

198
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,881
Stop doing this here and follow me.

199
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,881
What's your deal?

200
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,435
You already know.

201
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,995
My father.

202
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,481
Why are you asking me about him?

203
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:06,681
I know from experience.

204
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,197
What is it this time? Abduction?

205
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,721
Confinement?

206
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:14,481
Tell me, you jerk. What
did you do to my father?

207
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,117
Leave.

208
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,921
I have nothing to say.

209
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,801
Hey.

210
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,201
Doesn't that life confuse you?

211
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,235
You live with two opposite faces.

212
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,477
A star attorney, my foot.

213
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,077
A sense of conscience? Justice?

214
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,997
Don't make me laugh, you jerk.

215
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,837
You act like you're upright and dignified,

216
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,397
but you're only like me.

217
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,557
Isn't that why you reported Park Ji-eun?

218
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,957
You were upset because
you couldn't join in...

219
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:47,557
...when you wanted to rake in some money.

220
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:49,201
You rat.

221
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,841
Why you little...

222
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:53,761
Do you think...

223
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,681
...I could...

224
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,841
...kill you here or not?

225
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,727
Damn it!

226
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,201
There are no security cameras here.

227
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,641
You moron.

228
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,789
You're nothing without your father.

229
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:24,753
Why did you come alone? It's dangerous.

230
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,761
But,

231
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,441
not now.

232
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,321
I'm after someone first before you.

233
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,241
So,

234
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,801
behave yourself...

235
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,561
...and wait.

236
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,961
Goodness.

237
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,881
What a...

238
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,521
...nice office.

239
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,581
HAN DONG-SOO

240
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,157
There are 20 employees...

241
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:49,317
and five attorneys including me.

242
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,681
We'll start doing business tomorrow.

243
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,037
Invite those who will
support the marine casino...

244
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,881
to a gathering.

245
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,757
We'll pay for all the expenses.

246
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:03,681
Just make sure they
will participate for sure.

247
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,521
And let's do some cleansing.

248
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,277
To be qualified for the casino bidding,

249
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,761
we need to make three times the profits.

250
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,481
But there are too many
businesses like us these days.

251
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,961
Let's get rid of them all...

252
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:26,241
...and monopolize the industry.

253
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,397
How may I help you?

254
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:40,037
We're here regarding the game money.

255
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:41,877
Just a moment. Hee-seon.

256
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:42,797
Will you show them the way?

257
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,397
I...

258
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,397
...didn't even know what
exchanging money meant.

259
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:48,277
They kept sending me messages.

260
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,285
I was provided with an
unlimited amount of game money.

261
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,837
So I sold everything to play the game.

262
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,761
I get this many reminder notices a day.

263
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:58,197
HELLO, THIS IS ATTORNEY
JOO OF HAN LAW FIRM.

264
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,301
I'VE LISTED UP WHAT YOU REQUESTED.

Seoul and Incheon.

272
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,274
These guys are our main targets.

273
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:40,637
Focus on them.

274
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,121
Got it?

275
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:43,717
Oh, right.

276
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:44,877
CHECK MARKETING POST ON FORUM

277
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:48,117
Why are you holding our list, you punk?

278
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,417
Are you trying to mess with us...

279
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,061
- ...or what?
- Is this the police?

280
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,441
I want to report a case
of game money fraud.

281
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:00,628
Damn it!

282
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,077
Take the money.

283
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,681
Freeze!

284
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,877
- Gosh.
- Please.

285
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,277
- Come on.
- Be quiet and get in already.

286
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:09,517
Goodness!

287
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,317
You're getting good results these days.

288
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,517
They all move online, you know.

289
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,957
They're really fast.

290
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,917
So you should get them...

291
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,917
...within five minutes since
an inspection begins.

292
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,397
So they have no time to
erase records and websites.

293
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,561
- Who told you that?
- The informant.

294
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,541
POLICE

295
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:36,597
Even without the investment
costs for Gamblers,

296
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:39,921
the sales are skyrocketing
within the same period.

297
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,981
AFFILIATION, NAME, LICENSE
PLATE NUMBER, NUMBER

298
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,401
It's done.

299
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,881
- Let's drink.
- Sure.

300
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,961
Let's grab a drink.

301
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,521
How are the event preparations going?

302
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,597
The list of attendees...

303
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,841
...will be finalized tomorrow.

304
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:58,881
Assemblymen, the police, prosecution.

305
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,517
I only invited the high
ranks of public bodies.

306
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,601
It'll be around 50 people.

307
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,241
By the way,

308
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,801
I've been curious about this.

309
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:29,401
How did you meet Kim Yu-seong?

310
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,138
Gosh.

311
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:36,757
The car that Kim Bong-yeon received...

312
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:38,481
...from the Korean Series.

313
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:42,521
Kim Yu-seong got that car for me.

314
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,761
Not the exact same one.

315
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:49,481
One that's better.

316
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,201
I thought there was
no point in being a thug,

317
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,801
but I realized...

318
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,241
...this field wasn't so bad.

319
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:04,201
<i>You're digging your own grave.</i>

320
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,437
Kim Yu-seong.

321
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,197
Do you know why he became like that?

322
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,321
It's Seo Do-young's doing.

323
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:20,401
But when I met Kim Jae-yeol,

324
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,961
he told me it was you...

325
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:27,041
...who did that to Kim Yu-seong.

326
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:34,841
Gosh. I don't like incompetent people.

327
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:39,041
He got money from Kim Jae-yeol,

328
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:42,161
sucking up to him.

329
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,561
I found it pathetic.

330
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,997
You scum...

331
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:03,081
You jerk!

332
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:11,317
Let's stop cleaning up after Kim Jae-yeol.

333
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:13,841
He's like your boss, not a friend.

334
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:17,281
Because you act that way,

335
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:19,616
he looks down on me too.

336
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,020
You son of a...

337
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:27,201
Let's stop now.

338
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,401
Don't get in my way either.

339
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,795
But...

340
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,521
...why do you keep him here?

341
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:44,481
Because I can still make use of him.

342
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,601
Yes. I'm on my way.

343
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:31,599

CASE REPORT

349
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,037
It's a little small,

350
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,761
but it's in a good location.

351
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,597
That's why there's a line of people...

352
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:12,921
...wanting to move in
despite the high deposit.

353
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:15,241
What repair shop was it again?

354
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,077
Computers.

355
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:19,121
That's perfect.

356
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:22,237
You're still young, but
you must be competent.

357
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:24,161
You have your own business already.

358
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,251
What is it?

359
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,161
About Attorney Han...

360
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:04,241
How did he get involved with Seo Do-young?

361
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,877
You know already. He
was the legal counsel...

362
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,521
Not that.

363
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,997
I thought they worked together at first.

364
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,757
The recent incidents...

365
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:16,837
...were all targeting Kim Jae-yeol...

366
00:26:16,861 --> 00:26:18,881
...and Moon Sang-guk.

367
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,477
And those who benefited from them...

368
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,561
...were Seo Do-young and Attorney Han.

369
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:25,961
But...

370
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:27,681
...there's a case that I can't understand.

371
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:29,721
The murder case of Park Je-yi.

372
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:34,321
It has nothing to do with Attorney Han.

373
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:39,357
It must be one of the two.

374
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:42,521
He either got blackmailed or made a deal.

375
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:52,881
My brother...

376
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:56,001
...went through a lot for ten years
because of Moon Law Firm.

377
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,921
He was a legal counsel and a hired
designated driver because of them.

378
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:02,375
Don't run your mouth when
you don't know anything.

379
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,841
I'm not after Han Dong-soo.

380
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,401
Who I want is Seo Do-young.

381
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:16,356
There are quite a lot of people...

382
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,735
that went missing
around Seo Do-young.

383
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:22,441
That includes the gamblers
of his gambling house.

384
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,797
That outlaw became the CEO of a company.

385
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:27,281
And now,

386
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,561
he's trying to take over a casino.

387
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,681
We must stop Seo Do-young...

388
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,001
...before things get out of hand.

389
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,361
Leave. I have nothing more to say.

390
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,001
Tell me.

391
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,001
I can help.

392
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,361
Call me when you're done thinking.

393
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,401
I'll be waiting.

394
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:32,807
CHINESE FOOD, QUICK DELIVERY

395
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:45,401
I'm even more glad to see you alive.

396
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:47,681
What brings you here?

397
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,481
I thought I paid back my debt already.

398
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,637
The profits from the gambling house.

399
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,717
How much of it do you give to Seo Do-young?

400
00:28:56,741 --> 00:28:59,681
So what if I tell you? Will you pitch in?

401
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,357
Why don't you do business with me?

402
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:05,921
The gambling house.

403
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:08,321
I'll give the whole thing to you.

404
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:13,761
Instead,

405
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:17,361
please...

406
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,681
...get rid of Seo Do-young.

407
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,717
There's a truck of men I sent...

408
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:33,197
...to kill Seo Do-young.

409
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,237
But they all returned dead.

410
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:37,841
I'd love to send more guys.

411
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,161
But there are none
because they're all dead.

412
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,001
I'll leave since you're done talking.

413
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:49,441
What if there's a way?

414
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,717
<i>You were behind this</i>
<i>with Seo Do-young again.</i>

415
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:15,037
It was me the last time,
and this time, it's my father!

416
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:16,557
Stop this, or I'll call the police!

417
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,481
Lady, do you know what
your husband is up to?

418
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,117
This is pickled cucumber.

419
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:38,161
This is spicy dried squid.

420
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,357
I made some jangjorim too.

421
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,841
Gosh, I could've gone to get them.

422
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,601
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

423
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:49,095
Beom-jae.

424
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,921
About your brother...

425
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:55,161
Did something happen to him?

426
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,801
He seems...

427
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,441
...to have changed a little.

428
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,801
A few days ago, he...

429
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,481
I know I might be a
little sensitive, but...

430
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,001
I don't know.

431
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,571
<i>Don't come to work starting tomorrow.</i>

432
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,081
What about you?

433
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:31,161
Well, I will wrap things up eventually.

434
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:55,401
Are you here to get legal
advice for Game of Cards?

435
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,681
Well...

436
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,641
Beom-jae.

437
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:02,361
Oh, Seon-kyo.

438
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,290
HAN LAW FIRM

439
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,706
Gosh, it's hot.

440
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:15,635
Here. It's the instant coffee you ordered.

441
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,797
- This is the one, right?
- Yes.

442
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,237
Bad timing, though.

443
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:22,837
Dong-soo isn't here when
you came all this way.

444
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:25,477
It's all right. I see him often.

445
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,837
I dropped by to look around the office.

446
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,877
Right. I'm glad you're here.

447
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,357
By the way, Seon-kyo.

448
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:33,437
One of your staff asked me too,

449
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:35,542
and I saw something
about free legal counseling.

450
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:37,386
- What's that all about?
- Hey.

451
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,961
You know Game of Cards, right?

452
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:45,557
It's the top site for card games.

453
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:47,757
Because it's so popular,

454
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:51,641
some are acting up, trying
to make money off of it.

455
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,401
Illegal money exchangers.

456
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,717
They exchange game money into cash.

457
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,797
On the surface, it's just an online game,

458
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:01,121
but it's actually a gambling house.

459
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,575
But what does that...

460
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,237
...have anything to do with the law firm?

461
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:13,281
Oh, we're preparing a class
action suit of the victims.

462
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,037
And Dong-soo went to meet them...

463
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,641
...to help.

464
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:23,317
For all this time, you were victimized,

465
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:26,197
but you couldn't share that fact...

466
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,801
...because you illegally
exchanged game money.

467
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,517
But if you demand money,

468
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:33,117
con others,

469
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,477
and swindle a huge amount
of money for gambling,

470
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,721
it is clearly fraud.

471
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:42,957
Based on the exchanger information...

472
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,397
...and their account
numbers that you provided,

473
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,317
we'll press the police to investigate them.

474
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:49,317
And against the government
that was negligent...

475
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,517
...of regulating them,

476
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,481
let's prepare a class action suit.

477
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,077
Then you'll be able to get
back the money you lost.

478
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,477
Thank you for your service.

479
00:33:58,501 --> 00:33:59,917
GAME OF CARDS ILLEGAL
EXCHANGE FRAUD VICTIMS MEETING

480
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:01,877
Please take care of it well, Attorney Han.

481
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,877
I lost the money I saved for three years.

482
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:05,117
Don't worry.

483
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:06,877
We'll do our best.

484
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,481
Thank you.

485
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,481
Thank you.

486
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:26,197
What are you doing?

487
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,121
Why are you doing this?

488
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:30,681
What's so wrong about helping people?

489
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,070
We came up with the money exchange
and dummy room idea.

490
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:36,031
And now you're helping the victims?

491
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,435
It doesn't make any sense.

492
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:43,117
Be straight with me.

493
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:46,041
This has something to do
with Seo Do-young, right?

494
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,277
You said you'd quit and wrap things up.

495
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:52,677
If you stay here, your wife and Min-hee...

496
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:54,317
...will be in danger.
Don't you know that?

497
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,597
Who knows when Seo
Do-young that jerk will...

498
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,357
That won't happen anymore.

499
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,761
Let's talk later. I will...

500
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,681
...tell you everything later.

501
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,475
Is it because of Moon Sang-guk?

502
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:09,481
He didn't go into hiding, did he?

503
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,117
Seo Do-young killed him, right?

504
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,121
And that's what he has on you, right?

505
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:17,557
It's not like that.

506
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:19,127
Then what is it?

507
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:28,397
Let's report Seo
Do-young. It's not too late.

508
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:30,197
All we did was move the bodies.

509
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,197
You said we wouldn't be punished...

510
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,317
...if we were forced to do it.

511
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:33,557
Let's just come clean.

512
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:34,877
The money exchange business.

513
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:35,917
We were forced to...

514
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,917
It's not like that!

515
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:40,641
It's what I wanted. It was my choice!

516
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,997
This business was mine from the start...

517
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,717
...because I planned everything.

518
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,241
But Seo Do-young...

519
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,397
That jerk just took it.

520
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:52,717
Didn't he?

521
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:54,877
That's no business. It's a crime.

522
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,681
So what if it's a crime?

523
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,357
Gosh, it's so easy to make money.

524
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:05,761
Why did we work so hard pathetically?

525
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:08,673
We were so diligent
and considerate of others.

526
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,075
You can't make money like that.

527
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,717
That's how we lived.

528
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:16,401
Like fools.

529
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:19,997
So what are you going to do?

530
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:22,041
Are you going to fight Seo Do-young?

531
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:31,675
Why?

532
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,689
You don't think I can?

533
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:46,161
There's a mole we hired
from the Family Gang.

534
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,235
But he reported something strange.

535
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:55,585
It is Han Dong-soo.

536
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,357
Attorney Han.

537
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:25,781
DOWOONWON

538
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,081
What brings you here?

539
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,717
Let's have dinner together.

540
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,281
I know everyone is working hard.

541
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,161
Hey, Do-young.

542
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:15,081
You met each other at the fishery, right?

543
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,161
Well, yes.

544
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,295
Eat up.

545
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,437
It's uncomfortable...

546
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:27,241
...because of what happened that day.

547
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,801
Is that so?

548
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:36,001
I thought you two made up.

549
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:39,795
Gosh.

550
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,895
You two met separately.

551
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:54,361
- Well, that's...
- Yes.

552
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:56,241
We did meet.

553
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:03,321
Because of the gambling house.

554
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,672
Yes.

555
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,557
He needed legal advice,

556
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,681
and he needed to manage the money.

557
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,517
I couldn't do it myself,

558
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,237
so I introduced him to
an attorney from our firm.

559
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,677
Why turn it down when he pays?

560
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:22,437
The profit goes to Yuseong Gang anyway,

561
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,521
so in a bigger picture, we're like family.

562
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,195
Right, we are indeed.

563
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,877
Good thinking.

564
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,721
You should help him more from now.

565
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,761
I'm not after Han Dong-soo.

566
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,641
Who I want is Seo Do-young.

567
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:19,681
What do you mean?

568
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,681
Beom-jae.

569
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:32,061
SHINNAM POLICE STATION

570
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:36,797
Wait, Beom-jae. Beom-jae!

571
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:39,361
Beom-jae!

572
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,021
A NEW MESSAGE ARRIVED. CHECK NOW?

573
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,117
<i>Let's pretend it never happened.</i>

574
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:53,001
<i>Don't call me again.</i>

575
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:10,557
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

576
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:13,561
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

577
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:29,201
Did he go somewhere?

578
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,201
He left.

579
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:36,321
He must be busy.

580
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,121
I see.

581
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,677
I think tomorrow's event...

582
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,357
...is going to go well.

583
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,357
The casino is one thing,

584
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:03,841
but it's going to help the business a lot.

585
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:07,961
Right.

586
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:11,521
Thank you.

587
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:19,721
We wouldn't have gotten here...

588
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:22,801
...without you, you know.

589
00:43:16,621 --> 00:43:18,161
Let's get ready.

590
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:20,121
Yes, sir.

591
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:50,201
Hey. How are you doing?

592
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,281
Are you still on good
terms with Seo Do-young?

593
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:01,241
The Park Je-yi case is...

594
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:03,917
...finished, is it not?

595
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,721
Yes. It is finished.

596
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,841
It never started anyway.

597
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:13,321
This neighborhood is like some gang.

598
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,681
It's sickening.

599
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:19,357
People from out of town
have trouble adjusting.

600
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:21,357
Everyone's connected here,

601
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:23,081
friends, alumni, neighbors.

602
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:25,481
Everyone is connected somehow.

603
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:28,081
If you don't like that,

604
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,441
you should head back to Seoul.

605
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,841
Your brother feels tormented.

606
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,361
Are you aware of that?

607
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:44,867
Seo Do-young is great,

608
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:47,441
but you'd better take
care of those close by.

609
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:09,841
Hey, did you meet the detective?

610
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:11,761
What did you tell him?

611
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:15,121
Is that why you're here?

612
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:17,681
Yes. I went to the police station.

613
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,775
You did what?

614
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:22,277
I'm disgusted by what you're doing.

615
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:24,761
So I went there to tell them everything.

616
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,077
What did you tell him?

617
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,477
You disposed of the
body for Seo Do-young...

618
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:30,677
...and earned money through gambling.

619
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:33,361
Well, I won't claim to be clean.

620
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,797
But you're scamming those victims again?

621
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:37,441
Are you a con artist?

622
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:42,521
So, what did you say?

623
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:47,201
Why on earth are you doing this?

624
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,517
You just have to come
back to where you belong.

625
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,121
Why do you keep straying off the path?

626
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:20,584
Darn it.

627
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:41,597
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

628
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:44,641
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

629
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:48,281
Whether you accept my offer or not,

630
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,761
Seo Do-young will hit you up.

631
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:55,521
It means you don't have any choice.

632
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:02,681
This is your last chance.

633
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:05,121
Your last chance...

634
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:08,201
...to get rid of Seo Do-young.

635
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:20,117
<i>There is one voice message.</i>

636
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,837
<i>Press one to check the message.</i>

637
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:23,357
- What is this?
- <i>To delete the message...</i>

638
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,757
<i>Here's the message.</i>

639
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,597
<i>Whether you accept my offer or not,</i>

640
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:29,801

<i>It means you don't have any choice.</i>

642
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:40,557
Darn it.

643
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:41,917
CELEBRATION FOR THE
OPENING OF THE MARINE CASINO

644
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,077
Please set these tables.

645
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:45,561
Yes, sir.

646
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,721
What is that?

647
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,321
Your father.

648
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:33,001
Feed him some ramyeon, will you?

649
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:52,201
She told me to come here.

650
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:03,917
HAN DONG-SOO

651
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,081
Your name is Dong-soo?

652
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:25,081
What's your name?

653
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:30,841
Beom-jae.

654
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:33,521
Han Beom-jae.

655
00:49:57,685 --> 00:49:59,585
The car's ready, sir.

656
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:02,397
Let me go. All right. Let go.

657
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:04,481
Why can't I go in?

658
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:07,077
I am sorry, sir.

659
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:08,850
I told him he couldn't go in.

660
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:11,301
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

661
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:19,442
Long time no see.

662
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,715
This is the money you gave us.

663
00:50:25,861 --> 00:50:28,275
I might owe a few hundred,
but I'll pay it off quickly.

664
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,481
I'll return all of this,

665
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,601
so please, let my brother go now.

666
00:50:39,221 --> 00:50:40,717
It's Moon Sang-guk, isn't it?

667
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:42,477
You're the one who killed Moon Sang-guk.

668
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,401
You're holding my brother with that.

669
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:49,961
Do you...

670
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:52,121
...really think so?

671
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,196
If not, there's no reason for him to stay.

672
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,955
What should I say to that?

673
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,521
I shouldn't be the one to tell you.

674
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,835
Go ask your brother.

675
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:11,601
And take this with you.

676
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,481
Please, let my brother go.

677
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,915
I beg you. Please?

678
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:22,681
Okay.

679
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:25,361
I will.

680
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:17,675
You can't go in.

681
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:18,955
What?

682
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:21,641
You are not on the guest list.

683
00:52:22,781 --> 00:52:24,197
What are you talking about?

684
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:25,797
I prepared this event.

685
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:27,841
The order came from the boss.

686
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:46,517
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

687
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,921
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

688
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,121
This is Shinnam Police Station.

689
00:53:02,423 --> 00:53:04,083
You have something to report?

690
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:05,771
Go ahead.

691
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,437
All right. Are we all set?

692
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:16,997
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get going.

693
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:19,117
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you're here.

694
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:21,154
- Let's go.
- Go where?

695
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,947
Come on and follow us.

696
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:26,121
Come on, Chul-jin.

697
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:27,818
Darn it.

698
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:34,717
<i>You're the one who killed Moon Sang-guk.</i>

699
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:36,641
<i>You're holding my brother with that.</i>

700
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:38,975
Do you...

701
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:40,934
...really think so?

702
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:44,915
If not, there's no reason for him to stay.

703
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:47,155
Go ask your brother.

704
00:53:48,701 --> 00:53:50,435
Please, let my brother go.

705
00:53:54,206 --> 00:53:55,435
Okay.

706
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,115
I will.

707
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:01,801
Mr. Han Beom-jae.

708
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:04,041
Mr. Han Beom-jae.

709
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,921
We're the police.

710
00:54:10,061 --> 00:54:12,121
We need to check your place.

711
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:13,397
Start the search.

712
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:14,597
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

713
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,161
This way.

714
00:54:16,301 --> 00:54:17,717
This way.

715
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:19,677
This way.

716
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:23,081
Search thoroughly.

717
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,121
- What's going on?
- Let's search here.

718
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:35,201
We got a tip.

719
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:37,515
He said a body is buried here.

720
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,075
What?

721
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:51,683
What is it?

722
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:55,201
Dong-soo, the police are here.

723
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:57,215
What?

724
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:00,081
They are saying there's
something in the house.

725
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:19,601
I found it!

726
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:22,535
<i>Beom-jae.</i>

727
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:56,582
It's him.

728
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,186
Report it.

729
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,515
Yes, sir.

730
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:03,877
Yes, sir.

731
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:05,317
We've confirmed the body.

732
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:07,355
We will take the body and get back.

733
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:08,795
Yes, sir.

734
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:12,041
Mr. Han Beom-jae.

735
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:14,595
You are under emergency
arrest on suspicion of murder.

736
00:56:15,461 --> 00:56:16,957
You have the right to remain silent...

737
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:18,601
No, wait!

738
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:20,475
What... What is this?

739
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:23,475
Why would you ask us about it?

740
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,556
It's Moon Sang-guk's corpse.

741
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:41,141
SHINNAM POLICE WILL BE WITH YOU

742
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,681
- Tell us!
- Why did you do it?

743
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:36,815
<i>Attorney Han.</i>

744
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:40,721
You son of a gun.

745
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,375
What are you playing at?

746
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:50,938
So why did you do that?

747
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:54,835
You should've just done what I told you to.

748
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,507
What did I do?

749
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:04,761
I did everything you asked.

750
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:13,355
You disappointed me.

751
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:24,475
I enjoyed our time together.

752
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,604
Let's part our ways now.

753
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,028
EVILIVE

754
00:59:38,621 --> 00:59:41,397
<i>There's no clear evidence or justification.</i>

755
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,717
<i>You don't need to get me out.</i>

756
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:44,557
<i>That's what Seo Do-young is after anyway.</i>

757
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,677
<i>Do you really mean to take all the blame?</i>

758
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:48,797
<i>This is what you get for</i>
<i>having a wrong brother.</i>

759
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:50,837
<i>You should've lined up well.</i>

760
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:52,837
<i>That's why you can't live long.</i>

761
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:55,357
<i>Tonight, we are entering</i>
<i>Seo Do-young's place.</i>

762
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:58,157
<i>What will happen to my brother, then?</i>

763
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:00,641
<i>I am too upset to fall like this.</i>

764
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:02,717
<i>If it weren't for you,</i>

765
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:04,961
<i>I wouldn't have come this far.</i>
