MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS, AND TOURISM

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,320
Darn it.

EVILIVE

00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,036
EPISODE 2

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,720
Welcome.

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
What is going on?

13
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,960
Park Je-yi?

14
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,733
What about my boss?

15
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,022
Just out of curiosity.

16
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,258
So why are you curious about her?

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
Hey, forget it.

18
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:23,225
Not just anyone can meet her.

19
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,858
She's only a bar hostess.

20
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,498
She isn't an ordinary bar hostess.

21
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,338
Money, power, connections.

22
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:29,858
Do you have at least one of them?

23
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:32,698
If not, don't even dream about it.

24
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,698
Hold on. This is very suspicious.

25
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,480
You're even treating me to food.
It's not like you.

26
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,754
Does it perhaps have something to do...

27
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,619
...with the case I got you a few days ago?

28
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,978
What... What are you saying?

29
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:45,483
We decided not to take it.

30
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:47,018
He's being released in a few days.

31
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,738
How could you set us
up with someone like him?

32
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,178
You know the redevelopment
district is a hot issue.

33
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,138
The market in this
neighborhood will flourish.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,048
A lot of people come to check out...

35
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,993
...some properties in good locations.

36
00:02:57,138 --> 00:03:00,138
And apparently,
it's very hard to meet Ms. Park.

37
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,898
We've been asked...

38
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,018
...to look into what kind of person she is.

39
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,778
I doubt she's someone to be persuaded.

40
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,344
She knows too much about
the real estate business.

41
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,338
- Really?
- Anyway,

42
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:15,243
keep it from others that I told you.

43
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:16,963
It's the iron law in her business.

44
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,201
"Act like you didn't hear or see anything."

45
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:22,114
"Keep your mouth shut outside the store."

46
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:28,897
First off, she comes to work right on time.

47
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,498
No matter how much she drinks,

48
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:32,323
she always comes to work by 3 p.m.

49
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,283
She's a real tough cookie, sometimes.

50
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,898
Usually, she focuses...

51
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:40,643
...on managing staff and sales.

52
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:41,978
But when VIPs visit,

53
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,363
she joins them from time to time.

54
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,683
On a day like that, one of the valets...

55
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:46,963
...drives her home.

56
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,843
They kind of hate it.

57
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,338
Her house is so secluded...

58
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,443
...that it's not an easy
journey there and back.

59
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,898
Do you want to work part-time?
It's 50,000 won a day.

60
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:02,418
What do you take me for?

61
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,723
I'm a programmer!

62
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,523
Right, in your dreams.

63
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,803
Does Ms. Park...

64
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,504
...perhaps...

65
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,650
...have a boyfriend?

66
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,538
I'm not sure.

67
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,418
I know nothing about her private life.

68
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:17,043
You must've noticed at least something.

69
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,258
She wears like 10 masks.

70
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:21,120
It's impossible to read
what she has in mind.

71
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:30,623
14 DAYS BEFORE SEO DO-YOUNG'S DISCHARGE

72
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,163
How did it go?

73
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,208
It's been a little past two
hours since she entered.

74
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,938
Wait. It's Park Choong-ho.

75
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,272
Shinnam's assemblyman.

76
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,981
Oh, no wonder why he looks familiar.

77
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,821
Could he be her boyfriend?

78
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,575
They're leaving.

79
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:15,861
I think it really is him.

80
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:20,941
What? Where are they going?

81
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:25,916
Due to the Shinnam
Expressway construction...

82
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,141
...that's scheduled to
take place next year,

83
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,894
transportation will become very convenient.

84
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,941
Thus, it's much better...

85
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:34,381
...than any other candidate districts.

86
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:37,981
Here's the detailed
redevelopment proposal...

87
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,501
Thanks.

88
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,115
HOTEL PURPLE

89
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:22,036
FOUR DAYS BEFORE SEO DO-YOUNG'S DISCHARGE

90
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:23,661
THREE DAYS BEFORE SEO DO-YOUNG'S DISCHARGE

91
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,741
Well, that's understandable.

92
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,497
She may not have a boyfriend.

93
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,243
So the conclusion is,

94
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,388
I'm overly suspicious?

95
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,866
No, what I mean is...

96
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,466
This is so offensive.

97
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,066
You're treating me like a psychopath.

98
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,340
I've followed her for more than 10 days...

99
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,043
...without even sleeping.

100
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,435
But I couldn't find anything.

101
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,299
There's nothing to suspect.

102
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,106
I'm the one who doesn't understand this.

103
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,706
Shouldn't you rather be happy?

104
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:36,788
Now, you know for sure that she's single.

105
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,517
You darn little rat!

106
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,962
Are you trying to take my money for free?

107
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,812
Think of your wife at home.

108
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,546
Your mom suffering from Alzheimer's.

109
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,699
Your brother and your niece too.

110
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:08,278
You have four days left.

111
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:34,980
SHINNAM PRISON

112
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,420
What a jerk!

113
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:04,188
An attorney isn't a lackey.

114
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,570
This won't do. Let's drop it.

115
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,433
- Why?
- That jerk mentioned...

116
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,258
Mom, your wife, and even Min-hee.

117
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,315
We do need money, but this isn't right.

118
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,890
Let's just quit.

119
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:25,833
By the way,
isn't Seo Do-young a little weird?

120
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,625
He's this obsessed...

121
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,730
...about a man who doesn't even exist.

122
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,650
But he's not interested
in Park Je-yi at all.

123
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,050
Whether it be affection or hatred,

124
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,890
he needs to have something.

125
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,522
But I feel indifference.

126
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,539
It's as if he has an ulterior motive.

127
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,410
An ulterior motive, my foot.

128
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:44,155
He's just a psychopath.

129
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,210
His brain functions differently
from normal people's.

130
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,450
Did you look into his drunk driving case?

131
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,690
Well, there wasn't anything strange.

132
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,010
He was a little unlucky that day, I'd say.

133
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,450
He got into a fight with
some men from another gang.

134
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,930
Then the fight got big.

135
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,130
He was on the run when he
happened to ram into a store.

136
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,539
That's all?

137
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,930
There's something that bothers me, though.

138
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,770
Seo Do-young didn't
drink that much that day.

139
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,810
What does that mean?

140
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,685
He only had a few glasses
and got drunk quickly.

141
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,490
Wait here.

142
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,903
INMATE VISITION AREA

143
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,770
Long time no see.

144
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,330
Oh, you know it.

145
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,974
Things have been
hectic with the inspection.

146
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,170
Did you look into it?

147
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,690
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,810
I heard they were with the Family Gang.

149
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,610
This punk is darn rude.

150
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,730
He heard?

151
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,130
Is this how you discipline our men?

152
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,330
My apologies, sir.

153
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,010
I looked into it myself.
It just came out wrong.

154
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,530
What about Tae-ho and Du-sik?

155
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,290
We're still looking for them, sir.

156
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,427
Apologies.

157
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,040
Those darn rats.

158
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,250
After how much...

159
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,210
...you cared for them,
they ran off with the money.

160
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,650
Are you sure the Family Gang was behind it?

161
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,810
Of course.

162
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,490
If it wasn't sure, I wouldn't...

163
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,459
Then why aren't you doing anything?

164
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:33,834
We'll make sure it's done
before you come out, sir.

165
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,330
Get going.

166
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,658
I'm off to take a nap.

167
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:46,882
Goodbye, sir.

168
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:52,638
That son of a gun.

169
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,730
A nap, my foot.

170
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,691
Did you contact the Family Gang?

171
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,570
Yes, they're working on it.

172
00:12:58,595 --> 00:12:59,595
What's taking them...

173
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:03,682
Check if anyone is...

174
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,162
...helping Seo Do-young, okay?

175
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:25,466
- Should I...
- Yes?

176
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:27,251
- ...just get a haircut?
- What?

177
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,683
It's a hassle for you every morning.

178
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,115
Goodness.

179
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,979
That's hardly the case.

180
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,330
Never.

181
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,491
It's so much fun tying your hair.

182
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,234
Keep it as is.

183
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,410
Ta-da.

184
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,490
Get your hoodie out.

185
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:05,075
Have fun.

186
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,490
See you.

187
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,795
- Bye.
- See you.

188
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,362
FRIENDS, LET'S LOVE AND
CARE FOR EACH OTHER.

189
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,580
Are you going to be late again today?

190
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,970
Well, yes. For the time being.

191
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,490
Don't skip meals, no
matter how busy you are.

192
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:25,880
Okay.

193
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,530
Oh, right.

194
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,320
About your client,

195
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,195
what kind of person is he?

196
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,010
Why do you ask?

197
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,490
I'm grateful.

198
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,530
We dealt with the supermarket
issue thanks to him.

199
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:40,979
He pays you a lot too.

200
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:45,995
- See you.
- Bye.

201
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,730
Dong-soo.

202
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,810
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,530
Darn, it must be uncomfortable here.

204
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:58,923
I'm so busy these days.

205
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,650
Are you handling a lot of cases?

206
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,050
Not just cases.

207
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,930
I have to be at Moon
Hae-jun's beck and call.

208
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,930
You know he's running for election, right?

209
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,640
This neighborhood is doomed.

210
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,418
Oh, right. So, what about Seo Do-young?

211
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,610
He has something to do with my client.

212
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:23,923
Did he cause trouble in prison?

213
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,450
Well, kind of.

214
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,907
Did you look into his lawsuit?

215
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,993
Well, that is...

216
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,298
...a little leery.

217
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,650
The sentence was way too heavy.

218
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,330
I get that he assaulted a police officer,

219
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,650
but he was drunk.

220
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,890
It should've been around three months.

221
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,010
If Moon Law Firm took the case, I mean.

222
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,690
What did the attorney in charge say?

223
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,530
He wasn't clear about it.

224
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:56,217
Something does feel fishy.

225
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,371
Gangsters make sure...

226
00:15:58,396 --> 00:16:00,876
...to bail their bosses out right away.

227
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,145
Even if they deserve years,

228
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,210
they pay a huge legal fee to be paroled,

229
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,250
and it was just drunk driving.

230
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,330
Seo Do-young was sentenced to eight months.

231
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:09,675
This makes no sense.

232
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,375
Then...

233
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,135
An internal power struggle.

234
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:16,655
There must've been a guy...

235
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:19,615
...fighting against him
for power within the gang.

236
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,800
When Seo Do-young got arrested,

237
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,905
he took the chance to get him.

238
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,510
I bet there will be serious bloodshed...

239
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,295
...as soon as he's released from prison.

240
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,952
I mean, won't he?

241
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:35,535
As soon as he's freed,
he might rip them all apart...

242
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,655
- Hey, Dong-soo.
- Oh, yes.

243
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,255
By the way, does he...

244
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,295
...have a girlfriend?

245
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:44,455
What?

246
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,615
I mean, people like him
always have issues with women.

247
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,455
I'm not sure about Seo Do-young,

248
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:53,655
but his boss has a lot
of trouble with women.

249
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,295
I hear he lives with a
bar hostess or something.

250
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,535
Kim Yoo-sung, was it?

251
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:02,135
Maybe he lives with a woman too young,

252
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,375
but he's said to be close to dying.

253
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:11,183
Oh, hey.

254
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:14,215
Now that I'm full,
I need to go to the bathroom.

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

256
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:20,480
What?

257
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,015
Goodness.

258
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,095
How peculiar.

259
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:29,055
People don't even look
toward their past workplaces.

260
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:31,663
You have quite the nerve.

261
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,647
If you're here to eat, do just that.

262
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:34,969
Sure thing.

263
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:37,895
I see you're done.

264
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,215
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

265
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:57,815
Congrats, Attorney Han.

266
00:17:58,455 --> 00:17:59,575
I hear you're back in business.

267
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:01,855
How does it feel...

268
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,375
...to be back in the home ground?

269
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:11,255
You still have this uncompromising
attitude of yours.

270
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,495
You shouldn't be that aggressive,

271
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,215
or your life gets tiring.

272
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:16,655
Do you still not have...

273
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,615
...any intentions of apologizing?

274
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:21,655
Don't tell me...

275
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,135
...you're still blaming me.

276
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,215
That suspension.

277
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,095
To be exact, it was revenge...

278
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:29,760
...under the guise of a suspension.

279
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,175
A personal revenge...

280
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,584
...conducted with an
abuse of power and status.

281
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,535
You're good in every way...

282
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,615
...except for this one thing.

283
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,495
Self-reflection.

284
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,615
What about Park Ji-eun then?

285
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,495
Do you still not have...

286
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,656
...any intentions of
apologizing to her either?

287
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,015
I need to go.

288
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:41,655
What do you mean by that?

289
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,320
Park Je-yi isn't Seo Do-young's girlfriend?

290
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,935
Then, why is he looking for that man?

291
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,295
He has nothing to do with him.

292
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:48,975
A power struggle involving succession.

293
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,015
I think he's looking for a betrayer,

294
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,655
not a cheater.

295
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,095
Then what do we do?

296
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,415
What if we face harm because of it?

297
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,575
We'll have to be as careful as possible.

298
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:05,735
Do you have...

299
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,055
...the spy cam ready?

300
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:08,615
Yes.

301
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,975
We'll begin when Park
Je-yi leaves home tomorrow.

302
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,496
I'll deactivate the security system, then.

303
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,255
But I wonder if we can succeed.

304
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,895
We only have tomorrow and the day after.

305
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,697
Now that we've confirmed he's real,

306
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,015
he'll be caught on camera for sure.

307
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,950
Also, when we secure evidence,

308
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,455
we can't leave...

309
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:34,855
...any traces of us, including the spy cam.

310
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,775
Right.

311
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:38,935
We need to be way more discreet than now...

312
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:40,771
so that the other gang doesn't find out.

313
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:43,255
Gosh, it's confusing.

314
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,840
We can't tell which side will win.

315
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,773
Let's find the evidence
that Seo Do-young wants...

316
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,158
...as soon as possible.

317
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:50,695
Okay.

318
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:53,495
Yes, I'm on my way.

319
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:56,033
I'm almost there, so I'll call you after...

320
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,215
Hold on.

321
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,335
She just left.

322
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,095
Okay.

323
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,095
CLOSED TODAY

324
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,455
Yes, what is it?

325
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:20,855
Is it working at all?

326
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:22,434
Nothing seems to have changed.

327
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,695
It's not that simple.

328
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
There are so many things I need to work on.

329
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,054
So just hang up!

330
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,415
I'm really sensitive right now.

331
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
Hey, when will it be done, then?

332
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:32,175
Come on!

333
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:44,775
Got you.

334
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:46,455
Did it work?

335
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:49,255
I told you to trust me.

336
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:50,735
Go ahead and check.

337
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,270
The security cameras, security device,

338
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,175
and the front gate door lock. It's perfect.

339
00:22:58,215 --> 00:22:59,255
You...

340
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:01,735
You should never do this elsewhere.

341
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:03,455
After all the help I gave you?

342
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:05,975
Wait for me. I'll be there in 30 minutes.

343
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,830
Hey! What took you so long?

344
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:47,415
Why didn't you pick up my call?

345
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:48,935
You called me?

346
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,486
OUT OF SERVICE AREA

347
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,369
Gosh, this neighborhood is lousy.

348
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,909
Gosh, this is so cool.

349
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:19,095
How much money does he make?

350
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,175
My gosh.

351
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,040
Gosh. What's all this?

352
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:38,935
Oh, gosh.

353
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:41,855
My goodness.

354
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:44,775
Hey!

355
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,615
What are you doing?

356
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,910
I just tried it on since we're here.

357
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:50,015
- Take it off!
- Fine!

358
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,295
Get out.

359
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,015
We can install them in the living room...

360
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,360
...and the rooms.

361
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:15,748
Oh, gosh! What was that?

362
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:17,935
Gosh, that scared me.

363
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,375
The phone works in here.

364
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:27,855
Let's see.

365
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,135
All right.

366
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:49,695
Okay. Living room's done.

367
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,575
Let's see it now. Turn it on.

368
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:55,895
What are you saying?
It'll be saved on a USB drive.

369
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,630
We can't watch it real-time?

370
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:00,055
Gosh, you must've seen too many movies.

371
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:02,735
Korea's technology isn't that advanced.

372
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,255
Gosh, don't worry.

373
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:08,895
We can turn off the security device.

374
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,455
Then we can come in anytime.

375
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:14,615
Gosh, how laid back.

376
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:17,015
Is this Park Je-yi's room?

377
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,615
How cute!

378
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,735
Okay. We're all set.

379
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:40,655
Let's hurry and leave now.

380
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:53,375
Hey.

381
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:55,935
Where are you going?

382
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,255
Let's look around more since we're here.

383
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,855
No one's coming anyway.

384
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,095
Let's just go.

385
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,935
Gosh, he's such a scaredy-cat.

386
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:42,815
What is it?

387
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,335
- What is it? What happened?
- Dong-soo.

388
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:48,207
Look at that...

389
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,015
I'm so sorry.

390
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:13,680
What are you trying to do?

391
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:25,815
But his boss has a lot of such issues.

392
00:28:26,212 --> 00:28:28,332
I hear he lives with a
bar hostess or something.

393
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,535
Kim Yoo-sung, was it?

394
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,527
Maybe he lives with a woman too young,

395
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:38,433
but he's said to be close to dying.

396
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:06,735
Attorney Han Dong-soo.

397
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,615
Who are you?

398
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,175
You know Do-young, don't you?

399
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,215
I'm in his gang. We're like family.

400
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:17,815
I have something to ask you.

401
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,415
I heard you two met recently.

402
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,175
What did you talk about?

403
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:28,415
Why would you want to know?

404
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,375
Just answer my question.

405
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,455
I was requested there.

406
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:38,415
As a lawyer who runs errands.

407
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,335
But I turned it down.

408
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,215
Why?

409
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,942
You said you're his family,
so you must know.

410
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,320
He looked down on me and was sarcastic.

411
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:51,455
I couldn't stand him.

412
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:05,495
What are you doing?

413
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,055
What is this?

414
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,670
You're a lawyer,

415
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,175
so you wouldn't go
around to collect interests.

416
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:24,535
I asked what this was.

417
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,855
The days my legal fees are paid.

418
00:30:32,015 --> 00:30:33,935
The clients who can't pay me at once...

419
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:35,695
...pay me in installments.

420
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:40,935
You can check if you can't trust me.

421
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,040
JANUARY

422
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:50,015
You must collect interest for real.

423
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,455
If you're done,

424
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:54,095
please get out.

425
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:00,095
I'll do that.

426
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:21,828
BEOM-JAE

427
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,015
Gosh. Hey.

428
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:40,240
- Who's in the house?
- Take a look.

429
00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:45,935
Wait. Doesn't that lady...

430
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:47,615
...only come on even-numbered days?

431
00:31:47,735 --> 00:31:50,255
I know! Why did she come today?

432
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,255
You should follow Park Je-yi.

433
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,455
I'll stay here...

434
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:01,775
...and call you once she leaves.

435
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:03,762
Then we can turn off the
security device and go in.

436
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:04,655
All right.

437
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:51,335
You have four days left.

438
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:02,935
You darn little rat!

439
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,335
Are you trying to take my money for free?

440
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:42,824
Dong-soo. Did she leave?

441
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,495
Not yet.

442
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,335
Turn off the security device.

443
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:48,855
I'll try going in.

444
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:50,295
Are you out of your mind?

445
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,255
We only have a day left.

446
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:54,135
We can't just keep waiting.

447
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,415
- Yes?
- Why is the service so bad there?

448
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,199
Park Je-yi is going home now.

449
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:38,959
She'll be there soon.

450
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:21,615
Dong-soo.

451
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:24,495
Let's just stop.

452
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,175
We've been following
her around for two weeks.

453
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,495
What difference will it make...

454
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,000
...even if we sit here
for a few more hours?

455
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,466
We can't guarantee...

456
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:38,120
...that we got something on the spy cams.

457
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,095
If we quit now, then what
about Seo Do-young?

458
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:45,935
We'll have to come up
with the money and return it.

459
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,535
Money isn't the problem here.

460
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:49,950
He won't be okay with it...

461
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:50,975
...even if we return the money.

462
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,855
Then what are we supposed to do?

463
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:19,735
This is driving me crazy.

464
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:25,135
What?

465
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,798
Oh, hey. It's me.

466
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:30,607
Your brother is okay, right?

467
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,455
What are you talking about?

468
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:34,655
About the interview he did last time.

469
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,255
I told the Yuseong Gang guys about it...

470
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,240
...because they kept bothering me.

471
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:41,335
He decided not to take it.

472
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:43,482
He has nothing to do with it,
so what's there to harm?

473
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:45,736
Then it's a relief.

474
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:49,285
By the way, would you want a part-time job?

475
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,055
Your mom suffering from Alzheimer's.

476
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,200
Your brother and your niece too.

477
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:15,255
Think of your wife at home.

478
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:26,375
Dong-soo!

479
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:28,015
Dong-soo!

480
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:30,735
Dong-soo!

481
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:34,575
Stop the car! Dong-soo!

482
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,655
Dong-soo!

483
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:48,775
She dropped by home for some business.

484
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,550
He called me urgently...

485
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:51,880
...because there won't be a driver later.

486
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,855
So I'll go.

487
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:56,175
No.

488
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,513
You should go and turn
off the security device.

489
00:37:58,695 --> 00:37:59,680
I'll go.

490
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:28,215
- Are you new?
- Sorry?

491
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:29,935
Oh, yes.

492
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,389
Your outfit is unusual.

493
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:09,735
Wait. Your key.

494
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,680
- Oh, right.
- Here.

495
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,255
You can leave that way.

496
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,335
You can grab a taxi on the main road.

497
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,655
I'm sorry.

498
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,855
Could I use your bathroom?

499
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:45,455
It's over there.

500
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,495
Hello.

501
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,055
Come here.

502
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:34,655
What are you doing?

503
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:39,616
There wasn't any toilet
paper in the bathroom.

504
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,495
If you're done,

505
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,279
could you leave?

506
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:46,135
I'm sorry.

507
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,575
What? What's going on?

508
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:34,615
What happened?

509
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,040
I'm asking you. What happened?

510
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:41,535
I found it.

511
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:46,095
Yes! Gosh.

512
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:50,375
And I couldn't get all the
spy cams since I was in a rush.

513
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,132
You should go and get the rest.

514
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:54,735
Okay. I will get it done.

515
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:53,335
Now that we've confirmed he's real,

516
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,495
he'll be caught on camera for sure.

517
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:01,175
You're home.

518
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:03,415
You're still awake?

519
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:06,015
I didn't get to see you for days.

520
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:08,255
Let me see your face.

521
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:15,255
What is it?

522
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,735
My colleague from the
same team is quitting.

523
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:24,149
She's pregnant.

524
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:28,775
I am going to give these to her.

525
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,575
Three years is long enough.

526
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:38,975
There's no spot left on
my stomach for a needle.

527
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:44,332
Get washed up before you go to bed.

528
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:08,015
What are you going to do?

529
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:10,295
Seo Do-young is getting out in two days.

530
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,535
Why? Are you anxious?

531
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,720
Come on!

532
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,990
That's not what I am saying.

533
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:17,615
You said you would put an end to it.

534
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:20,407
My men entered the prison the other day.

535
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,670
They are eating rice with beans...

536
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:24,335
...and waiting for my order.

537
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,038
You really can't make another mistake.

538
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:29,775
If we lose this chance,
we won't get another.

539
00:44:29,855 --> 00:44:31,175
Will you stop worrying?

540
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,935
I only chose the best guys.

541
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:36,613
Gosh, you.

542
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:38,560
You know, right?

543
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:41,790
How much we're going to get...

544
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,175
...once the construction kicks off.

545
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,519
Of course, I do. I will be good, sir.

546
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,175
Order me one more of this,

547
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,175
and I will be even better.

548
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,760
Please do, brother. Please.

549
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:57,260
Hey.

550
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:39,495
TURN LEFT WITH CAUTION

551
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:48,375
Hey, Seon-kyo.

552
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:51,655
Yuseong Gang suddenly called me...

553
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:53,790
...and started asking all
sorts of questions about you.

554
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:55,560
- What?
- Is there something going on?

555
00:45:57,615 --> 00:45:59,175
You better be careful for a while.

556
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:02,455
Seon-kyo, I will call you another time.

557
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,415
Come.

558
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:30,455
- It's cheap.
- I'll give you at a good price.

559
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,615
I'll get 20,000 won worth of sea squirt.

560
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:34,335
Come.

561
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,575
- Can I have that one instead?
- Okay.

562
00:46:37,655 --> 00:46:39,175
What are you looking for?

563
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,935
- Right.
- Here you go.

564
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,215
Thank you.

565
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,335
Goodness, it's cheap.

566
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,615
Here. Buy some of this.

567
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:48,095
I will give you a big discount.

568
00:46:48,495 --> 00:46:50,815
It's delicious.

569
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,495
- Goodness.
- Passing through.

570
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:55,375
Move.

571
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:07,301
PRISON WITH BEAUTIFUL
SCENERY AND BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

572
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,015
We're closing in ten minutes.

573
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:27,695
You are late.

574
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,015
I know.

575
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:33,255
I have never been late...

576
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,735
...to a client meeting.

577
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,325
I had to lose someone on the way.

578
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:41,438
Someone who seems to really hate you.

579
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:44,852
Thanks to you, I'm very tired these days.

580
00:47:46,535 --> 00:47:47,535
Did you find it?

581
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:03,375
Whatever you see, you will find...

582
00:48:03,535 --> 00:48:05,335
...the man you are looking for.

583
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:09,655
But the black one has...

584
00:48:10,895 --> 00:48:12,495
...additional information.

585
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:21,455
At first, I didn't want to give it to you.

586
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:23,215
You lied to me.

587
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,741
But I am not like you.

588
00:48:29,215 --> 00:48:30,615
When I make a promise...

589
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:32,975
...to my client,

590
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:35,135
I make sure to keep it.

591
00:48:41,575 --> 00:48:43,175
I'll be outside.

592
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,636
MISSED CALL

593
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:14,975
11 MISSED CALLS, BEOM-JAE

594
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:26,975
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

595
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,575
What's up with the weather?

596
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,495
Beom-jae.

597
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:00,535
Han Beom-jae!

598
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:19,375
Gosh, where did he go?

599
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,520
He's not picking up his phone.

600
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,295
And...

601
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,080
...I couldn't get all the spy
cams since I was in a rush.

602
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:31,615
You should go and get the rest.

603
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:04,696
Do-young received his verdict.

604
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:06,855
He won't be released.

605
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:09,215
Are you sure?

606
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:11,775
Darn it. Don't you trust me?

607
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,175
I'm scared.

608
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:18,375
He should know by now that we drugged him.

609
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,615
We failed that day.
That's why I'm scared.

610
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:23,936
Stop worrying, will you?

611
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:28,535
You think I will just watch you die?

612
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:09,975
You're here.

613
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:20,855
You rat.

614
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:43,055
Beom-jae.

615
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:16,775
Beom-jae, are you here?

616
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,295
Dong-soo.

617
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:28,975
What are you doing here?

618
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:14,695
It could've been really bad.

619
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:16,072
Let's get going.

620
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:25,175
How long were you there for?

621
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:27,375
I don't know.
About two, three hours I think.

622
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,360
That's a long time.
You must be hungry.

623
00:55:29,775 --> 00:55:30,735
Let's go outside and...

624
00:55:34,135 --> 00:55:35,175
Did you leave?

625
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:37,975
We should drink on a day like this.

626
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,295
Darn it.

627
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:50,735
Yes. I feel better.

628
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:54,135
Now that I think Seo Do-young is dead.

629
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
Okay. Hurry.

630
00:56:07,095 --> 00:56:08,855
Seo Do-young must be dead.

631
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:13,935
What do we do?

632
00:56:15,735 --> 00:56:16,815
First...

633
00:56:19,095 --> 00:56:20,415
Let's get out of here.

634
00:57:05,895 --> 00:57:06,775
What?

635
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,455
What is it? What?

636
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:18,975
What could it be?

637
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:44,655
Long time no see, sis.

638
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:48,415
Wait. You're with another man now.

639
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,100
MkvDrama.Org

640
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:44,735
EVILIVE

641
01:00:45,415 --> 01:00:47,335
So what am I supposed to do?

642
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:49,495
Seo Do-young has to
get arrested for us to live.

643
01:00:49,655 --> 01:00:52,135
A person died.
A person.

644
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:54,775
Let's fight, then.

645
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,255
It's all in here, right?

646
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:58,015
Looks like you're here to report something.

647
01:00:58,095 --> 01:00:59,935
Are you in a difficult situation?

648
01:01:00,015 --> 01:01:01,935
Please. Let me go.

649
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:04,255
Maybe we will become
Seo Do-young's toy forever.

650
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:06,495
Legal advisor.
It sounds cool.

651
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:07,815
Let's be friends.

652
01:01:07,895 --> 01:01:09,215
We will do a double move.

653
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:11,375
I will call you when
I confirm the location.
