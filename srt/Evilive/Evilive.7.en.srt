00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:30,065
EVILIVE

PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY

ALL FIGURES, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,082
INCIDENTS, GROUPS, OCCUPATIONS, AND OTHERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS.

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,731
<i>We're going to make...</i>

7
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,676
<i>the world's biggest gambling</i>
<i>house on the Internet.</i>

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,156
<i>He tried to kill us</i>
<i>only a few days ago.</i>

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,796
<i>And you'll work with him?</i>

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,916
<i>But under one condition.</i>

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,516
<i>After this, it will be over between us.</i>

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,716
<i>The target sales will be one billion won.</i>

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,836
<i>How can we increase</i>
<i>the sales by fivefold...</i>

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,956
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,236
<i>I wouldn't have started it</i>
<i>if I were to make the same amount.</i>

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,116
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>the server crashed.</i>

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,316
<i>It's like everyone's trying</i>
<i>to access the site at once.</i>

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>We're getting flooded with calls</i>
<i>about currency exchange inquiries.</i>

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,792
<i>We both received double</i>
<i>the amount promised.</i>

20
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,076
<i>- That means...</i>
<i>- The sales must be twice higher.</i>

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,396
<i>We worked hard for nothing.</i>

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,876
<i>Did you look into why Han Dong-soo...</i>

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,516
<i>...and Seo Do-young joined hands?</i>

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,596
<i>First, stop Seo Do-young's money source.</i>

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,116
<i>So he can't move.</i>

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,276
<i>Are you sure?</i>

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,316
<i>That we can avoid the</i>
<i>inspection within five minutes?</i>

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,170
<i>You don't have to worry about it.</i>

29
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:24,636
<i>You never know.</i>

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,736
<i>I need to check on that...</i>

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,990
<i>...to be able to keep my word.</i>

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,756
<i>Are you going to search the office</i>
<i>without a warrant?</i>

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,996
<i>Let them in.</i>

34
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,996
<i>Will it take longer?</i>

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,276
<i>The carrier just left.</i>

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,276
<i>Attorney Han, this actually worked.</i>

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,156
<i>I heard that the Family Gang members...</i>

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,636
<i>...are making a move</i>
<i>on Attorney Han Dong-soo.</i>

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,356
<i>I definitely heard it.</i>

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,676
<i>I never miss out on anything I pick.</i>

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,076
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,516
<i>Is what we talked about last time...</i>

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,610
<i>...still valid?</i>

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,316
<i>You will go after Kim Jae-yeol,</i>

45
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,440
<i>and I'll go after Moon Sang-guk.</i>

46
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,815
LEE HYE-JA

47
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,852
Got a lot of work?

48
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:20,974
You look exhausted.

49
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,762
Right.

50
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:34,341
Tough days come in life.

51
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:37,912
I also...

52
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:41,192
...struggled a lot in life.

53
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,512
I used to work at a sewing factory.

54
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:50,112
I made bags...

55
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,952
...and clothes.

56
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:56,192
I spent...

57
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,632
...all my youth working there.

58
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,458
Why did you do that?

59
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,672
You should've had delicious food...

60
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,392
...and gone to nice places too.

61
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,312
Because I have a son.

62
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,042
I gave birth to him,

63
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:14,632
but he practically grew up alone.

64
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,152
My heart breaks at the thought of him.

65
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:28,192
He had good grades in school too.

66
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,592
But because of a scholarship,

67
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:34,352
I couldn't send him to a faraway college.

68
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:40,272
Still, he made it big.

69
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,792
An attorney.

70
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:00,432
Hello?

71
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:12,338
LEE HYE-JA

72
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:23,472
All right.

73
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:27,512
I'm coming.

74
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,552
Darn it.

75
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:40,992
Darn.

76
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:44,112
Do-young.

77
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,903
I already paid you.

78
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,437
Why are you doing this to me?

79
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,858
What, a gambling house?

80
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:54,178
Fine, darn it. I won't do it.

81
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,898
I'll back off.

82
00:05:55,922 --> 00:06:00,072
I was going to hand it
all over to you anyway.

83
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,792
I'm telling you.

84
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,032
What is wrong with him?

85
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:13,744
What?

86
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:16,752
What, you punk?

87
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,416
Darn.

88
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,022
What in the...

89
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,472
You little...

90
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,028
Help.

91
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,752
Help me.

92
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,312
Help.

93
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,107
Get him out.

94
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,112
Call in those who started the fire.

95
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:59,681
Darn...

96
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,445
Moon Sang-guk and Kim Jae-yeol.

97
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,672
What's their relationship like?

98
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:14,982
They're like us.

99
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,112
An attorney and a client.

100
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,578
Kim Jae-yeol needed a back-up.

101
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:23,392
Moon Sang-guk needed a handyman.

102
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,552
They satisfy each other's interests.

103
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,312
What got you on Moon Sang-guk's bad side?

104
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:37,872
When I was a law office manager,

105
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:40,512
a female employee...

106
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,392
...embezzled company money and ran off,

107
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,512
but it was actually political money.

108
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:49,792
That woman was...

109
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,432
...Moon Sang-guk's money carrier...

110
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:54,872
...and girlfriend.

111
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,512
Yes.

112
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,352
No.

113
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:04,232
Help me, Mr. Han.

114
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,312
One day, I got a call from her.

115
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,632
She asked for help.

116
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,552
After a few days of agonizing,

117
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,632
I reported it to the papers.

118
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,578
Because of it, Moon Sang-guk...

119
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,632
gave up on running
for the general election.

120
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:26,312
Why did you do that?

121
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,472
She had nothing to do with you.

122
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,738
I'm not sure.

123
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,992
I couldn't turn a blind eye.

124
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:42,072
Was her name Park Ji-eun?

125
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,472
Yang-ho took care of her...

126
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,072
...under Kim Jae-yeol's order.

127
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,832
Push harder, you punk.

128
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:06,712
It's all done.

129
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,378
Of course, Moon Sang-guk...

130
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:25,232
...planned it.

131
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:27,752
Like the fire at the nursing home.

132
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:32,112
But I bet that wasn't all.

133
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,632
It won't be easy...

134
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:42,312
...to get Moon Sang-guk
and Kim Jae-yeol apart.

135
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,832
They know each other too well.

136
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:49,032
It might rather make things easy.

137
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:52,821
Once they're cornered,

138
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,835
they'll only care about themselves.

139
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,312
Let's come up with something.

140
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:31,007
EVILIVE

141
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,334
EPISODE 7

142
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,945
DO NOT ENTER

143
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,338
Oh, hello.

144
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,778
What happened?

145
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:51,143
It seems to have been thrown to the sea...

146
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,858
but got caught in a tree.

147
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:55,858
People found it at low tide.

148
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,578
Did you identify the victim?

149
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,258
She was born in 1974.

150
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,178
The name is Park Je-yi.

151
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,832
Park Je-yi?

152
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:05,498
Do you know her?

153
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:09,272
Hey, punk. You got her missing report.

154
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,058
Oh, right. Misty Purple?

155
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:16,098
"Oh, right?" Goodness.

156
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:18,912
We better meet Yuseong Gang's boss first.

157
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,738
Kim Yu-seong and Park
Je-yi were practically married.

158
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,218
I'll investigate the case
with him as a suspect.

159
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,178
No wonder why I got a feeling...

160
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,338
that this was a crime of passion.

161
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:29,218
A crime of passion, my foot.

162
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,032
He can't even hold a spoon.

163
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,498
He had a stroke.

164
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:35,232
I mean, Yuseong Gang's boss.

165
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:38,112
Who is it now then?

166
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,832
Yuseong Gang's boss.

167
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:49,098
There was an illegal
gambling house report recently.

168
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,938
The whole of Team Two
was dispatched, remember?

169
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,738
That was Yuseong Gang.

170
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:56,752
Seo Do-young was in the President's Office.

171
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:58,738
After his release from prison,

172
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:02,472
he became number one from number two.

173
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:16,578
A WOMAN IN HER 30S WAS
FOUND DEAD IN MOUNT YUAK

174
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,098
What is this?

175
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,578
It's Park Je-yi.

176
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,338
The day Seo Do-young left prison,

177
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:24,818
she went missing with Heo Yang-ho.

178
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,722
They were lovers.

179
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,818
Heo Yang-ho and Seo Do-young were...

180
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,392
...fighting over the gang.

181
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:36,618
I told the police to
investigate it quickly.

182
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,098
And you gave me the record...

183
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:41,378
of Han Dong-soo visiting Seo Do-young.

184
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:42,578
That's right.

185
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:45,978
One for murder and the
other for abetting murder.

186
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:47,632
That's not bad.

187
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,618
Those scumbags made
political money illegally...

188
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:52,698
and gave it to Park Choong-ho.

189
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,658
Will it be possible?

190
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,712
The prosecution and I will do the work.

191
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,272
You just get the money ready.

192
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:03,498
The gambling house isn't doing well.

193
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,458
Shouldn't you run the marine casino?

194
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:08,858
Mr. Kim, it's almost settled.

195
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,512
You becoming a Minister of Justice?

196
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,192
Soon,

197
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:14,192
I'll hear good news.

198
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,418
Attorney Han is waiting at the office.

199
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,832
Why?

200
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,098
I'm not sure about the details.

201
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,952
Anyway, he says it's to secure funds.

202
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:36,458
There has been quite an
increase in money exchangers.

203
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:40,698
At this rate, it won't be
easy to secure game money.

204
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:44,112
Thus, I've decided we need a safety net.

205
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:45,298
GAME OF CARDS

206
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:49,112
A number of our men
enter a designated room.

207
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,352
Of course, they can see each other's cards.

208
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:57,232
But one player is oblivious of it.

209
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,732
GAME OF CARDS

210
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:07,952
Lucky me. A card each.

211
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,712
Oh, dear.

212
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,312
A card each.

213
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,098
- One go.
- Gosh.

214
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,618
This is fun.

215
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:20,592
All right, here I go.

216
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:25,752
Okay. Three go.

217
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,112
Four go.

218
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,352
How exciting.

219
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,072
Goodness.

220
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,293
This is a dummy room.

221
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:44,778
Instead of buying game
money, we'll take it from them.

222
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,952
By making one a dummy.

223
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:48,978
Right.

224
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,698
It'll be easier to supply money,

225
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:52,952
let alone cost reduction.

226
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,992
A money exchange service along with this...

227
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,112
...will make the sales...

228
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,672
...hike up, of course.

229
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,418
Is this the only way?

230
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,952
Must we work with Seo Do-young?

231
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:20,272
You already know the answer.

232
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,882
We barely escaped from him.

233
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,378
We have no choice.

234
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,058
We have to be on his side...

235
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:35,072
until we get Moon Sang-guk.

236
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,898
Once we get him, are
you sure you'll end it...

237
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,472
with Seo Do-young?

238
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:55,992
It's good to have you back, Beom-jae.

239
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,032
I was so sad when you said you'd quit.

240
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,432
Anyway, why did you
call off the emigration?

241
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,578
Things happened.

242
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,578
We're putting it off for a bit.

243
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:07,818
Good thinking.

244
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:10,058
It's not easy to find a
job like this, you know.

245
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:14,992
But Attorney Han has
become a lot more enthusiastic.

246
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:18,152
That dummy room idea is brilliant.

247
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,432
I like that idea.

248
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,592
That's good to hear.

249
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:39,872
Anyway, Park Je-yi...

250
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,792
Wouldn't Moon Sang-guk and Kim Jae-yeol...

251
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,512
be aware of it?

252
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,472
Don't worry. We just
have to make a move first.

253
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:54,632
It will be done tonight.

254
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:04,092
SHINNAM FERRY'S WAREHOUSE

255
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:14,082
Come.

256
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:22,258
Hurry up.

257
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,432
And don't make any mistakes to the end.

258
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,138
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,732
YUSEONG MIRAE CONSULTING

260
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,192
Gosh.

261
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:38,618
What? Who are you?

262
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:41,472
- Goodness.
- Get in.

263
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:57,652
MOON LAW FIRM

264
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,178
I'm going out to give Min-hee a ride.

265
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:26,098
Okay.

266
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,698
I'm off to school.

267
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,858
Have fun.

268
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,592
See you.

269
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,912
Yes?

270
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,498
Hello?

271
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,938
Did you get them?

272
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,592
Gosh, what are all these?

273
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,392
Come in those for your
first time on the mound.

274
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,938
Hello.

275
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:23,203
I'm Detective Ma
of Shinnam Police Station.

276
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,578
- Hello.
- Since when were those here?

277
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:28,352
We change shifts at 7 a.m.

278
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,498
These were here even before then.

279
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,658
How strange.

280
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:32,938
A murder case yesterday...

281
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:34,698
...and a theft case
of smuggled goods today.

282
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,298
Suddenly, in Shinnam, cases are...

283
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,098
Stop with the nonsense.

284
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,858
Go keep people under control.

285
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,378
Could we check the security camera footage?

286
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:44,192
Of course, this way.

287
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,858
<i>Illegally smuggled goods</i>
<i>worth a billion won...</i>

288
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,898
<i>were found in the middle of downtown.</i>

289
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,178
<i>The smuggled goods</i>
<i>included bear gallbladders,</i>

290
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,778
<i>musk and even hemp,</i>

291
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:56,218
<i>and the trucks were parked</i>
<i>in front of Moon Law Firm.</i>

292
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,738
<i>According to the car register,</i>

293
00:20:57,762 --> 00:21:01,032
<i>the trucks turned out to be</i>
<i>owned by Shinnam Ferry.</i>

294
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:04,138
They can never find...

295
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,978
any proof that the goods belong to Mr. Kim.

296
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:09,192
If the police summon him, tell him to go...

297
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:12,658
...and cooperate with the
investigation honorably.

298
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:15,672
I'll stop the search
warrant from being issued,

299
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,512
so tell him not to worry.

300
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:21,738
Father, who could've done this?

301
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,018
Can't you tell?

302
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,618
It's a message sent from Han Dong-soo...

303
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,938
...in league with that darn thug.

304
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,778
That he'll trample on Kim Jae-yeol...

305
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,672
...on his way above me.

306
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:33,792
He took the initiative to reveal...

307
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:37,152
...my connection with Kim
Jae-yeol to the public.

308
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,312
Will it be all right, Father?

309
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:43,272
I'll let them know...

310
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:47,072
...that they chose the wrong target.

311
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:50,792
I'll just trample on them harder.

312
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,372
MOON LAW FIRM

313
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,272
This is Moon Sang-guk.

314
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,792
See me for a bit.

315
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:21,632
No footage was recorded?

316
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,272
Right, the camera outside was broken.

317
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,032
It's being repaired.

318
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,061
Gosh.

319
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,218
They said the CCTV camera was broken.

320
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:38,098
A company this big...

321
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:40,178
...didn't do a thing about a broken camera?

322
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,418
For now, try to secure...

323
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,578
...the camera footage near Shinnam Ferry.

324
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,058
Everything, including nearby roads.

325
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:46,178
Sure.

326
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,538
I'll go visit Shinnam Ferry.

327
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,458
I doubt you'll find anything there.

328
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,938
The president of that company is...

329
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:54,458
...the chairman of the
Shinnam Regional Committee.

330
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:56,112
You know that, right?

331
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,232
No.

332
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,912
Yes, sir.

333
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,072
Now?

334
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:08,298
- Please say a word.
- Sir.

335
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:10,338
- Tell us.
- Just a moment.

336
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:12,178
- Sir.
- Mr. Kim.

337
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:13,418
Is it true?

338
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:15,658
- Sir.
- Is the news report true?

339
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:17,218
The trucks found in front of Moon Law Firm.

340
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,578
Is it true they belong to Shinnam Ferry?

341
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:21,512
What do you say about the
illegal smuggling suspicion?

342
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:23,712
Let me say just one word.

343
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,018
The trucks found this morning...

344
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,432
...do belong to Shinnam Ferry.

345
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,272
But they had all been stolen.

346
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,418
I'm curious myself...

347
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:36,178
...as to know who...

348
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,738
...is slandering Shinnam Ferry.

349
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:40,218
Why they are trying to ruin...

350
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:42,792
...the economy in Shinnam as a whole.

351
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:45,472
I'll make sure to get
to the bottom of this.

352
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:47,378
- Is that true?
- Excuse me, sir.

353
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:49,744
- Please tell us more.
- Sir.

354
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,812
Kim Jae-yeol went inside just now.

355
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,672
Send the Family Gang
members to Han Dong-soo.

356
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:20,062
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

357
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,938
They're here to turn themselves in...

358
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:30,672
...regarding the Shinnam
Nursing Home fire case.

359
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:37,842
PEOPLE'S POLICE TRUE TO THE BASICS

360
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,738
Hello, Mr. Kim.

361
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:42,858
It must've been hard coming here.

362
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:43,938
Where's Chief Kim?

363
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,592
He'll be here soon.

364
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,418
He stepped outside briefly to do business.

365
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,778
Reporters are watching,

366
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:53,698
so it's better he comes
at a different time.

367
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:55,098
What about Park Je-yi's case?

368
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:56,818
I told you to make a story with it.

369
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,578
Well... All of a sudden,

370
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:01,672
this smuggling goods case popped up.

371
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:05,778
I'm sorry, sir.

372
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:08,498
When Chief Kim comes
back, I'll put in a word.

373
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:10,418
Make sure you move swiftly.

374
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,943
You know, right?

375
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,898
The key point is...

376
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,658
to get Seo Do-young involved.

377
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,192
Yes, sir.

378
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,112
It's Chief Kim.

379
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:23,832
Hello, sir.

380
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:29,352
Chief Kim.

381
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,112
Pardon? But...

382
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:36,232
Follow the procedure.

383
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,618
Without any special treatment...

384
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,672
...just like other suspects.

385
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:45,218
You're admirable indeed.

386
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:47,672
He's a true example of the police.

387
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:51,938
Stagnant water is bound to rot.

388
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,778
Mr. Seo, young people like you...

389
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,512
...should renew Shinnam, okay?

390
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:02,658
Welcome.

391
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,512
This is the president of
Shinnam Bank I mentioned.

392
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:09,752
I'm Seo Do-young.

393
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,792
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:31,978
When is Chief Kim coming?

395
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:34,992
Something suddenly came up with him.

396
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,392
Get me a cup of coffee.

397
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,032
Oh, and...

398
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,138
...you know, the record of Han Dong-soo...

399
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:47,058
...visiting Seo Do-young.
Take a close look at it...

400
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:49,272
...and use it to make a
story with Je-yi's case.

401
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:51,512
Yes, sir.

402
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:03,578
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

403
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:06,792
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

404
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,952
It's me.

405
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,512
Quickly send Hae-jun here for me.

406
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:13,818
I told you.

407
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,298
Everything...

408
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:18,095
...was an order from Kim
Jae-yeol of Shinnam Ferry.

409
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,709
Are you sure it was Kim Jae-yeol's order?

410
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:23,898
I told our attorney...

411
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,018
...the exact time and location.

412
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,832
There's evidence too.

413
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:30,432
Is it a special day today?

414
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:35,672
Order me a bowl of hangover soup.

415
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:38,392
I skipped a meal to come here.

416
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:48,632
- You are...
- I'm Attorney Han Dong-soo.

417
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,058
Mr. Kim Jae-yeol.

418
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,778
You'll be added another suspicion...

419
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:58,272
...besides smuggling.

420
00:27:58,322 --> 00:28:01,378
My clients started a fire at
Shinnam Nursing Home...

421
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:02,938
and they turned themselves in.

422
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:06,072
As the abettor behind this arson,

423
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:08,298
they pointed at you.

424
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:09,992
What are you saying?

425
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,672
I abetted the arson?

426
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:13,942
Oh, gosh.

427
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:17,298
According to my clients' statements,

428
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,178
at 4 p.m., three days before the fire...

429
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:22,338
...at the Shinnam Ferry office,

430
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:26,152
you ordered them to commit the arson.

431
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:30,792
You specify the name, Lee Hye-ja,

432
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:34,312
and told them to disguise
her death as an accident.

433
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:38,072
Aren't you an attorney yourself?

434
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,058
They're just thugs.

435
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:41,538
What they said can't be evidence.

436
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,592
The judge won't buy it.

437
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:47,712
I never said they were thugs.

438
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,672
Do you know them?

439
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:54,138
Figures. Otherwise,

440
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:57,712
they wouldn't know these details.

441
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,338
You'll have to be arrested.

442
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:15,098
You abetted setting a residence on fire,

443
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,098
which caused casualties.

444
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,618
With aggravating factors added...

445
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,872
...such as intentionality,
deliberation, and so on,

446
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:23,032
you'll be sentenced to life imprisonment.

447
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:27,058
As for smuggling, since you're an expert,

448
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:29,472
you'd know the sentence wouldn't be long.

449
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,192
Make a choice.

450
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,618
You had me over with smuggling...

451
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,952
...to get me with arson?

452
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,072
Did you just...

453
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:50,792
...set a trap for me?

454
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:53,912
You better hurry and confess...

455
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:57,392
...that Moon Sang-guk abetted the arson.

456
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,298
If you drag time,

457
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,392
you'll face harm.

458
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,992
You don't want the whole house thing...

459
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:07,738
...to come to light, do you?

460
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,312
Park Je-yi.

461
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:11,232
Heo Yang-ho.

462
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:14,032
You killed them, didn't you?

463
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,378
Is that why you joined hands?

464
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:22,552
Did you plan it while
visiting Do-young in prison?

465
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:35,872
You're digging your own grave.

466
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:42,632
Kim Yu-seong.

467
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:46,232
Do you know why he became like that?

468
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,912
It's Seo Do-young's doing.

469
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:53,738
Do you know what happens
if you're by Do-young's side?

470
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:56,843
When you're by his side,
you become one of the two.

471
00:30:58,242 --> 00:30:59,578
A fool...

472
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:01,672
...or a corpse.

473
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:09,658
How can you do this without an attorney?

474
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,112
Gosh.

475
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,872
Gosh, that idiot.

476
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,912
Darn it.

477
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,632
Hey.

478
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:35,776
Oh.

479
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,778
It was you, Attorney Han.

480
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:39,738
I received a tip.

481
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:42,352
I thought it might assist
in the investigation.

482
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,592
I see. Thank you.

483
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,338
Han Dong-soo is the attorney you know?

484
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:10,192
Yes. He's my neighbor.

485
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:12,258
Do you know him well?

486
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:14,298
He's famous in Shinnam.

487
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:16,298
He's a livelihood lawyer...

488
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:18,432
...who does business with
petty criminals in prison.

489
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,532
KIM JAE-YEOL'S ARREST WARRANT EXECUTION

490
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:52,152
It suits you well.

491
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,898
Kim Jae-yeol's arrest warrant is out.

492
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,938
It seems he didn't mention
Moon Sang-guk yet.

493
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:00,832
He only admitted to smuggling.

494
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:04,232
He's trying to buy time, I guess.

495
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,978
I met the bank president.

496
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:10,112
To recover all the loans
from Shinnam Ferry.

497
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,632
Once money dries up, they
will come to their senses.

498
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:17,378
Let's also monitor Kim
Jae-yeol's warehouse.

499
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:19,218
Before the raid,

500
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:21,378
he will deal with the
remaining smuggled goods.

501
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:24,112
If we capture that, he'll
receive heavier penalties.

502
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,952
Let's do that, then,
since we're at it anyway.

503
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:42,672
Father.

504
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:46,338
Mr. Kim can handle the
smuggling from his end.

505
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:47,658
But the nursing home is...

506
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:50,592
Stop talking nonsense and leave.

507
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:52,752
Okay.

508
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:09,792
How's the sales these days?

509
00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:11,578
They've been good, sir.

510
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:13,752
The dummy room played an important part.

511
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:17,392
Get as much money as you can.

512
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,952
Shinnam Ferry.

513
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,152
I am going to buy it up.

514
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,612
SHINNAM GANGS

515
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,858
BAE JONG-HA, LEADER OF FAMILY GANG

516
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,612
SHINNAM NURSING HOME ARSON

517
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,738
KIM JAE-YEOL, ARSON SUSPECT

518
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,698
SMUGGLING TRUCK

00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,418
MOON LAW FIRM

520
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,012
DEFENDS KIM JAE-YEOL

521
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:00,058
BODY FOUND ON THE BEACH NEAR MOUNT YUAK

522
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:01,892
KIM YU-SEONG, LEADER OF YUSEONG GANG

523
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,872
The current leader of the
Yuseong Gang I asked about.

524
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:26,232
Do you know where that guy is living now?

525
00:35:26,802 --> 00:35:27,947
No.

526
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:30,872
The house where Park Je-yi used to live.

527
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,592
After Park Je-yi disappeared,

528
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:36,552
it seems like he started
serving Kim Yu-seong.

529
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,292
HAN DONG-SOO

530
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:46,658
Why did you connect
Attorney Han Dong-soo...

531
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:49,178
...to Seo Do-young's side?

532
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:50,578
Hey.

533
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,778
You're not the only one working hard.

534
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:55,938
When I was investigating
the Park Je-yi case,

535
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,858
I saw Han Dong-soo acting as...

536
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:01,752
...Seo Do-young's legal counsel.

537
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:07,312
So you're saying...

538
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:11,138
that Han Dong-soo, who
was Seo Do-young's counsel...

539
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:14,352
...is now defending Family
Gang, who accused...

540
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:16,338
Kim Jae-yeol of being the arsonist?

541
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:19,058
Yes. Han Dong-soo's mother passed away...

542
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:21,778
...due to the fire
caused by the Family Gang.

543
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:24,538
Isn't that really strange?
Unbelievable, right?

544
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:27,018
This guy. Heo Yang-ho.

545
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:30,138
He's missing too.

546
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:34,152
He was the guy competing with Seo Do-young.

547
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:38,232
Smuggling isn't what's important.

548
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,532
HAN DONG-SOO

549
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:57,332
SEO DO-YOUNG

550
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,332
SHINNAM FERRY

551
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:42,152
That place seems like the base.

552
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:43,898
They must be in a hurry.

553
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,032
They're selling at half the price.

554
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,192
We need to meet Kim Jae-yeol.

555
00:38:53,162 --> 00:38:54,418
If it's revealed he attempted
evidence tampering...

556
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:55,778
...while in custody,

557
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:59,072
he will have to serve at
least three more years.

558
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:02,792
We should use this as leverage.

559
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,352
Let's do that.

560
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,418
These are the new accounts.

561
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:30,512
Hand it over to the Clean Team.

562
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,392
We're going to double the
number of dummy rooms.

563
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:39,778
This is too many.

564
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:41,578
Not everyone in the
Clean Team is our people.

565
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:42,818
If we get caught...

566
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:44,952
You know Shinnam Ferry, right?

567
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:46,658
We are taking it over.

568
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:49,258
Coax the Clean Team into doing it...

569
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:52,112
...or expand the customer base
if you have to.

570
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:01,898
What is he saying?

571
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:04,338
What do they want from
taking over Shinnam Ferry?

572
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:07,658
He wants to become the real CEO.

573
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:09,058
He wants to wipe out the gangster life...

574
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,578
...and reset his life.

575
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:12,152
Gosh.

576
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:20,552
Hello.

577
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:22,472
Right.

578
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:31,258
Thank you.

579
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:32,378
You better do a good job.

580
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:35,738
I do my job well, sir.

581
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,632
Don't you worry.

582
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:42,538
Excuse me.

583
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:44,072
Gosh.

584
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:50,632
Let go!

585
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:53,778
What are you doing?

586
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,698
Why are you here?

587
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:58,018
What? Can't I go to an Internet cafe?

588
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:01,312
Stop trying to fool me, will you?

589
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:05,058
Tell me honestly. You're
the withdrawal man. Right?

590
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:07,272
That's why you left the shop. Am I right?

591
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,032
What are you talking about?

592
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:12,382
You can tell me, man.

593
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:14,952
I'm a withdrawal man too.

594
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:21,218
It's only for a short while.

595
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,338
I am quitting soon.

596
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:24,218
Are you out of your
mind? This is easy money.

597
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:26,658
We go straight to jail if we get caught.

598
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,472
You are such a coward.

599
00:41:29,642 --> 00:41:33,272
Wait. Have you played Game of Cards?

600
00:41:36,242 --> 00:41:38,658
You better create an account right away.

601
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:40,272
Do you see it?

602
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:43,152
All from yesterday. I
earned it in just three hours.

603
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:47,538
That's gambling. Not a game.

604
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:48,978
Precisely.

605
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:51,592
Who knows? Maybe I'll hit the jackpot.

606
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:59,732
CIVIL SERVICE OFFICE

607
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,272
Are you going to meet Mr. Kim?

608
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,818
Why?

609
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:09,498
Are you going to coax him...

610
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:11,632
...into removing my father this time?

611
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,858
How did you know?

612
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:16,392
Goodness.

613
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:19,432
You seem a bit confused,

614
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:22,752
but it wasn't you who
got Kim Jae-yeol into jail.

615
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:25,032
It was my father.

616
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:28,592
Just go in.

617
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:31,072
Sir.

618
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:32,698
It will only be a month at the most.

619
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,298
I will get you out before then,

620
00:42:34,322 --> 00:42:35,418
so just go in.

621
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:36,818
But sir.

622
00:42:36,842 --> 00:42:39,298
<i>My friend became the Prosecutor General.</i>

623
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:40,738

624

It's only a matter of time
before Han Dong-soo...

625
00:42:42,682 --> 00:42:44,338
...and that gangster
are implicated in murder.

626
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,143
Even if Chief Kim sided with them...

627
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,378
because of Park Choong-ho,

628
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:49,258
we're on a winning streak,

629
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:50,872
so don't worry.

630
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:54,818
Did you think working with a gangster...

631
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,592
...would change anything?

632
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:58,432
Gosh.

633
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,672
You're just a horse.

634
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,592
You play around in someone
else's game your whole life.

635
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:10,112
Good luck.

Kim Jae-yeol has been

645
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,018
It seems like the police
are trying to get you...

646
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,112
...involved in Park Je-yi case.

647
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:54,872
What is Chief Kim doing?

648
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:56,578
It seems like the instruction is...

649
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:57,858
...coming directly from the prosecution.

650
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,792

Any word from Mr. Moon?

658
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:55,392
Is he being arrogant now
that he moved me here?

659
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:58,032
He didn't visit me once.

660
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:02,178
We must find Yang-ho's body.

661
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,578
That will make it clear...

662
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:06,832
...that it was Seo Do-young's doing.

663
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:10,192

668

...I've put in so far, right?

672

Chief contacted me.

673

The money is all prepared.

674
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,538
I'll be heading to Seoul shortly.

675
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:04,552
Does that mean you
will become the minister?

676
00:46:05,802 --> 00:46:08,272
You need to regain your honor too.

677
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:09,992

But it doesnt feel right.

690
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:22,112
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

691
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:26,992
Seo Do-young is taking over Shinnam Ferry.

692
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:29,872

693
00:47:30,802 --> 00:47:32,818
Don't fool yourself.

694
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:36,072
Seo Do-young is using you, not helping you.

695
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:39,232
So what?

696
00:47:40,602 --> 00:47:42,632
To catch Moon Sang-guk,

697
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,352

700
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,712
It might rather make things easy.

701
00:48:40,515 --> 00:48:41,652
Once they're cornered,

702
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:43,626
they'll only care about themselves.

703
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:03,952
Do-young.

704
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,352
About Moon Sang-guk.

705
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:12,938
Getting Kim Jae-yeol out
might not be what he's after.

706
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:14,898
Kim Jae-yeol is suspected of smuggling...

707
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:17,178
...and instigating arson.

708
00:49:17,202 --> 00:49:19,232
What use could he be?

709
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:21,672
So?

710
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,832
He might have got the
man out to abandon him.

711
00:49:25,682 --> 00:49:27,232

Have one.

do you trust Moon Sang-guk?

723
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:48,792
Did you side with Seo
Do-young because you trust him?

724
00:50:52,362 --> 00:50:54,912
I know.

725
00:50:55,162 --> 00:50:58,872
All my life, I am to do all his dirty work.

726
00:50:59,802 --> 00:51:02,538
But he still got me out of prison.

727
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:06,312
Moon Sang-guk is the
man who keeps his promise.

728
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:12,432
He promised to get you out of prison.

729
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:15,792
It might not mean he is
going to keep you alive.

730
00:51:22,402 --> 00:51:23,734
The remaining smuggled goods are...

731
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:25,378
...being released on the market.

732
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:27,312
At half price.

733
00:51:33,162 --> 00:51:36,672
I naturally thought it was your order.

734
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:42,218
But I thought perhaps not.

735
00:51:42,242 --> 00:51:44,578
The stop of the execution
order is just tomorrow.

736
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,672
Why would you accept a loss like this?

737
00:51:50,522 --> 00:51:52,458
Without Moon Sang-guk's instructions,

738
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,072
it couldn't have happened.

739
00:51:58,002 --> 00:51:59,832
I think you know...

740
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:03,432
...Moon Sang-guk better than anyone else.

741
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:07,498
And I think you know well...

742
00:52:07,522 --> 00:52:10,272
...what decision
Moon Sang-guk might make...

743
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:13,272
...at this timing.

744
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:29,412
GENERAL WARD A

745
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,912
Yong-chan, you...

746
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:08,952
Yes, sir. It's Yong-chan.

747
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:12,272
I took care of the
remaining smuggled goods.

748
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:15,072
Good job.

749
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:18,632
<i>Where should I take the money to?</i>

750
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:20,912
You keep it.

751
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,778
Sir?

752
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,992
It's about time you go independent.

753
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:28,952
You've been working
hard under Kim Jae-yeol.

754
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:33,472
I don't understand what
you are talking about.

755
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:38,112
Let's get rid of Kim Jae-yeol.

756
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,232
What?

757
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:35,712
What are you going to do?

758
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:37,952
Bring it to me. Come on.

759
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:30,098
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

760
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:32,752
Why is he not picking up his phone?

761
00:55:57,642 --> 00:55:59,232
Wait.

762
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:35,138
<i>Make sure it gets done. I</i>
<i>don't care how many die.</i>

763
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:38,298
<i>Who cares if an elderly</i>
<i>person with dementia...</i>

764
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:40,778
<i>...plays with fire and dies?</i>

765
00:56:40,802 --> 00:56:43,832
The fire incident at the
Shinnam Nursing Home...

766
00:56:44,962 --> 00:56:46,378
...was the responsibility of Moon Sang-guk,

767
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,818
the CEO of Moon Law Firm.

768
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,338
<i>Saying that Mr. Moon asked him to murder...</i>

769
00:56:50,362 --> 00:56:53,538
<i>...a female employee of</i>
<i>Moon Law Firm ten years ago,</i>

770
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:56,218
<i>he continued to expose Moon Sang-guk.</i>

771
00:56:56,242 --> 00:56:58,658
<i>Make sure it gets done. I</i>
<i>don't care how many die.</i>

772
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:02,378
<i>In response, Moon Law</i>
<i>Firm denied these claims...</i>

773
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:05,258
<i>...and warned of a strong legal response.</i>

774
00:57:05,282 --> 00:57:07,658
<i>What's the reason behind the exposal?</i>

775
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:11,152
<i>Moon Sang-guk tried to kill me too.</i>

776
00:57:24,362 --> 00:57:26,018
<i>About Moon Sang-guk.</i>

777
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,858
Getting Kim Jae-yeol out
might not be what he's after.

778
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:31,832
He might have got the
man out to abandon him.

779
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:47,601
This might be a chance for us.

780
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:05,812
RELEASING

781
00:59:32,082 --> 00:59:34,070
EVILIVE

782
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:35,938
<i>I request an immediate investigation...</i>

783
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,618
<i>...and arrest of Moon Sang-guk.</i>

784
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:40,218
<i>A search and seizure</i>
<i>warrant has been issued.</i>

785
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:41,898
<i>I think Moon Sang-guk is behind it.</i>

786
00:59:41,922 --> 00:59:43,818
<i>We will turn the whole</i>
<i>situation upside down.</i>

787
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:45,938
<i>A new district attorney might be appointed.</i>

788
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:47,938
<i>The police arrived just on time.</i>

789
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:50,578
<i>Once the search begins,</i>
<i>it will be found in no time.</i>

790
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:52,178
<i>If we don't capture Moon Sang-guk now,</i>

791
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:54,498
<i>all the work we've done</i>
<i>will go down the drain.</i>

792
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:56,018
<i>Watch out for Han Dong-soo.</i>

793
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:58,738
<i>He will try to sit on your head.</i>

794
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,712
<i>Let's move the body first.</i>
