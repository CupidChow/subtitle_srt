1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
I have a task to shoot
a time-lapse video,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,560
so I'm thinking of a rooftop
with a beautiful view.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,910
Do you want to go to my condo?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
I'm not sure
if this is the deep talk

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,680
Punlee suggested,

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,960
but after reading about it online,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,600
it says this can help create
a better understanding of each other.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,970
Do you wanna go first?

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,750
Do you like spending time with me?

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,160
Couples have nicknames to call each other.

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,080
When you touch each other,

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,480
do it like you're a couple,

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,720
not friends.

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,960
I'll call you "Fah."

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
What do you want to call me?

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,960
You Naughty Baby.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,120
You did an amazing job today, Fah.

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
I was so excited for you to score the last goal.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,720
Do you want anything? You just won.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,680
I can give you a reward.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's go on a date.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,640

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,040
I can give you anything.

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,800
Let's go on a date, shall we?

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Right!

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,820
You mean the date on the checklist?

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,920
Sure, where do you want to go?

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Where do you wanna go?

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,360
I'll plan it for you.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
It's been a tough day for you.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,240
I got you water, snacks,
and a refreshing towel.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Thanks.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
Thank you.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,960
- But I...
- It's okay. I can do it for you.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,380
Ouch!

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,640
Are you okay, Fah?

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Shit.

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,460
Fah, you bastard!

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,920
What are you doing to my brother?!

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll kill you!

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Take it easy, Babe.

43
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,920
Babe, calm down!

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,000
Teerak, run!

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,910
Babe, take it easy.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,640
- Ouch!
- What's wrong with you, Babe?

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,079
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,200
What's wrong, Babe?

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,880
- Don't defend him. Come here, you two.
- I saw Muenfah, so I missed my shot.

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,360
- Talk to me.
- Then, Muenfah took the shot.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
- We'll talk later, Fah.
- See? He made the team win the match.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,240
- Stay here. Watch him.
- It was all part of my plan!

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,820
Rak, the list I gave you...

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,780
You don't need to do
every single one of them!

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,520
What are you talking about? I'm confused.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,880
I mean...

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
What were you doing?

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Nothing.

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,610
Nothing what? I saw it.

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,079
This was Fah, okay?

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,760
What? I just poked him in the eye.
That's all!

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Thank God he's okay,
and he's not even mad.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Are you sure that was all?

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,400
Of course, Babe!

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
I felt so bad.

66
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah, what's wrong?

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,560
It's none of your business.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
Clear, isn't it?

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
- Yeah.
- No more doubts.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,760
Hey, don't fight.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,210
I have a reward for you.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
Here!

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,159
I'll treat you guys to a BBQ

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,680
as a reward for the effort
you put into this game.

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
- Yay!!
- Yay!!

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,280
Actually, you and your friends
can come along, Teerak.

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,080
Without your support,

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
Muenfah wouldn't have scored any goals.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
That's right. I agree.

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
- Are you coming?
- Yes!

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
Okay, let's go!

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,880
All of us!

84
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,900
Yay!

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,320
Let's go.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,840
Let's get changed first.

87
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,890
I'll see you at the BBQ place at 10 P.M.,

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,000
- okay?
- Okay.

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,840
See you there.

90
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,840
Dom...

91
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,120
Hey.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
I have an upset stomach.

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Are you okay?

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,240
I think I am.
It'll get better with some medicine.

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,760
You should go eat the BBQ with Teerak.

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
Let's go!

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Why haven't you changed?

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Are you okay?

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,160
I have an upset stomach.
You should go.

100
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,000
Anyway, behave

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
and don't get too close to Muenfah.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
Are we clear?

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay.

104
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,500
Take your medicine and rest up.

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,700
Okay, we're leaving.

106
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,540
- Rest up, okay?
- Take care of him.

107
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
- Cheers!
- Yay!!

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Whoa.

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,920
Alright, guys.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,590
Today's a good day.

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,440
I, Ton, would like to thank all of you

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,560
for the hard work you put in
and our victory today!

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,370
- Yay.
- Yay!

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Thanks to my beloved bro,

115
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,820
Hia!

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
Let me kiss you!

117
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,040
- Hey!
- Hey, come on.

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
Gosh, all I wanted was just a kiss.

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,640
Anyway, I really wanted to thank him

120
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
for being our major sponsor,

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,720
providing us with a soccer field to practice

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,920
free of charge!

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,130
That's no problem, guys.

124
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,480
Considering that it's for my friends,

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
our faculty, and our college,

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,960
this is nothing!

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,040
Good job! Now sit down.

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,840
Last but not least,

129
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,840
thank you to Joy, Type, and Punlee,

130
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
for doing their best to cheer for us!

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,400
Yay!

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,990
- Hey, Ton.
- Yeah?

133
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,710
How could you forget about Teerak?

134
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,760
You're so hard to please, huh?

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,920
I didn't forget,

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,840
but he's for Muenfah.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you, Teerak,
for doing your best to cheer Muenfah up.

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,440
Without you,
the game might not have turned out this way

139
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,600
and this BBQ party wouldn't have happened.

140
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah, during the game,

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,000
I even thought
Oh would be sent to the hospital.

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,360
How did he make it?

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, that's so true!

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
They were so aggressive.

145
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,720
Watching them from afar still scared me.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
They were so harsh.

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,320
If it was the old Muenfah,

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,800
they would've been gone.

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,960
True.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,640
That's how love changes people.

151
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
They become softer.

152
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm really curious about what you did
to make my friend change so much!

153
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,159
- Right, guys?
- Yeah!

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
- Yeah.
- You're talking too much.

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,700
You're spitting all over the BBQ now.

156
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,400
Teerak,

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
do you want me to refill your drink?

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
Mine's also empty.

160
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,159
Let's go together, then.

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
- It's fine.
- Here you go. Take it

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,600
They're inseparable. How real.

163
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,240
Huh?

164
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
What did you say, Dom?

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh, I was talking about the BBQ.

166
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
It's stuck.

167
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Gosh.

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,980
I'll do it for you.

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,280
Thanks.

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,520
My friends like to tease.

173
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm okay. It's nothing.

174
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,190
If they upset you,

175
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,520
let me know.

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll deal with them.

177
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Yes, I'm just afraid that...

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll get caught if I talk too much.

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm bad at lying,

180
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
but it'll also seem fake if I talk too little.

181
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm not sure if I was too quiet.

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,600
Don't worry.

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,720
I know what to do.

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Are you free to talk?
I can't choose an outfit.

369
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,400
You look a lot happier lately, you know that?

370
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
Chatting with Teerak?

371
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,280
Yeah, I'm not free anymore.

372
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Your drinks can wait.

373
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Hey, seriously?

374
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Fantastic.

375
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
You sure you're free to talk?

376
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,920
Yes, I'm sure.

377
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
It's my free day.
I've got nothing to do.

378
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
Do you want me to help pick your outfit?

379
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
That's cute.

380
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,480
This?

381
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,080
Or this?

382
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,680
This one?

383
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,280
And this?

384
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,840
This one?

385
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,520
What about this one?

386
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,400
Or this one?

387
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Uh-huh.

388
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,200
Gosh, but I don't think so.

389
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,520
How do couples dress on a date?

390
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,370
How do we make it look believable?

391
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
Do we need to match?

392
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,640
Do our shirts have to be in the same color

393
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,000
to make us look like a couple?

394
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,370
It's also cute.

395
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,640
Well...

396
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,040
just be yourself.

397
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
You're already adorable.

398
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,840
You're a lot better now

399
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,480
at saying those pickup lines.

400
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
How long have you been waiting?

401
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,800
Not long.

402
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,840
You look happy.

403
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,680
I am. I'm happy to go on a date with you.

404
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,250
Just the thought
of spending the whole day with my love

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,600
makes my heart race.

406
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,320
Uh, are you okay, Fah?

407
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,480
Why are you giving me that look?

408
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,600
Oh, it's nothing.

409
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,240
I just wanted to say that...

410
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
your outfit is adorable.

411
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Thank you.

412
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,600
You're also handsome!

413
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,240
Let's go, shall we?

414
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,720
Come on, Fah, get in!

415
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,960
Fah, why is there nobody here?

416
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,720
Hello.

417
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,880
Are you Mr. Muenfah?

418
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes.

419
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,800
Your request to book the zoo privately for today

420
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
has been completed, sir.

421
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,080
If you need any assistance,

422
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,520
please let me know.

423
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,840
We'll take a look around first.

424
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,770
Be my guest, sir.

425
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,760
Welcome to our zoo.

426
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,920
Uh...

427
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,320
You booked the zoo?

428
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Well...

429
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Should we take a look?

430
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,440
Sure.

431
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Let's go.

432
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,040
Whoa!

433
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
The giraffe is lying down.

434
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Let's see the giraffes!

435
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,880
You go first, Fah.

436
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,720
Ah!

437
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,400
Choo-choo-choo-choo.

438
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,240
See? It's not scary.

439
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,640
Hey, I've got some corn.

440
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,280
- You want some?
- They're enjoying it.

441
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
You like it?

442
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
I even have more of them!

443
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,040
Hey, can you speak?

444
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,680
Say my name, "Teerak."

445
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,760
If you can say it, I'll give you my love.

446
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Teerak.

447
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,840
Teerak, Teerak, Teerak.

448
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Aw!

449
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,300
I did order them.

450
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Thank you.

451
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,840
As for today,

452
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,880
we're giving you a gashapon coin
as a souvenir.

453
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,360
Thank you.

454
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
Here.

455
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
How nice.

456
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,640
Should we get our prize now?

457
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,080
Sure, let's do it.

458
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,240
Fah, I want this one.

459
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
I want the fox!

460
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Okay.

461
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,440
I think...you should do it.

462
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,360
My luck's terrible.

463
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,040
I think your luck's good today, though.

464
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,120
Give it a shot.

465
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Fine.

466
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,240
Fah, it's the fox!

467
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,520
I really got the fox!

468
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm sorry. I was too excited.

469
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,240
That's okay.

470
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,160
Can you do it? Let me help.

471
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Thank you.

472
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
Is it cute?

473
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
Well...

474
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Yes!

475
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Uh...

476
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,960
let's go grab a meal.

477
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Okay.

478
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
Do you like foxes?

479
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,290
Yes, but actually,

480
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,240
I like all animals.

481
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,200
I love watching them,

482
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,440
and I'm so happy that I got to spend this day
with my love.

483
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
Your love?

484
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Yes.

485
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,440
Every animal is "my love."

486
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I see.

487
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,160
You look so happy today.

488
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
You've been smiling nonstop since we got here.

489
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,160
Fah, I know what to do with my task now!

490
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm gonna design a fox art toy.

491
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,280
Mm, that sounds wonderful.

492
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Thank you so much for making me realize
what truly makes me happy.

493
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,320
Do you feel better now?

494
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,440
Um...

495
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes, I'm better now.

496
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,500
Aw, our order's here.

497
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

498
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
This one's for you.

499
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,320
That's mine.

500
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,840
- All of them were yummy.
- Yeah, I also liked them.

501
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,600
- Let's have some more together later.
- Okay.

502
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,920
- Ask me to join you next time.
- Sure.

503
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Mew?

504
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Are you really dating Muenfah?

505
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,920
I thought it was just a silly rumor.

506
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
I didn't think...

507
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,720
Wait, are you still the same?

508
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,080
You know, being with someone
just because you couldn't say no.

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,680
Hey, don't take it seriously.

510
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,040
I was just kidding.

511
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,080
Excuse me.

512
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,920
Let's go somewhere else, shall we?

513
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,320
I wanna feed the fish.

514
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,600
Mm.

515
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,840
Do you want to tell me anything?

516
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,320
But if you're not ready,

517
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,800
that's totally okay.

518
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,080
It's not like that.

519
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,520
That girl... She's Mew.

520
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
She was my high school friend,

521
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,560
and we were...

522
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,320
in a relationship when we were freshmen.

523
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,520
That girl... She's Mew.

524
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,680
She was my high school friend,

525
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,920
and we were...

526
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,960
in a relationship when we were freshmen.

527
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,160
Anyway, we dated because...

528
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,640
♫Happy birthday to you♫

529
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
♫Happy birthday to you♫

530
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,360
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

531
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,040
♫Happy birthday to you♫

532
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,470
Make a wish, Mew.

533
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
What kind of wish is taking you this long?

534
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,480
Are you asking to be in a relationship
with someone here?

535
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
Teerak, I like you.

536
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Aw!

537
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,480
Can you be my boyfriend?

538
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Uh...

539
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Say yes!

540
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,800
- Say yes.
- Say yes!

541
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,560
Say yes!

542
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
- Say yes.
- Say yes.

543
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,040
Mm.

544
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,640
I was afraid that if I'd said no,

545
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
it would've embarrassed and hurt her,

546
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,400
so I said yes.

547
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,800
I thought we would make it.

548
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,000
I didn't have feelings for her, though.

549
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,560
It was my fault that I didn't dare say no.

550
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I understand.

551
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,800
You respected her;
that's why you didn't say no.

552
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,280
But...she was the one breaking up with me.

553
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I felt horrible.

554
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
I wanted to be her friend again,

555
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,800
but she probably despises me.

556
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Although we're at the same college,

557
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
we never talked since then.

558
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Are you still worried about that?

559
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,000
It feels like something
I just can't shake off.

560
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,560
It's normal to feel bad and guilty,

561
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,199
but the most important thing is that...

562
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,239
you need to forgive yourself as well.

563
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,159
Accepting your feelings and expressing them

564
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,080
are not wrong.

565
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,960
Just remember why you feel that way

566
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,880
and what mistakes you make

567
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,960
so that you improve them

568
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,840
and grow stronger next time.

569
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,400
Okay.

570
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,920
I'll try to be a better version of myself.

571
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,000
Thank you so much, Fah.

572
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,680
Talking to you makes me feel a lot better.

573
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,560
If anything else worries you,

574
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,220
just let me know.

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm...

576
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,510
a good listener.

577
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,520
You know what? People say...

578
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,280
you're the Scary Looker

579
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,600
who's fearsome
and doesn't care about anyone.

580
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,440
When I first met you,

581
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,120
I was so nervous and scared of you

582
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,040
cause I believed what people said,

583
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,360
but after getting to know you...

584
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,840
Why?

585
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,960
You're actually soft and the kindest!

586
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,920
Thank you so much
for going to the zoo with me today.

587
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Thank you so much for listening to me.

588
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,360
Have a good night, Fah!

589
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Good night, Naughty Baby.

590
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,720
UNO!

591
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,800
You won't get to play!

592
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,640
Yay!

593
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,720
I won!

594
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,580
What? Ghlaijai won again.

595
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,160
You idiot! Why did you use the Reverse card?

596
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,470
Let's do it again.

597
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Shuffle the cards.

598
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
What?

599
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
You can stay, can't you?

600
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,080
You don't have class this afternoon, right?

601
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Yes, he doesn't.

602
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,440
I know; that's why I invited him.

603
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,880
I was asking Ghlaijai.

604
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,120
Come on, deal the cards.

605
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,160
It's my time to win.

606
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,640
UNO!

607
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,960
UNO!

608
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,760
Yes!

609
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,080
Saggy Cheeks, how is that possible?

610
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,680
You just lost 5 times in a row.

611
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes, I wonder why.

612
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,280
It's okay, Rak.

613
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,990
Aw, just wait.

614
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,320
Let the skilled ones
show their talent for now.

615
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,320
But you lost.
Shuffle the cards.

616
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Fine.

617
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
I'll text Fah first.

618
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
My class has ended.

619
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm playing board games
at the library.

620
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Hey, is that Mew?

621
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
Why is she coming this way?

622
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,080
Don't tell me...

623
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,040
Teerak, can we talk?

624
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,350
Okay, sure.

625
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,450
I'll be back.

626
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,680
Saggy Cheeks,

627
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,160
- if you don't wanna go, we can...
- That's okay.

628
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I'm okay.

629
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Be right back.

630
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I'll be back.

631
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Guys, what do we do?

632
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,160
Do we need to follow him?

633
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,840
He said no.

634
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,400
Let them talk it out alone.

635
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,040
- Let's continue our game.
- But I...

636
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,040
Stop poking your nose
into others' business.

637
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm going to the library.

638
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,280
That means we're...

639
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,560
Come on, let me give you a hug.

640
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
Well, surprised, aren't you?

641
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,320
That's Mew, Teerak's first girlfriend.

642
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,360
From what I see,
I think they're back together.

643
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,160
Get ready to be dumped, man.

644
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,000
If I can't have him, neither can you.

645
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,800
Fah, let's go.

646
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
- Let's have a meal.
- Okay.

647
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
What was that?

648
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,480
Huh?

649
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,400
Your iced cocoa

650
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,040
always makes me happy.

651
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,720
That's nice.

652
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,360
Are you not curious
about what happened?

653
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
Well...

654
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,760
Do you want to tell me?

655
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Well...

656
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,840
I'm sorry for being rude to you yesterday.

657
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,440
I didn't know what to do.

658
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,560
It's okay. Neither did I.

659
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,920
- Do you have anything to say to me?
- What if...

660
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,680
I want you to date me again?

661
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,800
What will you say?

662
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,440
Does that silence mean a yes,

663
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
and you're coming back to me?

664
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
I don't think I can do that.

665
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
I'm sorry,

666
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,040
but I don't feel that way with you.

667
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,720
It's good to know that
you can finally say no.

668
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I actually wanted to warn you.

669
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
You know that
Oh's not leaving you alone yet, don't you?

670
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,320
Uh, what do you mean?

671
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,720
I'm here today

672
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,960
because he told me so.

673
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,840
It might take me longer
to wire you the money, Mom.

674
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm sorry. I really am short of it.

675
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,800
I'll give it to you as soon as I earn it.

676
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,360
I gotta go now.

677
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Mew.

678
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,240
Are you short of money?

679
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,560
You want any help?

680
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,360
Oh...

681
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
What do you want?

682
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,200
I just have a job for you.

683
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
It's an easy one. You're in?

684
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
What job?

685
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,200
You're Teerak's ex, aren't you?

686
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
I just want you to talk to him

687
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,770
and do whatever you can
to make him break up with Muenfah.

688
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,880
Why do I have to do it?

689
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,240
Why?

690
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,560
You probably have no idea

691
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,670
who my mother is

692
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,760
and what I'm capable of at this college.

693
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
If you disobey me...

694
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Let's put it this way.
It's up to you

695
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
if you want an easy job

696
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
or a problem.

697
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,360
That's your choice.

698
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,240
I just wanted to warn you and...

699
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,600
apologize for the past.

700
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,720
It was my fault

701
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,650
that I said it in front of everyone.

702
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,400
I didn't see that
I was just pressuring you

703
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,600
and forcing a yes.

704
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,800
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm sorry, too.

706
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,040
I didn't know what to do,

707
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,800
and I wasn't brave enough to say no.

708
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,080
I was scared of hurting you.

709
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,040
Anyway, thank you for warning me.

710
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,320
I thought you hated me.

711
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,280
I never did.

712
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
I actually was mad at first,

713
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
but after realizing what I did,

714
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,320
I shouldn't be the one being mad.

715
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,400
I'm not here because Oh told me to,

716
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,760
but I just wanted to take the chance
and talk to you.

717
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm glad we talked.

718
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
So am I.

719
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,360
You know what?
I'm feeling so much better now.

720
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Will this cause you any trouble, though?

721
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,440
Don't worry. I can deal with that.

722
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,800
You don't have to worry at all.

723
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Thanks.

724
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,410
And...has anyone told you

725
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,360
that you look so happy with Muenfah?

726
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,640
You're also more like yourself.

727
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,440
I'm happy for you.

728
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,920
And can we be friends again?

729
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
Sure!

730
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,480
Come on, let me give you a hug.

731
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,760
So Oh doesn't believe we're together?

732
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,920
He's known me for a long time.

733
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
He probably thinks I can't date anyone.

734
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,960
Luckily, Mew didn't doubt anything.

735
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,520
She just wanted to warn me
and clear things up between us.

736
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
What was that?

737
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,770
Wait.

738
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Where are you going?

739
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,860
You haven't done my job,
and you're running away?

740
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,610
"I just want you to talk to him

741
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,440
and do whatever you can
to make him break up with Muenfah."

742
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
Why? You're gonna delete it?

743
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,520
You think this is all?

744
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,970
It's saved everywhere now.

745
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,440
If I'm in trouble, so will you.

746
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,560
We'll see whose trouble turns out bigger,

747
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,120
yours or mine.

748
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,040
Right, this is for your sake.

749
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,200
Leave me alone. I can't help you.

750
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,760
They're in love.

751
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,120
I said sorry to her.

752
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,960
We're now friends again!

753
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I've embraced what you taught me:

754
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
saying no,

755
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,040
forgiving others, forgiving myself,

756
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,680
and becoming stronger.

757
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Thank you so much

758
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
for giving me the courage
to express my true feelings.

759
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,760
I'm not the only one who did a good job.

760
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,840
You also did an amazing job.

761
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,640
Saggy Cheeks, as a BL fan, I have a question.

762
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,400
Have you ever been intimate

763
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,120
or done anything with Muenfah?

764
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,200
We need to be more comfortable
with being physically close.

765
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
Okay, Naughty Baby.

766
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,160
Teerak, that's not a comfy place to sleep.

767
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,000
Do you wanna go somewhere better?

768
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,360
Don't joke around like this.

769
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,760
You should do it
with someone you're really into.
