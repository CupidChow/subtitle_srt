1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,800
I'm here.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
When did they become this close?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,750
Let's have some snacks.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,710
You two look suspicious.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,630
Nothing important.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm hitting on him; that's all.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,520
Whoa, this is heaven for a BL fan like me!

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,720
I'm going to tell my parents and grandpa
about us.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,240
I believe it will turn out fine,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,170
So, is she older?

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,480
Hey!

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,040
You're something!

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,680
I'll tell her now.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Dad...

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,040

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Rak, are you going with Fah?

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm leaving, then.

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Rak!

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,400
What were you saying?

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
What's with you?

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,760
You almost fell. Watch your step.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,120
Thanks, Lee.

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,280
What's wrong with you?

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,280
You've been zoned out
since we were in class.

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Well...

27
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,400
Something's been worrying me.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
What is it?

29
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
My dad thinks...

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Fah's a woman.

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
What made him think that way?

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,400
I think he heard me talking to Mookrob.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,640
I told him I'd introduce Fah to my family,

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,280
and my dad thinks Fah is a woman's name.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,840
Why didn't you tell him
you were talking about Muenfah?

36
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,520
I tried,

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
but my dad wouldn't listen.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
He's happy I'm dating someone.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
What should I do?

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,800
It's stressing me out.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
You don't need to do anything.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,160
It's just a misunderstanding.

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
Um...

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
The next time you bring Fah along,

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,680
just tell them he's your boyfriend.

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,720
Things have changed.

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Look at my parents. They like you.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm afraid my dad might not be okay with it.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,840
You know how fearsome and strict he is.

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,520
As long as you're happy,

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,360
I think your parents will be, too.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,640
It's not that easy.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
My brother's here.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Talk to him about it.

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Thanks, Lee.

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Let's go.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,120
Are you done? I wanna watch a soccer match.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Just a sec. I'm writing my name.

60
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,440
You missed a class
'cause you were mad at me.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
That's not good, Mr. Prarchana Phanha.

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Thanks, buddy.

63
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,040
What? Am I your buddy?

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,480
- Just a buddy?
- Ouch!

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,720
It hurts.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
What's wrong with you?

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
I can do anything for you,

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
but I can't be more than just a friend.

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
Feeling hurt?

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Nope, it's chill.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,400
I paid for it,

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,480
but you're acting like it's yours.

73
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,400
You're okay with everything I do, though.

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
Stop playing it cool.

75
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Be honest with me.

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Has your heart ever fluttered
when you're around me?

77
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
I don't know.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Come on!

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
Well...

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,360
You were just a friend to me,

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
but...

82
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
it's not like that anymore.

83
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,750
Come on, I'm just used to it.

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,320
Let's pretend we're dating, then.

86
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,230
No, do you want to...

87
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
do what Fah and Teerak did?

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah! I'm serious.

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
No! That's weird.

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Please.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Please.

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Please let me out of your friendzone.

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,190
Just for a minute is fine.

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,800
Please.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Please.

96
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm begging you.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Fine.

98
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
Just for a minute, though.

99
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Go!

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
Baby...

101
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
My boo!

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
- Baby!
- Hey!

103
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Stop that!

104
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,760
That wasn't a minute yet!

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Why? You didn't like it?

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
It's my turn.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey!

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,320
Ouch!

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,390
Whoa.

110
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
Oh!

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Argh!

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
That's what he told me.

113
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,440
Saggy Cheeks was completely stressed.

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
I think he's scared.

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Ghlai...

116
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
Are you stressed, too?

117
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Yeah.

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm worried about Teerak.

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Fah's with Teerak now.

120
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm sure Fah can make him feel better.

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
Don't worry, okay?

122
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
Smile!

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Smile for me.

124
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
I am.

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Good job.

126
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
Ghlai!

127
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
I have something for you.

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
You want some Ichitan?

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
Here.

130
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Thank you.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Keep it. It's for you.

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay.

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
Are you going to the cafe next?

134
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Um...

135
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
I don't think I am.

136
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
I didn't bring my car today.

137
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,020
How do you usually leave
if you don't have your car?

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Motorcycle taxis.

139
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Taxis? The motorcycle taxis?

140
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,480
Yeah.

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
But that's dangerous. You need to hug...

142
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,960
Can I give you a ride?

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
I also ride a motorcycle.

144
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm just as fast as a taxi.

145
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
You're giving me a ride?

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I don't want to bother you, though.

147
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
What do you mean?

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
We're already close.

149
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Let me give you a ride.

150
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,040
Please.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Please.

152
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Please?

153
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,390
Okay, fine.

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,360
Yay!

155
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,890
I'll hold that for you.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
Let's go.

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
Are you full?

158
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
You've only had a little food.

159
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes, I'm full.

160
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Are you okay?

161
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
You've seemed worried
ever since you got in the car.

162
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
Do you want to tell me anything?

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Fah...

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
My dad knows I'm in a relationship,

165
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,840
and he asked me to introduce you to my family
on my grandpa's birthday.

166
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,720
Okay.

167
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,120
What's worrying you?

168
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,550
My dad thinks...

169
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
you're a woman.

170
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,120
My dad overheard me talking to Mookrob

171
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
about introducing you to my family.

172
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
I'm afraid...

173
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,280
my parents won't be as kind as yours.

174
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
That's okay.

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I understand.

176
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
I'll do everything I can

177
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
to gain your parents' approval.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I promise.

179
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
Don't worry, okay?

180
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,880
We're gonna go
to your grandpa's birthday party together.

181
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,920
Now, can you tell me about your family?

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Let's start with my grandpa.

183
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,080
My grandpa is very kind and generous.

184
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,560
Mm...

185
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
He loves playing chess,

186
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
and he usually makes me cocoa drinks.

187
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Hey!

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
What?

189
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
What's wrong with you?

190
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
What?

191
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Real!

192
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,000
- What?
- You're getting on my nerves?

193
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Why are you hugging me?

194
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,960
I want something in your pocket.

195
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,940
Stop being cheesy.

196
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
You're acting innocent.

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,240
We've done more than this.

198
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,880
Fine!

199
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,520
Good!

200
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
Come on.

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,640
What?

202
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm done playing with you.

203
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,760
What?

204
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,900
Where are you going?

205
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm going home.

206
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,920
What? We just arrived.

207
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,160
There.

208
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,620
Let's go there with me.

209
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,480
You're pressing your luck.

210
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Where are you going?

211
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm hungry.

212
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
You literally ate a moment ago.

213
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Uh...

214
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,480
You just had something.

215
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I want more!

216
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800
That was a savory dish.

217
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,880
Let's have something sweet.

218
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Sounds good?

219
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,630
Yes.

220
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,640
I'm not talking about that, though.

221
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
I want the actual dessert.

222
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
Come on!

223
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,480
How about we tie it like this?

224
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh.

225
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,960
Hello, Grandpa.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,160
Happy birthday to you.

227
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
- Here's your present.
- Thank you.

228
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
This is very lovely.

229
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
- Oh.
- Mom, hello.

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,190
Hello.

231
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh, Muenfah?

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
Hello.

233
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,840
Hi.

234
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,880
Now that you're here,
feel free to stay for the party.

235
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Sure.

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
- Let's get stuff inside the house with me.
- Right.

237
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,280
Stay with Grandpa, Fah.

238
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,960
- I'll be right back.
- Right.

239
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,160
Let's go.

240
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Babe invited you to my birthday party?

241
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
It's Teerak, actually.

242
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
And...

243
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,360
You're close to Teerak, yes?

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,480
Yes, we're close.

245
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,960
How close?

246
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I...

247
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,120
I like Teerak.

248
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Winning someone's heart isn't easy.

249
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I know that.

250
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
I'm not giving up.

251
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
So you're not afraid of losing?

252
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
I'll fight until the victory is mine.

253
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If this makes Teerak happy,

254
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm okay with you.

255
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,320
Take care of each other, alright?

256
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,359
Thank you.

257
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,960
- Bring all of these outside, okay?
- Sure.

258
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, Babe.

259
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,240
You invited Muenfah to Grandpa's birthday party?

260
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,560
Uh... Well...

261
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
I was the one inviting Fah here.

262
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,520
You invited "Fah" here?

263
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,840
So...

264
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
Your dad told me that

265
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,080
you're in a relationship

266
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
with a senior

267
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,320
named "Fah"...

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,000
So he's...

269
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,320
How long have you two been dating?

270
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,880
It hasn't been that long.
We just got started, actually.

271
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,640
So...

272
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,300
All those times

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,600
when you said you were stressed and worried,

274
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
it was about this?

275
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,280
You've been worried that
I won't be okay with you?

276
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Yes, I've been very worried.

277
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Come here, dear.

278
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,240
Teerak.

279
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Do you know that

280
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
no matter who you are,

281
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
I'm fine with you.

282
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,040
Whatever makes you happy,

283
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm okay with it.

284
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,640
Does he make you happy, dear?

285
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,960
Yes, I'm very happy.

286
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
That's all I want to hear.

287
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,420
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I... I don't know.

288
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,560
You're pretty good at chess.

289
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
- Come and play with me if you're free, alright?
- Yes.

290
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,360
Right. Let's clear the board

291
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
and have dinner.

292
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,480
Oh?

293
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
Hello.

294
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,240
Right.

295
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,430
Oh, sweethearts!

296
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,720
Come here, guys.

297
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
Rak, come here! Quickly!

298
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
Lucky me, the traffic was good.

299
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
How about that? No need for a surprise.

300
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
It's from your favorite place.

301
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,560
I stood in the long line for this.

302
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
Here, help each other out.

303
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,920
- Let me put this away.
- How is it?

304
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Do you like it? Take a look.

305
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,150
- I'll save it for later if you don't mind.
- Sure thing.

306
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,520
Put it in the fridge, okay?

307
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,400
Right...

308
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,990
- Hi, dear.
- You're just in time for dinner.

309
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm starving!

310
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,960
Thank you.

311
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Whoa, we're having this much food?

312
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Isn't this too much?

313
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,680
No, it isn't.

314
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,700
- Hello!
- We've got many people here today.

315
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,560
Whoa!

316
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,720
Make sure you enjoy all of the food, Father.

317
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,080
- Whoa!
- Here.

318
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,360
How much rice would you like, Father?

319
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
- A scoop is enough.
- Here.

320
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,040
That's enough.

321
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
And you?

322
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,160
Here.

323
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,720
- Not too much.
- Right.

324
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Get the timer going.

325
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,320
I'm hungry.

326
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,160
Where are you, Rak?
Why are you taking so long?

327
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,360
- Would you like to try this?
- Dad, the timer starts now.

328
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,410
Quickly, Rak!

329
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Rak, everyone's hungry!

330
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
Is that enough?

331
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Yes.

332
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Thanks, Fah.

333
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
Do you want some cakes?

334
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,360
Oh, sure.

335
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
Mom prepared them with love, too.

336
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,000
- They're called fish cakes, dear.
- Oh!

337
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Sorry.

338
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,440
When should we reveal it to your dad?

339
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,520
I think we'll do it after blowing out the candles.

340
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,400
Mm.

341
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,540
By the way, Muenfah.

342
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,360
It's so nice to see that
Babe invited you to the birthday party.

343
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,040
It's been so long, hasn't it?

344
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Your friends aren't coming here, too?

345
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,480
Oh, well...

346
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,240
They're all busy, so he's here all by himself.

347
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,990
Right.

348
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,400
Right...

349
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Dad.

350
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,040
I was the one who invited him here.

351
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,000
What?

352
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,400
So it wasn't Babe...

353
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,200
You're also close to Muenfah as well?

354
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Yes.

355
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
So it wasn't Babe?

356
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
No, I mean...

357
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,120
I thought you were close friends with...

358
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,760
Shall we bring out the birthday cake?

359
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,600
- He's done with savory dishes.
- I'm full.

360
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,680
I'm craving desserts already.

361
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,930
Let me bring it here real quick.

362
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,970
- Okay.
- Right, please get the cake.

363
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
I'll leave that to you.

364
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I'll come with you.

365
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,680
Uh... Are you full, Dad?

366
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Oh, I am.

367
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
Okay, okay.

368
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,840
♫Happy birthday to you♫

369
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,160

372

Happy birthday, Grandpa.

373
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,720
Here I go.

374
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,440
- Yay!
- Yay!!

375
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
This one is from Dom and me.

376
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
May you have good health
and stay with us for years to come.

377
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,640
Stay healthy, Grandpa.

378
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,280
- Thank you very much.
- I'll take you out for a soccer game.

379
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Whoa, okay!

380
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,800
- Happy birthday to you.
- Oh?

381
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,880
- Happy birthday!
- You've got yours, too?

382
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,800
That's right.

383
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
May you have good health, Father.

384
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
This one's from me.

385
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,680
You're going to love it.

386
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,040
The one that you have isn't working well.

387
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,440
- Yours got a dying battery. This is the newer model.
- Oh, right.

388
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,080
Stop overstating!

389
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
As for the present from Fah and me,

390
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
it's actually the chessboard
you just played on.

391
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
I love you so much, Grandpa.

392
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Let me give you a hug.

393
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,040
I love you, my little puppy.

394
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

395
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
May you have great health.

396
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
You're very good at chess, actually.

397
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,080
Let's play it again sometime.

398
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Absolutely.

399
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,840
Wait...

400
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Just a second, Teerak.

401
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,840
Why is yours a joint gift with him?

402
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Why isn't it with your girlfriend?

403
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,560
When is she coming?
The one you told me about.

404
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Well...

405
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,320
Fah and I...

406
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,840
Wait.

407
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
You call him "Fah"?

408
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.

409
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
What does that mean?

410
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,880
Teerak and I...

411
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,120
We're in a relationship.

412
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,560
Huh?

413
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
You're joking, right?

414
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,040
It's not a joke, Dad.

415
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,080
Currently...

416
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,120
Fah and I, we're lovers.

417
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,160
When I told you I'd bring my partner over...

418
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
I was referring to "Muenfah."

419
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,560
Please let Teerak and me

420
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,200
be in this relationship.

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,280
In a relationship?

422
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
What the heck are you saying?

423
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,920
This is a birthday party,

424
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,160
not a soap opera.

425
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
How would two men be in the same relationship?

426
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,150
Are you crazy? Did you hear that?

427
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,110
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

428
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,480
Didn't you hear them? They've gone insane.

429
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
- Please, calm down!
- I'm not staying calm!

430
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,800
Didn't you hear them?

431
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,760
Men being together?

432
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,810
Are you crazy?

433
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm having none of this.

434
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,520
- Get out of my house.
- Dad...

435
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,280
- Honey...
- Get out!

436
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,000
- Honey...
- No!

437
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,680
- Teerak, why are you like this?
- Honey.

438
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
I don't get it. Explain this.

439
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,920
Why...

440
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,360
Dad!

441
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,600
Honey.

442
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
It's fine.

443
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Let him go.

444
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,280
I'll talk to him, okay?

445
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,880
Please return for now.

446
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,280
Muenfah.

447
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,640
I think you should leave now.

448
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,720
Let's wait for him to calm down before we talk.

449
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
I can try talking to him.

450
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Fah.

451
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,520
Let them deal with their family matters first.

452
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,440
Let's go.

453
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,060
You should leave now.

454
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,690
Let us deal with this ourselves.

455
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,960
Leave now.

456
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
Please. Please leave, dear.

457
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Fah, let's go.

458
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,320
Babe,

459
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,400
take him upstairs, okay?

460
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Go.

461
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,720
Hey!

462
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,960
Honey.

463
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,200
- Let go.
- Dad.

464
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,120
Let go of him.

465
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
- Rit!
- Hey!

466
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
Let him go.

467
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,920
Listen to me.

468
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Don't date a man, okay?

469
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,280
It'll come crashing down anyway.

470
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,360
Even though it's widely accepted,

471
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,280
you must build a perfect and complete family.

472
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
How will I sleep soundly if you're like this?

473
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,040
I love Fah.

474
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,040
If I want to have a family in the future,

475
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
I want Fah to be a part of it.

476
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,040
You're too young to understand what a family is.

477
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,800
You're still going to meet new people.

478
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,880
Men being together is doomed to fail.

479
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Believe me!

480
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,440
- Break up with him!
- Do I have to?

481
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,040
Why aren't you giving us a chance?

482
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
- What's wrong with it?!
- Listen!

483
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
I told you to fucking break up with him!

484
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
Break up with him!

485
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't fucking let me repeat myself again!

486
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,320
Understand?

487
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,360
Do you understand what I said?!

488
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,960
- Dad! Dad!
- Stop! Snap out of it!

489
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
Stop it!

490
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Stop!!

491
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Have a rest upstairs.

492
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,760
Babe.

493
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,740
What should I do?

494
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Calm down.

495
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,640
Give him some time.

496
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,160
We can talk to him again later.

497
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
I don't get it.

498
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,480
He seemed to understand about this.

499
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,320
He even watched a boys' love series.

500
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,240
But when it comes to me...

501
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
I don't want to break up with Fah, Babe.

502
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't want to break his heart.

503
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,120
I get it.

504
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,080
Have a rest for now.

505
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Okay?

506
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
[Muenfah: I've made it back to my place]

507
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,200
[Teerak: My brother's sleeping]

508
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,440
[Teerak: Don't you worry, okay?]

509
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
[Muenfah: Thank you]

510
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,000
Wow, these look really good.

511
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Babe, take your brother home
right after classes, okay?

512
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,400
Don't dawdle.

513
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,679
Okay.

514
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,280
Take the desserts with you.

515
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,199
I'll share these with Teerak
on the way to the college.

516
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,840
Bring all of them.

517
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,080
Give some to your friends as well.

518
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,889
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

519
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,000
I'll go check on him.

520
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
Are you happy

521
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
seeing him like this?

522
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
If it makes him happy,

523
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,680
we should be, too, shouldn't we?

524
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,160
Yes.

525
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,980
I'm doing all of this

526
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,420
because I care about him.

527
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
I know you do,

528
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,000
but the way you're expressing it

529
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
might be hurting him.

530
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,920
I want you to think about this again.

531
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,920
Please.

532
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
[Punlee: I'm at the college]

533
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
[Punlee: Right here]

534
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
[Ghlaijai: That's on my way]

535
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
[Ghlaijai: I'll come to you]

536
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,720
Rak!

537
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Hey, Rak!

538
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,400
What's wrong?

539
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,640
Why the long face?

540
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,120
My dad doesn't like Fah.

541
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,440
He wants us to break up.

542
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,760
Shit...

543
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,760
Are you serious?

544
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,240
Does Fah know about this yet?

545
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,640
What's wrong, Teerak?

546
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,020
- His dad wants him to break up with Fah.
- What?

547
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Teerak, are you okay?

548
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,840
I believe you and Muenfah
can go through this.

549
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
Right now, the greatest support you have

550
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
is being there for each other.

551
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,920
Thanks.

552
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,320
You're amazing, Saggy Cheeks.

553
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Answer it.

554
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,600
Talk it out with him
to figure out the solutions.

555
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,320
Yes, Fah.

556
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,040
Are you at the college now?

557
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,170
You weren't mad at my dad, were you?

558
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I wasn't.

559
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,720
I understand him.

560
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,280
He wants us to break up.

561
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,840
And do you want to break up with me?

562
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,240
I don't.

563
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
I don't want to hurt you.

564
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,240
I think...

565
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,960
I'm going to talk about us with my dad again.

566
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,840
It may have been a little too sudden.

567
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,440
That's why he didn't understand me.

568
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,920
If I can explain it to him again,

569
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,920
though it may take some time,

570
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
he will understand me.

571
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,920
If you can't do it alone,

572
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,040
let me help you.

573
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,240
I'll hold your hands
and go through this with you.

574
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm willing to do everything for you.

575
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
I'll do anything to keep us together.

576
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,520
I love you so much, Fah.

577
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
I really do.

578
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,280
I love you, too, my love.

579
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,120
- Oh.
- Hello.

580
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
- Hi, you're back?
- Hello.

581
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,640
How was your day? Are you tired?

582
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,160
Let's have dinner.

583
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,280
I'm not hungry, though.

584
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm going to bed.

585
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,160
Have dinner.

586
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,920
Don't be headstrong and childish.

587
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,480
Come on.

588
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,400
Are you going with Dom this week, Babe?

589
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,320
Yes.

590
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Okay, so...

591
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,800
I'll take Rak to college
and bring him back home.

592
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,080
Dad,

593
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,960
I want to talk to you about Fah.

594
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,280
I told you I didn't want to talk
about this again, didn't I?

595
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,480
Dig in.

596
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,080
Why are you being so hard on your kids?

597
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,480
They're mature now.

598
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,040
Just physically, and I'm not okay about it.

599
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,440
You two understand me, don't you?

600
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,840
I'm doing this because I care about you.

601
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Yes, Dad.

602
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,120
I'm not leaving the town this week.

603
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,360
Stay with me, both of you.

604
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Come on.

605
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,440
Rak!

606
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,320
I'll pick you up right here
after your classes, okay?

607
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,440
Yes.

608
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,040
Study hard, okay?

609
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,630
You want any help?

610
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,160
I do that every day.

611
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,920
Let me help, okay?

612
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,000
If you want to do anything for me,

613
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I just want you to hear me out.

614
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,920
I want you to listen to me

615
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,040
- that Fah and I...
- Rak,

616
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
we're not going to talk about this.

617
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,480
Teerak,

618
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,360
come with me to buy a leash for Mookrob.

619
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,880
You should go. I have to stay with Dad.

620
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,800
Come with me.

621
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,750
I can't.

622
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,760
Come on.

623
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,600
No.

624
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,600
Come with me!

625
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,600
Him.

626
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,600
Dad,

627
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,000
can Rak come with me?

628
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Well...

629
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,800
Go with Babe so that she won't be alone.

630
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,480
Am I allowed to leave the house?

631
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,640
Well...

632
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,160
If you want to, yes.

633
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,320
Okay.

634
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,040
Okay!

635
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,960
Let's change our clothes.

636
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,280
Thanks, Dad.

637
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,600
Babe, is Teerak okay?

638
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,200
Not really.

639
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,440
Dad won't let him go anywhere.

640
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,880
Teerak,

641
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,360
do you want to go somewhere?
I can take you there.

642
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,760
It's okay. I don't think Dad will be mad.

643
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,880
I want to go to an art gallery.

644
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,600
An art gallery?

645
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,680
Okay.

646
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,160
Let's go there.

647
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,640
Come on, we'll take you there.

648
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,440
What kind of art do you want?

649
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,880
I want something...

650
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
[Babe: We're here; come in]

651
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Right here.

652
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,880
Wow, there are so many paintings.

653
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Are you guys not coming with me?

654
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,140
I want some meatballs.

655
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,840
You go first. We'll be right back.

656
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,880
We're coming later.

657
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,480
Yeah.

658
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,840
Okay.

659
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,560
I don't like it when he's sad.

660
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,880
Yeah, hopefully, he can smile today.

661
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,160
Thanks.

662
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,400
It's okay. Friends always help each other.

663
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,440
Please help him feel happy again.

664
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,880
You should go in there.

665
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,320
We'll stroll around in the meantime.

666
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,760
"Good Bye My Love."

667
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Fah...

668
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,160
I miss you so much.

669
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,960
So do I; I miss you a lot.

670
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,120
Let's go.

671
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,440
Go where?

672
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,840
Let's go paint something.

673
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,280
You're taking me here to paint?

674
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,440
Yes.

675
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,580
I want you to be free from worry.

676
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,080
Seeing you...

677
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,080
has made me feel a little bit less worried.

678
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,520
But if you get to paint,

679
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,960
I think it'll make you feel better,

680
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,080
right?

681
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,120
You're amazing at this.

682
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
Thanks.

683
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,840
Does it look like you?

684
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,400
Mm.

685
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,520
Do you feel better?

686
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,960
I'm a lot better,

687
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,280
but I'm the happiest

688
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,320
cause I get to see you.

689
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,600
I'm happy to see you, too.

690
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,840
I'm glad I asked Babe for help.

691
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,360
You planned this with Babe?

692
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,360
Yes.

693
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,720
I asked her to bring you to me

694
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,680
cause...

695
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
I missed you so badly.

696
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,600
I'm sorry.

697
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,600
Dad wouldn't let me explain about us.

698
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,000
Are you tired?

699
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
No.

700
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,280
I won't give up on us.

701
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,060
Let me know if you're tired,

702
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,360
okay?

703
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
Hi, Dad.

704
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,000
Well...

705
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,050
Hold on.

706
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,040
About Rak...

707
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,240
You understand me, don't you?

708
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,360
I'm doing all of this

709
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,600
because I want him to have a perfect family

710
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,360
and be with someone he loves

711
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
who's nice

712
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,000
and can make him feel happy.

713
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Is Muenfah not nice, then?

714
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,320
Well...

715
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,560
It's not like that, but...

716
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
I'm scared.

717
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,490
Picturing them...

718
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,960
in the future, I'm scared...

719
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,600
no one would be there to take care of him.

720
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,680
Our son is mature now.

721
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,920
He should be allowed
to decide the direction of his life.

722
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,360
I know you're scared,

723
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,240
but the perfect life

724
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,600
you're talking about

725
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,960
isn't something to push on Teerak right now.

726
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,360
At this moment,

727
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,560
he needs more experience.

728
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,360
Don't you see

729
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,640
how happy he is right now?

730
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,040
Are you not happy

731
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,640
seeing your son like that?

732
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
I agree.

733
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,440
It's true that he's still young,

734
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
but supporting him from a distance

735
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,640
and being there for him when needed

736
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,320
is a better choice, isn't it?

737
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,630
So you think this is okay?

738
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,120
Why do you think I don't?

739
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,320
Rak's still my grandson

740
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,080
and your son!

741
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,040
He's still the same!

742
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,760
If I were you,

743
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,360
no matter who you want to be,

744
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,280
I would be there for you.

745
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,240
Rak's your son.

746
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,840
You need to know

747
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,080
what you can do for him.

748
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,880
If you're concerned about Muenfah,

749
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,200
and if you're scared

750
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,440
or wondering if he's a bad guy,

751
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,560
only time will tell.

752
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,280
Think about this carefully.

753
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,160
Think about what it is that you truly want.

754
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,760
I know you're disappointed.

755
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,480
So am I.

756
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,000
But he's our son.

757
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,640
About this,

758
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,680
it's not anyone's fault.

759
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,080
It's not your fault to be disappointed,

760
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,280
but he's not wrong
for making his own choices, either.

761
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,160
He's a nice guy.

762
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,440
He's sweet.

763
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
You should be proud of that.

764
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Let him make his own decisions, alright?

765
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Please.

766
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,300
Please.

767
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,500
Please.

768
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
Okay.

769
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,320
I get it now.

770
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,160
Good, son.

771
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Did Babe tell you

772
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,160
she'd leave with Dom?

773
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
Yeah.

774
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,080
So...how were your classes?

775
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,160
They were fine.

776
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,040
Who was that, walking here with you?

777
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,360
I only saw his back.

778
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,920
It was Muenfah.

779
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,520
You've known him for a long time now?

780
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,320
Yes, it's been a long time,

781
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,920
but we got closer when...

782
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,080
he helped me.

783
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:32,610
Helped you?

784
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,560
You know I didn't know how to say no, right?

785
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,880
I would feel bad to ask for someone's help.

786
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,240
But several times, it brought me...

787
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,240
problems.

788
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,960
However, Fah taught me to be braver

789
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,640
and care more about myself.

790
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,280
My life's happier because of him.

791
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
I know.

792
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,120
Listen.

793
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,840
I'm sorry, honey.

794
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,320
I'm sorry

795
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,080
for not listening to you.

796
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,880
I didn't care if you were happy or not.

797
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,040
I want to see you smile again.

798
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,720
I want you to feel happy again.

799
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,160
Alright,

800
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,160
from now on,

801
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,280
if there's anything you want to do,

802
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,280
go for it

803
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,840
and follow your heart.

804
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
It's just that...

805
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,080
If Muenfah hurts you one day,

806
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,320
you need to tell me.

807
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,080
Thank you for understanding me

808
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,560
and accepting me for who I am.

809
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,480
Does my hair stink?

810
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,120
You're my son.

811
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,280
It never does.

812
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,480
Dad kissed me on the head.

813
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Give your mom a hug.

814
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,440
I'm so happy.

815
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,360
- I really am.
- Thank you for understanding me.

816
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,200
You're my son;

817
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,120
of course, I understand you.

818
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,640
I'm happy for you.

819
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,080
I really am.

820
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,840
Thank you.

821
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,000
Yeah.

822
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,000
Now that you guys understand each other,

823
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,880
should we invite Muenfah to dinner tomorrow?

824
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,800
Whoa, tomorrow?

825
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,480
I have to work tomorrow.

826
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,280
Come on, you can just go to work

827
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,200
and come back to have dinner together.

828
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,280
Okay!

829
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,990
I'll tell Fah about this.

830
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,720
Sure.

831
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,680
I'm happy for you.

832
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,270
Aww.

833
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,680
You're so sweet.

834
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
What?

835
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,160
Hey.

836
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,250
- Dad...
- Babe!

837
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,250
Oh, Babe.

838
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,640
What's wrong?

839
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,880
- Don't cry.
- Are you all good now?

840
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,320
- Come on. Don't cry.
- Yes.

841
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,760
Honey, don't cry.

842
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,680
- Come on. Let's hug.
- Come here.

843
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,520
[Teerak: Are you free tomorrow?]

844
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,960
[Teerak: My mom invited you to dinner]

845
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,440
[Muenfah: I am; are you okay?]

846
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,640
[Teerak: I'm more than okay]

847
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,880
[Teerak: I'll call you tonight]

848
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,160
Grandpa!

849
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,390
Grandpa!

850
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,720
Grandpa.

851
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,360
Hello.

852
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,440
He is unconscious.

853
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,680
Yes, the address is 11/11.

854
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
Please hurry up.

855
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,319
Taking our family for granted is frightening

856
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,080
since we often don't realize...

857
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,840
how much we neglect them.

858
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,200
Muenfah,

859
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,560
please make him feel happy.

860
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,040
I promise

861
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,680
to make him the happiest person.

862
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,800
The New Year is just a week away.

863
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,960
Should we get our families together?

864
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,720
I was gonna ask if you have any plans.

865
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,920
I no longer want to go there with you...

866
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:43,399
as a friend.

867
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,359
Muenfah is lucky to have met Teerak.

868
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,720
They're both lucky to have found each other.

869
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,930
I'm thankful

870
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,640
you came into this world for me to love you.

871
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,279
Thank you, too,
for being with me through all of this.
