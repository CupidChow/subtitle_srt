1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,960
I'm afraid my dad might not be okay with it.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,280
You know how fearsome and strict he is.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,320
Men being together?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,320
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,160
Believe me!

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,000
- Break up with him!
- Do I have to?

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,340
I don't want to break up with you.

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,240
I'll hold your hands
and go through this with you.

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,900
I know you're disappointed.

10
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,100
So am I.

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,340
But he's not wrong
for making his own choices, either.

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,260
Let him make his own decisions, alright?

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,610
I'm sorry, honey.

14
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,660
for not listening to you.

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,480
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you for understanding me.

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,140
You're my son;

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,240
of course, I understand you.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,710
Grandpa!

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,880
Grandpa!

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Grandpa!

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Grandpa!

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Grandpa.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,920
Hello.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,200
Someone is unconscious.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
Yes, the address is 11/11.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,200
Please hurry up.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,800
- Grandpa!
- Yes.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa!

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,520
- Please hurry up.
- What happened?

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,870
Grandpa.

31
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,180
I just called an ambulance.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,760

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
Mom, how's Grandpa?

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,760
He's still in there.

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,079
I'm sure he will be okay.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,020
How's Dad?

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
We're still waiting. He's in there.

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
- And...
- Here she is.

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,480
- Is there a family member of Mr. Kan Nirun here?
- Yes, that's me.

41
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
I'm his son.

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
How is he?

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,960
The patient's safe and stable,

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,200
but the doctor has decided
to admit him for monitoring.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,710
- Okay.
- Anyway, please come this way.

46
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,630
Yes, okay.

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
Just a few more days,

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,240
and if everything's alright,
he can go home.

49
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,079
Please avoid letting him stay in the sun
for too long.

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,170
Thank you so much, doctor.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Thank you.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Goodbye.

53
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
I'll go get some food.

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
Do you have anything in mind?

55
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,190
We're getting some food.

56
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,230
Wanna come with us?

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,520
We'll catch up with you later.

58
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you still in shock?

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,840
It's okay.

60
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,780
Muenfah,

61
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
thanks a lot for today.

62
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,880
Without him, I have no idea
what would've happened to Grandpa.

63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Actually, your son takes after you in this way,

64
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
never showing weakness to anyone

65
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,560
except the one he loves,

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,800
and showing strength to the world

67
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,070
not to worry anyone.

68
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Why...

69
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,960
don't you take him to Grandpa?

70
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,310
Can I?

71
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
You're more than welcome to.

72
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,670
Thank you.

73
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
There's no need to stay at the hospital.

74
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,560
It's normal for someone this old to fall.

75
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,280
You need to stay here for now,

76
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,120
and when you're back,
I won't let you water the plants anymore.

77
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
That'll leave me with nothing to do,
feeling awfully lonely.

78
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,680
I'll stay with you tonight.

79
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,640
You should be with your mom.

80
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
What about Mookrob?

81
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
I bet our house is a mess now,

82
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
I'll stay with you, then.

83
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,360
Right, that's great.

84
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,630
I'll be with you, too.

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
You've got work to do.

86
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
- What?
- Go finish it.

87
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
You can come by tomorrow.

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,660
Then...

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
can I stay with you and Teerak?

90
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
Right, that's nice.

91
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,160
So there's someone with Rak here.

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
Hold on, how can he stay?

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,070
He didn't bring any clothes for tonight.

94
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,919
For Teerak's clothes and stuff,

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I can ask Dom to go get them.

96
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,390
- Right?
- Uh...

97
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes.

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,280
I'll go get yours, too.

99
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,840
Make sure you let your family know.

100
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay, thanks.

101
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
That's settled, then.

102
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,440
If I had gone home,

103
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
all of this could've been avoided.

104
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
You should stay here near the doctor.

105
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
I'll be with you, too.

106
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,760
No one thinks it's a big deal.

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,070
And you won't feel lonely.

108
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
Thanks.

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,830
I was in shock, so I forgot to tell you this.

110
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you, Fah.

111
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
Without you,

112
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
I wouldn't be able to get myself together.

113
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,930
He's always been healthy.

114
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
Every day, he would be watering the plants,

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
taking Mookrob for a walk,

116
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,320
or...playing chess all alone in the yard.

117
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,680
However,

118
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,080
taking our family for granted is frightening

119
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,170
since we often don't realize...

120
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,960
how much we neglect them.

121
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Watching him live his life alone

122
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,880
and hearing him
play with Mookrob every morning became so normal.

123
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,300
But today,

124
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
I had no idea.

125
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
I didn't hear him.

126
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
If you weren't there...

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
It's not your fault, Teerak.

128
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,140
It's not anyone's fault.

129
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,920
I believe...

130
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,040
no one wanted this to happen.

131
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
How about this?

132
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
If you and your family let me,

133
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I'll play chess with Grandpa,

134
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
so he won't be lonely.

135
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you.

136
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,610
Your family is my family, too.

137
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,040
Come here.

138
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,960
Who's watching who here?

139
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,120
Uh...

140
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
I think he'll be up soon.

141
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Do you want to eat anything else?

142
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
I'll go grab some food for Teerak.

143
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
He'll be hungry when he wakes up.

144
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, this is enough for me.

145
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,170
Okay.

146
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
I'll be right back.

147
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,080
Hey, Muenfah?

148
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
Oh, hello.

149
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,580
Oh...

150
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,520
You bought them, too?

151
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
Yes.

152
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm afraid Teerak will be hungry when he's up.

153
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,880
These are also for him.

154
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,730
Thanks a lot for taking care of him

155
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,760
and my family.

156
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
It's my pleasure.

157
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
Fah!

158
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
Hi, Dad.

159
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
- This looks so good.
- How are you doing?

160
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm all good. I wanna go home.

161
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
You'll get to go soon.

162
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,980
You're healthy and strong.

163
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Hey, Rak.

164
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,200
If he's allowed to go home tomorrow,

165
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,040
Mom'll cook a big meal to celebrate that.

166
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,640
- Really?
- Yes.

167
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,640
That's nice.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Muenfah,

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,240
if you're free tomorrow, join us.

170
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,720
Okay.

171
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm free.

172
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,420
Here. That's good.

173
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,040
Eat up, Grandpa, so you'll get stronger.

174
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,640
I've never felt stronger.

175
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,490
And where's Dom?

176
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,640
He's not joining us?

177
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
He has to be with his family today,

178
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
- so he couldn't come.
- I see.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,870
Muenfah, eat up.

180
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,680
I even asked her to do her best.

181
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,540
It's to thank you for saving me.

182
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,120
You're welcome.

183
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,320
Right,

184
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,900
when you have time,

185
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,030
help me plant some trees in the yard.

186
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,390
It's my yard.

187
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,360
I don't care if the others won't let you,

188
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,600
but I do.

189
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,020
Have some protein, too.

190
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,000
Here.

191
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,880
Give some to Muenfah if that's too much.

192
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Give it to him yourself, then.

193
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
You're right.

194
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,630
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

195
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
Eat up.

196
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,620
Have some more if it's not enough.

197
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,370
Right, Muenfah.

198
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,180
After this meal, I want to talk to you.

199
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay.

200
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,840
We may not have had...

201
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,360
many conversations before.

202
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,440
First of all, thank you

203
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,200
for saving Grandpa.

204
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,770
You're welcome.

205
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
I'm willing to.

206
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,560
There's one more thing that's...

207
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,290
very important.

208
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:27,120
I've hurt you with my actions and words,

209
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,580
and I...

210
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:40,120
really hope you'll be able to forgive me.

211
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
I can't forgive you

212
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,320
since I was never mad at you.

213
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,200
I know you've done all of that

214
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
just because you love Teerak.

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,790
Thanks a lot.

216
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,720
Well...

217
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,520
In the past,

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,400
the only thing I cared about
was for him to be happy,

219
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,280
be in a complete family,

220
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,240
and find someone
who can love him as much as I do.

221
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,040
But I was wrong.

222
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,680
I can see it now.

223
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,790
Each person sees love differently.

224
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
You can care for Teerak,

225
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,840
and you've become his source of happiness.

226
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,640
Teerak's grandpa once asked me

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
what I wanted

228
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,790
and what my intention was.

229
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,680
Many answers just kept coming to my mind.

230
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,760
But I've found the right answer today.

231
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
It's simple, and it's the only one.

232
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I want Teerak to be happy.

233
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
That's all.

234
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,900
Muenfah,

235
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:32,380
please make him feel happy.

236
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,160
I promise

237
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,920
to make him the happiest person.

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't you guys worry.

239
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
Everything's gonna be okay. Trust me.

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
They're here!

241
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,480
Uh...

242
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,120
What did you guys talk about?

243
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,960
Nothing much.

244
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,870
I just told him

245
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,720
he's welcome to come over anytime,
as often as he likes.

246
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,690
So that means...

247
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
you're okay if we date?

248
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
Yes.

249
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,920
Yay!

250
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,360
- Thanks, Dad.
- Alright.

251
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,990
Care for each other, okay?

252
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,270
Fah,

253
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
what did you guys talk about?

254
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I wanna know.

255
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Your dad told me

256
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,710
he wanted nothing from me

257
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
but to see you be the happiest person.

258
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,480
I've never questioned

259
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
why your name means "the loved one."

260
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,600
It's because you're adored
by everyone in your family.

261
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm really happy, you know that?

262
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
So am I.

263
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,230
I'm thankful

264
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
you came into this world for me to love you.

265
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,140
Thank you, too,

266
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
for being with me through all of this.

267
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Fah,

268
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,430
kiss me on the head.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Please.

270
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,320
Kiss me on the head.

271
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,050
Please.

272
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,490
Can you kiss me on the head?

273
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,420
Fah,

274
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,680
come on.

275
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,250
Please.

276
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,400
Okay.

277
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,160
I did.

278
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,160
Yay, you kissed me on the head!

279
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,440
What is it, dear?

280
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,600
What do you want, kiddo?

281
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,930
Fah's told me what you said to him.

282
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,720
So?

283
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,160
Thank you so much
for caring about my happiness.

284
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,280
Last night, I slept better than I have in a while.

285
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,560
I love you a lot, Dad.

286
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,920
I love you more.

287
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,840
Having a good time, huh?

288
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,030
- Right.
- Let me see.

289
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,450
- He's being clingy.
- I love you, too.

290
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,500
There you go.

291
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,800
What about your sister?

292
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,410
I love you, too.

293
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,030
- Does it smell good?
- How nice.

294
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,470
- That's a lot.
- Guess who I'm giving them to.

295
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,400
These...

296
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,840
You guys were hugging.

297
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,610
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

298
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,650
- Hello.
- Hi.

299
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
I've prepared lunch boxes for you,
Babe and Dom.

300
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,840
This is for you, Teerak.

301
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Thank you.

302
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,160
Muenfah.

303
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,220
[Muenfah]

304
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,850
- Thank you.
- Alright.

305
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,120
You should get going now, or you'll be late.

306
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,730
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

307
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,370
- Thank you so much.
- Drive safely, okay?

308
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
- Don't rush, alright?
- Yes.

309
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,520
After you guys talked it out,

310
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,360
can you feel that he's so much happier now?

311
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,160
Thank you so much for figuring it out with him.

312
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
- That's so sweet of you.
- Okay.

313
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
Aren't you too calm now?

314
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,760
We're running late,
and we might not have time for breakfast.

315
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,760
I knew it; I knew you'd be complaining.

316
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
I've prepared it for you.

317
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,890
Here you go.

318
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,840
When did you buy this?

319
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I made it myself.

320
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Told you.

321
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,190
Whoever becomes my lover

322
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,630
is one lucky person.

323
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,620
Wanna become one?

324
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,800
What are you talking about? Hurry up.

325
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,560
Look at you.

326
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,000
There you are.

327
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,920
You gave it to me, didn't you?

328
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Tell me your heart's fluttering.

329
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Give it to me!

330
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
Is your heart fluttering?

331
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
Tell me it is.

332
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,860
Told you we had 20 minutes.

333
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,150
That's more than enough.

334
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,460
Whatever.

335
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,530
Oh, Lee!

336
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,440
- Oh...
- Hi, Real and Hia.

337
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,160
Is Fah not here yet?

338
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,920
What?

339
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
He's supposed to be with Teerak, isn't he?

340
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,520
There they are.

341
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,440
- Hey.
- Look at them.

342
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,360
Hello.

343
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,640
I'm happy that you're happy.

344
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,040
I've talked it out with my dad.

345
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,230
Seriously?

346
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,440
Whoa, congrats.

347
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,040
This calls for a celebration!

348
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,060
Let's have dinner at your bar.

349
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,900
Hey,

350
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,680
are you trying to get
a free meal or something?

351
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
Gosh, I'm just happy for him.

352
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
We need to celebrate this.

353
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
- Right?
- I'm also thinking about a celebration.

354
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
See?

355
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,940
What's the occasion?

356
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,920
I can't tell you yet. It's a secret.

357
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
- That's nice. Let's...
- No.

358
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,680
Let them go by themselves.

359
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,200
They're a couple, but who are you?

360
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Stop it.

361
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Come on, let's go to class.

362
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,280
Fine, see you.

363
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,240
Okay. I'll take Teerak to class first,
and I'll be right there.

364
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,820
Alright, Mr. Madly in Love.

365
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,540
Hold on.

366
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
What do you want?

367
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Take me with you.

368
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
Got it.

369
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,120
Come here.

370
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,050
See you.

371
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,600
- Let's go. I'll walk you there.
- Okay.

372
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,730
Let's go.

373
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,520
Right,

374
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,160
Fah...

375
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,040
are you really taking me to a celebration?

376
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,960
Yes.

377
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Where?

378
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,360
I can't tell you that. It's a secret.

379
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,560
Are you coming or not?

380
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,190
- Yes, right?
- Let's go.

381
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,680
Ghlai.

382
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,530
Oh, why are you here?

383
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,660
I'm here to see you.

384
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,200
I was gonna ask

385
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,640
if you have any plans for the New Year?

386
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,720
If you don't,

387
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,610
I want you to come with me.

388
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,880
Can you?

389
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,500
Teerak told you to ask me?

390
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,160
No, he didn't.

391
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,730
It's me

392
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
who wanted to ask you that.

393
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,570
If it's you, I'm alright.

394
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Is that a yes?

395
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,090
Yes.

396
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,360
Are you going somewhere?

397
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Mm...

398
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,230
I think I'm going to a supermarket.

399
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
I ran out of shampoo.

400
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
I know a good shampoo brand.

401
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
- GO HAIR?
- GO HAIR.

402
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,320
Teerak also told you about that?

403
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,370
No.

404
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,520
I think we read each other's mind.

405
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
Fah, come on.

406
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,980
Is this the secret you talked about?

407
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,400
I knew it since we were in the car.

408
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,390
Do you like it?

409
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
I do!

410
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,910
You know what?

411
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,800
I've always loved the view
of the sky meeting the sea,

412
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,440
but now, it means so much more to me.

413
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,080
Why is that?

414
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,210
Because...

415
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,960
it reminds me of your tattoo.

416
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
Which one do you like better:
me or my tattoo?

417
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
I love you,

418
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
so I like your tattoo.

419
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
But...

420
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,240
I like you better.

421
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Uh...

422
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
Wait, Fah!

423
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll go into the sea.

424
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
Hold on.

425
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,080
Aren't you going to change?

426
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,880
Well...

427
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,560
Why do I need to?

428
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,400
It's too sexy. I'm jealous.

429
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,560
Um...how about this?

430
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,520
Hey!

431
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,280
You'll be naked, then.

432
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Isn't that great?

433
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,000
That way, I'll get to show my tattoo, too.

434
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,930
Well...

435
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I'd like to be the only one who sees it.

436
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,420
Fah!

437
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Let's get into the sea.

438
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,660
Come on.

439
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,060
Anyway,

440
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,000
the New Year is just a week away.

441
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,850
Should we...

442
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,640
get our families together?

443
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,270
Sure.

444
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,220
Can I invite my friends, too?

445
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,250
Yes.

446
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,070
How about...

447
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,020
having dinner with our families first

448
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,860
and hanging out with our friends at night?

449
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,330
Does that sound good?

450
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,920
Sure, so we're having dinner
with our families first.

451
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,910
Okay.

452
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,980
Here you go.

453
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,560
You'll get drunk drinking that much alcohol.

454
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,190
It's okay. I'm allowed to drink it.

455
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,560
Are you turning red because of this,

456
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,120
or is it because of me?

457
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,130
Your pickup lines are a lot better now.

458
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,920
They're only for you.

459
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,680
What is it?

460
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Whoa.

461
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,030
Do you feel dizzy?

462
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,400
It's just that...

463
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
I can feel the heat in my cheeks.

464
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,960
Can you still feel it?

465
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,660
Do you want me to help cool you down?

466
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
How?

467
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,420
Will this...

468
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,790
cool me down

469
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,420
or heat things up?

470
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,080
Muenfah,

471
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,080
you're so gorgeous.

472
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,760
How come you're mine?

473
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,780
You're right.

474
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,390
I'm all yours.

475
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,440
You belong to me.

476
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,410
That means...

477
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,800
I can do whatever I want with you, right?

478
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,240
[Love]

479
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,220
Honey,

480
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,920
is Babe not home yet?

481
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,520
She's on her way.

482
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,960
- Dom's taking her here.
- I see.

483
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,440
Hey,

484
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,920
New Year's approaching.

485
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,780
- Mm.
- Where should we hold a party this year?

486
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,440
- Right.
- Right.

487
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,080
Wait, I forgot.

488
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,480
Fah asked me to invite you all.

489
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,270
Invite us to?

490
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,920
He wants our families to meet

491
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
on New Year's,

492
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,120
so I suggested hosting it at our place.

493
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,850
That sounds good.

494
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,320
Aren't you going to party somewhere else?

495
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,350
I want to have dinner with you all first,

496
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,280
and I'll meet up with my friends at night.

497
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,920
What do you guys think?

498
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,390
What do you think?

499
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,040
That's fine by me.

500
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,840
Okay, deal.

501
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,050
OK.

502
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,730
That's settled, then.

503
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,780
Okay.

504
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,440
[Sunday, December 22, 03:22 P.M.]

505
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,040
- Hey.
- What?

506
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,800
That's a big bite.

507
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,510
Rak!

508
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,300
Where are you going?

509
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,760
Well,

510
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,160
Rak's become a homebody recently.

511
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,960
[December]

512
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,650
I think he's working on something, though.

513
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,950
It's suspicious.

514
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,720
What is he doing?

515
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,120
It's been days.

516
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,760
How would I know that?

517
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
I'm right here with you.

518
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,250
What are you doing with that phone?

519
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,470
Texting someone?

520
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,680
I'm getting you a concert ticket.

521
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
You want it, don't you?

522
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
That's fine, then.

523
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,640
What? You're jealous?

524
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Nope.

525
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Hey, but...

526
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,050
for this concert,

527
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,850
I no longer want to go there with you
as a friend.

528
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,830
And?

529
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,320
You know what I mean.

530
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
I'm not listening.

531
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,120
Will you be my boyfriend?

532
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,700
What? I didn't hear you.

533
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,520
I said, "Will you be my boyfriend?"

534
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,800
Don't you think you should've asked me nicely?

535
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,680
Hia,

536
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,720
will you be my boyfriend, please?

537
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,440
Yeah.

538
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
What?

539
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
I won't say that twice.

540
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,600
Yeah, I do.

541
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Fah,

542
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,240
I'm taken.

543
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,320
Hey, baby, where are you going?

544
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,200
Hello, Teerak.

545
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
What are you doing?

546
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,440
I'm reading about the benefits
of this GO HAIR serum.

547
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,040
My mom bought it for me.

548
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,720
This will stop my hair from stinking.

549
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,070
And...

550
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,320
I'm thinking of you.

551
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,600
So am I.

552
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,100
Have you brought up the New Year's party
with your parents yet?

553
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,800
I have, and everyone's okay.

554
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,840
You?

555
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,360
My family has agreed as well.

556
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's nice.

557
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,670
I can't wait.

558
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,520
Let's go.

559
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,080
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.

560
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,920
- Hi.
- Good evening.

561
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,240
These fruits are for your family.

562
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,480
Thanks, Mom.

563
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,760
I actually asked Lee to join us,

564
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,520
but he has to go with his friend.

565
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,020
That's okay. I get it.

566
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,160
Let's get inside, shall we?

567
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,080
Everything's set up in the yard.

568
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,920
We're sorry to bother you.

569
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Please don't be. It's my pleasure.

570
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,340
Please make yourselves at home.

571
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,380
Let me know if you want anything.

572
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,870
All the dishes look fantastic.

573
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,000
Fah always says
this family cooks amazing food.

574
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,320
I'll have to ask for your recipe one day.

575
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,400
I'm willing to give it to you.

576
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,440
Seeing the kids happy

577
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,920
puts my mind at ease.

578
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,600
That's all we want as a parent.

579
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,560
Muenfah is lucky to have met Teerak.

580
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,120
I was worried
that he wouldn't open up to anyone.

581
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,850
Thought he would end up alone.

582
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,120
Whoa.

583
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,520
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

584
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,520
Let's say...

585
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,910
they're both lucky to have found each other.

586
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,880
Let's dig in, shall we?

587
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,400
The kids will hang out later, too.

588
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,040
- Oh, yeah?
- That's right.

589
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,480
You guys can leave after this meal.

590
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,720
Dad and I will stay here

591
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,360
and talk to Teerak's family.

592
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,720
Please.

593
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,140
Sure. Don't worry.

594
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,990
Let's eat.

595
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,720
Alright, let's have our dinner now.

596
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,080
- Please enjoy.
- Let's eat.

597
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,480
What should we try first?

598
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,100
This one.

599
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,760
- What is it?
- Satay...

600
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,640
- Here.
- What is it?

601
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,040
- Wow!
- Okay.

602
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,400
Okay, take some.

603
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,280
- Should Grandpa take some first?
- Grandpa, grab some.

604
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,080
- Sure.
- Here you go.

605
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,200
Here you are.

606
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,480
- Do you want some sauce, too?
- Thank you.

607
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,310
Have some, Dad.

608
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

609
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

610
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,080
Rak, here.

611
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,640
Let's get changed,

612
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,760
or we'll be late.

613
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,840
No one takes longer than you.

614
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Hurry.

615
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,160
Come on, I've already put on my makeup.

616
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,820
- Fah.
- Yes?

617
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,840
I have a surprise for you.

618
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,080
What is it?

619
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Here!

620
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,200
Do you like it?

621
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,350
I love it.

622
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,720
Right,

623
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,680
I also have a surprise for you.

624
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Show me.

625
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,280
Not yet.

626
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,120
What?

627
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,120
I'll show you when we're on the cruise.

628
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,260
Okay.

629
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,720
Let's go get changed, shall we?

630
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,790
Let's go.

631
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,030
Where are your clothes?

632
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
In the car.

633
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,590
Why is it taking so long? I'm starving.

634
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,990
Jeez, why would you be upset?

635
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,560
I told you to have some food before we came,
but you didn't listen.

636
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,680
Can you stop being so fussy now?

637
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,560
I've never been mean to you,

638
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,800
but you're going too far.

639
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
Fine,

640
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,960
I'll let you have something tasty tonight.

641
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,960
After the party, though.

642
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,400
Tempting me and running away,

643
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,320
lover boy?

644
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,060
What's wrong with it?
I'm trying to be hard to get.

645
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,440
What's really on your mind?

646
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,760
"Calm down, Hia.

647
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,400
You can't let him get you that easily."

648
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,360
Wait, no.

649
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,760
I heard all of that.

650
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,480
It's surprising you're acting this way.

651
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Keep doing it, okay?

652
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,080
It's adorable.

653
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,680
Do you like it?

654
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,640
It makes my heart skip a beat.

655
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,320
What do you think?

656
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,880
I'm the best.

657
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,500
Give me a reward, big boy.

658
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,040
When it comes to you,
I have no reason to say no.

659
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,440
I'm willing to do anything,

660
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,040
asshole.

661
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,240
So you can speak your mind now?

662
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,830
It should be me saying that to you.

663
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,680
Our communication skills are improving,
and so are our kisses.

664
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,260
When did you set all of this up?

665
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,400
It's a secret.

666
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Do you like it?

667
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,520
It's beautiful.

668
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,400
I've got you a gift.

669
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,760
[A gift for "Teerak"]

670
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,000
♫It feels like the same old,
same old, familiar days♫

Yes, I did.

687
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,160
I made this for you.

688
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,040
Thank you so much.

689
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,170
I really like it.

690
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,930
There's one more thing I have for you.

691
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,440
Is this for me?

692
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Yes.

693
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,520
Try it on.

694
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,560
Thank you so much.

695
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,800
Thank you, too, for agreeing to be my boyfriend.

696
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,640
Not just "agreeing."

697
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,320
I love you.

698
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,990
I'm into you.

699
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,230
Whether it's a bright day or a stormy one,

700
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,130
through every high and low,

701
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,520
you'll always be my sky.

702
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
From now on,

703
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,320
I'll call you...

704
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,000
my "Sky."

705
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,060
So...

706
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,120
I'll call you my "Sea."

707
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,320
I never wished for anything on New Year's,

708
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,860
but this year,

709
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,640
I wish for us to wake up together
every morning,

710
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,360
share smiles every day,

711
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,320
and stay together

712
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,840
through every moment, good or bad.

713
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
I love you, my Sea.

714
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,320
I really do.

715
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,960
I love you so much, too, my Sky.

716
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:42,400
What are you doing?

717
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,760
Look at that, Fah.

718
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,480
They're stunning.
