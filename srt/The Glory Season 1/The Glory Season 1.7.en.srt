1
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,363
The left side should be a bit lower.

2
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,365
Mr. Jeong, a little bit to the left.

3
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,034
Maybe pull it to the right...

4
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,953
JOO YEO-JEONG PLASTIC SURGERY

5
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>My hand might touch you.</i>

6
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,340
Don't get startled.

7
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,066
I was at the car repair shop,
and a button on my sleeve fell off.

8
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,318
I crawled on the floor

9
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,904
like a crazy woman.

10
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,742
Ugly, right?

11
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,828
My scars.

12
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,871
They're injuries.

13
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,839
If you ever collapse again,
call me so you don't make it worse.

14
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,925
I've also hit rock bottom before,
so I understand

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,386
the weight of your anger.

16
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,894
Hold on. I'll put on a new button for you.

17
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,489
Here.

18
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,673
Just trust me.

19
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,467
My sewing is better
than most tailor shops'.

20
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,189
Who was the person

21
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,692
that you wanted to beat
by learning Go from me?

22
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,240
<i>This device is switched off.
Please leave a message.</i>

23
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,921
You were here?

24
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,715
I thought you didn't come home at all.

25
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,258
I'm going to work now!

26
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,224
What is this?
A sudden trip down memory lane?

27
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,310
I'd never have imagined
you digging this out by yourself!

28
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,645
High school friends, right?

29
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,068
That's before Hye-jeong got
her nose and boobs done!

30
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,654
I should've gotten a boob job too.
Should I get one?

31
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,156
Is Son Myeong-o not in this picture?

32
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,076
I wonder where he is.

33
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,498
By the way, how do you know Myeong-o?

34
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,291
Do you see them often?

35
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,627
Jeon Jae-jun or Son Myeong-o.

36
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,755
Sometimes.

37
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,675
I do my fittings at Jae-jun's shop.

38
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,345
But I haven't been able to reach
Myeong-o lately...

39
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,432
Ugh, this is so embarrassing!

40
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,935
He tends to do some weird stuff sometimes.

41
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,147
Did he threaten you or something too?

42
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,565
What did he say?

43
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,612
This doesn't seem normal.

44
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,948
When I mentioned Son Myeong-o,

45
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,159
you and your friend both asked
if he threatened me.

46
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,037
Drive safe.

47
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,143
RECENT DESTINATIONS
PLATINUM CC

48
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,395
He met with Jae-jun?

49
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,908
<i>It's Ha Do-yeong,</i>

50
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,453
the CEO of Jaepyeong Construction.

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,371
He's Yeon-jin's husband.

52
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,374
The perpetrator's husband?

53
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,006
When my revenge ends someday,

54
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,594
I don't want Yeon-jin
to have anybody left by her side.

55
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,265
Not her friends, parents,
daughter, or husband.

56
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,434
Nobody.

57
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
She must have no love left.

58
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,409
Did you win the Go match?

59
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,704
I won,

60
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,374
thanks to a good teacher.

61
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,715
The passcode to the front door is 3724.

62
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,098
It might take months or years,

63
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,517
but let's play a match again.

64
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,147
I'll make one move, and you'll come back
one day and make your move.

65
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,359
Then I'll know that you were here.

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,196
It's okay if you don't call me
or pick up my calls.

67
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,948
But keep in touch that way.

68
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,033
That's all I need.

69
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,955
Then I'll do whatever you say
like it's a royal command.

70
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,666
Anything at all.

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,045
I'll show you a wild sword dance.

72
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,728
YEONHWADANG

73
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,191
-Write your name here.
-Okay.

74
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,571
-They say this shaman is good.
-Really?

75
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,206
Excuse me.

76
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,210
Do a lot of young women usually come here?

77
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,254
This shaman must be good.

78
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,965
I don't know. This is my first time here.

79
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,218
But according to my friends
who've been here before,

80
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,262
this shaman provides
a fundamental solution.

81
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,222
"Fundamental"?

82
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,726
Next.

83
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,561
Kang Hyeon-a?

84
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,148
Kang Hyeon-a?

85
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,233
Yes! Kang Hyeon-a!

86
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,651
Right here. That's me.

87
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,744
It's an oil stain. Will it come out?

88
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,828
Sure it will.

89
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,334
You want a new button here, right?

90
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,837
I'll just...

91
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,549
leave it as is.

92
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,098
A plant has been sent to congratulate
Dr. Joo's private practice,

93
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,976
and these are letters
that were addressed to the hospital.

94
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,894
Okay.

95
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,438
That brat.

96
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,191
Maybe he sent me his credit card bills.

97
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,760

SERIAL KILLER KANG ARRESTED ON SITE

100
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,901
TO DR. JOO
HELLO, THIS IS KANG YEONG-CHEON

101
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,905
YOUR FATHER WAS GOOD

102
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,325
THE SMELL OF BLOOD WHEN I PIERCED HIS NECK
THE VESSELS BURST, HIS EYES TURNED RED

103
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,160
Son of a bitch...

104
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,834
That son of a bitch!

105
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,277
One hundred and eighty-two centimeters

106
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,238
and 75 kilograms...

107
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,850
Let's at least stick
to the rules, Dong-eun.

108
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,562
Why did you pick
such a holy place to rob me?

109
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,606
Well, I like this place.

110
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,236
I feel like your Father who art in heaven
will be a witness for us.

111
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,660
I don't have to count, do I?

112
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,913
God, you used to be fucking nothing.

113
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,584
Now that you've got some schooling,
you've become a fucking bitch!

114
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,170
I'll get going, then.

115
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,339
This fucking bitch has somewhere to be.

116
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,134
Hey! You can't go to heaven anymore.

117
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,094
But I can.

118
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,973
I've repented for all that I did to you,
and I've been saved.

119
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,689
You've got good connections.

120
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,691
Okay.

121
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,986
You should go to heaven when you die

122
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,322
because your life here will be hell.

123
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,118
What do you mean by that?
Are you not done with me yet?

124
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,369
Let go of me,

125
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,499
or I'll call your father from his office
and appoint him as our witness instead.

126
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,085
Hey, you little...

127
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,171
Answer me. Hey.

128
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,672
Hey!

129
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,593
Damn it!

130
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,435
Are we having our session here?

131
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,021
You'll take an assessment test today.

132
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,483
It's very simple, so don't be scared.
Come out when you're done. I'll wait.

133
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,151
What kind of assessment test is it?

134
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,656
I'm going to have you study abroad
in the United States.

135
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,740
Study abroad?

136
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,244
Something unexpected came up,
so I can't tutor you anymore.

137
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,247
That's why I want to find
a better teacher for you.

138
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,250
Wow.

139
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,294
Isn't that too big of a lie?

140
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,548
How will you send me to study
in the United States?

141
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,049
Are you rich?

142
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,969
Yeah. I just came into some money.

143
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,932
Come in.

144
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,978
TAIL - DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY?

145
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,197
You were awesome today, Ye-sol.

146
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,824
Just like Sonny.

147
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,082
But the kid with the pink socks

148
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,628
doesn't seem to understand "fair play."
Someone can get hurt.

149
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,422
Number two, Kim Ji-uk?

150
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,718
Yeah. He always tackles people.

151
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,846
Really?

152
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh, right!

153
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,101
Dad, we have an open house
at school next Friday.

154
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,185
It's just for dads.

155
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,938
But it's okay if you can't come.

156
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,565
A busy dad is a good thing.

157
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,902
No way.

158
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,238
Of course I will be there,
no matter how busy I am.

159
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,327
Oh, Ye-sol.

160
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,579
Can I ask about your homeroom teacher?

161
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,832
Mom doesn't seem to like her very much.

162
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,834
What about you? Do you like her?

163
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,669
But why? She's a friend.

164
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,296
A friend?

165
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,048
Whose friend?

166
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,258
My teacher is Mom's friend.

167
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,386
They went to the same high school.
Why wouldn't she?

168
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,307
<i>Ha Do-yeong?</i>

169
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,101
Why are you asking
about Yeon-jin's husband?

170
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,104
Just wondering what he's like.

171
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,273
I realized I don't know a thing.

172
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,525
He's nice, but he's a son of a bitch.

173
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,987
You always see assholes like him
in first class.

174
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,658
They think of flight attendants as maids
who can speak a bit of English.

175
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,288
Fuck. Do you have any idea
how many people I beat to get the job?

176
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,290
This is a new one from Vera Wang.

177
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,792
It's a mermaid cut,

178
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,795
so perfect for brides
who have a beautiful figure like you.

179
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,053
What do you think? Is it pretty?

180
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,555
Totally my type.

181
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,641
So,

182
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,435
what exactly is a <i>nice</i> son of a bitch?

183
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,354
How is that different from me?

184
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,023
You're an obvious son of a bitch.

185
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,110
But, Ha Do-yeong, how should I say this?

186
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,113
You have to look closely
to tell he's a son of a bitch.

187
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,824
He's not trying to be one either.

188
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,326
He's just used to ordering
people around all his life.

189
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,372
Oh, that explains
the damn look he gave me.

190
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
Did you meet Yeon-jin's husband? Why?

191
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,086
Does he know about you and Yeon-jin?

192
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,047
Hye-jeong.

193
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,758
Yeah?

194
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,261
Even if he knew,
you still wouldn't have a chance.

195
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,556
You should know that by now.

196
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,976
However, the dress does look great on you.

197
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,729
You really should get married.

198
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,482
You'll never meet another man at your age
who lets you wear a Vera Wang.

199
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,819
Oh, make sure to ask your guy
which hotel he had his last wedding at.

200
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,905
They might give a discount
to a regular customer.

201
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,165
He's not the groom?

202
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,753
Would you like to try on another dress?

203
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,465
You said this is the most expensive one.

204
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,259
Just get it altered.
The chest is so freaking tight!

205
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,571
Son of a bitch.

206
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,798
It's bigger than Yeon-jin's.

207
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,592
It's bigger, so what's the problem?

208
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,269
Snow White even lived with seven men.

209
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,771
Why?

210
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,982
Because they dig gold from the mines!

211
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,652
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE THAT BASTARD MYEONG-O LIVES?

212
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,226
<i>-The person you're trying to reach...</i>
-Damn it!

213
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,895
<i>Where are you? You're not at home.</i>

214
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,689
<i>Did you meet with Do-yeong?</i>

215
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,067
<i>Your golf club address
was in his car GPS...</i>

216
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,655
JAE-JUN SENT A NEW MESSAGE

217
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>Can you look for my watch if you go there?</i>

218
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>He lives at 34-9 Eulseo-ro, Jongno-gu.</i>

219
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>Don't know the code.</i>

220
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
INCOMING CALL
JAE-JUN

221
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,509
Why haven't you picked up? Where are you?

222
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,928
Weren't you ignoring my calls first?

223
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,765
I was busy. Did you see the texts?
Let's meet. Where are you?

224
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,477
Let's talk later. I'm out of town
for a family gathering.

225
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,482
Ye-sol!

226
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,075
Ye-sol.

227
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,005
Sorry.

228
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,258
I'm just happy to see you.

229
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,261
I know how to cross the road too.

230
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,264
Never mind. Where's Mom?

231
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,184
Oh, I'm by myself today.
I came to see you.

232
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,437
What do you like?

233
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,399
Gaming consoles? Dolls?

234
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,318
I like stocks.
Samsung Electronics or Kakao.

235
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,196
I'm just kidding.

236
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,616
Mom told me to say that
if anybody asked me that question.

237
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,290
Wow, an eight-year-old understood
a joke like that?

238
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,457
Wow, you're frea...

239
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,504
Very smart.

240
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,051
You're such a genius, Ye-sol.
I wonder who you take after.

241
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,643
Who the fuck does that in a school zone?
I'll cut those damn hands off.

242
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,562
Can't you see there's a child here?

243
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,239
I've made up my mind.

244
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,742
Just now.

245
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,703
I'll protect you from now on.

246
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,499
I love you, Ye-sol.

247
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,424
Ugh, it smells!

248
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,678
What the hell is this?

249
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,931
Did he run away or give up halfway?

250
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,436
What an idiot.

251
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,105
He actually stole Jae-jun's stuff?

252
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
Holy shit!

253
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,947
Bitch, you should be at church!

254
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,492
You see, you can pray anywhere, anytime.

255
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,745
I was wondering who would come.
Turns out it's Sister Hye-jeong.

256
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,956
You crazy bitch!
Why do you even want to know that?

257
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,960
The perpetrator always returns
to the scene of the crime.

258
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,878
Don't you know?

259
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,298
Shut it. Was Myeong-o not here?

260
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,467
-Did you make this mess?
-Yeah.

261
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,719
"Knock, and it shall be opened."

262
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,554
So I knocked, and it really did.

263
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,098
Look. My prayers are answered.

264
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,058
Shoo, you'll make me smell.

265
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,977
Damn it, I really need to see him.

266
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,064
If he comes to my wedding
with some weird pictures,

267
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,232
I'll be totally fucked!

268
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,442
Why would he try so hard
to screw you over?

269
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,444
Because he couldn't have me.

270
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,114
Do you know what he said over the phone?

271
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,365
No clue.

272
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,158
I think he went on a trip.

273
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,243
A trip?

274
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,745
"Vladivostok"?

275
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,247
Why are you going to Russia?

276
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,250
Oh, did you actually decide
to become a dog?

277
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,418
A sled dog?

278
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,335
What?

279
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,046
So, he was serious about Russia?

280
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,382
Why didn't he go, then?

281
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,176
Oh fuck! Is it really because of me?

282
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,304
-He didn't go?
-Well, you're holding his passport.

283
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,520
Why the hell do you scream all the time?

284
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,605
I can see that the lights are on!

285
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,691
Come on. Open the door!

286
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,235
Didn't you say you were in a hurry?

287
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,530
People are asking to see your room.
Why don't you pick up your phone?

288
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,662
What is it? What's the big deal?

289
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,873
-We went to Myeong-o's place!
-He might be dead!

290
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,749
One at a time. What was that?

291
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,376
Myeong-o's gone missing.

292
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,212
We went to his house.
The landlord can't reach him either.

293
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,299
He was going to move out.
He packed up and bought a plane ticket.

294
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,051
-It's just weird.
-Then, report it to the cops.

295
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,679
Why did you call me instead?

296
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,931
Report? What do you mean?

297
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,934
You can't call the cops
just because something is weird.

298
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,187
Yeah. Sa-ra's right about that.

299
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,273
I'm getting married soon.
I can't go to a police station.

300
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,275
Well, why did you call me here, then?

301
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,569
I need to head out
with the production truck!

302
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
I mean,

303
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,910
didn't Myeong-o call any of you guys
before we lost contact with him?

304
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,212
Well, I called him quite often.

305
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,130
He's Jae-jun's driver.

306
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,717
When do you mean?

307
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,055
Around October 19th or 20th.

308
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,516
Why do you want to know?

309
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,853
I got a super weird call from him!

310
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,731
So I was wondering if he called you too.

311
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,818
What was so weird about it?

312
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,487
I got a call too.

313
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,824
You did, right? What did he say to you?

314
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:40,038
I don't know. He said something stupid
about sending a gift, so I just hung up.

315
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,456
I wasn't in my right mind either.

316
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,625
So, you got a gift?

317
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,131
Fuck, he asked me out!

318
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,718
The asshole told me that he loves me
and asked me to visit him in Russia!

319
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,720
Does he think I'm crazy or something?

320
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,723
Oh, I'm getting pissed off
just thinking about it!

321
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:03,562
I mean, how could he dare to like me?
Does he really think he's on my level?

322
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,993
You must've wronged him big time
for him to have done that!

323
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,329
-You got punished!
-That's so freaking funny!

324
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,747
I'm leaving.

325
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,584
I'll be on the news truck,
so don't try to call.

326
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,253
No wonder.

327
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:32,340
So that's how you knew the passcode
to his house, "696969"!

328
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,093
What about you, then?
How did you know the passcode?

329
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,930
I've been there a couple times.
I just don't remember how I got there.

330
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,932
I'm rooting for you two.

331
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,851
Fuck, it's not like that!

332
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,983
<i>Saturday, three in the afternoon.
Locker number C7.</i>

333
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,026
<i>Passcode, 4885.</i>

334
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,365
STORAGE AND DELIVERY

335
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,999
RÉSUMÉ
AN JEONG-MI

336
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,418
Ms. An Jeong-mi?

337
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,047
Yes. Nice to meet you.

338
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,592
I've heard a lot about you.
Looking forward to working with you.

339
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,677
You too.

340
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,763
I'm looking forward to it.

341
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,598
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

342
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,351
Very good.

343
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,187
I'm sleeping well,
and I've started working out.

344
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,024
I heard you opened a practice
in Semyeong. Congratulations.

345
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,442
Thank you.

346
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,447
I regret not listening to you sooner
when you told me to change my environment.

347
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,866
That's good. How are you eating?

348
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,536
There are great restaurants in Semyeong.

349
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,581
Does it still comfort you
when you listen to the bubbling sound

350
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,375
of effervescent vitamin tablets?

351
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,296
I'm here to say goodbye.

352
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,173
I won't be coming again.

353
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,010
It's a two-hour round trip,
and we meet only once a month.

354
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,470
Is it too difficult for you?

355
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,390
It's not because of the distance.

356
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,644
It's just that
you weren't able to fix me at all.

357
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,221
<i>So, what kind of shit
are you in this time?</i>

358
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,306
Watch your mouth, asshole.

359
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,308
It's not shit this time.

360
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,398
There's something
really small and precious.

361
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,194
-I want to take it from someone.
-<i>Something small and precious?</i>

362
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,362
A jewel?

363
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,447
Hey, are you stealing things now?

364
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,033
I'm the one who got robbed
for fuck's sake.

365
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,662
Buddy.

366
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,872
Listen closely.

367
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,085
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

368
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,212
No. It's impossible.

369
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,048
-You can't get the kid.
-Why can't I?

370
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,050
Why not? I'm her father.

371
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,386
You're her biological father,
not her father.

372
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,974
A child who is born during a marriage
is legally considered to be the couple's.

373
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,892
Therefore, her father is Ha Do-yeong.

374
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,397
Fuck, that's nonsense.
I ran the DNA test and everything.

375
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,441
It was a 99% match. Isn't that science?

376
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,235
Why did you waste your time on it?

377
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,321
Even if it were 990% instead of just 99%,

378
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,824
as long as the legal father
doesn't abandon the child,

379
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,534
you're in second place forever.

380
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,247
Son of a bitch. Shouldn't you still
try to file a lawsuit or whatever?

381
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,624
I'm saying you can't even file a lawsuit

382
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,126
because you're a third party.

383
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,962
Who are you calling a third party?
I'm the father, damn it!

384
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,881
Shit.

385
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,800
What kind of a fucked-up law is that?

386
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,345
You can only file a lawsuit
if the legal parents

387
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,931
were obviously unable
to have a child at the time,

388
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,185
like one of them was locked up
in prison or on a business trip.

389
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,229
Is that a possibility?

390
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,318
No. They are freaking lovebirds.

391
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,570
Then, is the father abusing the child?

392
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,408
If so, why would I have called you, idiot?
I would've gone to the cops.

393
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,576
Well, then.

394
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,122
The best-case scenario for you right now
is not a lawsuit.

395
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,957
It's the mother's divorce.

396
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,669
Because child custody
is a whole other matter.

397
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,384
Divorce?

398
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,511
I went to the shaman's shop,

399
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,014
but I haven't found anything promising.

400
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,267
I'll go there a couple more times
and then tell you.

401
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
And...

402
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,939
You're not pulling out more eggs, are you?

403
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,608
Oh, not at all! I'm working here!

404
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,485
What's that over there?

405
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,573
You know, about the rental car guys.

406
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,910
We've actually got something this time!

407
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,790
STORAGE AND DELIVERY

408
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,466
<i>I followed them from the storage lockers,</i>

409
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,969
<i>and they drove down
Bukbu Expressway for a while.</i>

410
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,473
<i>Then they went into a motel in Namyangju.</i>

411
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,563
<i>And just when I was wondering
if I should just go back,</i>

412
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,400
guess who showed up.

413
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,531
Yes!

414
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,325
It's the cop who visits the shaman
with Yeon-jin's mother.

415
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,411
They're all on the same side!

416
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,996
Amazing, right?

417
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,000
You know, I don't even get scared anymore.

418
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,169
So, I've been thinking.

419
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,338
If I'm ever born again,

420
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,840
I want to become a spy.

421
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,386
Then I'm going to put on red lipstick
and wear a cool leather jacket.

422
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,056
You can put on red lipstick
in this lifetime too.

423
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,975
I don't think that Son Myeong-o

424
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,310
has simply gone missing.

425
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,646
No way, me wearing red lipstick?

426
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,025
He's not gone missing?

427
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,528
Wait, do you think
that Son Myeong-o has actually...

428
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,281
died?

429
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:58,161
I think these men are Yeon-jin's thugs
who take care of things

430
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,912
outside the law.

431
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,248
The cop is not the one
helping Yeon-jin out,

432
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,834
but Yeon-jin is the one
helping out the cop.

433
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,547
Wait, then by "outside the law," you mean...

434
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,340
Yeah.

435
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,968
That's why Myeong-o disappeared.

436
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,973
Myeong-o acted by himself
because he couldn't trust me.

437
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,725
He even got a plane ticket,

438
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,145
which means he definitely met
with Yeon-jin.

439
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,189
And then he disappeared.

440
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,484
What now?

441
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,491
What did you want from Myeong-o, ma'am?

442
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,290
We're in the same boat now.

443
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,960
Which one of them killed So-hee?

444
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,053
Park Yeon-jin.

445
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,726
Nice one!

446
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:05,853
But...

447
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,108
I'm sure Yeon-jin also knows
that So-hee is at Joo Hospital.

448
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,862
Do you have any proof?
Can you prove that Yeon-jin did it?

449
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,120
So-hee was holding this in her hand
when she fell that day.

450
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,123
PARK YEON-JIN

451
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,378
Why do you have this?

452
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,841
Were you there that day?

453
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,261
Now you were there too.

454
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,350
Because we're in the same boat.

455
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,227
Wow.

456
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,646
Fucking hell!

457
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,404
This is insane!

458
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,365
I think I'll ask for a billion won!

459
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,118
Call me when you set up a date
with Yeon-jin.

460
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,953
I'll give you this tag on that day.

461
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,416
No matter how much money you get,

462
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,293
that money is all yours.

463
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,255
I want something else.

464
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,466
Something else? What is it?

465
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,636
Park Yeon-jin's confession.

466
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:26,350
If Myeong-o managed to get the money,
that would have been her confession.

467
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,980
Myeong-o said
that he would record everything for me.

468
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,026
Oh, but

469
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,821
you said that the incident
was ruled as a suicide.

470
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,074
Do you think
that her confession could change things?

471
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,453
That's why I wanted
to make her a social pariah.

472
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,748
My chances are slim in a legal fight.

473
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,000
I wanted to let the world know

474
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,836
about what she did with her confession.

475
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,383
I wanted her to feel like
she was burning for the rest of her life,

476
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,510
with pus oozing from her wounds.

477
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,640
So she wouldn't be able to laugh, eat
or live another day in peace.

478
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:13,231
Does this mean
you can't get her confession anymore?

479
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,611
It's not like we can go look
for Son Myeong-o's corpse.

480
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,779
What should we do?

481
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,242
We need to find him first.

482
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,285
How?

483
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,704
Just relax.

484
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,256
What will the test results tell me?

485
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,425
It's a 12-panel STD test,
so it will catch most things.

486
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,678
Since you added an HPV test,

487
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,305
you'll see results
for resident flora and STIs too.

488
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,809
Nothing else will show up, right?

489
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,480
Here are the papers that you asked for.

490
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,233
Family Relations,
College Graduation Certificate,

491
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,026
and my ob-gyn examination results.

492
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,281
You could have just texted them.
Who carries around paper copies nowadays?

493
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,950
I'll take a look at these.

494
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,996
-Which bank do you use?
-Excuse me?

495
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,082
I won't be able to stand it
if you have a bunch of debts.

496
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,502
Just tell me which bank,
and I'll take care of the rest...

497
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,379
Ms. Moon?

498
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,840
Ms. Moon!

499
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,304
Oh my, it's so great to see you!
How long has it been?

500
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,140
You've gotten even prettier!

501
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,395
Choi Hye-jeong?

502
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,819
Do you two know each other?
That's my son's girlfriend.

503
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,905
Oh, we went to the same high school.

504
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,118
Oh, I guess I can't act
quite as friendly to you anymore.

505
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,870
What are you talking about?

506
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,622
What she does has nothing
to do with you, Ms. Moon.

507
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,082
You're hurting my feelings!

508
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,752
We're going to eat dinner at the temple.

509
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,754
If you have time, you should join us.

510
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,672
Sorry, I have plans today.

511
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,176
So, you're getting married?

512
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,261
Congratulations.

513
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,770
I'll make sure to come earlier next time.

514
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,356
Sure. Go ahead!

515
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,195
I wish she was marrying Tae-uk.

516
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,911
I'm stuck with this brat.

517
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,623
By the way, why didn't you even say hello?

518
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,084
Ms. Moon looked happy to see you!

519
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,173
Well, it was so sudden,
and we weren't very close.

520
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,134
Just one moment, please.

521
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,519
Dong-eun!

522
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,271
We didn't get to talk back there, did we?

523
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,025
My God, what a coincidence!

524
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,360
It's good to see you.

525
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,906
Can I have a word with you right now?

526
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,160
Shall we?

527
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,292
What on earth have you been up to?

528
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,795
And why won't you take my calls?

529
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,797
Do you know
how many times I've called you?

530
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,923
Seventeen times.

531
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,676
Speaking of, Yeon-jin,

532
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,429
do you have anything to tell me?

533
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,848
What do you mean?

534
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,851
Why the hell did you meet Do-yeong?

535
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,853
You really don't have anything to tell me?

536
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,521
Don't change the subject!

537
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,566
Who arranged the meeting? You or Do-yeong?

538
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,451
I didn't ask to see him first.

539
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,039
Your precious Do-yeong came to me
and asked where the fuck Myeong-o is.

540
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,208
And I'm asking you a question too!

541
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,671
Do you really have nothing to say?

542
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,632
Like what?

543
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,594
Dong-eun being Ye-sol's new teacher?

544
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,808
Okay, that too.
But I'm talking about something else.

545
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,560
Something else, what?

546
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,813
Tell me exactly what you want to know...

547
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,569
Are you crazy?

548
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,780
You're the one who's crazy.

549
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,325
How dare you raise my daughter
as Ha Do-yeong's?

550
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,494
Choose your words wisely.

551
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,205
Did you find out
after you gave birth to her,

552
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,625
or did you know it
before you gave birth to her?

553
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,171
I'm just curious, that's all.

554
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,842
I want to know if you kept your marriage,
knowing that you had my kid.

555
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,177
And why you left me again

556
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,137
if you knew the truth.

557
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,140
I want to know...

558
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,144
if you've ever loved me.

559
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,361
If you break a vessel in my eye,
I can't go on TV tomorrow!

560
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,334
-Ji-won.
-Yun-seo.

561
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,877
Hey, Han-sol!

562
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,006
Hi, Han-sol's friend!

563
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,354
Seo-u!

564
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,323
I've been seeing a lot of you lately.

565
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,199
At this rate,
we're going to be best friends.

566
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,619
What are you doing here?

567
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,832
I actually have a secret love child.

568
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,338
Just kidding.

569
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,007
A friend from school is here.

570
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,805
Not one of the parents.

571
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
Nice to meet you all.

572
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,119
I'm Moon Dong-eun,
the homeroom teacher for Class 1-2.

573
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,377
I'm friends with her.

574
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
Class 1-2 teacher, Moon Dong-eun.

575
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:42,888
I've heard...

576
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,767
that you all went
to Yeon-jin's high school.

577
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,936
Yeon-jin told you that?

578
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,979
Well, those two weren't friends.

579
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,357
I'm guessing she was
friends with you, then?

580
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,278
You could say we were close friends
who knew everything about each other.

581
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,739
I know her well.

582
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,660
I know what her bare skin is like
underneath her clothes.

583
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,960
Oh, I'd like to ask you something.

584
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,130
Have you ever...

585
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,217
had something precious taken from you?

586
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,318
We will now begin our class open house.
