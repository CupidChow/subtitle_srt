1
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,358
YEONHWADANG

2
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,364
Wow, that sunset...

3
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,742
It's amazing.

4
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,951
Did you buy that
with the money you won from me?

5
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,913
This one I got with my own money.

6
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,207
Would you like some?

7
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,381
Is that the only gambling you do?

8
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,178
There was one time
when I bet my entire life on something.

9
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,804
Did you win?

10
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,223
I'm planning to.

11
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,732
Do you live near here? I've seen you
at the Go club a few times.

12
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,358
Do you live nearby?

13
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,904
Not far. Do you work around here?

14
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,782
Aren't you hungry? Or do you not like food
from convenience stores?

15
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,202
It's not that. I'm just watching my carbs.

16
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,541
I haven't found out
a single thing about you.

17
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,543
Are you usually so full of questions?

18
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,961
Normally,

19
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,923
I keep quiet, believe it or not.

20
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,306
Why do you like to play Go?

21
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,979
Because I like that
you have to fight to the death in silence.

22
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,942
I also like that, for you to win,

23
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,153
you need to destroy the territories
that your opponent carefully built.

24
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,631
Why don't we play together
from time to time?

25
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,593
Now I know what you like to eat
and how you like to play.

26
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,514
JAEPYEONG CONSTRUCTION
CEO HA DO-YEONG

27
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,932
I'm Ha Do-yeong.

28
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,146
Next time, bring more money when we play.

29
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,482
You won't eat this, right?

30
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,969
Is that your breakfast?

31
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,932
You come here every morning.

32
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,727
Do you ever cook for yourself?

33
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,147
Have you eaten yet?

34
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,401
Do you work at Semyeong Elementary?

35
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,945
I noticed the sticker on your car.

36
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,697
You have a nice job.

37
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,164
Can I ask you about something as well?

38
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,751
You're the owner
of Semyeong Real Estate, right?

39
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,671
I think I saw you there
when I first visited to look for a place.

40
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,965
Yeah, that was me.

41
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,093
While living here,
I realized that my place

42
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,180
is a lot cheaper
than the other apartments around here.

43
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,515
Why is that?

44
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,852
Isn't it good that it's cheap?
Why do you ask?

45
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,271
Teachers aren't paid very well.

46
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,525
Back then, you couldn't have known
that I was a teacher.

47
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,034
I'm sorry for asking
about something like this,

48
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,619
but...

49
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,580
is that apartment haunted?

50
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,749
Huh?

51
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,714
Until now, I thought
you had no sense of humor.

52
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,799
That's rich.

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,220
Make sure you take your trash with you
when you head back down.

54
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,438
<i>These are the receipts for parking, gas,
and other expenses this month.</i>

55
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,483
<i>Sorry, it seems like
revenge is pretty expensive.</i>

56
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,449
MONTHLY PARKING FEE

57
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,743
GAS MONEY

58
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,661
OTHER EXPENSES

59
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,331
<i>I spent my twenties tutoring
so that I could spend money on this.</i>

60
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,251
<i>I've got plenty saved up, so don't worry.</i>

61
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,930
<i>Following them around, I've found
that Hye-jeong is the easiest to read.</i>

62
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>She's always on her phone.</i>

63
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,643
<i>I've been thinking
about stealing her phone.</i>

64
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>I think I'm pretty talented...</i>

65
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,157
I THINK I'M PRETTY TALENTED

66
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>Will it be possible?</i>

67
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>Just leave it to me.</i>

68
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,207
<i>By the way,
did you meet Park Yeon-jin yet?</i>

69
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,334
<i>Everything went smoothly, right?</i>

70
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,468
<i>Shall we meet up?</i>

71
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,640
Were you scared? Intimidated?

72
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,727
You should have crushed her spirits
like a piece of scrap paper!

73
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
I did something.

74
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,816
That's good. I'm glad.

75
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,194
I'm proud of you.

76
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,863
I was so worried about you.

77
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,910
You know Park Yeon-jin's mom?

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,454
The photo came out a little blurry.

79
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,416
She visited the shaman this month too.
Every other week as always.

80
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,667
With the same man again.

81
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,588
I thought that they might be dating,
but they leave in separate cars.

82
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,797
They arrive separately too.

83
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,134
There must be a reason
if there's a pattern.

84
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,553
Let me know if you find out anything.

85
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,515
And did you

86
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,518
happen to tail this person?

87
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,478
Tail him?

88
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,522
Don't follow this man.

89
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,942
I didn't tell you this
because it might scare you,

90
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,527
but that guy's a cop.

91
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,947
Before, when I first met him,
he was the chief.

92
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,658
He's a senior superintendent general
at Bukbu now.

93
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,078
He's fallen behind his classmates,
who are now chief superintendents.

94
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,913
How did you know that?

95
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,874
Didn't you see the receipts
from the <i>seolleongtang</i> diners?

96
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,670
I picked four <i>seolleongtang</i> diners
in front of the agency and waited there.

97
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,550
When you threatened me
the first time we met,

98
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,012
I had no idea how scary you really are.

99
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,847
Me?

100
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,606
Don't put yourself in danger.

101
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,236
Yeah, I won't.

102
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,990
Oh, can you look here for a second?
Think of it as work.

103
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,116
Wait, I...

104
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,506
What? Is something wrong? Are you okay?

105
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,508
I'm so sorry.

106
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,013
I'm great at taking pictures
of flowers and birds now,

107
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,182
but my hands start sweating
when I try to take pictures of people.

108
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,857
It's okay.

109
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:12,945
Take another.

110
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,959
I'll try it one more time.

111
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,953
Oh my!

112
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,289
It's your first Gucci, Ye-sol!

113
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,335
Do you like what Grandma got you? Hmm?

114
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,587
"Babies can't tell the difference."

115
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,215
"She won't even be wearing that
for a month."

116
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,132
Right?

117
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,968
Sorry?

118
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,805
You're living like that
because that's how you think.

119
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,808
A different start takes you
to a different destination, you know.

120
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,977
-Go get a new nanny.
-Sure.

121
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,732
Your paycheck and other fees
will be deposited into your account.

122
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,401
Thanks for your work.

123
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,829
Keep these clothes safe, and make sure
she carries them on her milestone days.

124
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,332
It will remind her to try her hardest
like she did when she was born.

125
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,168
Just as I did for Do-yeong.

126
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes, of course.

127
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,715
Oh my!

128
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,342
Ye-sol, honey,

129
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,094
say "Grandma" for me.

130
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,929
Say "Grandma."

131
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,182
I'll make sure Ye-sol never has to

132
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,561
try her hardest for anything.

133
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,410
How have you been, Mr. Principal?

134
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,829
If you're free, can I meet with you?

135
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,206
Yeah, right now.

136
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,958
The homeroom teacher, Ms. Moon?

137
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,377
Director Kim recommended her.

138
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,382
The school was in a bit of a tight spot,
since Mr. Yang quit so suddenly.

139
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,550
Hold on.

140
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,596
Are you telling me that Dong-eun
knows the director personally?

141
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,389
How?

142
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,391
I can't say for sure.

143
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,896
Well, does that mean
she didn't have the qualifications?

144
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,897
That's not the case.

145
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,900
We've done our own research,
and she has a great résumé.

146
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,236
It's odd though. It's rare
for a teacher from a public school

147
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,738
to transfer to a private school.

148
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,739
I see.

149
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,202
Could I possibly take
a peek at her résumé, then?

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,038
Well.

151
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,500
We have to be careful
with private information nowadays.

152
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,044
Of course. I know. I can't ask that.

153
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,381
So maybe you could just happen
to be holding her résumé,

154
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,592
and I could just steal a glance.

155
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,469
How does that sound?

156
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,062
Hey! You're doing it wrong!

157
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,399
You can't color it like that!

158
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,924
Ms. Moon, you need to use pink
to color cherry blossoms, right?

159
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,801
I can do what I want with my flowers.

160
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,345
My cherry blossoms
are transparent, you know.

161
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,347
There's no such thing.

162
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,767
Ms. Moon, Ye-sol's wrong, isn't she?

163
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,275
Seung-a's tulips look pretty
because they're full of color,

164
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,902
and Ye-sol's cherry blossoms look pretty
because they're empty.

165
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,154
I think they both look awesome.

166
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,045
Now, let's try to finish our drawings.

167
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,403
How much?

168
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,491
Stop with your bullshit,
and just ask me for money.

169
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,162
I'll give you as much as you want.

170
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,834
I'll compensate you for all
of the mental and physical damages.

171
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
You've made a fortune just now.

172
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,262
Do I need to write something?

173
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,099
"I'll never appear in front of you again
until the day I die."

174
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,852
I need that handwritten and signed by you.

175
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
Just like how your mom signed

176
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,732
your withdrawal letter.

177
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,153
I don't get why the likes of you
would take it out on the wrong person.

178
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,030
It was the parents who did the most harm.

179
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,325
Don't try to save face.
Tell me how much you want.

180
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,910
Wait.

181
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,581
You're not doing this to get
a sincere apology or something, right?

182
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,418
You'll be turning 40 soon.
Isn't that too much of a fairy tale?

183
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,170
It's all in the past!

184
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,715
So I can't do anything about it now.
Don't you agree?

185
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,637
Of course not.

186
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,722
Don't apologize.

187
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,352
I didn't bet my teenage years, twenties,
and thirties on this just for an apology.

188
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,187
You need to get punished.

189
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,275
Criminal punishment if God's on your side,
and divine punishment if God's on my side.

190
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,568
God?

191
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, so are we in scripture now
instead of a fairy tale?

192
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,408
What God?

193
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,159
Goddamn it!

194
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,246
You're holding my daughter hostage.

195
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,791
And what?
You think God will be on your side?

196
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,253
Holding her hostage?

197
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
Me?

198
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,798
What did I do?

199
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,593
Did I choke Ye-sol?
Did I hit her in the chest?

200
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,053
Did I slap her?

201
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,973
Or did I burn her
with something scorching hot?

202
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,934
What did I do to Ye-sol?

203
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,238
I actually tried to encourage someone
who lives in a world

204
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,408
where she can't understand
how the rainbow has seven colors...

205
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,325
HA YE-SOL

206
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,703
...or notice that a fruit is ripening.

207
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,874
Because colors don't matter
in my classroom.

208
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,459
But they might be

209
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,754
a slight disadvantage for you, that's all.

210
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,172
How...

211
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,385
How did you find out?

212
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm not going to do anything with Ye-sol.

213
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,015
I have a lot of other things I can do.

214
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,852
For example, parent-teacher meetings.

215
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,065
As you might know,
the mother isn't the only person

216
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,358
who comes to those meetings, right?

217
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,203
So never test me again

218
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,998
on how far I'm willing to go

219
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,668
or how far I could push you.

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,840
I want you to wilt away slowly,
over a long period of time.

221
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,471
Let's slowly wilt
and die together, Yeon-jin.

222
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm so excited right now.

223
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,198
What an interesting scene.

224
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,742
I wonder what that's about.

225
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,703
Hi, Bixby.

226
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,914
Call "Son of a Bitch."

227
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,460
<i>Calling "Son of a Bitch."</i>

228
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,546
SON OF A BITCH

229
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,383
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.</i>

230
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,635
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

231
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,054
Has that motherfucker actually lost it?

232
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,311
Mr. Jeon, a package just came for you.

233
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,981
-Here?
-Yes, sir.

234
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,649
Here, on this street?

235
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,444
What is this, <i>The Avengers?</i>

236
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,620
HA YE-SOL

237
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,748
What is this?

238
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,337
HA YE-SOL

239
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,467
It seems the secretary's office
is incompetent.

240
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,011
No outsiders should be allowed here.

241
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,346
Did you make a lot of money?

242
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,767
I like it when you're wearing
your work clothes

243
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,103
more than when you're wearing your suit.

244
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,938
It's sexier somehow.

245
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,610
You just put Zegna and Versace
out of business.

246
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,909
Do-yeong, should we just send
Ye-sol abroad for school?

247
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,036
What are you talking about?

248
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,331
Ye-sol is only eight years old.

249
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,627
There are professional guardians now.
Many kids are sent abroad early.

250
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,672
What's brought this on?

251
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,175
Do <i>you</i> want to go abroad?

252
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,552
It's not like that.

253
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,471
Then, it's even weirder.

254
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,475
You won't even let the nanny take her
to school without a driver,

255
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,268
and now you want to send her abroad?

256
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,022
Do-yeong, you've been golfing a lot
with Director Kim lately, right?

257
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,234
Can you help me meet with him just once?

258
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,862
Well, Ye-sol got a new homeroom teacher,

259
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,365
and she's crazy.

260
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,950
How is she crazy?

261
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,744
Crazy enough to get the director involved?

262
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,996
Give me some details.
I need more information than that.

263
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,458
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

264
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,378
I'm a bit emotional right now
because I'm feeling tired.

265
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,257
I'll go straight to work from Mom's place.
I'll call you.

266
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,648
Her finances, boyfriends,
and family members.

267
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,192
Friends, coworkers,
even her distant relatives.

268
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
Find out everything about her.

269
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,529
Good one!

270
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,657
Your mother broke 90 yesterday.

271
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,574
RÉSUMÉ

272
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,743
Moon Dong-eun. Who is she?

273
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,661
JAE-JUN

274
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,914
That's what I'm asking you to find out.

275
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,667
What I used to know about her
is meaningless at this point.

276
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,442
Effervescent vitamin tablets?

277
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,986
Yes.

278
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,905
You know how bubbles start coming up

279
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,408
when you drop a tablet in water?

280
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,661
I feel a lot calmer
when I'm listening to that sound.

281
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,749
And why do you think
that sound helps you feel calm?

282
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,920
It kind of sounds like a breeze
blowing through ginkgo trees.

283
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,757
It also sounds like raindrops
falling on a Go board.

284
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,928
When I keep listening to it,
I start to feel so lonely.

285
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,516
You know, something like that.

286
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,896
So your body's getting healthier,
but your heart is lonely.

287
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,358
You could try
changing up your environment.

288
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,526
Like moving somewhere new
or going on a trip.

289
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,278
I'll consider it.

290
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,281
I have patients to see as well.

291
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,784
You must be a good doctor.

292
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,078
You're always late for our appointments.

293
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,830
You get paid by the hour.
It's good for you that I'm late.

294
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,088
We'll have to run a CT scan to be sure,

295
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,674
but if it feels this hard,
there's a good chance it's an osteoma.

296
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,178
But it doesn't hurt.
Do I really need to get surgery?

297
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:12,057
You may not have any symptoms now,
but it could start hurting in the future.

298
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,016
I see.

299
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,436
If I do get surgery,
how long will I be in the hospital?

300
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm a schoolteacher,
so I'd like to do it during break.

301
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,609
The examinations and the surgery
will take about a week.

302
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,696
-So, you're a teacher?
-Yes.

303
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,699
At which school? What is it like?

304
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,952
I've seen vlogs
where teachers can't eat well

305
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,870
because they have to eat with the kids.

306
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,873
What about the kids?
Do they listen to you?

307
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,960
Are you a parent?

308
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,880
No. I'm not interested in kids

309
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,174
but in what it's like to be a teacher.

310
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,092
What?

311
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:22,169
SHANGHAI

312
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,859
Did you lose weight?

313
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,611
Yes, a little bit.

314
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,906
I told you to make sure
that your weight matches mine.

315
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,532
The fit's going to change!

316
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,368
-Do you want a bad performance review?
-I'm sorry.

317
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,290
Just return that one. Next.

318
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,416
Okay, Hye-jeong.

319
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,881
Get your weight back up
before your next flight.

320
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,219
If your weight changes again...
What the fuck is this?

321
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,763
What's wrong with my phone?

322
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,849
Did it get switched
with a passenger's phone?

323
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,392
How the hell would I know?

324
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,854
Call Incheon Airport quickly!
Ask if they have a lost phone.

325
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,772
Okay.

326
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,610
Aw, you've got to be kidding me!

327
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,075
Really?

328
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,210
Well, it was a piece of cake.

329
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,629
What else do you need? Tell me anything.

330
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,092
Great work. I'll see you next time.

331
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,594
Oh my, wait just a minute!

332
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,973
You act so cold every time I see you.

333
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,101
Eat before you go.

334
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,229
I thought we'd be meeting outside again.

335
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,898
I liked what we did last time.
It was like a picnic.

336
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,236
This is, you know,

337
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,405
something meaningful.

338
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,408
"The bird fights its way out of the egg."

339
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,202
"The egg is the world."

340
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,745
From Raemian.

341
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,664
Sun-a was reading it.

342
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,626
That bird can't fight its way out.

343
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,877
You've boiled it.

344
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,506
Also, Raemian is an apartment complex.
The book is called <i>Demian.</i>

345
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,512
I didn't boil it. I baked it.

346
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,349
Can't a girl get emotional
just because she's trying to get revenge?

347
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,188
Ouch! I had a bruise there!

348
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,110
I bet it'll bruise again.

349
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,406
<i>"Beloved,</i>

350
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,286
never avenge yourselves,
but leave it to the wrath of God,

351
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,999
for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine,
I will repay, says the Lord.'"

352
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,500
-Amen.
-Amen.

353
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,169
Let us pray together

354
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,088
while reminding ourselves
of His words from Romans 12:19.

355
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,256
Let us pray.

356
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,678
Loving Father,
I thank thee with all my heart.

357
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,390
You always embrace us with love
even though we are lacking.

358
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,934
Let us thank you again for your grace.

359
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,564
Lord, you always told us
to love our enemies.

360
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,569
But how many times have we tried
to love and care for our enemies?

361
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,990
We failed to live by your word
and treated them with hatred and grudges.

362
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,577
We pray that
you'll forgive us for doing so.

363
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,876
What's a shabby person like you doing
in a precious place like this?

364
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,673
Sa-ra, I'm honestly curious,
so let me ask you.

365
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,510
Do you actually believe in God?

366
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,345
Do you really?

367
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,307
What you just said is blasphemy.

368
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,060
Repent if you don't want to suffer
God's punishment.

369
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,187
-Really?
-Yeah.

370
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,364
Yeah, I just prayed
and reached an agreement with God.

371
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,116
He's fine with it.

372
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,494
You crazy bitch. You're crossing the line.

373
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,789
You don't give a fuck
because we're all grown up?

374
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,374
Watch your mouth, Sa-ra.

375
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,043
We are in the house of God.

376
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,545
One second.

377
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,051
Oh no.

378
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,015
Your God is super pissed off now.

379
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,686
He says you're going to Hell.

380
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,770
Hey!

381
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,690
Have you lost your mind? Are you high?

382
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,026
You're the one who's been taking drugs.
Lots of them.

383
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,570
Often too.

384
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,199
What's this fucking bitch talking about?

385
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,828
I'll give you 15 days.

386
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,373
Fill it with cash and wait for my call.
I want it in dollars.

387
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,291
Hey!

388
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,085
This is called blackmail,
you fucking bitch!

389
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,756
Do you know how many high-ranking cops
come to this church?

390
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,383
You've never been threatened before,
have you?

391
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,427
Hey, let go of me!

392
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,435
Shit!

393
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,022
I haven't even started to threaten you.

394
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,732
Sa-ra.

395
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,620
<i>Turn left at Gyodae Park intersection.</i>

396
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,374
GYODAE PARK

397
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,161
YEO-JEONG

398
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,372
<i>Did you save my number?</i>

399
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,833
<i>I'm making it easier for you
in case you didn't.</i>

400
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,418
<i>Also, my name is Joo Yeo-jeong.</i>

401
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,098
<i>There's going to be a heat wave today.
How are you doing?</i>

402
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,225
<i>It's snowing heavily today.</i>

403
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,519
<i>Walk carefully like a baby
so you don't fall.</i>

404
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,104
<i>Take care.</i>

405
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,940
<i>Did you see the sky today? It's so clear.</i>

406
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,776
<i>I hope you're staying healthy.</i>

407
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,663
CIALIS

408
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,049
TO: SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL
JOO YEO-JEONG

409
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,594
FROM: KANG YEONG-CHEON

410
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,308
Yeo-jeong, you got a text.

411
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,566
DONG! EUN! SENT A MESSAGE

412
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,322
Whoa, I think my phone's broken!

413
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,824
There's no way she texted back
after seven, eight years!

414
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,536
We did run into each other once, yeah.
But still, she replied?

415
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,872
Maybe I looked cool that day.

416
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,168
Oh, I see. That's right. I did.

417
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,795
Is Dong-eun married or not?

418
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,380
Hey, don't read that!

419
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,092
Why? What did she say?

420
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,055
Is it a wedding invitation?
Is she getting married? To whom?

421
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,100
She's getting a divorce, right?
Or is it a remarriage?

422
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,268
Is it?

423
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,313
She wants to know what Cialis is.

424
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,109
<i>What medicine is this?</i>

425
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,319
DONG! EUN!

426
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,243
-Let's talk in person. Where are you?
-Are you mad?

427
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,372
-The professor is coming soon.
-Oh, not right now.

428
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,207
Where will you be after seven o'clock?

429
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,735
Sorry if you were busy.

430
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,030
I got busy after your text.
I had to change my on-call schedule.

431
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,414
Have you been playing Go?

432
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,917
I win some money from time to time.

433
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,757
Are you still living in Seoul?
Or Semyeong?

434
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,552
How did you know that?

435
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,888
You said before that
you weren't working in Semyeong "yet."

436
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,518
So you're there now.

437
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,563
I'm working at Semyeong Elementary.

438
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,111
Are you close with that person?

439
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,655
-The one who uses that medicine.
-Not yet.

440
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,491
Oh, so that one's a "not yet" too.

441
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,873
I'm only going to say this once,
so listen closely.

442
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,376
Cialis is a drug that contains Tadalafil.

443
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,211
It has a very long-lasting effect.

444
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,129
And?

445
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,964
That'd be a nice thing.

446
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
Viagra is a similar product.

447
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,468
I know that.

448
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,389
Is it used for a purpose
other than the one we know?

449
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,934
What are the two purposes
that you're talking about?

450
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,313
Well, it could be used
in a different situation.

451
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,734
The word is, some people take it
to cure altitude sickness.

452
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,989
But from a doctor's point of view,
it's an erectile dysfunction medicine.

453
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,326
Does that man live in Semyeong?

454
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,036
Those are two different stories.

455
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,038
Meet a guy who doesn't need pills.

456
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,959
As a doctor, I'm a bit worried.
As a man, it gives me a lot of thoughts.

457
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,505
You've got it wrong.

458
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,261
You've become ruder
since the last time I saw you.

459
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,846
Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?

460
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,604
But you already knew

461
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,649
that the pill was just an excuse.

462
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,195
I did.

463
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,200
You can easily look up what Cialis is for.

464
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,118
But

465
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,621
I didn't know why you needed an excuse.

466
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,540
So I got a bit excited.

467
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,043
And although I don't know who he is,

468
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,546
"Does he have any other illnesses?"

469
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,257
"I hope every part of his body
is sick in some way."

470
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,802
That's what I thought.

471
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,771
I wanted to apologize.

472
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,858
Apologize?

473
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,404
I don't know
what you went through at the time,

474
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,823
but back then,

475
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,117
I was rude.

476
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,872
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

477
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,092
But hey,

478
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,761
why does your apology sound

479
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,347
like a farewell to me?

480
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,983
It is, isn't it?

481
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,613
You're telling me to stop texting you now.

482
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,074
But why?

483
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,703
You don't even text back anyway.
Am I that unattractive?

484
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,872
Yes, I don't like you.

485
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,790
You're not my type.

486
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,500
No way.

487
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,135
I don't know what you've got going on.

488
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,097
I really don't know why you're doing this.

489
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,391
But just do it.

490
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,269
Do everything you want to do.

491
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,274
But you should date me too.
I'd make you happy.

492
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,950
<i>You know those moments?</i>

493
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,287
<i>Those moments
when you're allowed to like someone?</i>

494
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,999
<i>If those moments mean that you're alive,</i>

495
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:38,464
<i>then how many days do you think
I have really lived, Yeon-jin?</i>

496
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,762
Why are you laughing?

497
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,224
I guess I felt happy just now.

498
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,650
But, Yeo-jeong...

499
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,530
I'm not looking for a prince.

500
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,284
What I need is not a prince,

501
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:12,415
but a headsman
who will join me in the sword dance.

502
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,137
What?

503
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,556
She doesn't pass out in eight seconds.
It was a lie.

504
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,559
-Hit her in the chest.
-What?

505
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,144
You have to hit her hard enough.

506
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,730
If she doesn't pass out,
that means your fist is weak.

507
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,483
Hey. Do you know who set the top score
on the punching machine at Jongro-gu?

508
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,819
It was me.

509
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,907
Tell me if it hurts, Dong-eun.
I'll pray for you.

510
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,867
Look here.

511
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,911
Dong-eun. Stand up straight.

512
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,998
<i>If I miss, I might hit you in the tits.</i>

513
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,276
You called me out to a <i>tteokbokki</i> place

514
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,905
to talk about something serious,
yet you haven't ordered.

515
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,535
Excuse me. <i>Tteokbokki,</i>
fries, and <i>sundae,</i> please.

516
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,453
Sure.

517
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,581
You eat <i>sundae,</i> right?

518
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,626
-You're not covering your tattoo now.
-My tattoo?

519
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,127
Oh, on my neck.

520
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,755
Nobody gives me crap about it now.

521
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,674
You remember we had Spanish class
in school, right?

522
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,135
You see, I really hated Spanish.

523
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,264
But I started liking it again
thanks to your tattoo.

524
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,851
Wow, you're dumber than you look.

525
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,813
Hey, this isn't Spanish. It's Latin.

526
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,439
"Memento mori."

527
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,691
"Remember that you must die."

528
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,362
But you used to cover only a part of it
with a pain relief patch

529
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,322
which gave it another meaning in Spanish.

530
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,782
What meaning?

531
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,833
I do eat <i>sundae.</i>

532
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,586
-Did you go to the hospital?
-Yeah.

533
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,344
Hey, it looks like
you found something big.

534
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,472
So-hee's body was actually there.

535
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,852
Wow, damn it. I don't even know
how much money I should ask for.

536
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,270
So, who was it?

537
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,731
The amount depends on
who we're talking about.

538
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,401
-What if I told you?
-Just tell me who it was.

539
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,486
The rest is easy.

540
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,322
I'll bark at them day and night.

541
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,241
They won't be able to eat or sleep.

542
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,493
I'll turn them into a raggedy mess...

543
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,872
and deliver them right to you.

544
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,626
I know I'm not the one.

545
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
Was it one of the four?

546
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,382
<i>Sa-ra? Did she do it while she was high?</i>

547
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:10,968
<i>Yeon-jin?</i>

548
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,888
<i>The scariest one of the four.</i>

549
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,098
<i>Hye-jeong.</i>

550
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,685
<i>It must be her if So-hee spread the rumor
about the gym teacher and Hye-jeong.</i>

551
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,482
<i>Jae-jun? If So-hee brought up his eyes,
then it's that bastard.</i>

552
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,610
We're in the same boat now.

553
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,572
Which one of them killed So-hee?

554
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,421
Dong-eun asked you for money? How much?

555
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,466
I don't know. She threw me a bag
and told me to fill it.

556
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,843
Fuck! The bag is so freaking big!

557
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,347
-Why won't you pick up my call?
-When did you call me?

558
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,932
-Not you.
-So you, then.

559
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,434
Hey, did she really not come to you guys?

560
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,603
It's not money she's after.

561
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,314
I offered her money first,
but she ignored me.

562
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,651
Why is it so hard to reach Myeong-o?
Did you fire him?

563
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,445
That asshole wouldn't know if I had.
He's ignoring my calls.

564
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,780
Her too.

565
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,659
Do you guys remember clearly
what happened in high school?

566
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,077
How's Ye-sol?

567
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,662
Who is she with now?

568
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,830
What exactly did we do to Dong-eun?

569
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,291
Was it bad?

570
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,752
She really didn't throw a bag at you guys?

571
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,421
Damn it, she must have watched
a lot of movies.

572
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,590
Fill it with dollars? Fuck me.

573
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,676
Ye-sol must be in elementary school now.

574
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,594
Where? Semyeong Elementary?

575
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,765
If she wants us to suffer the same,
what would she do to us?

576
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,934
Jeez, I didn't even get her a school bag.

577
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,561
Which class is she in?

578
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,041
Can you tell me your destination
and if it'll be a round trip?

579
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,378
Wow, I've always wanted to try this.

580
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,090
I didn't imagine that this day would come.

581
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,306
Vladivostok. One way,

582
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,436
I've been thinking about you all day.

583
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,146
Want to meet up?

584
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,607
Fuck off.

585
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,192
You want to see me alone? Why?

586
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,154
I'm curious. Why would you want to see me?

587
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,323
Who? Son Myeong-o?

588
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,491
You fucker, where the hell are you?

589
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,077
How about Yeon-jin?
Did you set up a date with her?

590
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,308
<i>"Me..."</i>

591
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,644
<i>I...</i>

592
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,067
<i>"...mori."</i>

593
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,864
<i>...am dead.</i>
