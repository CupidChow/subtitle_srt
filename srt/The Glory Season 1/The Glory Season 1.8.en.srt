1
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,321
Dong-eun!

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,157
We didn't get to talk back there, did we?

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,952
My God, what a coincidence!

4
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,287
It's good to see you.

5
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,666
Can I have a word with you right now?

6
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,213
Shall we?

7
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,173
This way.

8
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,907
Spare me, Dong-eun.

9
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,659
Spare me just once.

10
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,079
I made a mistake back then.
I'm not asking you to understand.

11
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,081
I have no excuse for my actions.

12
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm so sorry.

13
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,253
I've been repenting all my life,
and I'll never stop.

14
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,170
I swear, Dong-eun!

15
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,591
I haven't even gotten started yet.
Why are you kneeling already?

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,385
How will you beg later?

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,013
You know that my family runs
a dry cleaning business.

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,975
I really didn't want to do it, but they...

19
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,602
I didn't have a choice.

20
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,771
We were all so young, you know.

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,858
We all make mistakes growing up.
Please, Dong-eun?

22
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,653
So, is this a mistake
or is it intentional?

23
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,580
Are you crazy?

24
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,248
I'm a flight attendant!

25
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,881
This is what you call "intentional,"
Ms. Flight Attendant.

26
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,801
It's when you hurt someone,
knowing that it will hurt.

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,721
It's what you did to me every single day.

28
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,269
Okay. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,355
I'm so sorry.
I've done something unforgivable.

30
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,608
But, Dong-eun,

31
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,944
can't you please forgive me
just this once?

32
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,864
Please don't tell my mother-in-law. No.

33
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,199
Please stop contacting her.

34
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,784
Just until I get married, please?

35
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,204
I've submitted my resignation forms,

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,373
so if I can't get married,
I won't have a source of income. I'll die!

37
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,459
Please, Dong-eun!

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:36,007
Your change of attitude is a good plan,
but it was too early and too clumsy.

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,261
I don't want anything from you,
whether it be money or an apology.

40
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,056
You've kneeled, begged,

41
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,016
and tried threatening me too.

42
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,101
Try your next move now.

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,564
Fuck!

44
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,983
So what?

45
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,110
What is it?

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,488
What do you want from me,
you fucking bitch?

47
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,367
You lost your phone before, right?

48
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,509
Yeah. That's the phone that you lost.

49
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,261
It was you?

50
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,388
Those photos weren't sent by Myeong-o?

51
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,598
You crazy bitch!

52
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:30,270
Just think about how much I know
about you now, Hye-jeong.

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,358
Now there's only one way to save yourself,
so think carefully.

54
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,277
It's what you do best.

55
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,781
Then I won't meet
with your future mother-in-law.

56
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,001
I will be on your side
until the day I die, Dong-eun.

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,546
What should I do first?

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,051
Report Myeong-o

59
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,721
as a missing person.

60
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,318
Thank you, sir.

61
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,240
Be careful.

62
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,389
Look ahead.

63
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,321
Do you have something left to say?

64
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,699
Oh, it's just nice
to look at children laughing.

65
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,035
It's like watching
an air purifier commercial.

66
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,498
I don't plan on marrying since married men
get the short end of the stick.

67
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,294
It's "romantic" if you're unmarried
but "adulterous" if you're married.

68
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,963
-Right?
-There are kids here.

69
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,757
Wow, you're a great father.

70
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,510
But you're not a fun one.

71
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,639
Ye-sol has a sense of humor.

72
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,600
I wonder who she got it from.

73
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,438
You've been like this
since the classroom. Why?

74
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,024
Wow, you look like you're about to hit me.

75
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,860
There are kids here.

76
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,158
Well, then.

77
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,828
I need to talk to my friend.

78
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Did you reach Myeong-o?

79
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,632
I don't need to anymore.

80
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,385
I found out the reason today.

81
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,661
Stand right there.
Raise your hands and you're dead.

82
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,745
This way.

83
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,431
Hands down! I said I'll kill you!

84
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,309
Which homeroom are you in?

85
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,811
-The bell rang ages ago!
-Ugh, fuck!

86
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,031
Do you drink a lot of strawberry milk?
I think you can stop drinking now.

87
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,618
I was right, wasn't I?

88
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,661
Her boobs are freaking huge, right?

89
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,926
Hi, Dong-eun.

90
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,935
So Yeon-jin's pretty plaything
is Yeon-jin's daughter's teacher now.

91
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
A coincidence?

92
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,608
Yeon-jin didn't tell you?

93
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,653
I told her it wasn't a coincidence.

94
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,366
Hey, if it wasn't a coincidence,

95
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,538
it means you've planned everything out
from the time at the gym

96
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,122
to this moment.

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,461
That's scary as hell.

98
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,132
I didn't know you had a side like this.

99
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,886
I thought you'd be playing
basketball or something.

100
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,557
Why are bad feelings never wrong?

101
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,561
Well, it's too late to stop you now,

102
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,396
and it can't be avoided either.

103
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,316
Will your revenge only end
once everyone has suffered?

104
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,736
Like the summer rain back then?

105
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,160
Wow, so you know how to get angry now?

106
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,790
This is why I'm here,
to see how you've grown up.

107
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,959
Oh, right.

108
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,670
You have those scars, right?

109
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,757
Are they all better now?
Do they not feel hot anymore?

110
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,179
Hey, I asked you a question.

111
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,440
Oh my, they're still there.

112
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,488
Let me blow on it for you.

113
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,457
I'm warning you.

114
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,043
Don't touch Yeon-jin's daughter

115
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,004
in any way.

116
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,056
Did you get Ye-sol's toothbrush?

117
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,601
I used express delivery
because I figured it was urgent.

118
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,811
That...

119
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,023
was you?

120
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,775
Let me warn you too.

121
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,737
Don't help Yeon-jin in any way.

122
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,575
If you really want Ye-sol,
then I'm your ally.

123
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,743
Not Yeon-jin.

124
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,623
I guess you don't know,
so let me tell you.

125
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,377
That I was also somebody's daughter.

126
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,754
Okay, Jae-jun?

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,594
Wow.

128
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,184
Well, my mom always said...

129
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,230
that I should listen to the teacher.

130
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,815
Yeah.

131
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,151
Good to see you, friend.

132
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,699
A gift.

133
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,376
HA YE-SOL

134
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
An open house? Today?

135
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:58,110
Yeah. There were a lot of dads there,
but Dad was the coolest!

136
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,780
Ha Ye-sol!
Why didn't you keep your promise?

137
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,616
I told you to tell me
everything that happens at school.

138
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,493
Everything your teacher says!

139
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,496
You should have told me
about something like that!

140
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,832
I told you when we were eating dinner
a while ago.

141
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,460
I said that all the dads will be coming.

142
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,546
Oh, I'm just all over the place
these days.

143
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,714
Sorry.

144
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,510
Did your dad talk with the teacher?

145
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,053
Did they say hi?

146
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,721
No, they didn't.

147
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,391
Dad just talked with Uncle Jae-jun.

148
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,604
Uncle Jae-jun was at school?
In your classroom?

149
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,170
I thought it was fun
when you asked me out for a meal.

150
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,589
I was curious as to what you wanted.

151
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,885
But I never imagined
something like this would happen.

152
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,054
What do you mean by this?

153
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,556
It doesn't mean much.

154
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,268
It's like a fruit basket.
I couldn't come empty-handed.

155
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,437
I asked Gyeong-tae for your number
and what you like.

156
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,397
I hope that's okay.

157
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,149
It's okay, but I am a bit anxious.

158
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,403
Your fruit basket is totally my type.

159
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,658
You know Moon Dong-eun, right?

160
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,501
To be exact, I'd like to know
the relationship between her and Yeon-jin.

161
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,840
How do you know Dong-eun?

162
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,967
We play Go together.

163
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,220
Wow!

164
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,016
Wow. It's a small world, huh?

165
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,144
Does Yeon-jin know that you're meeting me?

166
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,479
She won't know
because I'm not going to tell her.

167
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,573
There's not much to say
about Yeon-jin and Dong-eun.

168
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,326
We all went to the same high school,

169
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,162
and Yeon-jin bullied Dong-eun
while we were there.

170
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,501
So, kind of like

171
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,795
school violence?

172
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,757
Not "like." It was exactly that.

173
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,011
How exactly?

174
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,263
Badly.

175
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,030
We're in the same homeroom,

176
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,282
but I've never talked to you.

177
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,492
Right, Dong-eun?

178
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,827
What do you need?

179
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,579
She won't say hello back.

180
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,373
Okay, then.

181
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,792
I don't need anything. It's just a favor.

182
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,795
I can't stand the smell of bleach,
you know.

183
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,674
But it's already my turn
to clean the bathroom.

184
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,426
What do you think?

185
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,303
What do you mean?

186
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,264
You know what I mean.

187
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,685
Does it hurt your pride less
if you put off your answer?

188
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:23,273
Anyway, can you clean the bathroom for me?

189
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,318
Another friend of mine helped me
until last week,

190
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,736
but now she's changed schools.

191
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,488
So-hee transferred?

192
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,406
Apparently.

193
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,244
Now we're going to find out
where she went.

194
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,495
Come on, answer me now.

195
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,373
I really want to hear your voice.

196
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,418
What will you do...

197
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,046
if I say no?

198
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,758
I like quick answers,
and I'm not so patient.

199
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,137
So, what? You don't want to?

200
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,017
God, I'm so impatient.

201
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,936
This won't do.

202
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,106
Hey, Myeong-o.

203
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,233
You can't be patient for even a minute?

204
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>That's how it started.</i>

205
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,788
It all ended when Dong-eun dropped out.

206
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,667
Ask Yeon-jin
about what happened in between.

207
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,878
It's a pretty <i>searing</i> story.

208
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,592
So, Dong-eun wasn't the first victim?

209
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,970
I guess you don't talk much
with your wife.

210
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,681
Well, you should try it today.

211
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,892
I'll get going now.

212
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,731
Can I ask you for a favor?

213
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,692
When you see Dong-eun,

214
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,820
can you tell her
that I told you about all this stuff?

215
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
Please.

216
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,040
Is that the only gambling you do?

217
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,294
There was one time
when I bet my entire life on something.

218
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,879
Did you win?

219
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,632
I'm planning to.

220
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,822
Oh, come on. You shouldn't try so hard
to beat an old man like that!

221
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,491
You should let him go again.

222
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,035
He can re-do his last move, right?

223
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,372
I'll say. He's so skilled
for someone so young, huh?

224
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,414
Sure.

225
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,667
I've lost this match, sir.

226
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,878
Here.

227
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,589
My friend is here.

228
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,384
There you are.

229
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,053
Let's go.

230
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,973
Am I the friend?

231
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,892
-Let's play another match.
-Sure.

232
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,062
Help me out here. I just played
three rounds against four people.

233
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,667
Doesn't your wife hate it
when you play Go?

234
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,211
That's not the only thing she hates.

235
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,175
Do they still sell those?

236
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,181
I got invited by a friend I taught Go to.
I wasn't sure what to bring.

237
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,600
You two are adorable.

238
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm guessing that
you're actually waiting for someone.

239
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,197
I have a call to make.

240
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
But I haven't collected my thoughts yet.

241
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,248
Do you live nearby?

242
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,584
Oh, I just moved here.

243
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,962
Semyeong is a good place to live, indeed.

244
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,422
The air is still nice.

245
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,135
I didn't move here
because of such a practical reason.

246
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,387
I'm here to help someone's revenge.

247
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,476
Revenge, in this country?

248
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,646
It won't be easy,
especially since there are no guns.

249
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,442
Although half of the country knows
how to shoot a gun, right?

250
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,363
But you can use knives.

251
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,075
You can shoot a gun from a distance,

252
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,619
but you need to get up close
to use a knife.

253
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,959
You need to get so close that you can see
your own eyes reflected in theirs and...

254
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, sorry!

255
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
I've been watching Netflix all day
because I don't have any patients.

256
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,518
Oh, right.

257
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,355
I've opened up a practice.
You should drop by.

258
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,359
I have a lot of male patients as well,
so don't feel uncomfortable.

259
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,153
Best of luck to you.

260
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,656
I hope I can pay my rent, at least.

261
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,074
No, I mean with your revenge.

262
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,329
I'll definitely need some of that, then.

263
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>He was pretty tall.</i>

264
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,548
About 178 or 179 centimeters tall
and 76 or 77 kilograms, I'd say?

265
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,050
You're tall too, Yeo-jeong.

266
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,387
I wish I were the only tall guy around.

267
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,850
His watch, coat, shoes, and cologne...

268
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,396
They were all just right.
Not too showy but not too cheap.

269
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,231
How should I put this?

270
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,193
It was like opening page 17
of the January issue of <i>GQ.</i>

271
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,744
You see, my mother and father
are a bit weird.

272
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,079
My birthday is on January 16th,

273
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,333
and they thought it was so hard
to choose my birthday gifts.

274
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,959
I think it was my senior year.

275
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,588
They said they'd just get me whatever is

276
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,423
on page 16 of the January issue of <i>GQ.</i>

277
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,219
Sometimes it was a book,
and sometimes it was a coffee machine.

278
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,847
Once I even got a sports car.

279
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,269
I still don't get
why Ha Do-yeong is page 17.

280
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,191
When you flip to page 16,
you can always see page 17 too.

281
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,527
But you often find
something even nicer there.

282
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,113
Well, simply put,

283
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,033
"I was annoyed because he was so cool."

284
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,078
That's what I tried to say
without you finding out about it.

285
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,923
Did you get his call?

286
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,050
No.

287
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,303
I thought he'd call me
right after the open house,

288
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,222
but he hasn't yet.

289
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,851
He probably doesn't like the fact
that he has no control over the situation.

290
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,312
I could tell by his playing style.

291
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,649
Around Friday afternoon,

292
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,444
after finishing up work,
canceling all of his weekend arrangements,

293
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,490
and organizing the questions
inside his head, he'll call you.

294
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,300
You weren't answering my texts.

295
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,052
Where have you been?

296
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,722
Where's Ye-sol?

297
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,101
Don't you know what time it is?

298
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,603
By the way, Do-yeong,

299
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,857
maybe I should learn how to play Go too.

300
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,152
Let me ask you something.

301
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,945
Huh?

302
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,906
Are you friends
with Ye-sol's homeroom teacher?

303
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,329
Is she the one you said you don't like?

304
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,294
I heard you went to the open house.

305
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,256
Jeez, it seems
that she's been misunderstanding me.

306
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,844
As you probably noticed,
she and I are from different worlds.

307
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,263
But we talked it out.

308
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,182
What's wrong? Did she say something?

309
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,976
So there's something to say.

310
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,064
How exactly did you talk it out?

311
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,233
You told me a while ago

312
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,903
that Ye-sol's homeroom teacher was crazy.

313
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,822
Did you mean she might hurt Ye-sol?

314
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,866
Is that why you tried to send her abroad?

315
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,162
Do-yeong.

316
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,041
We dated for two years,
and we've been married for ten.

317
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,168
Twelve years in total.

318
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,588
You're my husband,
so you should always be on my side.

319
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,049
But you're scolding me right away.

320
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,261
No matter what you've heard, or will hear,

321
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,763
don't be like that.

322
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,601
You know, when you choose something,

323
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:25,148
you always choose the thing
that's the most aesthetically shiny.

324
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,359
Our marriage is one of those things.

325
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,363
You like my body, my voice,

326
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,115
my jokes, and my background.

327
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,868
You like them all.

328
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,039
So don't try to open the box
that should not be opened.

329
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,669
I love you, Do-yeong.

330
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,256
So I don't want you to find out
about anything.

331
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,719
I'm going to make sure that nothing
in this box comes out into the world

332
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
and that Ye-sol stays unharmed.

333
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,974
So, Do-yeong,

334
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:05,021
can you just let Ye-sol and I
shine like we do now?

335
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,606
Please.

336
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,154
This box isn't shiny at all, Do-yeong.

337
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,295
I'm so jealous.

338
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,637
I shouldn't be eating soup.

339
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,056
The shaman told me
to lose three kilograms.

340
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,225
I thought compatible fortunes
were all we needed.

341
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,394
Damn it, that's because you're skinny.

342
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,023
So what?
I haven't been matched with a guy yet.

343
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,275
It must be nice to have good fortunes.

344
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,279
Hey. The guy who got matched with you,
will good things keep happening to him?

345
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,074
I guess it's not too bad.

346
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,370
I have a lot of "earth" in my fortunes,
but he doesn't.

347
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,290
So, that's what's important?
How interesting.

348
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,418
What's wrong with my fortunes?

349
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,130
Well done, everyone.

350
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,841
-Good work.
-Thank you.

351
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,849
That scar's taking a long time to heal.

352
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,267
It's been there for a while.

353
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,727
Do you want a new band-aid?

354
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,732
No. Just don't get any more
sponsored products from them.

355
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,818
My feet are getting all scratched up!

356
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,994
<i>Come out. I'm in the parking lot.</i>

357
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,042
What are you talking about right now?

358
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,877
-End it.
-End what?

359
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,170
End it with your husband.

360
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,256
Let me be Ye-sol's father.

361
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,676
And you'll get a new husband.

362
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,348
You've lost your mind.
Is that why you went to Ye-sol's school?

363
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,350
Don't try to change the subject.

364
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,686
Do you love him?

365
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,980
You can't even talk to that bastard
about Dong-eun.

366
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,858
Because you're afraid
he won't take your side.

367
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,027
No, wait.

368
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,780
Is it because you know
he won't take your side?

369
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,033
But I know all about it.

370
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,994
I know, but I've always been there,

371
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,205
right next to you.

372
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,958
That's love.

373
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,003
You think that's love?

374
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,547
Yeah.

375
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,174
Love that you and I didn't know about.

376
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,553
Am I right?

377
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
I guess so.

378
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,561
I've never actually thought about it.

379
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,147
I love you, Do-yeong.

380
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,482
So I don't want you to find out
about anything.

381
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,157
Right? So...

382
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,075
Oh, I really do.

383
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,746
I really do love him.

384
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,876
I've loved him all along.

385
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,971
<i>If I'm being honest, Yeon-jin...</i>

386
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:25,930
SIESTA

387
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,349
<i>...I've been giddy with anticipation lately.</i>

388
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,438
<i>Myeong-o never left the country,
and nobody can reach him.</i>

389
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,274
<i>Could this mean</i>

390
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,194
<i>that this is your confession?</i>

391
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,866
<i>To cover up one case,</i>

392
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,036
<i>could it be
that another case has taken place?</i>

393
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,254
Here you go, ma'am.
The hydrogen peroxide is inside.

394
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,672
Are you hurt?

395
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,592
-Put it there and go back to work.
-Oh, okay.

396
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>I've been so excited thinking</i>

397
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,190
<i>that maybe you've unintentionally
opened Pandora's box</i>

398
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,818
<i>while trying to cover up your tracks.</i>

399
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,864
CHIEF SHIN YEONG-JUN

400
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,243
Hello?

401
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,829
Do you have time at lunch tomorrow?

402
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,665
I need to give you
a few things you asked for.

403
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,590
From the factory job after dropping out,

404
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,218
all the way up to Semyeong Elementary,
it's all in there.

405
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,514
She's never had to pay a fine, and she's
always paid her health insurance on time.

406
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
The bitch is a model citizen.

407
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,145
What about the bitch's mom? Where's she?

408
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,730
Jeong Mi-hee?

409
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,148
You need that too?

410
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,943
It worked pretty well
when I was in high school.

411
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,820
If you are poor,

412
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,907
your family ends up doing the most harm.

413
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,828
PREPARATION TIME

414
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,938
<i>By the way, who was that in the picture?</i>

415
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,943
I could recognize most people based
on your explanations and the pictures,

416
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,778
but I couldn't recognize one.

417
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,450
The woman at the very left
wearing a red apron?

418
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,580
<i>That's my mom.</i>

419
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,003
You want to know why I put her there
along with the perpetrators?

420
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,508
Well, can I ask a different question?

421
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,428
Do you often wash your sheets?

422
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,432
-Yes.
-Oh...

423
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,896
Can I ask you a question too?

424
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,066
You finally want to know
something about me.

425
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,400
What is it?

426
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,613
Why is the passcode
to your front door 3724?

427
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,452
Usually, passcodes are a birthday,
the day when you first met somebody,

428
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,621
or a license plate number.

429
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,040
But I can't figure out what that is.

430
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,757
Can you ask a different question?

431
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,902
<i>Inmate 3724, you have a visitor.</i>

432
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,995
I'm sorry, ma'am.

433
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,832
After staying here for a while,

434
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,421
I've realized
that I did something terrible.

435
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,842
No matter how many times I apologize,
I know my sin won't go away.

436
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,927
I also know that I can't undo it.

437
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,555
I didn't know.

438
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,016
Excuse me?

439
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,267
I didn't know...

440
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,104
that a murdering bastard like you

441
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,149
had been sending letters to my son...

442
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,943
all this time.

443
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,654
Yes. I was mentally unstable...

444
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,865
"I couldn't withstand
the social pressures,

445
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,534
and I made a mistake"?

446
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,955
Bullshit. Dozens of your letters
all say the same thing.

447
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,208
Yes, I...

448
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:08,963
I...

449
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,882
I'm bad at writing.

450
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,133
Shut your mouth!

451
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:17,055
How dare you mess with my son
for a reduced sentence, you piece of shit!

452
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,891
How dare you make him go through hell!

453
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,394
I can never forgive a prick like you.

454
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,022
So if you ever send
a letter like that again...

455
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,858
I'll kill you.

456
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,155
But you're a doctor.

457
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,200
What?

458
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,333
All of your family members are doctors.

459
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,960
You can't kill people.

460
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,925
Your husband kicked the bucket
because of an oath like that.

461
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,763
I'm not doing this
because I want to get out of here.

462
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,640
I like this place. It's comfy.

463
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,267
They let me exercise.

464
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,187
They give me three meals a day
and medical attention too.

465
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,647
So, why...

466
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,483
are you sending those letters?

467
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,735
Because I'm bored.

468
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,328
So, is your son going through hell?

469
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,375
You son of a bitch!

470
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,108
HA YE-SOL

471
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,264
Hello.

472
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,186
Where?

473
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,646
Jongno Police Station?

474
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,734
Who was it? Was it you? You?

475
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,403
Who the hell reported Myeong-o as missing?

476
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,864
Maybe it was Yeon-jin.

477
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,742
She told us to do it.
Maybe she did it herself.

478
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,286
She'd never do something so annoying.

479
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,122
That leaves you. Was it you?

480
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,376
I got the call first because I'm his boss.

481
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,545
And an adult is treated
as a runaway at most.

482
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,964
The asshole is 36, for God's sake.

483
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,134
The special forces won't come running
just because we can't reach him.

484
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,179
So it was you, then.
You started looking for him first.

485
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,056
Why do you think it's me?

486
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,975
Why aren't you including yourself?

487
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,853
So it was you.

488
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,399
It was you. Yes, you fucking bitch.

489
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,693
Should I ask the cops if I'm right?

490
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,784
Yeah, you're right. It was me.

491
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,410
I reported it.

492
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,329
So what?

493
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,457
You said he's probably dead somewhere.

494
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,584
What if he's really dead?

495
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,964
Am I the weird one here
for reporting a friend as missing?

496
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:42,218
-He lives alone. Aren't you worried?
-This fucking bitch has gone insane.

497
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,972
Since when did you care
so much about Myeong-o?

498
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,726
I get why he asked you out now.

499
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,064
Did you sleep with him too? Huh?

500
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,983
What the fuck are you talking about?

501
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,484
He asked her out?

502
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,611
I got goosebumps.

503
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,030
Your pussy's always been
publicly available, right?

504
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,783
Hey, you did it on purpose, didn't you?

505
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,118
What's your intention?

506
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,120
You know that I bought drugs from him

507
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,790
and got prescriptions under his name
for a few years, don't you?

508
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,460
You also know that I'll be caught first
when they start investigating.

509
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,130
So, why the hell did you call the cops?

510
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,548
God. Too much information.

511
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,967
-I'm leaving.
-Let go.

512
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,011
Let go of me!

513
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,096
Fuck! Let me go!

514
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,850
Hey, if the cops start calling me,

515
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:35,396
then I'm really going
to fucking kill you, bitch!

516
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,609
EARLY MORNING DELIVERY

517
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,610
What is this?

518
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,529
Is it kimchi?

519
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,990
No.

520
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,121
Deposit the won and dollars separately,

521
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,914
and get proof of your average balance.

522
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,293
What is all this?

523
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,339
Did you make a passport for Sun-a?

524
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,340
What?

525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,634
Here.

526
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,764
But why do you need a passport?

527
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,643
I'm going to submit these
to the overseas agency. Please sign them.

528
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,772
BEST OVERSEAS AGENCY

529
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,691
I'm going to send Sun-a to study abroad.

530
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,320
Study abroad?

531
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,406
I'm trying to hurry up my plans,
bit by bit.

532
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,827
I'll start doing what you asked for
on the day Sun-a leaves the country.

533
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,914
Sun-a will hear the news

534
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,958
of her father's death in the US.

535
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,214
I lied to you.

536
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,385
You won't get to have a proper dinner
with your daughter.

537
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,471
You

538
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,890
will lose Sun-a.

539
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,561
But Sun-a will be safe

540
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,107
from her abusive father

541
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,653
and her mother who took part in a murder.

542
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,077
That's the reality
of what we've planned to do.

543
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,831
If you want to stop,

544
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,500
then tell me now.

545
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,849
EDEN APARTMENTS

546
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,684
Is this really the right address?

547
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,602
Dong-eun's current address?

548
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,146
Yeah, it is.

549
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,066
She reported the new address shortly
before moving to her new job. Why?

550
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,069
Are you sure this is the place?

551
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,239
The bitch is living...

552
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,450
UNIT 301, EDEN APARTMENTS
71 SEMYEONG-RO, SEMYEONG

553
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,290
...right in front of my house.

554
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:30,821
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

555
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,282
Something personal came up.

556
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,952
Cancel all my plans for the weekend,
Monday, and Tuesday.

557
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Text me if something urgent comes up.

558
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,501
<i>-Yes, sir. Do you need anything else...</i>
-No.

559
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,597
Where are you?

560
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,141
We should meet.

561
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,879
How much can I win per point here?

562
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,596
You must have a lot of questions.
Go for it.

563
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,518
Aren't you cold in those clothes?

564
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,733
I thought you would first ask me
if I had approached you on purpose.

565
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,319
Well, I wanted
to be unpredictable for once.

566
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,200
What would you have done
if I hadn't called you?

567
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,868
Held a parent-teacher meeting.

568
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,704
What if I had made a complaint?

569
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,456
It's a private school,
and I'm influential enough.

570
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,541
I know.

571
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,588
Your influence is
what I'm depending on, actually.

572
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,763
There's a lawyer
who taught me how to play Go.

573
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,726
That person told me that I had been born
holding the black stone.

574
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,147
So I've always had the upper hand.
It's always been easy for me.

575
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,274
But this match...

576
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,445
is a tough one.

577
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,371
I have a lot of questions
for both you and Yeon-jin.

578
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,751
But I'm planning on hearing you out first.

579
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,379
Why?

580
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,549
'Cause you seem to be claiming
that you're the victim.

581
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,845
Oh, are you here?

582
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,181
Yes. Unit 301.

583
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,643
How long will it take to unlock?

584
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,112
But this is illegal, you know.

585
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,740
If it were legal,
I wouldn't be paying you this much.

586
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:05,953
By the way,

587
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,707
aren't you the weathercaster?
Park Yeon-jin?

588
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,542
If I am,

589
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,253
does that change anything?

590
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,953
Open the door and wait here.

591
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,455
What?

592
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,041
Oh, okay.

593
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,713
You went to school with Yeon-jin.

594
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,091
Did you approach me on purpose?

595
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,177
Yes.

596
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,973
Then did you also...

597
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,811
learn how to play Go on purpose?

598
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,483
That's how it started,
but I've come to like it.

599
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,904
Because essentially,
Go is about building territories.

600
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,449
I dreamed of becoming an architect
until 11th grade, but gave up on it.

601
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,293
Did you send this picture?

602
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,588
I picked out the ones
that you look good in.

603
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,215
It doesn't look like it.

604
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,343
Where do you live?

605
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,764
If you've approached me on purpose,
I feel like it'd be very close.

606
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,476
I'm ready to find out.

607
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,857
I know this from experience,

608
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,609
but even if you've braced yourself,
brutality like this...

609
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,779
will hurt a lot.

610
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,632
I messed up.

611
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,680
I shouldn't have bullied that bitch.

612
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,561
I should have just killed her back then.

613
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,263
