1
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,234
Hello, ma'am.

2
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,742
-Hello, ma'am!
-Hello, ma'am!

3
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,077
Okay. Hurry along.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,953
-Yes, ma'am.
-Enjoy your lunch.

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,871
Thank you!

6
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,048
<i>But, Yeo-jeong,</i>

7
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,218
I'm not looking for a prince.

8
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,054
What I need is not a prince

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,017
but a headsman
who will join me in the sword dance.

10
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,147
Here's your drink and salad.

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,358
Thanks.

12
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,569
GYODAE CAFE

13
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,079
This fellow must be crazy,
ordering the director around.

14
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,915
Wasn't it nice walking
through the park though?

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,126
-Is this your lunch?
-It's breakfast.

16
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,170
God, you're breaking my heart.

17
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,464
-No matter how busy you are...
-I'm on a diet.

18
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,675
I'll lose four more kilograms
so I can wear a bikini

19
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,510
when I go to Guam for Christmas.

20
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,264
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,227
Mom, I've made my decision.

22
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,980
-About what?
-I'm not gonna be a professor.

23
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,982
That's fair.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,902
-I'm going to open my own practice.
-That's great too.

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,071
But did you just make that decision?

26
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,489
I decided quite a while ago.

27
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,033
But I just made the decision
to tell you about it.

28
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,537
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

29
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,208
-So you're serious.
-I'm serious.

30
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,466
Do it, then.

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,887
I'm just happy that you didn't decide
to stay in the military forever.

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,305
This is decent compared to that.

33
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,474
Where are you thinking?
Apgujeong? Cheongdam?

34
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,810
No, Semyeong.

35
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,731
Someone I'm interested in
lives in Semyeong.

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,858
Are you dating?

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,277
I haven't gotten that far yet.

38
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,280
Do you know that type of person?

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,825
She's so calm like she's underwater

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,244
but makes me feel like
I'm in the eye of a storm.

41
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,539
-Is she a fisher?
-It's a metaphor!

42
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,374
You aren't doing it to make money

43
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,668
or to help out
a medically underprivileged area,

44
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,669
but for a girl?

45
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,173
Hey, did you write that in here too?

46
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,425
Jeez. I'll write a new one, Mother!

47
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,512
My goodness, you're so embarrassing!

48
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,847
You sure you're on diet?

49
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,065
<i>Once, I believed
in all the gods of this world.</i>

50
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:57,987
<i>I kneeled and prayed in front
of all those gods who abandoned me,</i>

51
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,450
<i>as if I were an incurable patient
roaming the country with a sliver of hope.</i>

52
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,331
<i>I wonder where you are right now
and what you're praying for.</i>

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,009
Sew this into Ye-sol's bag
where she can't find it.

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,512
Do it yourself
so that nobody else touches it.

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,639
Thanks, Mom.

56
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,766
Did you just find out

57
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,771
that the bitch was appointed
as Ye-sol's new homeroom teacher?

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,358
You're so incompetent.

59
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,319
You should go home for now.

60
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,530
I'll take care of this.

61
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,866
Whose son-in-law was in the policy office
of the Ministry of Education?

62
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,285
Oh, don't do it.

63
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,786
What if you provoke her

64
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
and that bitch starts
telling people about it?

65
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,708
What if everybody finds out?

66
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,252
I'm scared, Mom!

67
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,212
What's so scary about a nobody like her?

68
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
Not her. Ye-sol! I'm scared of Ye-sol.

69
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,801
If everybody finds out, Ye-sol will too.

70
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,723
She might not know now,
but what if she grows up and finds out?

71
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm so scared of that happening.

72
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,229
Yeon-jin.

73
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,232
Look at me.

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,694
I told you before

75
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,821
to never look back.

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,116
You'll never find a solution in the past.

77
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,702
It'll always be in front of you.

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,539
That's just what life is like.

79
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,791
Do you understand?

80
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,607
OCTOBER 31ST - NOVEMBER 6TH
FLIGHT SCHEDULE

81
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>I eventually realized</i>

82
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,490
<i>that God doesn't exist.
God just pretends to exist.</i>

83
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,996
<i>So you should be praying to me, Yeon-jin.</i>

84
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,251
<i>Because your salvation is up to me.</i>

85
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,964
Wow, he's handsome.

86
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,718
Is he your boyfriend? He's young.

87
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,138
-Get us some coffee, Mr. Kang.
-What?

88
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,850
Oh, sure.

89
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,768
I'm fine.

90
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,228
No, I don't mind.

91
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,025
That's exactly your problem.
You don't get it until you're told.

92
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,946
Do you have something to say to me?

93
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,614
No, not at all.

94
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,533
I know that you're a great teacher.

95
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,368
I just want to share a cup of coffee.

96
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,710
MS. KANG

97
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,255
<i>Please call me, ma'am. It's urgent.</i>

98
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,341
Is your boyfriend good to you?

99
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,927
I bet he is.

100
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,641
I don't know why, but I just assumed
that you'd be into older men.

101
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,352
Oh, are you two-timing?

102
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,189
Just kidding.

103
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,070
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Oh, do I look like I do?

104
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,113
No, you don't.

105
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,449
Why?

106
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,284
Hasn't anybody told you?

107
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,870
I won't say anything either, then.

108
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,206
We're basically strangers.

109
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,292
I guess you're the type to

110
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,627
say things that piss people off.

111
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,380
You make others uncomfortable
with your words.

112
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,298
What?

113
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,384
Seriously, Ms. Moon.

114
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,554
You should be thankful
that you're a woman.

115
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,349
If you were a man,
I'd smack you, you know that?

116
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,684
Oh, really?

117
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,605
You look like a guy who only fights women.

118
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,778
Just kidding too!

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,658
You sounded cute before,
so I wanted to try it too.

120
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,421
I'm not sure where Son Myeong-o is.

121
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,966
I would often lose him
because he rides a motorcycle.

122
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,638
Then he'd usually show up at his house
after two days or so.

123
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,642
But since that day, he hasn't been home
or gone to the golf club.

124
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,187
So, you last saw him
at this travel agency?

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,104
Yeah.

126
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,859
Maybe he got paid a ton of money
and went over to their side?

127
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,278
If he got the plane ticket that day

128
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,989
and left the country the very next day,
it makes sense!

129
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,868
I'll check out the travel agency.

130
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,791
Let's wait until the weekend
and see what happens.

131
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,708
Okay.

132
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,044
Unless he's dead,

133
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,214
it's not our goal to find out
about Son Myeong-o's disappearance.

134
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,215
Dead?

135
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:10,967
Wait, murdered?

136
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:12,969
I mean...

137
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,889
You're saying
that he might already be dead?

138
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,724
It's a possibility.

139
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,185
-I'll contact you.
-Wait.

140
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,479
Did...

141
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,482
By any chance...

142
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,443
did you...?

143
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,989
Are you asking
if I did that to Son Myeong-o?

144
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,117
If you did, by any chance,

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,704
then I should know about it,
so I can prepare for whatever happens...

146
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,621
No.

147
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,833
Even if I did do it,
you don't need to know about it.

148
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,002
What?

149
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,255
The deal that we made
is a very simple one.

150
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,093
You do what I ask you to do,
and I do what you ask me to do.

151
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,761
That's all we do for each other.

152
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,684
We've gotten too close, Ms. Kang.

153
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,842
Dad's home, Louis.

154
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,431
Dad hasn't been home in so long, I know.

155
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,058
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,485
What?

157
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,819
Louis!

158
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,738
Damn.

159
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,410
Why are you acting like that? Huh?

160
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,373
Daddy just apologized, didn't he?

161
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,293
I get that you're mad at me
for not coming home...

162
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,923
What is that?

163
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,228
Damn.

164
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
What the hell?

165
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,609
You fucker, where the hell are you?

166
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,861
So, the fucker was right here, huh?

167
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,280
That fucking dog must be mad.

168
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,615
No, not you.

169
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,203
By the way, Louis.

170
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,165
What were you doing then?

171
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,875
Did you bite him or not?

172
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,795
If you just sat there
and watched it happen, damn it,

173
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
I'd be disappointed.

174
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,177

SCHOOL VIOLENCE

176
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,189
NO POSTS FOUND

177
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,653
She's a weathercaster,
but she can't even write her scripts.

178
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,613
Even newbies write their own scripts.

179
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,907
Jaepyeong is running another commercial.

180
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,327
Su-mi?

181
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,331
Oh, did you hear that?

182
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,958
You were pretty loud.

183
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,461
They say that truth sounds louder,
Yeon-jin.

184
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,176
Am I watching <i>The Newsroom</i> right now?

185
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,094
Su-mi.

186
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,513
You should really listen to the stylist.

187
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,767
She said that
my husband is running a commercial again.

188
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,435
Don't you know what that means?

189
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,773
This broadcasting station pays me
only 2,2 million won a month,

190
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,694
but my husband spends
220 million won for this place.

191
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,404
Oh, you're young?

192
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,615
How long does that last?

193
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,159
Will you be young next year?
The year after that?

194
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,535
You're asking for it...

195
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,122
No matter how much collagen you shove
in your mouth or slap on your face,

196
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,459
you'll never be able to take my place.

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,377
You young little bitch.

198
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,380
So, Su-mi,

199
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:23,469
don't tempt me to get
your contract canceled just for fun.

200
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,477
Please enjoy.

201
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,146
What about Dong-eun?

202
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,315
You still got nothing?

203
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,989
Looking up someone's private information
is not as easy as you might think.

204
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,993
To pull up the information,
I need to slip it into some other case.

205
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,122
JAE-JUN

206
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,167
If it were easy, I'd have done it myself.

207
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
The world has changed, Yeon-jin.

208
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,969
It's different from 18 years ago.

209
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,721
That's why I'm not paying you
the amount I did 18 years ago.

210
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,060
I heard you bought a motel
under your younger sister's name.

211
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,479
Do you get a lot of guests?

212
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,067
Thanks for your concern.

213
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,486
I was trying to be condescending.

214
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,866
I've put some men on it.
I'll let you know when I get something.

215
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,954
By the way,
you seem way too busy nowadays.

216
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,625
Thanks for your concern.

217
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,626
LAND TOUR

218
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,712
I checked Son Myeong-o's ticket.

219
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,092
He bought a one-way ticket to Vladivostok,
but nothing else.

220
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,054
But he didn't board the flight
for this one-way ticket either.

221
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,683
I also checked the hotel he booked,
but he never checked in.

222
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,645
So he definitely didn't leave the country.

223
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,563
Right.

224
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,107
Why are you asking about him?
Is something wrong?

225
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,067
Yeah.

226
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,948
But I'm not sure if he's just missing,
or if he's met a sudden death.

227
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,494
You have a lot of black clothes, Dong-eun.

228
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,498
Yeah, I do.

229
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,337
<i>I guess Myeong-o has snapped, then.</i>

230
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,716
<i>Well, SD cards are expendable anyway.</i>

231
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:34,058
<i>Is it time for me to find a real butterfly
that will flap its wings for me?</i>

232
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,236
<i>A silk-winged butterfly
that will brew up a hurricane.</i>

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,739
<i>I know just the one, Yeon-jin.</i>

234
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,461
The wires are all done!
Lighting them up now!

235
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,968
SEMYEONG GO PARK

236
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
We thank you on behalf of the city.

237
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,020
Thank you
for staying here so late, Mr. Ha.

238
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,981
I would call it early, not late.

239
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,482
Oh, that's true.

240
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,069
Great work.

241
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm going to look around a bit more
to remember this moment.

242
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,657
Sure. Well, then.

243
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,426
<i>Fuck, Myeong-o!</i>

244
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,098
<i>I'm out of ice and dope!</i>

245
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,437
<i>Where are you? Let's meet.
Want to come to my place?</i>

246
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,148
You want to see me alone? Why?

247
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,528
<i>Come on and read my text. Read it already!</i>

248
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,254
<i>Which ring looks better?</i>

249
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>The son of a bitch skipped work again.
He stole my clothes and watches.</i>

250
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,927
<i>Pick one from one, two, and three.</i>

251
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,471
<i>My God, really? Which watch?</i>

252
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,972
<i>Hey, I paid you in advance.</i>

253
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,643
<i>I don't care if you fucked up
over the phone. Business is business.</i>

254
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,325
Would you like to see another design?

255
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,286
Big stones can be a bit uncomfortable
when you wear them.

256
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,956
No.

257
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,583
I told you I like big ones.

258
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,379
I like everything big.

259
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:56,969
Tae-uk!

260
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,680
You said you'd be late.
Why are you so early?

261
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,349
They're all so pretty.
I haven't picked one out yet.

262
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,143
Give us five minutes.

263
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,824
Hey, didn't I tell you to wear high heels
when you see me?

264
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,743
I like it when you look tall!

265
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,454
Even if you wear those,
I won't be taller than you.

266
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,540
How will this work
if you can't accept my height?

267
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,626
My legs are hurting
because of my flight yesterday.

268
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,879
I'll wear heels next time.

269
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,964
There won't be a proposal.

270
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,633
You said all you want is a bigger stone
than your friend.

271
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,303
There. That's the biggest one.

272
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,348
Wow, really?

273
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,602
Oh my God. It's bigger! I love it!

274
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,189
Oh, also,

275
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,649
Mom wanted me to tell you this.

276
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,154
My mom likes temple food,
so don't say you want to eat meat, okay?

277
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,198
I know!

278
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,950
I don't like meat that much, either.

279
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,667
INCOMING CALL
MS. KANG

280
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>You need to change directions!</i>

281
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>There's a car following you!</i>

282
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,972
What are you doing here?

283
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,724
<i>That's not important right now!</i>

284
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,518
Gosh, I've been doing this every day.

285
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,771
I should've known
that they might follow us too!

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,066
Anyway, I'll try to lose them somehow.

287
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,236
No, leave it to me.
You shouldn't expose yourself.

288
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,563
Do you have a death wish?
That's not the way to stop a car!

289
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,732
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

290
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh, my neck! My back!
What are you going to do about this?

291
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,696
We're busy men.

292
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,866
Either call the cops or pay me in cash.
Make your choice.

293
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,951
I think you've given me the wrong choices.

294
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,204
You normally call your insurance company,
not the police.

295
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,458
If it's rented,
you call the rental company.

296
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,546
Fuck, aren't you a smart one?

297
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,967
This rental car is fucking dear to me!

298
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,472
If you smashed a busy man's car,

299
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,060
you should either be calling the cops
or handing me some cash.

300
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,981
But now I have a smashed car,
and I'm getting scolded on the streets.

301
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,483
What the hell is this?

302
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,028
Since we're both busy, let's go with cash.

303
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,115
-Tell me your bank account number.
-That's a transfer, not cash.

304
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,329
Give me your phone number.

305
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,056
When I call you, bring cash.

306
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,195
Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see.

307
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,159
Aren't you supposed to be following
Jeon Jae-jun today?

308
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,244
So, why were you behind me?

309
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,164
Why were you following me?

310
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,417
Oh, why would I follow...

311
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,174
Are you suspecting me right now?

312
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,386
I'm just being careful.

313
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,805
Aren't you nervous?

314
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,809
I could go to your husband and tell him
that you asked me to kill him.

315
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,353
I could just tell him everything.

316
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,689
I'm sure you've thought about that.

317
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,032
Jeon Jae-jun was in front of your school.

318
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,867
He left after watching Ye-sol for a bit.

319
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,120
And I just happened to be there
while I was following him.

320
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,872
That's when I saw you.

321
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,667
I was glad to see you. Then I saw the car.

322
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,547
I guess that I could

323
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,258
worry about all that.

324
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:16,097
But I wasn't thinking that way.
I just don't think of anything else.

325
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,101
I'm busy enough
with the camera and driving.

326
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,107
Get out of the car.

327
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,715
Jae-jun is a regular at a restaurant
inside Mangwon Market.

328
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,968
I found some Haenam cabbages there.

329
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,470
Eat it right away.

330
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,597
It's been in the car,
so it's ripened already.

331
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,142
And, ma'am,

332
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,105
I could spill your secrets
to a lot more people than you could mine.

333
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,691
Park Yeon-jin, Jeon Jae-jun, Lee Sa-ra.

334
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,652
I was just

335
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,655
happy while buying the cabbages.

336
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,866
Because I started to dream
after I met you.

337
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,787
The dream of having dinner with Sun-a...

338
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,337
Not a dinner
where you just scarf down your food.

339
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,593
A proper dinner
where we can eat <i>jjigae</i> and fried eggs

340
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,429
as slowly as we want.

341
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,933
A dinner like that is my dream.

342
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,271
I get so happy just thinking about it.

343
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,280
So you <i>have</i> been thinking
about other things.

344
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,369
Ah, you're right.

345
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,045
Oh, I'm sorry.

346
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,797
Oh, why am I always like this?

347
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,260
Because you're a good person.

348
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,228
I made a mistake today.

349
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,399
I'll make sure that your dream comes true.

350
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,737
Thank you for the kimchi,
but I won't take it.

351
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:49,292
<i>"Ma'am" and "Ms. Kang."
That's what we call each other.</i>

352
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,840
<i>What better way to call a person
who has been plotting deaths with me?</i>

353
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,801
DOAMSA

354
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,680
<i>Yeon-jin, we are well aware</i>

355
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,100
<i>of the darkness
that we've conspired to unleash.</i>

356
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,144
<i>We know how dark the end of it will be.</i>

357
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,695
<i>This device is switched off.
Please leave...</i>

358
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,446
Is Yeon-jin not picking up?

359
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,031
Myeong-o's not answering, either.

360
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,034
Maybe they're together.

361
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,414
She might be sleeping with other guys too.

362
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,874
Watch your fucking mouth, will you?

363
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,003
I mean, neither of them
are picking up their phones.

364
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,589
-I'm just saying.
-Hye-jeong.

365
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,053
If you want to be a bitch, do it right.

366
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,141
That's how you become a successful bitch.

367
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,101
Right now, you're sloppy.

368
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,233
I'm leaving. I have a flight tomorrow.

369
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,283
That kid.

370
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,535
Yeon-jin's daughter.

371
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,705
-Ye-sol.
-What about her?

372
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,294
Aren't those Yeon-jin's heels?

373
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,463
I bought them
when I had a flight to London.

374
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,382
I didn't know Yeon-jin had them too.
What about Ye-sol?

375
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,343
Do you know when her birthday is?

376
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,428
Ye-sol's birthday?

377
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,679
Do you know it or not?

378
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,765
I don't know her birthday,

379
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,935
but I remember Yeon-jin's mom
setting a date when she got pregnant,

380
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,481
telling her to give birth before <i>Chuseok</i>
so that it brings the baby wealth.

381
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,149
Why do you want to know?

382
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,572
I'm wondering if she's my daughter.

383
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,407
You must be mad!

384
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,621
When the summer sun doesn't sink
below the horizon,

385
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,208
making nights look as bright as day,
it's called the white night.

386
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,127
That's right.
Nights become bright as day, right?

387
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,547
Did you know
that when these white nights occur,

388
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,550
people on the opposite hemisphere
must endure the polar night?

389
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,428
It'd be so stressful
if nights lasted that long.

390
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,765
The opposite of white night is called
"polar night," not "dark night,"

391
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,519
because these nights are so long
like the polar opposite of white night.

392
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:17,357
Were your nights for the past week
white nights or polar nights?

393
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,945
<i>I hope you'll wisely weather
the tough times you face this week.</i>

394
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>I'm Park Yeon-jin.</i>

395
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,283
<i>Hwang Kwang-hee's</i> Shine or Go Crazy.
<i>We have with us here Park Yeon-jin,</i>

396
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,120
<i>the big sister of all weathercasters
and the queen of awesome comments.</i>

397
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,789
<i>We'll be back after the commercials.</i>

398
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,099
This place has a high ceiling,

399
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,601
and the skylight lets in
plenty of sunlight.

400
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,229
It looks even better at night.

401
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,775
Looks great. I'll take this one, then.

402
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,113
It's newly built and near a station,
so it's nice, both day and night.

403
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,366
You've got a yoga studio downstairs
and a gym upstairs.

404
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,120
Apparently, people who work out there
get hurt really often.

405
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,080
The perfect spot for a private practice.

406
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,917
What kind of doctor are you?
It'd be great if you're an orthopedist.

407
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,335
I'm a plastic surgeon.

408
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,753
Even better!

409
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,048
Working out will make people want
to get double-eyelid surgery.

410
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,927
This is nice. I'll take it.

411
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,556
-Are you really a doctor?
-Sorry?

412
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,058
You seem so decisive,
almost like a scammer.

413
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,897
You're fresh-faced too.

414
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,148
Oh, man.

415
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,984
I don't want to sound like I'm bragging,

416
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,069
but my nickname is Sunkist.

417
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,739
People don't believe
that a doctor has a face like this,

418
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,491
so I can't even say that I graduated early
from a science high school

419
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
and that I'm a member of Mensa.

420
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,370
I like it better when you aren't talking.

421
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,168
Here's your schedule
for next week and the mail.

422
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,670
An express delivery package
is on the very top.

423
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,422
Express delivery?

424
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,028
SON MYEONG-O

425
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,145
PLATINUM CC
SON MYEONG-O

426
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,192
<i>The person you're trying to reach
is not available. Please leave...</i>

427
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,569
Who's here?

428
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,159
It's been a while.

429
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,038
About three years, right?

430
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,794
I last saw you at the opening party
for your father-in-law's office, so yes.

431
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,881
Doesn't look like you're here to play.

432
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,634
I'm very curious as to what brought you.

433
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,763
I can't reach Mr. Son Myeong-o.

434
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,558
Where is he right now?

435
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,394
Wow. So, you're looking for him too?

436
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,106
I can't reach that asshole either.

437
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,066
Why are you looking for him?

438
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,076
-Want a cigarette?
-I don't smoke.

439
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,913
Are there other ways of reaching him?

440
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,919
You still haven't told me
why you're looking for him.

441
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,922
It's something I have to discuss with him.

442
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,677
Please tell me his address,
names of family members, or anything.

443
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,930
Did you receive something too?

444
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,642
Oh, you did.

445
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,813
What did you get?
How is the bastard threatening you?

446
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,816
What did you get from him?

447
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,154
This conversation won't go anywhere.

448
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,824
How about we let each other know
when we find him?

449
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,911
Don't you think you'll find him first?

450
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,040
He's your friend, after all.

451
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,541
He's not my friend.

452
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,712
I just used him, that's all.

453
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,011
Well, then.
I have some matters to take care of.

454
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>This device is switched off.
Please leave a message.</i>

455
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,122
Myeong-o, you fucking son of a bitch.

456
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,834
It turns out that I'm not the only one
you sent stuff to and blackmailed.

457
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,796
But what do you have to use
to threaten Ha Do-yeong?

458
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,215
Is it a woman?

459
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,551
Or a girl?

460
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,809
If Ye-sol is the reason
Do-yeong and I are lumped together...

461
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,647
I'm going to kill you,
you fucking asshole.

462
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,065
Hey, what is this?

463
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,317
It's so pretty.

464
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,366
Oh, why?

465
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,539
Did you really win?
Wow, you're pretty good!

466
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,874
Play a match with me.

467
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,500
Yeah, come on.

468
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,257
That's so cool.

469
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,842
This is what Go is about.

470
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,513
I should post this online.

471
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,397
You can check the bumper,

472
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,275
go to the office to pay,
and pick up your key.

473
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,527
-Thank you.
-Sure.

474
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,422
<i>I've been thinking.
We haven't properly ended our match.</i>

475
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,467
<i>We need to count our points.</i>

476
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,879
What's going on?

477
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,549
Are you okay? What's wrong?

478
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,301
Excuse me?

479
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,056
Are you okay?

480
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,280
What's wrong?

481
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,742
Come inside, quick.

482
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,751
What happened? Are you feeling sick?

483
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,920
Just come in first.

484
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,429
I don't have all of my furniture yet.

485
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,474
Hold on, I'll get you water. Sit here.

486
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,518
What is this place?

487
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,195
What's going on?
Did I contact you at a bad time?

488
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,615
Did you move?

489
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,993
A friend who opened a practice here
was making a ton of money,

490
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,411
so I quit and came here too.

491
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,247
Well, at least,
that's what I was planning on saying.

492
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,499
I messed up, right?

493
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,878
You want to count points?

494
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,215
I don't want to lose
without even knowing why.

495
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,176
I thought you'd come if I said that.

496
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,262
How clever.

497
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,645
You asked me before about where I'm headed

498
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,274
and why I'm doing all of this.

499
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,320
It's a very long story...

500
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,075
and there's nothing pleasant about it.

501
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,705
Would you like to hear it?

502
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,835
<i>Out of white nights and polar nights,</i>

503
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,754
my entire life has been white nights.

504
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,674
It's always been bright.

505
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,428
Well, of course.

506
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,139
Why are you saying that?

507
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,433
Wow!

508
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,644
Are you going to a party?

509
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,813
Your mother's going to work.

510
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,315
She's going to a super famous
fashion awards ceremony.

511
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,359
Wow, that's so cool!

512
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,656
I can't wait to be like Mom too.

513
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,701
I'm going to wear those necklaces

514
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,619
and pretty dresses too.

515
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,752
Mom, I want to try this one. It's pretty.

516
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:06,964
Ta-da!

517
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,051
Oh, it's heavy.

518
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,805
Expensive jewelry, watches,

519
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,724
handbags, and cars

520
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,559
are all heavy.

521
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,898
And expensive coats, dresses, and heels

522
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,983
are all light.

523
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,401
Okay?

524
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,069
Okay!

525
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,199
Don't worry, Ye-sol.

526
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,871
I'm not going to sink below the horizon.

527
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,418
No matter what.

528
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,763
TEST RESULTS
NAME: JEON JAE-JUN

529
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,348
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99,999%

530
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,350
No wonder.

531
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,645
So that's why she's so damn pretty.

532
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,438
Shit.

533
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,371
HA YE-SOL

534
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,542
Hye-jeong, hello.

535
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,459
Hey.

536
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,212
Someone from Information was here earlier.

537
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,799
-Did they find my phone?
-I don't think it's a phone.

538
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,718
It's quite thin.
An express delivery for you.

539
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,636
Express?

540
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,024
So, right now,

541
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,944
I'm betting my entire life on revenge.

542
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,959
And you're not going to stop?

543
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,297
You're a better person than them,
Dong-eun.

544
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,468
I don't plan on being a better person.

545
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,095
I'm becoming worse every day.

546
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,348
Once your revenge is over,

547
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,559
your world will also be in ruins.

548
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,246
I'm jealous of you, Yeo-jeong.

549
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,333
Your childhood must've been
like a box of chocolates.

550
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,710
Now you've grown up
to be a good, happy adult.

551
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,673
You say something so naive,
yet you have no trouble living your life.

552
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,595
You've seen my scars before, right?

553
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,104
Can you heal them?

554
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,531
How long has it been?

555
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,125
You're making a face like that

556
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,919
after only seeing one arm?

557
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,213
And yet,

558
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,674
you want me to stop?

559
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,521
It felt like a white night,

560
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,359
and sometimes,
it felt like a polar night too.

561
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,786
Did they do this...

562
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,789
to you?

563
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,292
Those bastards?

564
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,380
I'm already in complete ruins,
with no dignity left.

565
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,966
So, go back.

566
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,513
I'd like to stay faithful
to my rage and vice.

567
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,528
I'll do it.

568
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,490
I'll be your headsman.

569
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,912
I'll join the sword dance.

570
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,918
Tell me. What do you want me to do first?

571
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,546
How do you want me to do it?

572
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,675
Who do you want me...

573
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,012
to kill first?
