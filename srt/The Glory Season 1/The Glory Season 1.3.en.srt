Where are you going?

10
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,248
You think someone's going to help you
if you run that way?

11
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,084
Let's finish this today, okay?

12
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,086
Stop hitting her!

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,839
Please stop!
I'm going to fucking kill you!

Mom will take care of everything.

16
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,595
-Don't do it.
-No!

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,848
I'll do it. I need to do it, Mom!

18
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,517
You'll get arrested,
but I'm a juvenile, so I'll be okay.

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,019
-So move, Mom!
-No, please don't!

20
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,020
Don't do it!

21
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,858
I'll do it if I have to.
Please don't do it, Sun-a!

22
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,942
Sun-a.

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,613
You bitches have both lost
your damn minds!

24
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,699
Such a good role model, aren't you?

25
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,785
An amazing role model, you are!

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,454
You need another good beating! Fuck!

27
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,834
Well, are you going to stab me with that?

28
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,295
Huh? Go ahead.

29
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,298
Stab me! You stupid bitch. Damn it.

30
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,800
You've both lost your fucking minds.

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,970
Fine. Let's do this today, then. Okay?

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,805
Let's do this. All right?

Don't touch Sun-a.

37
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,483
I'll kill you.

38
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,153
<i>Even the weather, maybe. If not,</i>

39
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,405
<i>then a sharp weapon.</i>

Exactly. So don't do it.

00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,582
Come get it dressed every three days.

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,751
Yeo-jeong,

00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,669
Okay.

Ms. Kim.

51
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,885
Can I have just one sip of that?

52
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,595
-You mean the coffee?
-No.

53
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,224
-Don't let him near the vending machine.
-Okay.

Thank you for being my tutor
for all this time.

59
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,426
I hope you'll become a great doctor.

60
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,261
Is this our last lesson?

61
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,972
Why?

62
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,725
We have to keep going.
You haven't beaten me yet.

63
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,896
You're not the person I want to beat.

64
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,944
I'll get going.
I've got some extra tutoring to do.

65
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,199
Are you trying to buy a building?

66
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,577
You can't do that with tutoring.

67
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,330
I know. Buildings are usually gifted.

68
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,665
But still,

69
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,044
how can you say goodbye like this
after all the time we've spent?

70
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,089
Can you at least tell me
which direction you're heading in?

71
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
I know

72
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,765
that you're running somewhere
at full speed, even now.

73
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,393
But I don't really know where.

74
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,771
To be honest, I also want

75
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,859
to go somewhere,
but I'm terrible at directions.

76
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,113
Your mother is the director

77
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,949
of Seoul Joo General Hospital, right?

78
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,244
You're at your destination, aren't you?

79
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,540
From the moment you were born,
you probably heard

80
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,877
"You have reached your destination"
countless times.

81
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,008
I watch the weather channel every morning.

82
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,846
Some winters are warmer than usual.

83
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,808
And a thick winter fog occurs

84
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,728
because of a warm winter
that follows a cold wave at year-end.

85
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,524
Because they're staying warm,

86
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,820
they don't realize how cold it is outside.

87
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,072
Life is just calm

88
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,366
and happy for them.

92
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,070
I wrote down the basic details
on the back of the photos.

93
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,573
Other information I've collected
is in there too.

94
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,326
I want new information
besides what's in there.

95
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,953
Including info
about Director Kim Shin-tae.

96
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,247
Okay.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,253
You can pay me the minimum wage
for eight hours a day.

98
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,381
Transportation, food, and other costs
should be paid too.

99
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,258
All right.

100
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
We won't always be doing legal things.

101
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,264
And my business always comes first.

102
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,558
Okay.

103
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,810
It will take some time,

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,730
but we won't get any blood on our hands.

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,526
All right.

106
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,363
Do you know how to drive?

107
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,532
No.

108
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,076
Learn how to drive.

109
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,953
Okay.

110
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,624
What grade in middle school is your child?

111
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,878
My daughter won't be any trouble, ma'am.

112
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,130
She's all grown up,
so she looks after herself.

113
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,216
You will never have to worry about...

114
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,970
On the weekends, send her
to Seoul Station by train for two hours.

115
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,429
I'll tutor her.

116
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,308
You can also pay me the minimum wage.

117
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,062
Thank you, ma'am.

118
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,315
I'll bring back some good news.

00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,549
Isn't it illegal for a schoolteacher
to tutor a student for money?

125
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
It is illegal.

126
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,720
But I'm not much of a law-abiding person.

This rectangular thing
is called an SD card.

132
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,685
I'll give you several of these.

133
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,103
You put this in here...

134
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,232
with a click and take a picture.

135
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,069
When you take it out, press on this,
and it'll come out with a click.

136
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,156
If you leave the card in here,
I'll come and get it.

137
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,033
Do you understand?

138
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,703
When do I give you the photos?

139
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,540

140

There are so many things I need to learn.

142
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,718
Oh, it feels like it's going to break.

143
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,971
Yes. If you put it in like that,
it will break.

144
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,141
Make sure
that the gold part is on the bottom.

145
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,734

00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,114
You were yapping about it earlier.
Why so quiet now?

165
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,450
What did you say about my eyes?

166
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,493
What about my eyes, you motherfucker?!

167
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,173
Then what color is this?

168
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
Answer me now!

169
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,515
Hey, he passed out. Stop it.

170
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,104
You fucker.
I may be colorblind, but I'm not blind!

171
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,981
I know he passed out!

172
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,322
<i>Looks like you couldn't become
a good wife, Yeon-jin.</i>

173
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,117
<i>Well, you can try your best to hide it.</i>

174
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,166
I told her not to
because it's too dangerous.

175
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,167
It's fine.

176
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,295
Wow, Ye-sol! You've gotten so much taller!

177
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,216
Yeah, I'm gonna be a weathercaster, too,
when I grow up.

178
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,802
This has been Ha Ye-sol with the weather.

179
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,305
But, Mom, these heels are green, right?

180
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,435
Oh, they're red.

181
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,981
Ye-sol, look at me.

182
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,818
The color of these heels doesn't matter.

183
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,404
What's important is
that they're expensive,

184
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,947
and they're very hard to get.

185
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,491
And what's even more important

186
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,577
is that no matter how many there are,
you can have them all.

187
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,748
All the price tags in this world
are written in numbers,

188
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,166
not colors.

189
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,793
Do you understand?

190
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,672
I shouldn't tell Dad about it, right?

191
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey, Mr. Jeon!

192
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,603
This guy owns this place.

193
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,358
Wow, look at you. How long has it been?

194
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,776
-Hola!
-Hola!

195
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,196
Senorita.

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,823
You're as beautiful as always.

197
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,744
If you had called me,
I'd have rolled out the red carpet.

198
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,662
Yeah, sure.

199
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,542
When I was in Spain,
he and I were neighbors.

200
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,212
Oh, this is my friend.
I'm recommending her as a member here.

201
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,214
Consider it, okay?

202
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,966
How dramatic.

203
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,761
Is reviewing really necessary
just to buy a membership?

204
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,096
How was today?

205
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,016
Our club has the best greens
in this country.

206
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,519
When people get a taste of this place,
they keep coming back, you know.

207
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,105
Anywhere is great when you're exercising.

208
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,191
The dumplings at the café were delicious.

209
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,027
It's really tricky to get in here.

210
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,864
You need at least four recommendations
from preexisting members to apply.

211
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,950
She has all the qualities
to be a member here.

212
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,620
Her son is the CEO
of Jaepyeong Construction.

213
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,881
I'll make sure
to look over your application.

214
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,717
Well, then, I have to get going.

215
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,011
-I'll give you a call.
-Okay.

216
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,434
We'll stop reviewing for now.
Don't accept her application.

217
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,852
And damn it.

218
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,733
Stop selling dumplings at the café.

219
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,152
Throw those fucking things away.

220
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,695
Yes, sir.

221
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,869
PAGODA GO CLUB

222
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,723
Park the car, leave the keys at the club,
and go home. It's Friday.

223
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,267
Thank you, sir.

224
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,435
Mr. Choi is already here.

225
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,738
I've secured the implementation rights
for the development of Jeongbok-dong.

226
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,743
And I've reached an agreement
with the city to open up the Go Square

227
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,454
as soon as the landscaping is finished.

228
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,666
It's taking a bit longer
since we changed the landscaping company.

229
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,752
Wow, that's good.

230
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,337
Amazing.

231
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,178
Young people nowadays
aren't interested in things like Go.

232
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,763
You don't see that often.

233
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,852
Park, the owner of the ribs restaurant,
has lost two rounds to her,

234
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,022
so he is fuming right now.

235
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,109
They're betting 20,000 won per round.

236
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,986
Really?

237
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,965
You should get that group first.

238
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,804
You can't find liberty over there.

239
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,806
Forfeit now,
and you'll lose by ten points.

240
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,403
She got him.

241
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,160
That's impressive.

242
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,039
-He lost 20,000 won?
-Did you see the ten points?

243
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,874
-Huh?
-I didn't see that!

244
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,043
-Wow, seriously.
-She's good.

245
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,871
JUNEE

246
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,249
<i>I arrived in Seoul.
Tomorrow's my day off. I'm bored.</i>

247
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,551
<i>Oops, wrong number.</i>

248
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,396
He must be crazy!

249
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,452
You thought I was Jae-jun, right?

250
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
Fuck, you're freaking hilarious!

251
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,206
Just open the door!

252
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,051
You got a good one this time.

253
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,471
The iPad's in the back.

254
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,853
Is it okay to drive
Jae-jun's car around like this?

255
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,356
I bet you use this car to pick up girls.

256
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,359
This job would be unbearable
without a perk like that.

257
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,277
Six, nine.

258
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,113
Six, nine, six, nine.

259
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,199
The passcode!

260
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,162
-A beautiful set of numbers.
-God, you're so gross.

261
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,873
He is indeed a divorcé.

262
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,834
He owns a shit ton of buildings
and land and shit.

263
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,419
He even has horses in Jeju.

264
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,841
I thought it was bullshit, but holy cow!

265
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,222
Can you look into
this guy's ex-wife, then?

266
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,225
Her face, the schools she went to,
her family, anything.

267
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,685
Another 300,000 won, right?
How long will it take?

268
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,396
Hey, what's the rush?

269
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,690
I'll do it for 450,000 won.
I'm kind of busy nowadays.

270
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,193
He wants to go to Jeju with me next week.

271
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,654
I need to decide
if I will sleep with him or not.

272
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,325
Oh, of course. I'll shut up, then.

273
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,911
I should be careful.

274
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,496
I almost said "slut"!

275
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,166
Jeez.
I can't even be bothered to cuss at you.

276
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,838
Do you know the one place in the world
where you can clearly find classes?

277
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,172
It's the inside of a plane.

278
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,175
First, business, economy.

279
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,637
The only thing dividing them
is a curtain, but nobody can cross it.

280
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,431
What bullshit are you on about?

281
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,559
I'm telling you to stay
behind the fucking curtain

282
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,228
when you barely get paid enough
to cover a proper meal.

283
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,188
I'm going to cross it.

284
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,859
Stop the car. Jae-jun's car.

285
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,233
Is it that much fun?

286
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,905
The match was already over by this point,
but the player dragged it out.

287
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,114
But why?

288
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,616
Who?

289
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,159
At the Go Club.

290
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,245
What is it?

291
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,665
I'm going to get some shut-eye
and go to work.

292
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,711
That thing gives me a headache.
Why do you do it?

293
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,881
It's neat.
Both entertainingly and aesthetically.

294
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,050
Why do you smoke?
It's not good for you.

295
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,176
That's a good point.

296
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:16,014
So, why did you marry a smoking woman
when you're not a smoker yourself?

297
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,225
You're neat, aside from the smoking.

298
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,728
Both entertainingly and aesthetically.

299
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,440
That's what I liked about you.

300
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,692
You have an answer
to every single question.

301
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,195
But you know,

302
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,114
you had three arranged matches,
including me.

303
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,699
Why did you pick me?

304
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,993
You were wearing
the least amount of clothing.

305
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,747
You were wearing the least,
but they were all from Dior.

306
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,042
You're killing me.

307
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,129
So gentle,
but sometimes you can be so crude.

308
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,050
If you're coming, hurry up.

309
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,845
I'm going to wear very little to bed.

310
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,472
Five minutes.

311
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,899
My goodness.

312
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,153
Is it that bad?

313
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,614
But it's my best outfit!

314
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,165
<i>Let's start in ten minutes.</i>

315
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,962
Did you pass the certification exam?

316
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,382
-Yeah.
-Oh, you did.

317
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,676
Congratulations.

318
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,679
Oh, maybe I'm too late.

319
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,723
Thanks.

320
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,233
I'm going to an academic conference
in Semyeong with some professors.

321
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,198
Have you been well?

322
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:39,908
Yeah.

323
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,370
I heard you went to the army
as a medical officer.

324
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,039
It's been forever since I was discharged.

325
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,792
But where did you hear about that?

326
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,419
From the old guys at the park.

327
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,839
They said that the jobless young guy
went to the military,

328
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,675
and that he'd be back a brand-new man.

329
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,847
So, you went to the park?

330
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,103
Should I have written you a letter?

331
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,355
Can medical officers get letters too?

332
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,150
-We usually get love letters.
-Did you get a lot of them?

333
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,449
TO
JOO YEO-JEONG

334
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,451
FROM
CHEONGSONG PRISON

335
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,161
I don't like letters.

336
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,290
What brings you to Semyeong?

337
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,126
Do you work there?

338
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,711
Not yet.

339
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,463
I had some other business there today.

340
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,883
Is she with you?

341
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,344
She's been staring for a while.

342
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,181
I've got to go now.

343
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,894
Me too.

344
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,021
By the way,

345
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,899
back then,

346
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,194
when we started having
Go sessions at the park,

347
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,575
that was the coldest season of my life.

348
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,496
But those tutoring sessions with you

349
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,169
were the only routine in my life,
and the only appointment I had.

350
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,173
So, if I seemed like a warm person,

351
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,134
then that's all thanks to you.

352
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,222
That's been eating away at me.

353
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,109
This is where I am.

354
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,862
Just in case you get curious.

355
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,784
Have a safe trip, then.

356
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:01,132
SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL
PLASTIC SURGEON JOO YEO-JEONG

357
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,228
Excuse me.

358
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,649
EDEN APARTMENTS

359
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,818
Do you not live here?

360
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,611
You're in Unit 301, right?

361
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,197
I'm the owner here.

362
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,574
Hello.

363
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,202
I'm asking if you don't live here.

364
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,539
Your water and electricity bills
are always the base amount.

365
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,874
I've paid all my rent on time.

366
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,209
I know that.

367
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,380
But you said
you wanted this apartment so badly,

368
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,425
but you've left it empty for months.
I'm just wondering what's going on.

369
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,680
I haven't gotten a job at Semyeong yet.

370
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,265
I'm trying.

371
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,774
<i>I know that we're not supposed to meet,
but I've got a video today.</i>

372
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,276
<i>So I'm going to get in the car.</i>

373
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,323
I thought you'd get in this way.

374
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,577
Sorry. I'll write that down next time.

375
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,373
I zoomed in a lot,
so the quality isn't that great.

376
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,166
You need to look closely. Here.

377
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:18,960
All right.

378
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,682
Look. It's right here. Here!

379
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,071
"Sir, why don't you sit
in the front today?"

380
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,368
I'm not following you.

381
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,877
"Babe, you can sit in the front today."

382
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,010
Is that driver's name Jo Soo-hyeon?

383
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,179
How did you know?

384
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,931
So it wasn't a woman.

385
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,435
There was a box
of erectile dysfunction medication.

386
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,855
Well, I guess gender doesn't matter
in how long you last.

387
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,150
We should have focused on age.

388
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,989
You get serious in the weirdest moments!

389
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,746
What?

390
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,249
You think a bitch who gets beaten up
doesn't know how to laugh?

391
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,294
I might get beaten up,
but I'm a cheerful bitch!

392
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,545
Oh God!

393
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,512
You should have told me that earlier.

394
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,348
-Told you what?
-That you're cheerful.

395
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,351
You see, I don't want to laugh.

396
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,311
Why not?

397
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,733
I'm afraid I'll forget
what I should be doing

398
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,485
if I start laughing.

399
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,991
I didn't think of that.

400
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,660
I'll be careful.

401
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,997
Maybe this is why I get beaten up.

402
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,289
Don't say that.

403
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,801
I guess I just really love
how I am right now.

404
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,221
I'm a cheerful person,
but I've never had the chance to be happy.

405
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,974
Now that I can finally breathe again,
I keep laughing.

406
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,523
Don't worry. I won't drag you down, ma'am.

407
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,859
Let's cheer up!

408
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,323
<i>How come she and I... No, how come we</i>...

409
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,369
<i>have to cheer ourselves up every day?</i>

410
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,956
<i>Keeping myself going is so tiring.</i>

411
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,209
<i>I'm so sick of it, Yeon-jin.</i>

412
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,544
All done.

413
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,563
How have you been, Mr. Kim?

414
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,565
It's me. Dong-eun.

415
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,026
Who?

416
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,944
From Sunghan High School.

417
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,073
I dropped out of school in 2004.

418
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,908
You don't remember me?

419
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,245
Who did you say you are?

420
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,504
Soo-han! Hello.

421
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,465
What brings you to this neighborhood?

422
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,509
Dong-eun. What are you doing here?

423
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,053
This is my family's house. He's my father.

424
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,638
Oh, really?

425
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,974
What a small world.

426
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,352
I used to be your father's student.

427
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,857
You remember me now, right?

428
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,275
Oh, right.

429
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,737
Mr. Kim, I'm a teacher now.

430
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,993
What did you

431
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,953
say about...

432
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,413
my son?

433
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,125
Say that again. What did you say?

434
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,481
Why meet at a place like this?
I told you to come to Siesta.

435
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,611
This building was abandoned
even when we were in high school.

436
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,405
But it's still like this.

437
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,198
Enough of the chitchat.

438
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,536
You're trying to get revenge, aren't you?

439
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,954
That's right.

440
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,957
Wow, look at you. You're not even scared.

441
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,792
Why'd you leave me out?

442
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,672
I can't get revenge on you
because you have nothing.

443
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,843
All of the others have something to lose,
but you don't have anything.

444
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,304
Wow, you'd tell me that to my face?

445
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,265
This is the perfect height
to push you to your death.

446
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,683
Watch your damn mouth.

447
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,728
I know.

448
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,689
I even stood up here once.

449
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,858
'Cause you guys were bullying me.

450
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,194
Are you fucking threatening me?

451
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,073
-At least you get scared.
-You're really asking for it.

452
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,206
-Remember So-hee?
-What?

453
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,458
There were rumors
about her killing herself

454
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,126
after moving to another school.

455
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,712
You must remember her.

456
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,798
Because before you said,
"Here comes Dong-eun,"

457
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,010
you probably said, "Here comes So-hee."

458
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,061
This is where So-hee fell from.

459
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,313
And she didn't kill herself.

460
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,826
Hey, what the hell? It wasn't me!

461
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,078
I didn't kill her!

462
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,162
I know.

463
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,958
So go and get money
from the person who killed her.

464
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,126
That's the information I have.

465
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,050
Well, who was it?

466
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,137
I told you. My business comes first.

467
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,814
I had a hard time picking these out.
There was so much freaking dog hair.

468
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,358
Ten with the roots attached, right?

469
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,276
But hey.

470
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,152
Did you...

471
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,864
give birth to Jae-jun's kid?

472
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,784
Not unless you did too.

473
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,912
I'll call you when I've confirmed it.

474
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>I didn't leave you out, Myeong-o.</i>

475
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,964
<i>Of course you have something to lose.</i>

476
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,590
<i>Just one thing.</i>

477
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,467
<i>Your life.</i>

478
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,757
Do it on her arm.
She says that the back of the hand hurts.

479
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,094
Sa-ra, wake up already. You need to detox
and go to the exhibition.

480
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,347
It's so bright.

481
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,099
Are you an angel?

482
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,435
Come on. Get up.

483
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,104
You have a special exhibition today.

484
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,275
If you want to smoke something,
try something weaker.

485
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,194
You can get thinner cigarettes.

486
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,029
Don't they have such a thing
for what you do?

487
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:32,370
LEE SA-RA SPECIAL EXHIBITION
GAZING AT AN IDEAL INSIDE A DREAM

488
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,625
Hey, I want that one.

489
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,211
Send it to my golf club.

490
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,755
You have to pay for the delivery,
dear customer.

491
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,006
The rich are greedier.

492
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,675
I give the whole thing back
after getting the taxes.

493
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,469
It's basically talent donation.

494
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,679
This is the world of general income taxes.

495
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,016
You wouldn't know since you only ever pay
earned income taxes.

496
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,938
Sa-ra?

497
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,232
Hey, hide the drinks.

498
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,320
This is the wife of Buil Chairman Jang.

499
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,905
Oh, ma'am!

500
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,699
These paintings are lovely.

501
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:15,121
I wonder how Ms. Lee got
such a wonderful talent from our Lord.

502
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,622
Amen.

503
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,417
She purchased three pieces.

504
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,085
-Thank you.
-Sure.

505
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,461
-This way.
-Okay.

506
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,130
-We need your address.
-Sure.

507
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,173
Do you want it sent
to your house or office?

508
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,091
Wow.

509
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,469
How on earth do you act so normal,
Ms. Lee?

510
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,265
I'm getting a freaking hilarious award
next month.

511
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,184
You'll all come
and get embarrassed with me, right?

512
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,061
You too, Ms. Lee.

513
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,313
Fuck, stop it now.

514
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,025
What award are you getting?

515
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

516
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,619
Wow, this place hasn't changed at all.
It's my first time here since graduation.

517
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,372
Really? You didn't see the gym teacher
after you graduated?

518
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,542
Hye-jeong dumped him.
He cried his ass off.

519
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,294
-Were you not in Korea?
-Nah.

520
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,504
I was watching <i>Lovers in Paris</i> in Paris.

521
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,757
It took three days to download an episode,
but I still watched it.

522
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,092
So fun.

523
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,553
Why isn't this asshole picking up?

524
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,305
I need something from him.

525
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,347
You mean Myeong-o?

526
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,808
He's not picking up today either?

527
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,978
Damn, I need something from him too.
Do you know where he is?

528
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,272
He's probably drunk
and passed out somewhere.

529
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,901
God. That idiot.
I really need to fire him or something.

530
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,640
Wow, it's been so long.

531
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,017
Have you guys been well?

532
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,686
I swear I've seen her before.

533
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,983
Wow, has it been 17 years?
Since the six of us all got together?

534
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,070
More like five of us. Myeong-o's not here.

535
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,947
Oh! Moon So-hee, right?

536
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,867
You got the names mixed up.
Moon Dong-eun and Yoon So-hee.

537
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,912
I heard that she went to work
at a factory somewhere.

538
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,248
What are you doing here?

539
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,500
You're not an alumna.

540
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,461
Sorry. It makes me so sad
that my fond memories are blurry.

541
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,713
Anyway, it's good to see you, So-hee.

542
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,215
I said, it's Dong-eun.

543
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,594
I actually come to this gymnasium
every once in a while.

544
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,307
But today, it seems
that all the friendly faces are here.

545
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,102
How have you been, Yeon-jin?

546
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,437
I love your weather forecasts.

547
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,651
You look like a really good person on TV.

548
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,907
How about you?

549
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,579
How have you been?

550
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,082
I got a new job recently,
so I've been busy every day.

551
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,670
I bought some new clothes
and ate expensive sashimi too.

552
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,047
You're the chief director
of Semyeong Schools, right?

553
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,090
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

554
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,466
Congratulations.

555
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,931
Who are you?

556
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,100
Did you go through my trash?

557
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,810
There was no other way.

558
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,355
Your driver's name is Jo Soo-hyeon, right?

559
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,526
Do your son
and your future daughter-in-law know

560
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,615
that they'll be sharing their inheritance
with Jo Soo-hyeon?

561
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,702
Are you threatening me right now?

562
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,163
I'm sorry.

563
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,333
But what I'm requesting from you
is actually pretty simple.

564
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,919
I want to be the homeroom teacher
for Class 1-2 at Semyeong Elementary.

565
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,505
I'm well-qualified.

566
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,841
My residence is in Semyeong,

567
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,761
and I submitted a letter of resignation
to my current school.

568
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,846
You're a teacher?

569
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,264
Yes.

570
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,061
May I start coming to work
when the new semester starts?

571
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,582
HA YE-SOL

572

<i>We'll begin the awards ceremony now.</i>

573
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,009
<i>This award goes to Park Yeon-jin,
an alumna of the 23rd graduating class.</i>

574
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,390
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

575
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,523
<i>From now on,
every single day will be a nightmare.</i>

576
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,609
<i>They'll be provocative and terrifying.</i>

577
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,405
<i>You can't stop me or make me disappear.</i>

578
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,369
<i>I'm planning on becoming
a very old rumor of yours,</i>

579
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,745
<i>Yeon-jin.</i>

580
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,844
Go, Yeon-jin!

581
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,054
Bravo!

582
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,932
You're amazing, Yeon-jin!
