1
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,137
Are you always this selfish?

2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,183
We're all waiting for you.
It's wrong for you to study here alone.

3
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,609
You're going to get up, right?

4
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,905
Oh, right. Dong-eun.

5
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,990
You said you want
to major in architecture.

6
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey. If you have any questions, ask me.

7
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,831
I'm pretty knowledging
when it comes to construction work.

8
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,583
It's "knowledgeable," dumbass.

9
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,585
That's what I said, you crazy bitch.

10
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,504
You said "knowledging," you idiot.

11
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,798
Don't try to teach me,
you fucking featherbrain.

12
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,217
<i>Don't hurry or rush</i>

13
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,719
<i>Look cool when you come to me</i>

14
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:22,892
<i>My heart is blazing with love
I want to feel it with you tonight</i>

15
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,730
<i>Sing the song of love
As you and I become one</i>

16
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,374
<i>Your feet that were eager
to inflict pain on others</i>

17
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,126
<i>and all the feet that walked next to them.</i>

18
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>Your lips that laughed
at others' misfortune</i>

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>and all the lips that laughed with them.</i>

20
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>Those leering eyes</i>

21
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>and all the eyes
that gazed at them with affection.</i>

22
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,267
<i>I want to dance with you tonight</i>

23
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,078
<i>Your hand that mocked and broke others</i>

24
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,915
<i>and all the hands that held it.</i>

25
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>And</i>

26
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>your soul that rejoiced
in every single moment.</i>

27
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,135
<i>That's how far
I'm planning to go, Yeon-jin.</i>

28
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,513
<i>There will be no forgiveness, and so...</i>

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,142
<i>there will be no glory either.</i>

30
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,063
You crazy bitch!

31
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,484
-Let go.
-You're acting like a high schooler again.

32
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,818
Let go of me!

33
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,113
So, did you achieve all of your dreams?

34
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,116
It seems you have a pretty decent job.

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,078
You married an eligible bachelor
when you were young and pretty.

36
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,663
Are you living a happy life?

37
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,959
I'm sure you managed to do it.
Right, Yeon-jin?

38
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,672
Oh my!

39
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,132
-Gosh, be careful.
-When did you prepare all this?

40
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

41
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,555
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,477
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yeon-jin</i>

43
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,773
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

44
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,321
<i>What do you want?</i>

45
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,825
You must have looked up
articles about my marriage.

46
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,077
-What the hell are you after?
-Hey!

47
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,788
Stop. You're not going to kill her here.

48
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,540
It's crowded with students outside.

49
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,709
Hey, be the bigger person.

50
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,253
Yeon-jin is still a kid
with anger management issues.

51
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,302
You guys haven't changed at all.

52
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,305
And neither has your friendship.
I'm jealous.

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,641
Well, you've changed a bit.

54
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,186
You were black-and-white in high school,

55
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,772
but now you're more colorful.

56
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,524
You think so?

57
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,111
I've got to get going.

58
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,906
I'll enjoy your forecast, Yeon-jin.

59
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,743
You don't mind
if I leave comments online, do you?

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,249
Anyway, it was nice seeing you all.

61
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,210
By the way, Jae-jun,

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,255
you wouldn't know

63
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,090
what "colorful" means.

64
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,230
SUNGHAN HIGH SCHOOL
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

65
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
Here's the bag.

66
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,211
You didn't come to work,
and you've been ignoring my calls all day.

67
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,089
I've been so confused lately.

68
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,924
I drive my car more often than you do.

69
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,301
So, why are you taking
the fucking paychecks?

70
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,470
Sorry.

71
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,555
I passed out after drinking.

72
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,476
Is there anything else I should do?

73
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,816
Find out what Moon Dong-eun's been up to.

74
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,862
Moon Dong-eun?

75
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh, the girl from high school?

76
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,451
Yeah, the one whose mouth you covered.

77
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,786
How long will it take?

78
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,875
By any chance,

79
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,213
did you sleep with Dong-eun?

80
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,091
Did she have your kid?

81
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,427
Are you on drugs?

82
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,345
Are you insane?

83
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,472
Have you decided to be a fucking idiot?

84
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,476
Huh? Are we hitting the tub together?

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,727
No, we're not.

86
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,609
He doesn't buy me any handbags.

87
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,118
Wow, the view is so pretty at night.

88
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,038
Hey, should I just live here with you?

89
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,040
What was your name again?

90
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,793
Ha-na.

91
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,422
My dear Ha-na.

92
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,674
Not the sharpest tool in the shed,
are you?

93
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,636
Ha-na, do I look like I'm on drugs?

94
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,057
You can't even tell me your real name,
but you dream so big.

95
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,060
That makes me so sad.

96
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,944
Hey, Ha-na.

97
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,864
Your hair is red, right?

98
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,658
It is red.

99
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,828
Can't you see?

100
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,750
Ha-na.

101
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,214
Do you know the two bitches
I hate the most?

102
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,759
Anne of Green Gables
and Red Riding Hood Chacha.

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,677
Since you're a redhead too,

104
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,932
should I make your life lonely and sad
so you can become tough?

105
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,934
Huh?

106
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,523
Call me if you get a consultation request
for Mr. Yoon in Room 701.

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,025
Excuse me, Yeo-jeong.
Can I ask you something?

108
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,194
You can ask me. He's got to go.

109
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,530
I'll take care of everything, so go.

110
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,032
I'm only leaving
because I trust you. Call me.

111
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll be back.

112
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,622
What's the question?

113
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,542
Is Yeo-jeong the director's son?

114
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,169
Really? He's the director's son?

115
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,796
I thought he was her daughter.

116
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,548
Pink looks great on him, you know.

117
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,799
Wow, so it's true.

118
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,801
I just found out yesterday.

119
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,386
Jong-heon,

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,056
so Yeo-jeong's father
is the former director

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,642
who passed away, right?

122
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,102
Do you want to go that far?

123
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,895
You can look that up on the internet.

124
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
Did he really get murdered
by a patient he saved?

125
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,281
It's the anniversary
of his father's death.

126
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,032
That's why he went home early.

127
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,079
Did you memorize
his death anniversary too?

128
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,665
Yeo-jeong's mother is my maternal cousin.

129
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,624
I see.

130
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,959
What?

131
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,599
You're a doctor. You shouldn't be smoking.

132
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
The house is filled with chest surgeons.

133
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,858
You ate before you came here, right?

134
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,276
Will you be able to drink?

135
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,447
Your uncles are already drunk.

136
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,534
-Did you write the paper?
-I'm going to do it now.

137
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,499
Here.

138
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,335
It was your father's.

139
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,962
It's yours now.

140
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,058
Let's go. Your father is waiting.

141
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,459
JOIN US, FATHER,
WHO DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO LEARNING

142
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,367
<i>-I thought I saw a ghost.
-I bet she showed up on purpose.</i>

143
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
<i>She totally knew what she was doing.</i>

144
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
<i>Nobody knows what she's up to?</i>

145
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Myeong-o, you should look into it.</i>

146
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,624
<i>Who's going to pay me for this,
and how much?</i>

147
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,307
<i>I need something from you first.</i>

148
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,069
God, the color's a bit...

149
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,029
Hey.

150
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,451
Show me that one.

151
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,666
<i>By the way, Yeon-jin, are you okay?</i>

152
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,086
<i>What if a weird rumor spreads
on the news website?</i>

153
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,214
<i>What if you get egged on your way home?</i>

154
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>Moon Dong-eun, that bitch!</i>

155
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,843
<i>Sad face.</i>

156
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,678
Fucking bitch.

157
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,430
MY PUPPY

158
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,018
Baby! Did you enjoy your lunch?

159
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,770
I'm about to go home now.

160
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,148
<i>Yes. But I spilled milk on my slippers.</i>

161
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,817
<i>They got wet, so I'm barefoot right now.</i>

162
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,569
You're barefoot?

163
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,696
That's dangerous!

164
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,782
Did you tell your teacher?

165
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,619
Mr. Yang Wu-gyeong isn't
our homeroom teacher anymore.

166
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,288
What do you mean?

167
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,624
<i>We're getting a new homeroom teacher.</i>

168
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>She's coming soon.</i>

169
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,376
Really?

170
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,004
But they didn't tell me about...

171
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,590
I'll go to your school tomorrow.

172
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,510
You'll be happy to see her
since she's your friend.

173
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,720
Huh? Who is?

174
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,305
<i>The new teacher.</i>

175
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,724
<i>Ms. Moon Dong-eun.</i>

176
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,732
What's your teacher's name again?

177
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,651
Nice to meet you.

178
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,822
Please advise her on everything

179
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,616
that she needs to know
regarding our school.

180
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,700
-Mr. Principal.
-Yes.

181
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,079
Please make sure
that you take good care of Ms. Moon.

182
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,996
Of course, sir.

183
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,165
My name is Moon Dong-eun,

184
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,460
and I'm your new homeroom teacher
since Mr. Yang left the school.

185
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,718
From now on, the following three things
will be meaningless in this classroom.

186
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,556
Your parents' jobs, your parents' money,

187
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,933
and their connections.

188
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,979
And please make sure
to follow these three rules.

189
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,941
Don't bully another student
because you wear better clothes,

190
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,070
because you ride in a better car,
or because you live in a better house.

191
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,658
If you still decide to bully a friend,
I will make your family beg

192
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,162
for forgiveness, including your mom
who bought your clothes,

193
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,499
your dad who drove you in your car,
and your grandparents

194
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,209
who paid for your house.

195
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,882
Let's have a great time together.

196
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,342
-Okay!
-Okay!

197
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,892
Let's all brush our teeth.

198
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,728
Here, give me your toothbrush.

199
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,649
I wonder how she knows the director.

200
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,818
I mean, he introduced her himself.

201
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,614
Maybe she's his relative.

202
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,827
Mr. Kang, does it make you feel
like you're a good person

203
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
when you act all innocent like that?

204
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,291
Do you feel proud?

205
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,836
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,838
She's probably sleeping with him,

207
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,882
or she did in the past.

208
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,092
No doubt.

209
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,402
Ye-sol's homeroom teacher.

210
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,488
Is it really you?

211
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,576
She's barefoot
because she spilled milk on herself.

212
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
Her feet were so small and soft.

213
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,792
So this isn't a coincidence.

214
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,293
Not at all.

215
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,797
Nothing in my journey here
was coincidental.

216
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,178
I've walked right into your trap,
haven't I?

217
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,099
Unbelievable.

218
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,979
I thought you'd find a shitty guy,

219
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,314
have a bunch of shitty children,

220
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,900
and live a shitty life. I'm impressed.

221
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,902
How long have you been planning this?

222
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,239
I'm disappointed that you don't know.
Yeon-jin, you're my dream.

223
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,492
I told you we'd see each other again.

224
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,623
I bet every single day was fun for you
while making your way here.

225
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,626
The way here was so tough,
I thought I'd die.

226
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,129
But now that I'm here, it is pretty fun.

227
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,590
Then you should have just died back then!

228
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,924
For whom?

229
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,886
Even an evil bitch like you
is living so well.

230
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,095
Why should I?

231
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,141
We've met again because I stayed alive.

232
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,102
Today has been especially fun for me.

233
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,148
Welcome to my very own gym, Yeon-jin.

234
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,821
Yeah, it's totally understandable.

235
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,533
Considering you got all the way here
through your plotting,

236
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,702
I believe you can think up
something so fucked up.

237
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:03,123
Even a nobody like you
can act so damn annoyingly.

238
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,502
Fine. Try your best.

239
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,088
Good luck!

240
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,065
HYE-JEONG: REMEMBER
OUR HOMEROOM TEACHER FROM SENIOR YEAR?

241
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,399
HIS WIFE JUST CONTACTED ME

242
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,734
JAE-JUN: SUCH A SOCIALITE

243
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,069
HYE-JEONG: HE'S DEAD

244
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>He's dead.</i>

245
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,925
<i>You became a teacher?</i>

246
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,010
You went to college?

247
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,971
Yes, Mr. Kim.

248
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,056
All thanks to you.

249
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,309
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

250
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,438
Oh, I'll take that.

251
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,149
My father has asthma.

252
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,192
He can't be near flowers,
especially lilies.

253
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,904
Then, these can be
your congratulatory flowers.

254
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
Congratulations.

255
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,284
You passed your School Inspector Exam.

256
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,871
How did you find out about that already?

257
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,539
I came here as soon as I heard.

258
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,418
I passed the first part.
Now I have the in-depth interview left.

259
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,753
I'm worried about the interview though.

260
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
There's no need to worry.

261
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,091
You're from a family of great educators.

262
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,095
When I submitted my withdrawal form,
you took off your watch...

263
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,597
Shut your damn mouth!

264
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,639
Dad?

265
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,184
You goddam leech of a woman!

266
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,436
You piece of garbage!

267
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,605
You!

268
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,356
-Hey, Dad!
-You!

269
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,274
Hey,

270
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,861
do you think you'll be fine
after ruining my life?

271
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,408
If I had known that this would happen,
I would have just killed you back then!

272
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,492
Dad!

273
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,246
Were you concerned about me
when you ruined my life?

274
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,582
Dong-eun, hold on.
You need to calm down too.

275
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,876
Dad, just go inside first!

276
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,295
People are watching! Come on!

277
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,090
That bitch is full of lies, okay?
Nothing worth listening to!

278
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,099
Dong-eun.

279
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,602
Now tell me.

280
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,354
What's going on here?

281
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,648
I came to you before posting it

282
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,067
on the Office of Education's website.

283
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,568
"Office of Education"?

284
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,113
I know very well that you are innocent.

285
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,698
But...

286
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,826
I was innocent, too, back then.

287
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,248
You're an adult now, Soo-han,
but I was just...

288
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,751
an 18-year-old girl.

289
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,264
Was it you?

290
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,642
Did you do that to Mr. Kim?

291
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,936
Which part are you talking about?

292
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,646
His death

293
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,898
or his punishment?

294
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,359
Dad!

295
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,111
Dad!

296
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,572
Dad!

297
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,993
Dad!

298
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,998
The congratulatory flowers
are already starting to arrive.

299
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,586
I'll be a dad too, Dad.

300
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,716
A father can do anything
for his child, right?

301
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,468
What are you...

302
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,555
What are you talking about?

303
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,807
You know I only have
the evaluation left, right?

304
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
So close to becoming an inspector.

305
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,396
I'll try my best to help you with that.

306
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,983
I may have retired, but...

307
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,027
Soo-han, can you open the window?

308
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,237
No.

309
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,239
Don't be like that.

310
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,992
You know that rumors travel fast
in our line of work.

311
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,162
Your reputation becomes rumors,
and rumors become your reputation!

312
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,541
You can have your watch back.

313
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,253
Okay.

314
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,465
Soo-han, please open the window...

315
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,052
Now, there's only one thing left

316
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,638
that you can do for me.

317
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,183
Please remain a respectable father,

318
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,685
one who received
the Order of Service Merit.

319
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,814
Do that for me. Please.

320
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,402
Soo-han, please, the window...

321
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,912
Dad!

322
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,456
Dad!

323
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,256
<i>What happened to Mr. Kim</i>

324
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,384
is on him, not me.

325
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,720
If you are looking for another culprit,

326
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,889
then that'd be you, not me.

327
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,642
You fucking bitch!

328
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,145
Yeah, that's more like it.

329
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,065
I'm so glad you haven't changed a bit.

330
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,692
Now,

331
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,071
shall we discuss
what you're most curious about?

332
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:27,948
Ma'am?

333
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
I saw that your daughter Ye-sol
is pure, soft-hearted,

334
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,416
and kind.

335
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,669
I guess she will be your punishment.

336
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,170
I'll kill you.

337
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,174
Go ahead and touch
a single hair on Ye-sol's body.

338
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,009
Let's see what happens.

339
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,803
I'm so curious.

340
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,930
What's going to happen?

341
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,435
You've already broken my body
and crushed my soul.

342
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,603
So, what more can you do?

343
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,652
Move her to another school?
Don't even dream about it.

344
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,865
Move me to another school?
Don't even think about it.

345
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,868
From now on, you're going to suffer.

346
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,162
Just like I did.

347
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,165
Fuck!

348
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,988
<i>How much should I give
for condolence money?</i>

349
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,157
<i>Fuck, his wife texted me again.</i>

350
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,244
<i>Pay 100,000 won for a schoolmate,
500,000 for a friend,</i>

351
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>a million won for a pet dog,</i>

352
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,956
<i>and 50,000 won for a homeroom teacher.</i>

353
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,458
<i>How much will you give me at my wedding?</i>

354
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,210
<i>A hundred.</i>

355
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,546
<i>Oh my God!</i>

356
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,297
<i>Won.</i>

357
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,385
Fuck.

358
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,471
Apologies, sir, but do you mind
holding the umbrella for a second?

359
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,434
The wine from the secretary's office
is in the passenger seat.

360
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,528
It's from Mr. Shin of Hanjinmaru.

361
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,615
Oh, you can drink that.

362
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,451
If Mr. Shin sent it,
it's probably well over a million won.

363
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,368
Pardon?

364
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,121
Oh, I can't do that, sir.

365
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,585
Well, my hands are full.

366
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,505
Still, I can't take something so precious.

367
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,468
I don't even know how to drink
something like this. It's fine, sir.

368
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,221
I should be the one to tell you it's fine,
and I've already said it.

369
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,932
So I don't know what the issue is.

370
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,976
Sir?

371
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,647
Then buy a ten-thousand-won wine
at a convenience store on your way home.

372
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,981
Buy some cheese too.

373
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,194
Drink the ten-thousand-won wine first,
and then drink that one.

374
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,490
Then you'll learn how to drink it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

375
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,730
<i>Do you know what I used to wish for?</i>

376
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
Dad!

377
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,906
Daddy's vitamin! Daddy's treasure!

378
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,160
<i>I wished that, one day,</i>

379
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,540
<i>I'd be able to forget your name
and your face.</i>

380
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,044
<i>So when I'd run into you somewhere,
I'd wonder,</i>

381
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,506
<i>"Who was she again?"</i>

382
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,969
<i>I hoped that I'd never even remember you.</i>

383
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>It's so horrible
if you think about it, isn't it?</i>

384
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,229
<i>That my world is all about you.</i>

385
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>And because my world is all about you,</i>

386
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:01,823
<i>the world that your daughter will live in
will be all about me.</i>

387
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>I will live with the horrible resentment
she will come to bear,</i>

388
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,914
<i>as the price for my revenge.</i>

389
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,800
TO YEON-JIN

390
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,901
What happened? Who did this?

391
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,200
I got the picture that you sent.

392
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,788
I'll put So-hee's picture
to good use as well.

393
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,040
Thank you, ma'am.

394
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,958
It's something that I needed to do.

395
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,295
I was young back then.

396
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,882
Were you close with So-hee?

397
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,889
Can I have some pads, please?
Ones without wings.

398
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,057
One moment.

399
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,234
Here's the hydrogen peroxide solution
and burn ointment.

400
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,401
It's 4,700 won.

401
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>No.</i>

402
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,160
YOON SO-HEE

403
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>When So-hee was getting bullied,</i>

404
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,872
<i>I was...</i>

405
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,376
a bystander.

406
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,420
And then I became a victim.

407
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,758
So now,

408
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,136
I'm going to be the perpetrator.

409
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,392
It's a bit too late,
but I won't be a bystander anymore.

410
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,769
Then...

411
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,565
is this the start of a long battle?

412
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,525
Yes.

413
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
This is the only thing I can tell you.

414
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,240
Please win.

415
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,371
The 18-year-old Dong-eun
and the 36-year-old Dong-eun,

416
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,498
I'm rooting for both of you.

417
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,128
Okay.

418
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,881
I'll...

419
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,967
make sure to win.

420
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,732
There you are.
I was worried you wouldn't show up.

421
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
Why would I not show up?

422
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,193
So you met the guys.

423
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,030
And you didn't tell them about meeting me.

424
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,615
Why would I tell them?

425
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,660
I've bet everything
that I have on you. I'm all in.

426
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,872
So...

427
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,210
you're dead
if you drag me into some half-assed shit.

428
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,843
Have you eaten yet?

429
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,682
I'll make this short.

430
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,101
Let's make it long.
We can talk over some food.

431
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,519
What do you like?

432
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,529
Excuse me!

433
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,698
A bottle of soju, please.

434
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,162
Why aren't you eating?

435
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,624
I already ate.
What about the stuff that I asked for?

436
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,263
Want a drink?

437
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,723
I had some of that too.

438
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,901
Sa-ra's drug account book.

439
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,237
And info on the guy
Hye-jeong is obsessed with.

440
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,909
What about the hair I gave you?

441
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,953
I got a match.

442
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,251
Are you for real?
So, Jae-jun actually has a kid?

443
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,087
-Where?
-That's a card for me to use.

444
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,506
Take this.

445
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,091
D-3 MORTUARY, SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL

446
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,680
"A mortuary"? What's in here?

447
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,018
-Are you sure this is the better card?
-If you want money, yes.

448
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,104
As for who is there,
you can check that out for yourself.

449
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,027
So this is going to make me some money.

450
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,862
Right?

451
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,541
D-3. Right here.

452
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,383
YOON SO-HEE
PROCESSED ON 12/15/2004

453
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:15,970
So,

454
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,474
Yoon So-hee has been here

455
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,142
for over a decade?

456
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,226
That's right.

457
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,479
The unpaid bills are over 100 million won.

458
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,649
The cops concluded that it was a suicide,
but her parents don't agree.

459
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,319
They haven't been picking up our calls.

460
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,406
We can't remove the corpse
without the family's consent, you know.

461
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,241
Can I...

462
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,412
Can I see it right now?

463
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,206
You know, the corpse.

464
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,791
Oh, I don't think I can...

465
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,628
-You're not her immediate family?
-No. Oh!

466
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,548
We're friends.
We hung out all the time in high school.

467
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,635
So you need to be accompanied
by a family member.

468
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,637
This is a problem for us too.

469
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,307
So, please try to convince
the family members, okay?

470
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,186
It's also fine if they give up
on taking the body. Okay?

471
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,483
<i>You want to know what I want?</i>

472
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,531
<i>Do I want Myeong-o's wings
to cause a hurricane?</i>

473
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,120
<i>Myeong-o doesn't have any wings, Yeon-jin.</i>

474
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,964
<i>He doesn't deserve to have
something so beautiful.</i>

475
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,889
<i>Myeong-o is my SD card.</i>

476
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,726
<i>I just put him in the camera
to take a picture of something I want.</i>

477
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,313
This will be worth a lot of money.

478
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,986
Wow, Dong-eun.
You've become one interesting bitch.

479
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:13,004
ROOM 701
PATIENT: YOON JEONG-HWAN

480
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,638
Did you move Yoon Jeong-hwan in Room 701?

481
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,684
Did you not know?
He suddenly went into shock this morning.

482
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,844
Oh, are you okay?

483
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,346
Isn't it hot?

484
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,268
I'm fine.

485
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,134
Ye-sol, did anyone bully you at school?

486
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,302
Did anyone hit you?

487
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,470
Mom, what's wrong?

488
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,057
Even if your teacher does something
to you as punishment, that's not okay.

489
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,893
Did anyone put something
really hot on your body?

490
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,979
Why would anyone do such a thing?

491
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,480
That's so mean.

492
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,440
You should be scolded for that.

493
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,778
I'm going to play <i>Among Us</i>
with my friends.

494
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,866
Ye-sol!

495
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,212
<i>Always visits once a week, on Fridays.</i>

496
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,716
<i>Around three out of five pictures
I take are in focus now.</i>

497
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,101
PAGODA GO CLUB

498
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,746
<i>I learned Go very quickly, Yeon-jin.</i>

499
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,666
<i>I had a clear purpose.</i>

500
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,671
<i>The game is won by taking
territories your opponent carefully built.</i>

501
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,091
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

502
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,479
You haven't been here in a while, right?

503
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,440
No. I was busy making a living.

504
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,734
What do you do?

505
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,197
I was out backstabbing naive men
and making them cry.

506
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,284
Did you earn a lot of money?

507
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,161
Not really.

508
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,163
I'm a good person.

509
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,545
Where did you learn to play Go?

510
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,256
At a neighborhood park.

511
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,635
All of your answers are so unexpected.

512
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,411
It's 20,000 won per round, right?

513
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,047
Single liberty.

514
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,091
No possibility of a comeback.

515
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,262
You're going to pay in cash, right?

516
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,014
What?

517
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,766
Oh.

518
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,358
It was fun.

519
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,946
50,000 won per round.

520
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,241
How about one more game?

521
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,870
<i>By the way, Yeon-jin,</i>

522
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,875
<i>do you want to know the real reason
why I like to play Go?</i>

523
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,796
That would count as gambling.

524
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,882
Would it?

525
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,512
<i>When you play Go,
you display your desires in silence.</i>

526
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:41,225
<i>You seduce and get seduced.
You strip each other bare.</i>

527
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,853
<i>And if your opponent doesn't reciprocate...</i>

528
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,066
<i>then...</i>

529
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,070
<i>it just becomes a game of Go.</i>

530
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,157
I'd like that. Gambling.
