1
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,655
SUMMER OF 2012

2
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,075
KOO SEONG-HEE

3
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,535
FRIENDS: MYEONG-O, SA-RA
HYE-JEONG, JAE-JUN, YEON-JIN

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
SON MYEONG-O

5
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,791
MORE TATTOOS? I'M SO COOL

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,292
LEE SA-RA

7
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,794
FINISHED MY PAINTING. CHEERS!

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,295
WHAT TO WEAR? SO MANY CLOTHES

9
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,352
Why are you snooping around?

10
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,941
-Does that make them better painters?
-It makes them more obedient.

11
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,113
Five hundred grams.

12
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,864
Don't use it too quickly.

13
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,118
We thank thee for our daily bread...

14
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,331
You broke-ass punk. This isn't 500 grams.

15
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,625
How dare you steal
my source of inspiration?

16
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,044
You're just a druggie
acting like an artist.

17
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,798
If you have a pencil in your hair,
can you draw the <i>Mona Lisa</i>?

18
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,134
That's the only drawing you know, right?

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,760
You probably saw it while taking a shit.

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,514
I'll let it slide
because your life is so pathetic.

21
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,266
Stop barking at me and get lost.

22
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,526
That fucking bitch.

23
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,444
CHOI HYE-JEONG

24
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,660
JEON JAE-JUN

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,175
Do you need anything, sir?

26
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,929
Sing me a lullaby, will you?

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,347
I can't fall asleep.

28
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,892
Would you like a warm wet towel?

29
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,269
Do you offer anything else that's warm?

30
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,235
Stop screwing around and go to sleep.

31
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,613
<i>Dear passengers.</i>

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:21,034
<i>To ensure a safe flight, the use of any
personal electronic devices is prohibited.</i>

33
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,456
<i>I'm dead tired. Can you give me a ride?</i>

34
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,374
NEW MESSAGE
JUNEE

35
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,100
<i>Drink an energy drink
and take the airport bus. I have plans.</i>

36
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,563
Can I try this on?

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,857
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,611
We currently have some water leakage
in the fitting rooms.

39
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,780
I'll give you a 10% discount instead.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,283
You don't even need to try it on.
It's like it was made for you.

41
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,498
UNDER MAINTENANCE
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE - SIESTA

42
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:44,033
Do you know why I named this store Siesta?

43
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,955
You like doing it with me during the day.

44
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,877
You're right.

45
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,840
So you can meet some other bitch at night?

46
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,143
How's your wedding planning going?

47
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,895
Why ask? You're not even interested.

48
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,106
It makes me seem nice.

49
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,733
Bullshit!

50
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,404
Let me know
if you ever want to get married.

51
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,741
I don't share men with other bitches.

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,623
PARK YEON-JIN

53
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,501
WAITING FOR MY BABE

54
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,753
AMAZING VIEW. THANK YOU

55
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,463
WHICH DRESS?
THEY'RE ALL SO PRETTY

56
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,265
A LOT TO PREPARE,
BUT I'M HAPPY! LOVE YOU!

57
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,086
LAND TOUR

58
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,591
-Do you enjoy working?
-It's a lot of fun.

59
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,427
The manager really likes you.

60
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,556
Apparently, ever since you started
tutoring their daughter,

61
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,309
she started wearing less makeup.

62
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,980
Here it is.

63
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,318
I think they are starting
to switch over to Instagram.

64
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,238
That bitch Hye-jeong already switched.

65
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,615
They don't use Facebook anymore?

66
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,576
Cheer up, Dong-eun.

67
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,162
You didn't think
revenge would be that easy, did you?

68
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,748
When they all switch over,
just use this account.

69
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,418
The ID and password are the same
as the Facebook account.

70
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,753
I didn't expect
to have to learn new things.

71
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,171
Oh, come on.

72
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,426
I keep telling you.
It's not too late to change your mind.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,887
Revenge is supposed to be
dirty and violent.

74
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,182
I know some guys with gangster tattoos.

75
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,768
I grew up with them at the orphanage.

76
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,398
Do you think they would kill for me too?

77
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,234
Kill for you?

78
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,780
Unless I'm actually going to kill them,

79
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,367
I don't want to be a sloppy avenger.
I've come too far for that.

80
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,621
I need to take this step by step,
even if it takes a long time.

81
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,540
You're right.

82
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,794
You're halfway there though.

83
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,883
I saw an article today
about that cunt Park Yeon-jin's wedding.

84
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,050
Have you seen it?

85
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,136
Yeah.

86
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,474
It was a total gamble.

87
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,060
I was so glad.

88
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,067
Do you know what's nice
about not having a religion, Seong-hee?

89
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,158
You know where you're going when you die.

90
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,286
Hell.

91
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>If I'm going to end up in hell anyway,</i>

92
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>whether I was a good or evil person,</i>

93
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,429
<i>I'm going to do this in two steps.</i>

94
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,184
A BOOK ON THE GAME OF GO
THE GO STORY

95
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,697
<i>I hope that you still want
to see me dance, Yeon-jin.</i>

96
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,538
<i>Although I'm afraid
that it will be a wild sword dance.</i>

97
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,380
CAN YOU DO AN EXTRA MATH SESSION?
YOU CAN SET THE PRICE

98
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,514
Now, let's derive the quadratic formula.

99
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,102
We'll use the perfect square equation
to solve the quadratic equation.

100
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,022
Ax squared plus bx plus c equals...

101
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,023
Ms. Moon.

102
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,776
Where did you get that shirt?

103
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,736
Online.

104
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,657
-Have you been listening?
-It's pretty.

105
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,952
When did you stop listening?
Your mock exam is next week.

106
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,037
I think you'll look prettier without it.

107
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,833
Just show me your boobs once.
I swear I'll do well on the exam.

108
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,170
You will get paid extra
if I get better scores, right?

109
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,172
<i>It's all thanks to you, Yeon-jin.</i>

110
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>I'm not even surprised when this happens.</i>

111
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,346
<i>I wonder how you people
always recognize the kind of person I am.</i>

112
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,891
-This will be my last lesson.
-Why?

113
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,561
I can get more money through other means.

114
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,772
And you'll end up
wearing government clothes,

115
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,483
regardless of whether
your grades go up or down.

116
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,277
A prison uniform.

117
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,528
Are you insane?

118
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,280
If Mom finds out, you're screwed!

119
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,489
She already knows.

120
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,076
She's been listening to our lessons
since the very first one.

121
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,579
You know this is being recorded,
right, ma'am?

122
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,081
You can pay to keep my mouth shut.

123
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,668
This is fucking unbelievable.

124
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,963
You want to be a teacher.
Fuck, are you allowed to do this?

125
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,633
Not sure. Am I not?

126
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,051
Good luck with your exam.

127
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,589
He got into a fight nearby this time,

128
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,257
so he was brought in quickly.

129
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,677
Seriously,
we shouldn't be giving him a day off.

130
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,098
That damn psycho is always on TV.
The results of the hearing came out.

131
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,058
Really?

132
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,354
I wish we could just cut the power.

133
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,108
Please give him a 10% DW
mixed with vitamins B and C.

134
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,238
-Oh, with the deputy director...
-I know.

135
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:47,623
<i>Can the guardian of Kim Min-su
in Ward 62 come to the ward, please?</i>

136
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:53,045
<i>Can the guardian of Kim Min-su
in Ward 62 come to the ward, please?</i>

137
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,715
<i>Congratulations on your wedding, Yeon-jin.
I mean it.</i>

138
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,843
<i>I'm sorry I didn't bring money
for your wedding gift.</i>

139
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
<i>Oh, well.</i>

140
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,141
<i>A wedding isn't the only major event
in life, you know.</i>

141
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,688
"Fog and clouds are both made up of vapor,

142
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,108
but the name differs
depending on where they are formed."

143
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,029
"If it's closer to the sky
than the ground, it's called a cloud."

144
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,449
"And it's called a fog
if it's closer to the ground."

145
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,707
What is it, Yeon-jin? Is there a typo?

146
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,375
No.

147
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,545
It's well written,
so I'm reading it again.

148
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,131
By the way,

149
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,218
why do you guys get scared so easily?

150
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,307
Seul-gi.

151
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,436
You know that the other weathercasters
all talk behind my back, right?

152
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,106
They say I can't even write my own script.

153
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,358
Excuse me?

154
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,778
Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm talking about!

155
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,781
This is why I don't write them.

156
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,909
I can pay you to get a script like this.

157
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,328
And my scripts are shitty.

158
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,581
Do you have a passport?

159
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,292
-No.
-Then get one.

160
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,295
And tell me where you want to go
for your vacation.

161
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,713
I like your script.

162
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,758
You do?

163
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,637
Thank you!

164
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,850
I'll go and look it up.

165
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,984
With some pocket money,

166
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,778
I just became her God.

167
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:31,078
"When driving in the morning or at night
when fog is likely to form,

168
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:35,666
please turn on your hazard lights
and slow down for safety."

169
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,886
You motherfucker!

170
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,647
That fucking dog doesn't shit
when he's out on a walk.

171
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,900
He shits when he's back at home.

172
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,651
His name is Louis.

173
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,737
Louis the 11th.

174
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,824
It's because Louis is old. He's 11.

175
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,953
But you're young, you bastard.
So, what's wrong with you?

176
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,122
What about me?

177
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,415
Are you doing it too?

178
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,542
Doing what?

179
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,384
Drugs.

180
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,849
Sa-ra told me
that you keep pilfering her weed.

181
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,063
I wasn't pilfering it.

182
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,982
I'm worried about Sa-ra,
so I was just checking...

183
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,900
Hey.

184
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,611
Hey!

185
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,367
You think your job is a game?

186
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,787
And I'm still your friend
because I hang out with you?

187
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,877
I have a lot of things to inherit.
Right, Myeong-o?

188
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,256
But if you drive while on drugs
and I die young,

189
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,552
that wouldn't be fair to me, would it?
Answer me.

190
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,722
Answer me, damn it!

191
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,936
Oh, wait!

193
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,521
Hold on!

194
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,066
My God.

195
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,402
I know that I look a bit rough right now,

196
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,655
but I'm an intern here. Yeah.

197
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,866
It's my day off.

198
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,242
Hold on.

199
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,255
Press it for about five minutes.

200
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,442
Where did the patient go?

201
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,194
She left.

202
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,114
Hey, I'm fine now. Look.

203
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,491
She just left?
But her HCT level looks awful.

204
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,285
Hey, I'm in pain too.

205
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,954
I just got brought in.

206
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,622
You, I should just... Jeez!

207
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,293
God. Just freaking go back to sleep.
And don't roam around.

208
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,423
She didn't even finish her IV.

209
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,384
What is it? Let me see.

210
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,223
She's malnourished?

211
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,894
All right, before we start today's class,

212
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,814
I've been wondering about this
for a while now.

213
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,567
You, the decent-looking student
at the very back.

214
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,486
Who are you?

215
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,822
I don't think
you're a student in my class.

216
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,116
Hello, Professor.

217
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,203
I heard that your class is exceptional,
so I'm just sitting in.

218
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,205
-If you'd just allow me...
-I don't buy it.

219
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,958
Who is the "exceptional" person
that led you here?

220
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,086
It's definitely you, Professor!

221
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
-I respect and love you!
-Oh dear.

222
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,590
That's too bad.

223
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,508
I'm married. Get out.

224
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,179
Okay, I didn't know that you were married.

225
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,515
I'll get going, then.

226
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,102
Come on, spill it.
Who is this "exceptional" person?

227
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,207
Soo-han!

228
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,921
I thought you weren't at school.

229
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,632
I have a class
that I need to get the credit for.

230
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,718
-What are you doing here?
-I'm buying lunch for some club members.

231
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,638
Have you eaten yet?
You should come with us.

232
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,933
Are you a good drinker?

233
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,576
Thankfully, you look good today.

234
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,665
How did you find out what school I go to?

235
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,834
Oh, a nurse saw your student ID

236
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,004
while looking
for your guardian's phone number.

237
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,756
And I went to the lecture hall

238
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,717
because your blood test results
weren't very good.

239
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,971
You left without your prescription,
so I brought it with me.

240
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,973
You don't seem to know your condition.

241
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,894
You need to take medication
for anemia for six months.

242
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,481
And get another test,
because the prescription from before

243
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,609
is no longer valid.
Make sure to take your meds.

244
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,991
Do you like to play Go?

245
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,452
Do you know how to play?

246
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh, I'm incredible at it.

247
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,545
How long would I have to learn Go
to beat a good player?

248
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,465
Who are you trying to beat? Lee Se-dol?

249
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,176
Who's Lee Se-dol?

250
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,475
I think you might need a tutor.

251
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,979
Would you like me to be your Go tutor?

252
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,571
Do late evenings work for you?
I have to tutor somebody too.

253
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,906
GYODAE CAFE

254
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,118
You were a freshman in 2006?

255
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,456
I know, right?
Nobody thinks I look that old.

256
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,291
Oh, jeez.

257
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,752
I usually don't say so as not to brag,

258
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,463
but I was born in early 1989
so started school early.

259
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,342
I was something like a prodigy as a kid,
so I skipped some grades.

260
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,846
So, should we refer
to each other formally, then?

261
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,474
I guess you like formalities.

262
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm a beginner, so I get the black, right?

263
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,942
So you know who plays which stones.

264
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,028
Place your stone.

265
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,335
Okay.

266
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,091
To sum up Go in one sentence,

267
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,551
the person who has more territory wins.

268
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,805
So, you start near the end
and move towards the center.

269
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,226
While building your own territories,
you destroy your opponent's,

270
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,436
tightening the boundary slowly.

271
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,315
A battle fought fiercely, in silence.

272
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,948
I like that.

273
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,419
I didn't study oriental medicine,

274
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,838
but <i>cheongsimhwan</i> is the best
for national exams.

275
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,508
The Teacher Certification Exam
is next week. I hope you pass this time.

276
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,067
Thank you for being my tutor
for all this time.

277
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,612
I hope you'll become a great doctor.

278
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,323
Is this our last lesson?

279
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,909
Why?

280
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,953
We have to keep going.
You haven't beaten me yet.

281
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:02,000
You're not the person I want to beat.

282
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,672
To become a teacher,
it's essential for you to possess...

283
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,590
SPRING OF 2015

284
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,426
...a deep love for humanity.

285
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,803
You are to provide high-quality education...

286
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,763
MOON DONG-EUN

287
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,350
...and cultivate talented students
who will contribute to this country...

288
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,603
<i>I really liked the spring of 2015.</i>

289
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>I passed the Teacher Certification Exam
on my second try.</i>

290
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,693
<i>And thankfully, you became a mother.</i>

291
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,145
<i>I came up with over 100 names
for your child</i>,

292
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,231
<i>who was to be born that fall.</i>

293
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,484
<i>I even gave a toast</i>

294
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,864
<i>to my eventual corruption</i>

295
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,285
<i>and your eventual destruction.</i>

296
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,543
SUMMER OF 2021

297
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,740
Happy birthday.

298
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,159
Oh my God. It's beautiful!

299
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,661
How did you think of getting
such a bright color?

300
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,415
I thought you'd be able to pull it off.

301
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,211
It's Gyeong-tae.

302
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,381
He and Sang-hyeon want me
to join them for a drink.

303
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,885
-At this hour. Crazy bastards.
-Just the two of them?

304
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,220
No way.

305
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,431
You sure you don't wanna go out?

306
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,392
No. I saw the girls they are with.
They aren't pretty.

307
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,811
Would you have gone if they were?

308
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,521
Define "pretty."

309
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,234
You're brushing your teeth right now?

310
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,986
While I'm doing this?

311
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,114
That's why I'm doing it fast.

312
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,162
Gyeong-tae is a total mama's boy,
and he's so boring.

313
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,416
Being an accountant is his only charm,
but he's always with a new girl.

314
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,168
I never understood that.

315
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,673
But I finally found out the reason,
thanks to Hye-jeong.

316
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,926
What's the reason?

317
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,513
They did it in the hotel lobby bathroom.

318
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,391
They got turned on
while getting the hotel keys.

319
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,020
That crazy bastard.

320
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,566
What? I'm kind of curious.

321
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,780
It's a tight space,
and there are people outside.

322
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,533
The marble feels cold,

323
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,952
but you and I feel so hot.

324
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,622
Apart from the fact that it's big...

325
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,294
I guess this room is similar.

326
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,853
<i>Your toll has been charged.</i>

327
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,944

00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,893
TO MY OLD FRIEND JO SOO-HYEON
I BEQUEATH THE FOLLOWING...

331
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,027
70 SEMYEONG-RO, SEMYEONG

KIM SHIN-TAE'S FAMILY TREE

335
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,620
Jo Soo-hyeon isn't
Kim Shin-tae's immediate family.

336
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,420
TO MY OLD FRIEND JO SOO-HYEON

337
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,222
CIALIS

338
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,895
After living here for a few months,

339
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,147
I've realized
that this garden is the best.

340
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,734
It looks really expensive during the day

341
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,737
and ridiculously expensive at night.

342
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,990
The money is well spent, then.

343
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,828
Is the commute okay?
It's a two-hour round trip to Seoul.

344
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,913
It keeps me fit, so it's good.

345
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,414
You said that you don't like women

346
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,500
who stop taking care of themselves
after marriage.

347
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,170
I'll wake up at two in the morning,
jump rope on an empty stomach,

348
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,422
and set out at three.
Then I should be on time.

349
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,092
Are you on an earlier news show now?

350
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,594
It's obvious I got ousted due to my age.

351
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,723
Speaking of which, Do-yeong,

352
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,894
can you run some commercials
on our news channel?

353
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,647
I'll use capitalism
when I renew my contract.

354
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,983
You should have told me earlier.

355
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,861
There's no need to hurt your pride.

356
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,115
A problem that can be solved with money
is the easiest one in the world.

357
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,199
Really?

358
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,451
You're so awesome, my ally!

359
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,125
So, is the PR team coming
to the broadcasting station tomorrow?

360
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,085
In the afternoon.

361
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,422
You got new cigarettes?

362
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,882
Huh?

363
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,592
Yeah.

364
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,099
Oh, about your friend,
the flight attendant.

365
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,519
Hey, it's Choi Hye-jeong!
You should know that by now.

366
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,565
What about her?

367
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,610
She told Gyeong-tae
about when you were in high school.

368
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,944
While they were drinking.

369
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,574
About me? What did she say?

370
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,537
That she had better grades than you.

371
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,211
That was one time. Just once!

372
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,048
Are you mad
because your wife did badly at school?

373
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,842
I don't like the fact
that they talked about us over drinks.

374
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,345
Not "us."

375
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,599
I guess they had fun talking about me.
I won't let it bother you again.

376
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,940
Mommy!

377
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,820
Ye-sol.

378
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,490
What do you do first when you get home?

379
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,576
Wash my hands. I need to wash my hands!

380
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,624
She scared me!

381
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,542
Did you see my maternal instinct?

382
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,753
What does Yeon-jin do first
after she smokes?

383
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,338
You're cute!

384
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,553
Damn it.

385
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,098
<i>When are you coming?</i>

386
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,934
Why is she being so damn annoying today?

387
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,738
It's pretty.

388
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,250
What? What is it?

389
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,211
Did you buy a new dress?

390
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,672
Oh, I got it from my boyfriend.

391
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,966
He thought of me
when he was at the Galleria.

392
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,885
Hye-jeong.

393
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,680
Is Sa-ra your boyfriend now?

394
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,518
Have you been wearing
your customers' clothes?

395
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,689
I told you that she would show up
wearing the dress you left at the shop.

396
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,567
At least she has a keen eye.

397
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,236
She picked your dress
out of all those clothes.

398
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,738
Hey, Hye-jeong.

399
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,949
I lost a Chanel today thanks to you.

400
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,452
Damn, you're rich. Use perfume!

401
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,871
The quality is what matters,
not the price.

402
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,081
This is the best
for getting rid of smells.

403
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,960
Jeez.

404
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,172
There are only two of these
in the country.

405
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,634
Look at you and your high standards.

406
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,389
Hye-jeong.

407
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,142
Come to your senses.

408
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,896
It was either Dong-eun or you back then.

409
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,400
You would have gotten grilled instead.
Do you understand?

410
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,819
Hye-jeong.

411
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,575
Don't you know how bad Gyeong-tae is
at keeping secrets?

412
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,995
You talked about me in front of him?

413
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,167
You should have just gotten drunk
and slept with him.

414
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,629
Why the fuck
did you have to start babbling?

415
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,134
We're not in high school anymore.

416
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,637
Friendship alone can't keep us going.

417
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,599
Watch your damn mouth from now on.

418
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,521
Know your place,
and wear clothes that you can afford.

419
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,524
If you understand me, then nod.

420
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,829
I'm taking this.

421
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,794
Sa-ra.

422
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,296
I'm sorry. I'll clean this dress and...

423
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,757
Hey, fucking hell.

424
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,470
It's loose around the chest now.
You can keep the damn thing.

425
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,705
<i>A gift from my friends. Thanks, guys!</i>

426
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,624
<i>Surprise!
With the weathercaster, Park Yeon-jin.</i>

427
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
<i>The weather is volatile</i>

428
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,712
<i>as we approach the first weekend of March.</i>

429
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,130
<i>Ms. Park Yeon-jin?</i>

430
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,967
Yes, I am now at the Kilsangsa Temple
in Seoul.

431
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,720
The spring flowers have bloomed
on the trees around the temple.

432
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,637
SPRING OF 2022

433
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,683
The winter jasmine is the most impressive,
its name meaning "welcoming spring."

434
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,604
<i>It was placed on the heads
of the top-scoring candidates in gwageo.</i>

435
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,814
<i>So they are also known
as the King's flowers.</i>

436
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,650
<i>But with the spring rain
that started yesterday afternoon,</i>

437
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,903
<i>Korea is getting cold once again.</i>

438
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,322
<i>The rain is expected to continue
across the country</i>

439
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,074
<i>over the weekend
and lead to the final cold snap.</i>

440
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,744
<i>The temperatures are almost
seven degrees lower than average.</i>

441
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,747
<i>In the mountainous regions,
the rain has turned to snow,</i>

442
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,583
<i>which will possibly continue
today and tomorrow.</i>

443
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,835
<i>If you're planning on a weekend hike...</i>

444
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,254
I watch the weather channel every morning.

445
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,091
<i>...so please be sure to dress with care.</i>

446
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,509
<i>This is Park Yeon-jin.</i>

447
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,101
A NEW TOMORROW WITH JAEPYEONG
A FUTURE BUILT WITH JAEPYEONG

448
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,436
JAEPYEONG CONSTRUCTION

449
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,504
Jeez, you phony patient.

450
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,966
I told you not to come outside.
Why are you here again?

451
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,551
I felt stuffy,
so I came out to get some air.

452
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,263
What are you doing out here?

453
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,682
Did you get stood up again?

454
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,433
Stood up? Who, me?

455
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,937
Not at all.
And I've never gotten stood up before.

456
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,106
You look just fine on the outside.

457
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,608
I wonder if the director knows about this.

458
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,901
Oh, come on.

459
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,404
Let's not get our families involved now.

460
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,824
I'll think about it
if you let me have a sip of that coffee.

461
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,075
That's not happening.

462
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,786
-Why are you stepping in the puddle?
-Huh?

463
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,121
-Come over here.
-Okay.

464
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,372
Seriously.

465
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,048
Damn, it's raining
cats and dogs out there.

466
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,386
Jae-jun called, right?

467
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,805
Yeah. He wants you to bring some sweaters.

468
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,641
Hold on.

469
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,062
Damn.

470
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,918
Huh?

471
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,879
It's Moon Dong-eun.

472
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,135
It is you.

473
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,347
Wow, what a coincidence.

474
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,516
It's Son Myeong-o. You remember me, right?

475
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,479
Of course I do. It's been a long time.

476
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,646
Right?

477
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,566
Wow.

478
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,987
How have you been?
What are you doing nowadays?

479
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,282
-I'm an elementary school teacher.
-What?

480
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,200
Really?

481
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,910
I've been thinking a lot about you.

482
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,537
You have?

483
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,876
Are you here to buy shoes?

484
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,129
No, I was just trying them on.

485
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,176
Hey, don't take them off.

486
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,011
They look great on you.

487
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,806
Try them on.

488
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,312
Okay.

489
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,272
Look in the mirror.

490
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,209
Do you want a drink?
We have all kinds here.

491
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,545
You can keep those on.

492
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,172
This store is basically mine.

493
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,265
Alcohol, water, or coffee.
Which one do you want?

494
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,939
Coffee.

495
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,290
By the way,

496
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,917
what were you thinking about me?

497
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,464
Wait.

498
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,175
Was I your first kiss?

499
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,720
Man, you must think about it a lot, then.

500
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,058
Is this store really yours?

501
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,019
Yeah, more or less.

502
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,605
I do a lot of things.

503
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,773
So I'm pretty busy.

504
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,320
Jae-jun called.
He asked why you're not picking up.

505
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,157
He wants you to pick his clothes up
and buy some dog food for Louis.

506
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,831
Damn, that asshole.

507
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,418
He can't do anything without me.

508
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,004
You remember Jeon Jae-jun, right?

509
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,007
So nothing has changed.

510
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,718
You're still running errands for Jae-jun?

511
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,303
Fuck, it's not like that.

512
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,805
You know, life is so unfair.

513
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,143
While I was working to become a teacher
and you were getting him dog food,

514
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,938
they inherited a golf course
and own a store like this,

515
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,523
thanks to their parents.

516
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,028
That's why I hoped
that all of this stuff was actually yours.

517
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,863
I really wished that for a second.

518
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,366
Hey, stop playing with me, damn it.

519
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,663
Choose your next words wisely.
I still hit women.

520
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,794
Why don't you pick another punching bag?

521
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,589
If you do that, I think this shop
could actually become yours.

522
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,424
What bullshit is this?

523
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,760
I learned something recently,

524
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,556
but it's pretty intense.
So I can't handle it by myself.

525
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,897
You want to know why I'm telling you this?

526
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,359
I thought you'd understand
my desire to destroy them.

527
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,820
And

528
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,573
back then,

529
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,534
I actually found you more scary

530
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,828
than I found anybody else.

531
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,292
Really?

532
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,587
What is it?

533
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,339
What's this "pretty intense" stuff?

534
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,846
So you can drink after all.
You just chose not to.

535
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,934
I usually get drunk after just one glass,
but I guess I'm just excited today.

536
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,187
Hey, that's nice to hear.
It makes me feel kind of special.

537
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,065
Of course, you're special to me.

538
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,861
By the way, Soo-han,

539
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
you always wear that watch, don't you?

540
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,240
My watch?

541
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,618
Oh, this?

542
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,120
My father bought it
when he was first assigned to a school.

543
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,955
He wanted to pass it on to his son.

544
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,291
He has a thing for creating traditions.

545
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,419
Wow, that's cute.

546
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,215
But he's old now,
and it's quite hard to pay his caregivers

547
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,217
and his hospital bills.

548
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,679
So I really need to pass
the Inspector Exam this time.

549
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,222
My wife even prays at church.

550
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,475
Does it help?

551
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,187
For me, I'm taking another step forward
all by myself.

552
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,689
God has never really helped me.

553
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,107
Huh?

554
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,361
Oh, are you praying for something too?

555
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,824
Yes. I've been praying for you
so that you can pass your exam this time.

556
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,452
I really hope you pass, Soo-han.

557
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,829
I'm rooting for you with all my heart.

558
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,123
SEMYEONG REAL ESTATE

559
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,333
Oh. Okay, thanks.

560
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,753
Your eyes look pretty
when you're drinking.

561
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,837
No.

562
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,383
My legs are even prettier.

563
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,263
Go ahead.

564
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,266
Hello?

565
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,603
<i>Hello, this is Semyeong Real Estate.</i>

566
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,777
<i>There's a vacancy
in the apartment that you wanted.</i>

567
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,736
RENTAL CONTRACT

568
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,154
<i>Bring your seal, okay?</i>

569
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,475
You're looking for this, right?

570
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,584
When did you start doing this?

571
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,754
I noticed it for the first time last fall.

572
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,839
Don't lie to me.

573
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,009
You may have avoided the security cameras,

574
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,596
but I got your face right on my phone.

575
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,516
I've collected these pictures
for six months.

576
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,021
<i>Look at that. God never helps me.</i>

577
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,316
<i>Why did this employee
at the foundation director's house</i>

578
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,735
<i>have to be observant and patient
at the same time?</i>

579
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,911
If you want money, I can give it to you.

580
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,289
I don't want any money,
and I'm not going to report you.

581
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,627
I don't know
what you want to do with this,

582
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,588
but you've been doing it for six months,

583
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,548
and I feel like you'll achieve something.

584
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
I want to be on your side.

585
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,223
I'll help you out,

586
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,725
so please help me too.

587
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,274
What exactly do you want from me?

588
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,403
I want you

589
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,740
to kill my husband.
