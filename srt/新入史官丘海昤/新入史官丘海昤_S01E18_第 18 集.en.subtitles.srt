00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,087
EPISODE 18

2
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,300
Then,

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,345
have you been seeing the dethroned king
in your dreams the whole time?

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,723
Maybe.

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,975
I've never seen his face before.

6
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,190
How did you know right away
that he was Ho Dam?

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,150
Did you meet him in the past?

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,074
Is it something you can't tell me?

9
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,371
I've never told the story
to anyone before.

10
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,041
However,

11
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,046
I no longer want to pretend
I don't know anything.

12
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,428
My father passed away 20 years ago

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,098
because he was accused of treason.

14
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,728
Hence, my brother,
who was one of my father's students,

15
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,233
took me to Qing to save me.

16
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,737
And I've been living as Goo Hae-ryung
since then.

17
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,658
Then you're...

18
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,368
Right.

19
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,413
I've been on the run
for the past 20 years.

20
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,917
How...

21
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,254
did that happen?

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,925
I don't know the details either.

23
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,804
All I know is that my father
was the dean of a place called Seoraewon,

24
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,141
and I heard he was roped
into committing treason.

25
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,939
I studied medical practice at a place
called Seoraewon around 20 years ago.

26
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,484
Seoraewon...

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,237
I've heard of it before.

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,865
That female physician
studied medical practice there.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,994
She said she studied
cowpox variolation there with her teacher.

30
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,997
Right.

31
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,543
Yeongan...

32
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,255
must have been my father's pseudonym.

33
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,721
I can't believe myself.

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,893
As his one and only daughter,

35
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,855
I couldn't even recognize his writing.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,959
If this is too hard for you,

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,421
you don't have to tell me anymore.

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,549
No.

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,595
I must think about it even if it's hard.

40
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,639
All these years,

41
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,310
I just thought my father died
an unfair death

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,730
because he was framed for treason
by some bad people.

43
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,110
But if Ho Dam was the King at the time,

44
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,951
why did he just let my father
suffer such false allegations?

45
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,581
They were close enough
for the King to frequent Seoraewon.

46
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,294
I've lived

47
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,755
many years

48
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,883
with the name Seoraewon

49
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,929
and my father buried in my heart.

50
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,934
I acted like nothing happened,
as if I knew nothing,

51
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,189
because I was told
that my father's wish for me was that

52
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,067
I forget everything
and move on with my life.

53
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,822
But I don't want to do that anymore.

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,411
I want to find out
what exactly he was accused of,

55
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,123
what happened at Seoraewon,

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,543
and why Ho Dam

57
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,837
was dethroned.

58
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,631
I want to know

59
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,176
and understand what happened.

60
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,101
I feel the same way.

61
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,437
I want to understand

62
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,566
all these things.

63
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,113
Your Highness!

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,284
Your Highness!

65
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,078
I was worried thinking
something might have happened to you.

66
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,706
Why are you out here? You need to rest.

67
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,833
I was just about to head in.

68
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,728
Hurry, let's go.

69
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,704
Please, go on in.

70
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,838
I will quickly lay out
your bedding for you.

71
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,134
Getting a lot of rest
will help you recover fast.

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,260
Eunuch Heo.

73
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,102
-Yes, Your Highness.
-You started working in the palace

74
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,437
before I was born, right?

75
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,356
Yes, Your Highness, that is correct.

76
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,359
-Why do you ask--
-Do you remember

77
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,279
what happened on the day I was born?

78
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,453
Gosh, sure thing. Of course I do.

79
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,792
His Majesty was elated all day,
delighted by the birth of a prince.

80
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,587
The Queen and the Queen Dowager
were very happy as well.

81
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,258
Everyone in the palace
was excited and happy.

82
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,931
The Queen Dowager was happy?

83
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,185
Even though...

84
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,773
her son, the dethroned king,
passed away that day?

85
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,697
Why are you lying to me?

86
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,949
What are you hiding from me?

87
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,998
-Your Highness.
-I will return to the palace.

88
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,040
Do not follow me.

89
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,335
No, you shouldn't!

90
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,172
You're not well enough yet! Your Highness!

91
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,717
Your Highness.

92
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,357
Because I have a son like you,

93
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,943
I am too ashamed
to face the former kings after I die.

94
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,779
You are more wicked and malicious
than anyone

95
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,073
who has ever lived in this palace!

96
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,620
Rim.

97
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,339
Your Highness!

98
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,745
Are you Seomun Jik's daughter, Hui-yeon?

99
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,790
Yes. Who are you, sir?

100
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,208
Me?

101
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,632
You can call me Ho Dam. Master Ho Dam.

102
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
Here.

103
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,097
But the thing is, I was looking for

104
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,808
a different book, not this one.

105
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,226
Is that so?

106
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,063
Then do you wish to find it yourself?

107
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,439
Sure.

108
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,614
-I want to read that one too.
-What?

109
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,742
Oh, okay. Sure.

110
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,585
Your Majesty.

111
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,005
There you are, Yeongan.

112
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,214
Your father is back.

113
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,677
Hello, Master Ho Dam.

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,721
You are back, Father.

115
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,358
Father.

116
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,375
Dowon returned to the palace
in that state?

117
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,919
Yes, Your Majesty.
I do not know what he has found out,

118
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,049
but he asked me about what happened
in the year of Gyeongo.

119
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,867
-Clean this up.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

120
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,672
We searched the whole area

121
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,882
but found no traces of them.

122
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,261
They must be highly trained
in raids and retreats.

123
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,808
Don't worry, Your Royal Highness.

124
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,894
Our soldiers are going door to door
asking about them.

125
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,398
We will soon find out where they fled to.

126
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,524
No, that is not necessary.

127
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,900
Stop the search.

128
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,737
Your Royal Highness, they tried to harm
His Highness Prince Dowon.

129
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,448
We must track them down
and find out who is behind them.

130
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,409
That is...

131
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,917
Seeing soldiers walking around

132
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,545
will only make the people fearful.

133
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,840
First, order all the soldiers
to return to the palace at once.

134
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,216
I will take care of the rest.

135
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,937
Giddy-up!

136
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,405
What did he lose? What's the fuss about?

137
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,450
Do you really know nothing
about the royal court?

138
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,368
It is a document that merges
historical records,

139
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,579
the Royal Secretariat's daily records,
and so on.

140
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,416
Right, the daily records.

141
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,634
Who might you be?
Why are you looking for a scribe?

142
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,596
I am Prince Dowon.

143
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,598
Your Highness.

144
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,766
There is something

145
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,559
I need you to do.

146
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,106
Your Majesty.

147
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,027
Is everything all right...

148
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,040
I know nothing about it.

149
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,377
We do not share a single drop of blood,

150
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,672
but I have lived as your son
for almost 50 years.

151
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,217
Who would do such a thing to their mother?

152
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,638
Then why is Min Ik-pyeong still alive?

153
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,684
Tell me, Your Majesty.

154
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,436
The Second State Councillor
is clearly the only person

155
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,565
in this country that is capable
of doing such a thing, so why...

156
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,361
Why is that man still alive?

157
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,531
I cannot punish him

158
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,617
just based on mere suspicions
without any evidence.

159
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,785
That is not the reason.

160
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,039
You are turning a blind eye
to what he is doing

161
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,166
for you share the same goal with him.

162
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,127
Even at this moment,

163
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,755
I am sure you are lamenting
the fact that the arrow

164
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,091
failed to pierce Dowon's heart.

165
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,092
Your Majesty.

166
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,304
Do not forget the promise you made to me.

167
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
I have made it clear to you.

168
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,520
If anything bad happens to Dowon,

169
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,857
I will hang myself without any hesitation.

170
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,319
You will then be remembered as a king
that killed his own mother

171
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,154
for generations to come.

172
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,781
I still feel

173
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,620
the exact same way as I did

174
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,166
twenty years ago.

175
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,383
Did you wrap things up well?

176
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,886
Yes, they won't be able to come after us.

177
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,056
-How is the Prince?
-Don't worry.

178
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,392
His wound isn't too deep,
so he will recover soon.

179
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,771
Go get some rest now.

181
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,230
Good work.

182
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,573
I heard people are saying the attack
was led by the Second State Councillor.

183
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,075
Yes.

184
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,662
As we expected, the King seems
to be suspicious of Min Ik-pyeong as well.

185
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,249
A rift will form between them very soon.

186
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,380
Be careful.

187
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,924
If they find out that
you've joined hands with us,

188
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,802
they will try to kill you right away.

189
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,845
I gave up my desire to live

190
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,307
a long time ago.

191
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,999
My lady, what are you doing here?

192
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,542
Your bed is all ready.

193
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,586
You said Jae-gyeong went
to the countryside for work, right?

194
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,256
-Yes, my lady.
-And he didn't come home three days ago.

195
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,216
That's right.

196
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,926
What's the matter?

197
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,104
My lady, what do you need to do
in that empty room?

198
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,439
Government Newspaper?

199
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,527
GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER

200
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,279
"A historian who refused
to turn in his daily record?"

201
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,783
Why is Jae-gyeong

202
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,744
keeping this government newspaper?

203
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,833
"The day of sinmyo, month of jeonghae,
and year of Gyeongo.

204
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,751
First Historian Kim Il-mok

205
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,838
refused to submit his daily record
to Ilgicheong."

206
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,631
ILGICHEONG:
MANAGED RECORDS ON DEPOSED KINGS

207
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,134
"The day of sinchuk, month of jeonghae,
and year of Gyeongo.

208
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,970
First Historian Kim Il-mok

209
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,597
was executed by decapitation
outside the gate."

210
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,108
Apprentice Goo, you should go
to the library and get some rest.

211
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,777
I can't believe she had to come to work
when she nearly died.

212
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,028
Isn't it crazy?

213
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,072
I'm really okay.

214
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,326
I'm totally fine, from head to toe.

215
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,210
Well, who went to Nokseodang yesterday?

216
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,174
No historians are allowed to go anywhere
near Nokseodang for the time being.

217
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,635
His Highness needs to recover, and they
think we'll just be a nuisance to him.

218
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,309
Oh, boy. There you are.

219
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,395
The unlucky troublemaker.

220
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,692
You shouldn't even step out of
the Office of Royal Decrees from now on.

221
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,403
-I'm too anxious to let you go anywhere.
-Understood, sir.

222
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm glad you're back.

223
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,834
-Officer Min.
-Yes.

224
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,628
By any chance,

225
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,505
have you heard of a historian
by the name of Kim Il-mok?

226
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,217
Historian Kim Il-mok?

227
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,054
How do you know about him?

228
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,847
Kim Il-mok?

229
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,184
-Who is that?
-I've told you about him before.

230
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,772
The senior historian before my time
who was like a crazy tiger.

231
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,316
I heard he worked extremely hard.

232
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,361
He always went home when the stars
were high up in the sky

233
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,154
and returned before sunrise.

234
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,743
And whenever a royal lecture was held,
he wrote three to four sachaeks.

235
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,162
Then how come we knew nothing

236
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,706
about such a wonderful historian
until now?

237
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,251
I would've loved to visit him

238
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,544
and learn how to write daily records.

239
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,880
He passed away.

240
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,132
He refused to submit his daily record

241
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,343
regarding the deposed king to Ilgicheong

242
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,053
and was beheaded.

243
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,390
Pardon me? Why would a historian
refuse to turn in his daily record?

244
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,393
-What was his reason?
-No one knows.

245
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,729
That's why people suspected
that he never wrote one

246
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,690
or he misplaced it somewhere.

247
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,566
There were only rumors.

248
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,153
Why are you asking about him?

249
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,409
I happened to hear about him,
so I was just curious.

250
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,994
Don't ask anyone about him.

251
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,371
He didn't just refuse to turn it in.

252
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,416
He was sentenced to death
for committing high treason.

253
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,793
People might misunderstand
your intentions.

254
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,006
Understood, sir.

255
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,815
I can only find one reason.

256
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,191
It's because...

257
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,322
I visited the dethroned king's grave.

258
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,907
More importantly,
he was sentenced to death by my father

259
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,579
for committing high treason.

260
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,080
Your Royal Highness.

261
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,418
Don't get mistaken
and think that you know everything.

262
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,589
Not everything you hear is the truth.

263
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,092
Your Royal Highness.

264
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,429
Here is what you asked for.

265
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,097
Great, thank you.

266
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,100
But the scribe told me

267
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,478
that His Highness Prince Dowon

268
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,481
also viewed the records
from the year of Gyeongo.

269
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,067
Dowon?

270
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,081
-Jin.
-This is about the dethroned king.

271
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,667
It is unnecessary for you to step in.
And you shouldn't.

272
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,754
I wish to find out things about myself,
not about the dethroned king.

273
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,257
What is it that you want to know?
What are you thinking?

274
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,675
Is there

275
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,012
some kind of connection
between me and him?

276
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,889
Rim.

277
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,684
Did you know about it?

278
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,480
The day of mujin, month of gapsin,
and year of Gyeongo.

279
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,193
The day I was born,

280
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,613
His Majesty launched a coup.

281
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,159
Right, I did hear about it.

282
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,871
But that does not mean anything.

283
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,164
It was just...

284
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,251
-It was a mere coincidence.
-If that is the case,

285
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,796
why is it that

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,509
there is nothing about my birth
in the Royal Secretariat's records?

287
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,764
There are records
about His Majesty's royal orders,

288
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,933
appointing his aides in the coup
to high positions,

289
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,854
and you and Mother moving
into the palace from your residence.

290
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,605
However, I could not find my name

291
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,692
anywhere...

292
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,486
in the months' worth of daily records.

293
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,906
That is...

294
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,033
Well...

295
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,580
Mother stayed with her parents for a while

296
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,708
when His Majesty was preparing
for the revolt.

297
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,502
You were born at their house
and came to the palace later.

298
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,672
That is probably why
there is no record about your birth.

299
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,633
-It took place outside of the palace.
-Then answer this question.

300
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,553
Did you ever see Mother...

301
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,142
when she was pregnant with me?

302
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,236
Yes, I did.

303
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,448
She had made a little garment for you

304
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,241
and had even picked a name for you.

305
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,036
Father, Mother, and I

306
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,581
excitedly waited for the day
when we could meet you.

307
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,666
That I clearly remember.

308
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,629
Jin.

309
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,634
So please...

310
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,386
Do not doubt it ever again.

311
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,767
You are a member of our family

312
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,895
and my one and only brother.

313
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,357
That fact will never change.

314
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,283
Rim.

315
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,728
-Your Highness.
-Let His Majesty know.

316
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,901
Your Majesty.

317
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,113
His Highness Prince Dowon
is here to see you.

318
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,865
I do not feel well today.

319
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,617
Tell him to come another day.

320
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,164
Your Highness,
please return to your chamber.

321
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,377
Father.

322
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,422
Please let me in.

323
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,132
I wish to ask you something.

324
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,427
I was...

325
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,805
hit by an arrow.

326
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,101
Do you not wish to know...

327
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,397
if I am okay?

328
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,333
DAEJOJEON

329
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,587
I must

330
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,298
speak with you today, Father.

331
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,509
I will stay here

332
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,012
until you let me in.

333
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,778
DAEJOJEON

334
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,879
Your Majesty.

335
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,585
Your Highness.

336
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,963
You...

337
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,590
haven't fully recovered yet.

338
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,220
Please get up.

339
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,069
Then,

340
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,364
I will wait here with you.

341
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,241
Apprentice Goo.

342
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,995
All rise for His Majesty.

343
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,847
Look at you being all stubborn
with a female historian by your side.

344
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,601
What is all this fuss about?

345
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,103
I do not know what it is
that you want to know.

346
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,315
But I do not wish to converse with you,
nor do I have anything to tell you.

347
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,115
-Dowon!
-Father, have you ever...

348
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,952
loved me,

349
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,374
even for a short moment?

350
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,676
What do you mean?

351
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,261
Have you ever

352
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,099
thought of me or missed me,
even just once?

353
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,978
Have you ever felt affectionate toward me?

354
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,108
I am asking...

355
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,655
if you have ever...

356
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,457
truly thought of me

357
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,584
as your son.

358
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,276
Escort him back to his chamber.

359
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,987
Father.

360
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,323
Government Newspaper?

361
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,033
GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER

362
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,910
KIM IL-MOK REFUSES TO TURN IN DAILY RECORD

363
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,411
Don't ask anyone about him.

364
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,163
He didn't just refuse to turn it in.

365
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,124
He was sentenced to death
for committing high treason.

366
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
A historian who didn't

367
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,046
turn in his daily record.

368
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,553
JANNABI, JIWANUI

369
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,555
What?

370
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,432
Private history books?

371
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,309
Yes.

372
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,479
History books by private historians,
not governmental historians.

373
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,982
If you are a historian,

374
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,777
why are you looking for history
out on the streets?

375
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,529
It's filled with nothing but rumors.

376
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,240
I don't care if it's just filled
with rumors and gossip.

377
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,160
Do you have anything from

378
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,538
the year of Gyeongo?

379
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,957
Let's see. The year...

380
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,167
What? The year what?

381
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,338
Are you trying to get me in trouble again?

382
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,717
All the private history books
released in that year are banned.

383
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,888
We aren't supposed to sell it,
and you aren't supposed to look for it.

384
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,640
They're all banned?

385
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,852
There were too many rumors
about the deposed King.

386
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,729
He took people to Seoraewon or something

387
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,315
and slit their stomachs in half to death,

388
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:55,278
and he apparently associated
with Western barbarians.

389
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,573
Anyway, you won't find that
in any other book rental stores,

390
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,534
so don't go around looking for it.

391
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,849
Are you getting ready
to go into the palace already?

392
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,602
I was away for too long.

393
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,398
You need to quit working
as a female historian.

394
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,943
You need to quit for good and cut ties
with the Second State Councillor.

395
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,697
Why do you suddenly say that?

396
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,157
What do you think?

397
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,367
I can't let you go on. That's why.

398
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,745
When you went
to the Office of Royal Decrees

399
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,163
and became a bridal candidate,

400
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,999
I just figured that you had a plan.

401
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,376
My gosh.

402
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,754
He's a man who let his kid's wife die.

403
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,089
How would he know
how precious my daughter is?

404
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,344
Anyway, you need to have nothing to do
with Min Ik-pyeong from now on.

405
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,180
I'll find a way to patch up the situation.

406
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,932
Father.

407
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,227
I can protect myself.

408
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,521
And even the Second State Councillor

409
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,400
couldn't lay a finger on me.

410
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,697
Once I open my mouth,
he won't live to see another day either.

411
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,857
What are these?

412
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,734
A banned book.

413
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,769
Councillor, this is the book
you mentioned...

414
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,480
Put those down immediately!
This is a banned book!

415
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,982
-A banned book?
-It's a banned book.

416
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,991
All rise for His Majesty.

417
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,460
THE STORY OF HO DAM

418
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,509
THE STORY OF HO DAM

419
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,885
Why is this here?

420
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,181
Who put this here?

421
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,633
THE STORY OF HO DAM

422
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,804
THE STORY OF HO DAM

423
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,369
"The Story of Ho Dam"?

424
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,749
What did they say?
Is it the same for everyone?

425
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,502
Yes, the Royal Secretariat,
Office of Special Advisors,

426
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,754
Office of Censors,
Office of the Inspector-General,

427
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,923
Sungkyunkwan,
and the Street of the Six Ministries

428
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,258
all got these books.

429
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,096
What kind of lunatic
would do something like this?

430
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,349
Why would anyone leave
copies of this novel all over the palace?

431
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,103
I know, right? I wonder what it's about.

432
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,107
This book was on the list of banned books.

433
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,942
You'll get in trouble for reading it.

434
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,612
Everyone else is reading it already.

435
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,281
I'm getting nervous just by looking at it.

436
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,450
Just give it to the Royal Secretariat.

437
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,994
Tell them that we didn't even touch it.

438
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,871
I'll do it.

439
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,143
I was looking for a book
called The Story of Ho Dam.

440
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,271
It's become a banned book now,
so I can't get it.

441
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,916
THE STORY OF HO DAM

442
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,839
THE STORY OF HO DAM

443
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,889
-Did you collect every single copy?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

444
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,851
But many officials have already
read the book.

445
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,603
Then arrest them all!

446
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,023
Whoever talks about the banned book

447
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,026
will be tied to a rack
and have their tongue pulled out.

448
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,405
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

449
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:59,034
Your Majesty, the people you must punish
are the ones who spread the book,

450
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,869
not the ones who read it.

451
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:06,000
On top of that, you already know
who's responsible for this.

452
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,967
Second State Councillor,
watch what you say.

453
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,011
What do you mean I know who it is?

454
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,473
The Story of Ho Dam is just a novel
that used to be all over the street.

455
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,519
Anyone who reads this book
and talks about it should be blamed

456
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,855
for being dull-witted.

457
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,274
But whoever brought this banned book
into the palace

458
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,775
and questioned your authority

459
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,570
should definitely be punished severely,
Your Majesty.

460
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,328
I hope you'll stay level-headed
and make the right choice.

461
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,097
My lord, why did you bother
mentioning the Queen Dowager?

462
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,934
You know His Majesty
can't do anything to her.

463
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,271
His indecisive character
is what led things to come this far.

464
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,983
He's turning a blind eye even when she's
hiding a knife behind her back.

465
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,444
I took a look at the book earlier,
and I noticed

466
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,655
that a lot of the things
were written in detail.

467
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,490
Do you think the Queen Dowager

468
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,409
managed to find
Historian Kim Il-mok's daily record?

469
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,745
We've searched
the entire country for 20 years,

470
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,246
but couldn't find a single trace.

471
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,333
There's no way she would've been
able to find that all of a sudden.

472
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,131
Nothing in the book
seems too different from the truth.

473
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,137
So I don't get why my father
is so upset about this.

474
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,849
Well, the school named Seoraewon
that's mentioned in that book

475
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,645
was actually established
and run in real life

476
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,606
-by the dethroned king 20 years ago.
-The dethroned king?

477
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,945
Then are you saying Ho Dam
is actually the dethroned king?

478
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,573
I'm afraid so.

479
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,539
However, that novel is very different
from the truth.

480
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,583
I don't exactly know
what happened back then in detail.

481
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,253
But I do remember everyone talking about

482
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,923
how the dethroned king
established a school named Seoraewon

483
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,134
and taught Catholicism
to peasants and women.

484
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,261
And they also said he frequently performed

485
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,555
strange rituals, killed people,
and even tortured them.

486
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,391
But...

487
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,644
were those rumors all true?

488
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,564
Of course, they were true.

489
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,774
History says that His Majesty

490
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,819
raised an army to stop
the dethroned king's wickedness

491
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,155
and finally saved our country.

492
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,459
THE STORY OF HO DAM

493
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,252
NOT TOO LONG AGO...

494
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,722
Not too long ago,

495
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,725
there was once a scholar named Ho Dam.

496
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,312
Ho Dam loved to read.

497
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,981
He cared for others.

498
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,193
And he truly loved his country.

499
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,991
However, the outside world
was changing very quickly.

500
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,704
Western countries slowly started
exerting their influence to the East.

501
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,500
Ho Dam was sure that Neo-Confucianism,
which had been the pillar of Joseon

502
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,335
for 400 years,

503
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,921
was no longer enough to protect Joseon.

504
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,509
This country needed change.

505
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,639
Thus, he and his old friend named Yeongan
came together and set a goal.

506
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,600
HO DAM AND YEONGAN
THIS IS WHERE THE PATH WAS MADE

507
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,437
That's how Seoraewon was established.

508
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,358
The Chinese characters meant
"dawn" and "arrival".

509
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,568
"The place where dawn arrives."

510
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,948
It was a place
that was filled with youth and hope

511
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,575
hoping that Joseon will soon welcome
a new beginning.

512
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,702
Inside the walls of Seoraewon,

513
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,579
every class and gender

514
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,707
were all considered equal.

515
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,295
Anyone who had talent was welcome to join

516
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,797
and learn with everyone else.

517
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,174
What is this?

518
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,427
Day and night, the students would
always be busy reading their books.

519
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,138
-Take a look.
-What's he saying?

520
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,309
He's teaching us about the human heart.

521
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,520
You keep hogging it.

522
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,523
They were each other's compass
and the way to each other's future.

523
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,442
They all dreamt of the same future.

524
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,448
It was truly a beautiful place.

525
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,911
However, others thought quite differently
of Seoraewon.

526
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,122
It was where peasants
socialized with women,

527
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,665
and it was also a place

528
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,585
where people gathered
to learn the languages of barbarians.

529
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,462
No one could understand them.

530
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,257
Misunderstandings became rumors.

531
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,385
And rumors came back as the truth.

532
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,305
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

533
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,515
People eventually turned their backs
on Seoraewon.

534
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,160
The young people of Seoraewon
who were full of so much hope

535
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,746
all ended up

536
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,664
getting killed hopelessly.

537
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,709
Get over here!

538
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,628
No!

539
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,316
SEORAEWON

540
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,901
Ho Dam and Yeongan

541
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,238
also lost their lives that night.

542
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,993
They dreamed of building power

543
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,871
so we could protect our country.

544
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,627
However, their dream ended up
disappearing into darkness.

545
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,338
They failed

546
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,341
to welcome a new beginning.

547
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,475
THEY FAILED TO WELCOME A NEW BEGINNING

548
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,182
THE STORY OF HO DAM

549
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,061
I thought about it,

550
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,566
and I realized that you're the only one
who could possibly

551
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,235
know this much about Seoraewon.

552
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,905
You wrote...

553
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,075
this book, didn't you?

554
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,332
How much of it is true,
and how much of it is fiction?

555
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,170
If Ho Dam is the dethroned king,

556
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,297
and Yeongan is my father,

557
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,551
does that mean the current king
and his vassals

558
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,679
were the ones who slandered them?

559
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,849
I don't want you to get involved.

560
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,684
Why didn't you tell me?

561
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,646
I worked at the palace every day

562
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,859
without even being aware of that.

563
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,080
I saw you at the temporary palace
with the female doctor.

564
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,793
What are you trying to do?

565
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,214
I'll help you get on a boat to Qing
tomorrow morning.

566
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,049
-Stay there for a while.
-No.

567
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,761
-I'm never going to run away again.
-Hae-ryung!

568
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,596
Twenty years ago,
on the day of the incident,

569
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,183
my father said goodbye to me
and went to work like any other day.

570
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,477
And then,

571
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,314
he never came back.

572
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,073
I can't lose you the same way I lost him.

573
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,510
So please tell me.

574
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,430
What's going on right now?

575
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,017
And what can I do to help?

576
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,436
The only thing you can do

577
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,732
-is to stay alive.
-Jae-gyeong!

578
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,860
That was the promise I made
to your father.

579
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,113
I promised to save you
and to protect you from them.

580
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,739
So please...

581
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,993
I don't want you to get involved.

582
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:22,365
RECORD OF APPEARANCE,
PERSONAL RECORD SHEET

583
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,583
KIM IL-MOK

584
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,177
The day of sinchuk, month of jeonghae.

585
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,033
How...

586
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,785
do you feel?

587
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,746
I'm okay.

588
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,417
Have you read

589
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,795
The Story of Ho Dam?

590
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,798
-Yes.
-What do you think?

591
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,592
Do you believe

592
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,303
what's written in the book?

593
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,347
It coincided...

594
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,017
with the memories I have of Seoraewon

595
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,103
and my father.

596
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,982
However, if everything in the book

597
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,652
-is actually true...
-It means His Majesty

598
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,448
killed your innocent father
and the people of Seoraewon

599
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,702
and stole the throne from
the dethroned king.

600
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,876
But I still want to find out the truth.

601
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,922
The Royal Secretariat didn't keep
a single record about my birth.

602
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,426
And no one tells me about that day
including His Majesty,

603
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,761
my brother, and Sam-bo.

604
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,471
But I still need to find out

605
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,975
what happened on the day of my birth

606
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,563
and the death of the dethroned king.

607
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,776
Will you be able to handle it?

608
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,112
Yes.

609
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,157
I might not want to believe the truth.

610
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,118
But I'm finally ready

611
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,620
to face it.

612
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,502
In the year of Gyeongo,

613
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,464
a historian named Kim Il-mok

614
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,135
got executed for refusing to hand in
his daily record.

615
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,429
And there was a rumor

616
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:53,475
saying he secretly hid
his daily record somewhere.

617
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,809
Are you saying

618
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,437
the daily record from 20 years ago

619
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,397
still exists?

620
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,858
Yes.

621
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,818
That is...

622
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,488
quite possible.

623
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,010
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

624
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,305
There were eight Hanrims back then.

625
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,682
After Kim Il-mok got executed,

626
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,601
three of them gave up their positions.

627
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,728
And among those three,

628
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,564
this person is the only one
who's still alive.

629
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,277
Is anyone inside?

630
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,868
Who are you people?

631
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,207
I'm a female historian.
I came to ask you something...

632
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,876
Haven't you people harassed me enough?

633
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,379
What do you still want from me?

634
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,465
How many times have I told you
that I know nothing?

635
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,591
I know nothing!

636
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,929
Tell the so-called Second State Councillor

637
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,392
that I've never seen
Historian Kim's daily record

638
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,187
and that I'm just a yahoo
who always drinks all the time!

639
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,650
Tell him that I have
absolutely nothing to tell him.

640
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,488
Do you remember

641
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,490
Seoraewon?

642
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,037
I'm the daughter

643
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,040
of Seomun Jik

644
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,751
who used to be the dean of Seoraewon.

645
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,551
I came because I wanted to find out

646
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,012
what happened to my father.

647
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,233
I'm sorry I don't have much to offer.

648
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,194
No, it's okay.

649
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:11,654
I guess

650
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,115
time really flew by.

651
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,784
It only feels like yesterday
when your father

652
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,329
went around bragging
about the birth of his daughter.

653
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,873
Do you know my father?

654
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,583
He was in charge of Sungkyunkwan

655
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,585
back when I was a scholar there.

656
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,380
He was quite odd,
but he was also very wise.

657
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,673
I learned a lot from him.

658
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,136
But I really don't know much
about Seoraewon.

659
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,305
The vassals always caused a huge fuss

660
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,557
whenever anyone mentioned Seoraewon.

661
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,893
So His Majesty didn't talk much about it.

662
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,063
Whenever he went there,
he only took Historian Kim with him.

663
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,357
Are you talking about

664
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,486
First Historian Kim Il-mok who passed away

665
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,781
because he refused to hand in
his daily record?

666
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,076
Yes, I guess you already looked into it.

667
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:03,248
How was it recorded
by the Royal Secretariat?

668
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,793
It didn't say anything
about the interrogation.

669
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,630
I just read that he dishonored
the history of our country

670
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,677
by refusing to hand in his daily record.

671
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,597
He dishonored our country's history?

672
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,308
He's not that kind of person.

673
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,394
We stepped down because we were cowards.

674
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,188
But he remained as a historian

675
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,441
until the very end.

676
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,570
Officer Kim, you'll get executed
once the sun rises.

677
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,115
Please stop being so stubborn. Just
tell them where you hid your daily record.

678
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,827
They promised to keep you alive
if you tell them that.

679
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,707
Min Ik-pyeong formed a group
to dethrone His Majesty.

680
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,002
You must stay alive
so we can continue to record history.

681
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,713
Officer Sim.

682
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,675
Don't you get it?

683
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,429
The vassals who betrayed His Majesty

684
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,640
and the historians who succumbed to power

685
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,893
will gather together to distort history.

686
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,897
And our daily records will be edited
to their own advantage.

687
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,777
That's why I must protect my daily record.

688
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,697
I'll be protecting the truth

689
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,658
by sacrificing my life.

690
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,827
Officer Kim.

691
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,039
You'll get caught at this rate.
You must leave.

692
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,960
Officer Kim.

693
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,797
Officer Sim.

694
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,883
Come closer.

695
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,723
One day,

696
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,186
go to the island of the green forest.

697
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,314
That's where you can find the truth.

698
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,498
The island of the green forest

699
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,917
is where you can find the truth?

700
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,797
What's that supposed to mean?

701
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:18,925
I don't know either.

702
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,427
It seems like the place
where he hid his daily record.

703
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,638
But I don't know where that is.

704
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,605
Your Highness.

705
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,077
Your Highness.

706
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,455
What's the matter?

707
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,251
Did you happen to realize something?

708
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,919
Have you ever thought about

709
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,422
the meaning of Nokseodang?

710
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,591
The meaning of Nokseodang?

711
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,724
NOKSEODANG

712
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:14,188
NOKSEODANG

713
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,815
"Green".

714
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,984
"Island".

715
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,486
"The island of the green forest".

716
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,240
NOKSEODANG

717
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,201
"Nokseo".

718
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:40,006
NOKSEODANG

719
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,073
Are you saying the Queen Dowager was
the one who spread The Story of Ho Dam?

720
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,826
I might not be the person
you always thought I was.

721
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,538
Nothing will change.
You'll always be the person I know.

722
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,499
It's strange that it never rots.

723
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,292
When did you replace it?

724
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,920
I found Officer Kim Il-mok's daily record.

725
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,088
-No, don't do that.
-I will not allow that.

726
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,341
Are you sure it's not because
your father was involved?

727
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,427
It's up to the historians
to decide what to do.

728
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,262
It wasn't to set things right.
It was treason.

729
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,015
Someone changed the content of the letter.

730
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,684
A witness says
the daily record was fabricated,

731
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,561
and we have the daily record
to prove that.

732
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,397
It's a petition written
by Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung.

733
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,942
