00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,170
EPISODE 10

2
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,795
Apprentice Goo!

3
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,172
Apprentice Goo!

4
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,271
It looks like the rain will stop.

5
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,318
You should go. The rain stopped.

6
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,363
No, I'll help you get back.

7
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,535
You're completely wet.
How can I let you go by yourself?

8
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,953
I'm all right.

9
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,833
Oh, right.
I heard tigers live in this mountain.

10
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,170
-Tigers?
-Yes.

11
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,965
So let's go together.

12
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,155
I didn't think you'd be that scared.

13
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,781
Are you that scared of a tiger?

14
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,284
Scared? Who's scared?

15
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,536
I'm a prince of this country.
A tiger can't--

16
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,913
Over there!

17
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,421
I should have known
when you offered to walk with me.

18
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,175
Forget it. I would rather go alone
and get eaten by a tiger.

19
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,137
Do you want me to hold your hand?

20
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,063
It's not that I have an ulterior motive.

21
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,107
Whenever I climbed mountains as a child,

22
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,026
my brother would always hold my hand.

23
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,447
Then nothing scared me anymore

24
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,242
because I could feel
that someone was next to me.

25
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,010
I don't have an ulterior motive
for doing this either.

26
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,680
It's because of the tiger.

27
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,788
Where did she go?

28
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,623
Think something happened to her?

29
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,338
Apprentice Goo!

30
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,134
We were so worried!

31
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,052
Why did you come so far?

32
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,473
Oh, because I think
I dropped something on my way here.

33
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,228
-Where could it be?
-What is it? Shall I find it for you?

34
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,731
No. It's all right.

35
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,733
You can go first. I'll find it in no time.

36
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,068
Don't be too late.

37
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,156
Apprentice Oh already finished a bottle
while it was raining.

38
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,534
Come on, Apprentice Heo.

39
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,495
-You two should go, then.
-Okay.

40
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,461
-I'll be there soon. Don't worry.
-Okay.

41
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,508
Your Highness.

42
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,642
-Right, Apprentice Goo!
-Yes?

43
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,604
You don't have to find any firewood.

44
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,855
All right.

45
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,316
Then see you soon!

46
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,278
Let's go.

47
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,699
Your Highness.

48
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,661
-Seriously?
-I apologize. I was in a hurry.

49
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,051
Even so, how can you push a person?

50
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,358
You're pretty.

51
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,949
I mean, I was talking about that flower.

52
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,492
That flower is very pretty.

53
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,119
I know.

54
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,831
I have a mirror at home too.

55
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,292
You're really...

56
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,467
Your Highness.

57
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,970
I was just joking.

58
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,146
Officer Min.

59
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,148
SENIOR-SEVENTH RANK
OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES

60
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,649
You got here early.

61
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,575
Then I'll go and tidy up the library.

62
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
Wait.

63
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,338
You need to rewrite the wimu journal.

64
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
Pardon?

65
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,341
Again?

66
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,764
I already rewrote this twice.

67
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,475
I read it over ten times to see

68
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,477
if it was different
from the daily records.

69
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,062
Why do you keep asking me to rewrite it?

70
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,941
-I don't even know what to fix anymore.
-I can tell how you feel.

71
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,528
I can tell how you feel

72
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,323
about Prince Dowon between the lines.

73
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,410
This time, rewrite all of it.

74
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,248
Okay.

75
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,886
"I can tell how you feel
between the lines."

76
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
Is he a fortune-teller or something?

77
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,309
How can he possibly read my feelings?

78
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,395
My gosh, he's so inflexible.

79
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,918
-Hello.
-Hello.

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,468
Why are you coming out from there?

81
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,345
Because I live here.

82
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,472
What about your father?

83
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,932
He'll be here soon.

84
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,353
Hey, wait. Clerk Song.

85
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,522
Come on. Apprentice Song.

86
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,316
APPRENTICE: GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
NOT YET OFFICIALLY APPOINTED

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,652
You know there will be
changes in the personnel.

88
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,530
If your father asks

89
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,533
how good the officials
at the Office of Royal Decrees are,

90
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,953
tell him that I'm the brightest
and most diligent official.

91
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,455
-Just tell him that.
-I'm sorry.

92
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't like lying.

93
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,629
That little brat.

94
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,009
Good for you. You must be happy
to be born in a prestigious family.

95
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

96
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,933
What made you come this far?

97
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,812
Let me count how many of you are here.

98
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,856
There are so many of you.

99
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,358
Okay, make way.

100
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,527
Yes, sir.

101
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,196
Sir, I'm Second Historian
Hyeon Gyeong-muk.

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,032
-Hello.
-I'm Park Gun-su.

103
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,909
-Okay, hello.
-My name is...

104
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,745
My name is Kim Chi-guk.

105
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,123
Hello. I'm Kim Chi-guk,

106
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,542
a senior ninth-rank
who's always ready to work hard.

107
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,668
Please remember me.

108
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,215
My goodness, hello.
You and I are from the same school.

109
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,550
Please support me.

110
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,053
-Don't forget. My name is An Hong-ik.
-Let's have fun.

111
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,554
-Let's drink.
-Hello, sir.

112
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,766
Please don't forget my name.
It's An Hong-ik.

113
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,392
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

114
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,353
They're your juniors.
What are they doing?

115
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,812
Sir, my name is An Hong-ik.

116
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,106
They should be ashamed of themselves.

117
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,192
I'm the youngest historian there ever was.

118
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,444
My name is Kim Chi-guk.
Please remember my name.

119
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,238
-Sir, my name is An Hong-ik.
-I'm Kim Chi-guk.

120
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,490
An Hong-ik. Kim Chi-guk.

121
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,578
What? Your wife's sick?

122
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,288
A memorial service?

123
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,540
You little punks.
You only just started working.

124
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,417
Trying to get appointed somewhere else?

125
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,544
No, please don't get the wrong idea.

126
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,130
This place was
my late father's favorite place to drink.

127
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,717
Oh, I see.
I guess your father's soul rests here.

128
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,302
Hello, Hong-ik's father!

129
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,347
I'll make sure your son learns his lesson!

130
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,556
-Get over here.
-Wait.

131
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,767
-My ear hurts.
-No, wait.

132
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,853
-It hurts so much!
-Follow me.

133
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,360
Is that the appointment list?

134
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,987
-Yes, I just got it from--
-Give me that!

135
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,451
I pray to all my ancestors.

136
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,870
I spent so much money for this.

137
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,623
Please.

138
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,084
Please!

139
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,264
What? Where's my name?

140
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,100
I bought all those drinks for nothing!

141
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,480
I guess I'll just have to die here.

142
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:21,157
You'll all get appointed
and receive a pay raise

143
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,366
when the time is right.

144
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,869
You totally wasted your time and money.

145
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,121
When I used to be in your position,

146
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,666
I never even dreamed
of doing something so absurd.

147
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,419
I just worked hard and did my best.

148
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,963
And now, I'm a First Historian.

149
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
Back when you were a senior ninth-rank,

150
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,052
you used to chop firewood
for the Chancellor,

151
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,971
asking him for a promotion.

152
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,348
Well, that's...

153
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,726
I just needed some exercise.

154
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,609
Go write the appointment certificates.

155
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,860
-Okay.
-Okay.

156
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,780
APPOINTMENT CERTIFICATE:
GIVEN TO THOSE WHO GET NEWLY APPOINTED

157
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,160
There are so many changes
in personnel.

158
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,621
They're really causing a huge fuss

159
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,581
just to get a so-called good position.

160
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,584
They just end up drinking like fish.

161
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,169
I agree.

162
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,131
Obsessing over a rank
is all driven by vanity.

163
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,348
Why do you have that?

164
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,433
Oh, right. Record of Appearance.

165
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,395
People have different ranks now,
so we need to memorize it again.

166
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,774
That's so annoying.

167
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,824
Lim Han-baek
from the Office of Special Advisors

168
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,700
got transferred to the Office of Rites.

169
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,502
Jeong Gye-ju from the Office
of Diplomatic Correspondence

170
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,380
got appointed as the governor of Namhae.

171
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,549
Namhae, Gyeongsang Province.

172
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,636
SIHEUNG

173
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,098
NAMHAE

174
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,815
GIMPO

175
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,694
BOSEONG

176
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,750
Officer Hwang.

177
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,211
Some information in Record of Appearance

178
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,214
is a little different
from the official documents.

179
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,258
Which one's more accurate?

180
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,843
Record of Appearance, of course.

181
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,512
We even check their personal record sheet
to be sure.

182
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,557
-Really?
-There was once a big issue

183
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,601
because someone
wrote the wrong information.

184
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,686
Your seniors already
went through everything,

185
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,731
so use Record of Appearance
to write the appointment certificate.

186
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,482
Okay.

187
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,456
Where are you going, Apprentice Goo?

188
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,003
Official Jeong?

189
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,631
Yes, do you know where he's from?

190
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,965
Of course.

191
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,011
He always goes around boasting
that his father is

192
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,472
a very rich man in Namhae.

193
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,807
"Namhae"?

194
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,938
Where was Official Kim from again?

195
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:43,108
-He's from somewhere in Honam.
-Is he from Boseong in Jeolla Province?

196
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,945
Yes, that's right.
He told me he's from Boseong.

197
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,406
He speaks in a dialect
every time he gets drunk.

198
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,870
-Their hometown address isn't correct?
-Yes, sir.

199
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,332
There are 42 government officials
on the appointment list,

200
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,918
and 15 of them have different addresses.

201
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,129
-What?
-Take a look at this.

202
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,134
It says Official Jeong's hometown
is Siheung.

203
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,553
But Record of Appearance says
he's from Namhae.

204
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,640
-What's going on?
-Did Official Jeong get appointed...

205
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,559
as a governor in Namhae?

206
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,104
How did you know?

207
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,857
It's due to the Kinship Act.

208
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,362
KINSHIP ACT: A BAN ON PEOPLE OF KINSHIP
WORKING IN THE SAME GOVERNMENT OFFICE

209
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,446
What?

210
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,866
Are you saying the Ministry of Personnel
forged their personal information

211
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,326
so they won't get caught?

212
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,331
The Ministry of Personnel
would never do something like that.

213
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,667
The clerks were probably drunk
and made a mistake.

214
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,253
Officer Hyeon,
did you check the appointment list

215
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,380
with Record of Appearance last time?

216
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,465
No.

217
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,343
I was jealous of other people
getting appointed,

218
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,512
so I just wrote down what I got.

219
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,351
I want all of you to bring me
all the appointment lists

220
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,437
we received
from the Ministry of Personnel.

221
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,730
-Okay.
-Okay.

222
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,483
These punks.

223
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,501
I found one.

224
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,295
Seo Sang-hyeong.

225
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,673
He got promoted as the governor of Jecheon
in Chungcheong Province.

226
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,967
I also found two.

227
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,927
Yi Chang-du
in the Marketing Control Office.

228
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,055
Park Gi-taek
in the Bureau of Royal Genealogy.

229
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,767
There are so many of them.

230
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
They totally scammed us.

231
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,979
I don't understand.

232
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,941
Why would they lie about their hometowns
just to go back to where they're from?

233
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,443
Why do you think?

234
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,195
They want to go back home

235
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,989
looking all fancy
to show off how successful they've become.

236
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,451
Then they could even receive bribes
from people they know.

237
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,620
Those darn clerks.

238
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,081
How dare they do this
to the Office of Royal Decrees?

239
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm sure it wasn't done by the clerks.

240
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,627
If they get caught,
they could get dismissed.

241
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,212
They wouldn't have the guts.

242
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,255
Then who'd dare to do
something like this?

243
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,800
They handed over
forged documents to historians.

244
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,301
Who do you think?

245
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,386
Only one man in the Ministry of Personnel

246
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,013
would mess with such matters.

247
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,786
What are you going to do?

248
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,995
Officer Min.

249
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,499
Gosh, there he goes again! Min U-won!

250
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,513
I'll send you a gift of gratitude
once I'm settled.

251
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,809
Okay. The heavier, the better.

252
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,314
Okay, you should get going now.

253
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,110
Officer Min, what brings you here?

254
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,365
Let's go inside
and have some tea together.

255
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,825
-Sure.
-Come on.

256
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,243
Officer Min.

257
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,872
You become more handsome
every time I see you.

258
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,959
You kind of look similar
to how I used to look when I was young.

259
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,926
Please correct this.

260
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,054
What?

261
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,767
Some of the hometown addresses
are incorrect on the appointment list.

262
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,188
We can't use this to write
an appointment certificate.

263
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,148
Their hometown addresses are incorrect?

264
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,859
What do you mean?

265
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,282
Do you know nothing about this?

266
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,951
Well...

267
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,914
I don't know what you're talking about,

268
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,500
but the Ministry of Personnel
wouldn't have made such a mistake.

269
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,587
You and your colleagues must be mistaken.

270
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,883
Okay, then.

271
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,344
I'll go to the Inspector-General.

272
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,595
No, wait.

273
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,933
That's really not necessary.

274
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,062
Okay, fine.
I changed their hometown addresses

275
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,106
because of the Kinship Act.

276
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,650
I sometimes need to overlook

277
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,903
petty issues like this
when it comes to personnel appointment.

278
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,155
What are you talking about?

279
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,951
Breaking the law is not petty.

280
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,453
Don't be so bullheaded.

281
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,705
Officer Min.

282
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,916
You might not know much

283
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,252
because your job is to just record things.

284
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,089
But when you're in charge
of personnel appointment,

285
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,134
the Kinship Act can be
very frustrating and inflexible.

286
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,471
What's so wrong about appointing someone

287
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,431
to a governmental position

288
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,432
in their hometown?

289
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,601
They know their hometowns very well,

290
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,396
and they know people there,
so work will be easier for them.

291
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,357
Do you not know that there are cases
where those men

292
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,776
ended up overlooking the irregularities

293
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,028
of their family and friends
and eventually made

294
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,697
corrupt decisions?

295
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,534
That's just a small part of what goes on--

296
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,452
Even if you don't add to it,

297
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,248
there are already enough corrupt officials
who use their connections

298
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,208
to their advantage.

299
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,921
Please refrain
from causing any further chaos

300
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,048
in this country.

301
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,885
I'll delay the certificates.

302
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,638
Officer Min.

303
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,642
I really wasn't going to say this,

304
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,895
but I'm very good friends
with your father.

305
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,653
Do you think it's appropriate
to act this way to your father's friend?

306
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,656
Don't make me lose my face.

307
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,411
I'm giving you a chance

308
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,581
to save that great face of yours.

309
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,545
That little punk!

310
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,631
Darn it!

311
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,508
-Come on!
-Sir!

312
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,428
-Sir!
-Please come outside!

313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,597
-What's going on?
-Please talk to us!

314
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,599
-Sir!
-Sir!

315
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,352
-Section Chief!
-Sir!

316
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,228
-Sir!
-Sir!

317
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,272
-Please talk to us!
-Sir!

318
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,524
We're all waiting here!

319
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,026
How could you do this?

320
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,194
-Section Chief!
-Sir!

321
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,695
What do you think you're doing?

322
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,906
My lady.

323
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,409
If you feel wronged,
go to the City Administration Office

324
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,286
instead of causing a fuss like this.

325
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,914
Or file a petition to His Majesty.

326
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,457
My lady, the thing is--

327
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
Should I file a petition on your behalf?

328
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,719
Sa-hui, I'm glad you're here.

329
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,763
You have no idea what U-won did to me--

330
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,515
Aren't you even embarrassed?

331
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,851
I don't expect you to be
a decent nobleman.

332
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,772
But you should at least
try not to embarrass yourself.

333
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,067
How dare you!
Are you trying to add fuel to the fire?

334
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,486
Did U-won tell you

335
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,738
that I'm an embarrassment?
Did he say that?

336
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,407
No one needs to tell me that.

337
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,870
-What?
-People call you "Master Yes".

338
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,289
That's enough to make you
an embarrassment.

339
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,501
So please stop
soiling our family's reputation.

340
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,877
How dare you say that to me!

341
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,340
Do you think U-won is an honorable man?

342
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,136
Do you think he never did anything
to soil his reputation?

343
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,347
That little...

344
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,392
That brat!

345
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,398
Call Official Jeong from the Office
of Diplomatic Correspondence!

346
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,482
Do it now!

347
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,620
Do you want me to hold your hand?

348
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,462
Your Highness!

349
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,467
What are you doing out here at this hour?

350
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,302
I looked for you everywhere.

351
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,639
The night breeze is nice,
and the stars look beautiful.

352
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,767
Not because you're in love
with Apprentice Goo?

353
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,897
Do you think I think of only her all day?

354
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,023
Yes.

355
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,361
You're annoying sometimes.

356
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,113
You know me too well.

357
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,785
What's bothering you today?

358
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,081
It's not about me.

359
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,584
It's about my friend.

360
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,461
But you don't have any friends.

361
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,297
Go ahead.

362
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,800
A lady asked my friend to hold her hand.

363
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,052
That says it all, right?

364
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,887
That means she also likes me...

365
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,849
That means she likes my friend too, right?

366
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,644
Let me see.

367
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,314
Apprentice Goo isn't the type
to do that out of the blue.

368
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,359
It depends on what kind of situation
you were in.

369
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,278
We were in the mountain
where tigers are known to appear.

370
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,740
Then there's only one reason
to explain her behavior.

371
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,575
Right? There's just one reason, right?

372
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,410
She held your hand to survive.

373
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,082
I mean, think about it. She needed someone

374
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,252
to throw at the tiger
so she could run away.

375
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,379
It was her way to buy some time.

376
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,507
Are you saying she tried to use me
to buy time?

377
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,139
Forget it.
I shouldn't have asked a eunuch.

378
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,144
What did you just say?

379
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:08,608
You just insulted all the eunuchs
in this country. Your Highness!

380
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,905
The next petition is from the Office
of Diplomatic Correspondence.

381
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,872
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

382
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,916
I think I brought the wrong petition.

383
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,502
What is it about?
You've suddenly become very pale.

384
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,546
I've become curious,
so I'd like to hear it.

385
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,506
Read it out loud.

386
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,009
But Your Royal Highness...

387
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,431
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

388
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,271
"I, Jeong Gye-ju, from the Office
of Diplomatic Correspondence

389
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,189
ask for the impeachment

390
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,026
of First Historian Min U-won."

391
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,952
"It is always essential to be cautious

392
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,872
when hiring a historian.
And in order to prove their innocence,

393
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,334
we even looked into the mistakes
of their family members.

394
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,004
However, Min U-won’s father-in-law
got punished

395
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,505
for plotting a conspiracy.

396
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,592
And his wife ended up committing suicide

397
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,969
due to the feeling of being wronged.

398
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,765
That eventually caused an issue
with his credibility.

399
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,101
However, because he's the son
of a prestigious family..."

400
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,520
That's enough!

401
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,648
How could you even think

402
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,191
of bringing such a thing here?

403
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,194
Your Royal Highness,
we've already dealt with this issue

404
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,404
when we discussed his recruitment.

405
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,324
There's no reason to raise an issue now.

406
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,826
It may be in the past,
but if he really is at fault,

407
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,620
we must take that into consideration.

408
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,998
On top of that, he's a historian
who records our country's history.

409
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,000
If he is busy hiding his flaws,

410
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,002
how could we give him the right

411
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,463
to record history without any bias?

412
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,868
Officer Min, you should leave.

413
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,788
I am fine.

414
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,290
I order you to leave.

415
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,161
Please summon a scribe.

416
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,581
We'll resume the meeting once he arrives.

417
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,418
Officer Yang! Hey!

418
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,045
I'm going to go see the Chancellor.

419
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,422
Officer Yang!

420
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,258
Officer Yang!

421
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,385
-Hey!
-What's all the fuss about?

422
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,845
Did you hear the news?

423
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,767
Someone filed a petition
asking for the impeachment of Min U-won.

424
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,144
What do you mean?

425
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,438
"Impeachment"? On what basis?

426
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,106
You know...

427
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,276
That incident with his wife.

428
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,863
His father-in-law got beheaded,

429
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,823
and his wife committed suicide.

430
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,993
-She killed herself?
-Officer Min had to leave the meeting.

431
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,954
-I thought she died of an illness.
-Scribe Kim had to fill in.

432
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,874
They're fighting over whether he should
get impeached or not.

433
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,877
Min U-won's life

434
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,838
has been nothing but great,
but I guess this could be the end.

435
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,382
Why would the Royal Secretariat
report that petition?

436
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,803
-Why bring up his painful past?
-We didn't do it on purpose.

437
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,346
It somehow ended up in that pile.

438
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,766
And let's be honest.
He became a historian thanks to his father

439
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,810
even though he wasn't qualified.

440
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,769
Hey.

441
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,688
Don't you remember

442
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,859
how much you used to harass him
when he first started working here?

443
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,363
-That was just--
-Scribe Jegal is right.

444
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,992
When hiring historians, they look
into every single record of your past.

445
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,120
He shouldn't have been hired
considering what his father-in-law did.

446
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,665
I knew something bad would happen one day.

447
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,625
Shut your mouth.

448
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,878
Where is he right now?

449
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,171
How would I know?

450
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,799
He's probably too embarrassed
to come here.

451
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,759
Rumors have spread throughout the whole--

452
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,927
Officer Min.

453
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,147
Officer Son,
please take care of my work for today.

454
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,524
Okay.

455
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,449
Let's go.

456
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,875
Get back to work.

457
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,255
What a ridiculous fellow.

458
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,507
Of all the people he could slander,

459
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,175
he chose to slander Officer Min?

460
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
You all know Officer Min U-won.

461
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,804
Because of his upright personality,

462
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,806
people call him the Dong Hu of Joseon.

463
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,600
DONG HU: FAMOUS QIN DYNASTY HISTORIAN

464
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,894
I'll look into who wrote the petition.

465
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,021
I'm sure he got orders from someone.

466
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,731
Don't do anything.

467
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,359
Just don't.

468
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,246
What do you go around doing these days

469
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,248
to make someone
write a petition like that?

470
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,709
Who did you irritate this time?

471
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,546
My gosh, just drink up.

472
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,424
I'm sure this won't last very long.

473
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,522
Jeez, this is totally ruining my mood.

474
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,233
Excuse me.
Do you have any empty rooms here?

475
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,652
It's okay.

476
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,280
-I should get going.
-What...

477
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,657
You're leaving?

478
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,285
He acted like a man of integrity.

479
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,413
But it turns out he's just a spoiled son
of a high-ranking official.

480
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,084
Since his father acts as if he's the king,
he thinks he's the crown prince.

481
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,294
No wonder everyone calls him
Crown Prince Min.

482
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,255
He must have a really bad temper.

483
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,967
His wife couldn't take it anymore
and took her own life.

484
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,427
I couldn't have put up with it either.

485
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,814
Officer Min...

486
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,072
-What are you doing?
-Listen.

487
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,908
You'd better watch out.

488
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,372
Officer Min.

489
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,752
Everyone has already heard the rumor

490
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,797
that the Second State Councilor
made him a historian

491
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,675
when he wasn't even qualified
to be endorsed for the position.

492
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,179
You see, I usually love
things like backbiting, gossiping,

493
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,848
and scandals.

494
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,394
But I'm just so upset today.

495
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,895
I don't understand Officer Min.

496
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,732
He always talks about
the importance of abiding by the rules.

497
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,734
Why did he break the rules himself

498
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,860
and become a historian?

499
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,404
Had he opted for a cushy job elsewhere,

500
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,490
he would have never had to deal
with such humiliation.

501
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,117
I'm so upset for him.

502
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,083
Officer Min.

503
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,627
Well, we're...

504
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,172
We're going home now, sir.

505
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,548
Go and get ready.

506
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,844
We are going to Dongungjeon.

507
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,633
-Your Royal Highness.
-You may be seated.

508
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,103
I am sorry about earlier.

509
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,648
I couldn't let you record it yourself.

510
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,192
I understand.

511
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,570
I would not...

512
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,574
have been able to record it
in a fair manner.

513
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,664
Do not be concerned.

514
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,542
I will not respond to that petition.

515
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,389
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

516
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,768
Must you...

517
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,980
resign from your post?

518
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,233
-Please accept it.
-I cannot.

519
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,776
-Please accept it.
-Min U-won!

520
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,616
Have you forgotten what you said

521
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,368
when you came to see me that day?

522
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,871
You asked me to make you a historian.

523
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,540
You said you will record the names
of those

524
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,250
who suffered because of your father

525
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,502
and wash away his sins
with your own two hands

526
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,670
for it is...

527
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,922
For it is your last duty

528
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,134
as Dan-yeong's husband.
That is what you told me.

529
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,597
What happened
to that determination of yours?

530
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,062
No matter what people say,

531
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,231
you have done nothing to be ashamed of.

532
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,818
You aced the examination
but turned down the senior sixth-rank.

533
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,069
To become a historian,

534
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,030
you started at the lowest position.

535
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,491
You are an honest, upright historian

536
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,785
who never compromises his principles.

537
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,959
That is good enough. Do not falter.

538
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,504
I cannot take it anymore.

539
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,342
People...

540
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,679
gossiping about Dan-yeong.

541
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,727
She died a lonely death

542
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,563
while enduring contempt of the people.

543
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,025
She deserves...

544
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,363
to rest in peace, don't you think?

545
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,707
Please accept my resignation,
Your Royal Highness.

546
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,896
Officer Min.

547
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,901
Officer Min.

548
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,365
Please don't do this.

549
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,700
Step aside.

550
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,576
Officer Min.

551
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,330
I understand how you must be feeling.

552
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,627
You wanted to clear her name.

553
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,255
That's why you became a historian.

554
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,550
You were afraid that her name
would suffer disgrace

555
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,926
and eventually be forgotten.

556
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,762
Isn't that why you became a historian?

557
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,519
Please don't give up.

558
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,980
If you leave like this...

559
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,388
I heard you decided to resign.

560
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,516
All right. It's actually better this way.

561
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,894
Resign without any hesitation.

562
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,981
Things will quiet down if you leave
Hanyang for a couple of years.

563
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,152
You can find another position
in the government then.

564
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,116
Alcohol won't solve your problems.

565
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,244
Why on earth did you do such a thing?

566
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
Why did you...

567
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,209
have to do that to Dan-yeong?

568
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,920
That is how politics work.

569
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,548
You ought to make sacrifices if necessary.

570
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,800
No.

571
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,553
Not once...

572
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,808
have you sacrificed what is yours.

573
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,939
You always demanded sacrifice
from others...

574
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,112
including your own children.

575
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,656
Until when will you be obsessed
with the past?

576
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,951
To a man, dwelling on regrets
is like imprisonment.

577
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,203
Forget about it and move on.

578
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,204
Right!

579
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,499
Right.

580
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,629
You said the exact same thing on that day.

581
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,090
When I came back

582
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,218
after burying Dan-yeong
with my own two hands,

583
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,011
you just told me...

584
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,265
to forget what happened.

585
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,562
So?

586
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,981
Have you forgotten all about it?

587
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,859
All the people
who suffered because of you...

588
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,945
Is it that easy for you
to forget about them and move on?

589
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,617
You're drunk.

590
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,287
Go to your room.

591
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,164
I'm not like you, Father!

592
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,334
Hence, I cannot forget.

593
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,506
I can't forget Dan-yeong...

594
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,177
or the things you've done.

595
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,725
Dan-yeong.

596
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,020
Honey.

597
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,898
Gosh, you're here again?

598
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,775
You're a scholar at Sungkyunkwan.

599
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,236
You shouldn't be out and about like this.

600
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,239
Well, this is not my fault.

601
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,993
Regardless of what I'm reading...

602
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,663
all I see...

603
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,083
is your face, my dear.

604
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,253
So what am I supposed to do?

605
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,424
Did you just smile?

606
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,178
Come on. Don't be like this.

607
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,807
Let's spend just an hour together.

608
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,019
Come on, please.

609
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,647
I came all the way here
because I missed you.

610
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,249
I'm happy.

611
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,168
I'm happy too.

612
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,049
When I'm with you,

613
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,052
I'm so at ease...

614
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,472
and content.

615
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,329
Dan-yeong.

616
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,315
Please.

617
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,735
Why are you accusing my father
of being a traitor?

618
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,780
He has been a scholar his whole life.

619
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,783
He would never harbor
any treacherous thoughts.

620
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,993
I know he'd never do that.

621
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,414
Please, I beg you. Just this once...

622
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,250
Please help me just this one time.

623
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,627
No.

624
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,255
Please spare my family.

625
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,008
I beg you, Father.

626
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,637
Please spare us, just this once.

627
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,915
Please spare us just this one time.

628
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,451
My dear.

629
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,164
I brought you some porridge.

630
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,208
You haven't even had
a sip of water for days.

631
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,423
I don't want you to ruin your health.

632
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,937
Dan-yeong!

633
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,858
Dan-yeong, no...

634
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,818
Dan-yeong.

635
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,488
Is anyone outside?

636
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:44,843
MIN U-WON, MUN DAN-YEONG

637
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:50,015
MIN U-WON, MUN DAN-YEONG

638
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,066
Mun...

639
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,904
Dan...

640
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,241
MIN U-WON, MUN DAN-YEONG

641
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,367
...yeong.

642
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,975
Good morning!

643
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,769
Hello, sir.

644
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,980
-Hello, sir.
-Hi, you girls are working so hard.

645
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,248
-This is so nice.
-What are you doing there, sir?

646
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,918
Oh, I'm just trying to imagine

647
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,921
what it will feel like
to move up to the seventh rank.

648
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,758
-Very nice.
-That obnoxious prick.

649
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,469
Look, that desk belongs to someone else.

650
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,971
He resigned, so that's that.

651
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,098
Hence, this desk is no longer occupied.

652
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,310
Officer Son is next up for a promotion.
Why are you--

653
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,647
Hey, this world is cutthroat
when it comes to promotions.

654
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,858
Just because you started sooner
doesn't mean you'll be promoted first.

655
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,906
Well, I hold no hard feelings toward you.

656
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,117
So don't take it personally, okay?

657
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,666
Officer Min.

658
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,593
I was just trying
to warm up your chair for you, sir.

659
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,261
It can get very cold in the office.

660
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:35,806
Right, sir?

661
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,854
Hey, look at you arriving at the palace
after I get in.

662
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,815
I apologize, sir.

663
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,922
It's the wimu journal, sir.

664
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,010
I really did my best this time.

665
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,721
Please review it again, sir.

666
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,683
All right, I will.

667
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,813
Apprentice Goo.

668
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,400
Can we talk for a moment?

669
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,831
Your Highness.

670
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,751
You didn't see her for just one day.

671
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,670
Why must you be so upset over it?

672
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,173
You'll be bedridden with lovesickness
at this rate.

673
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,885
It is not because I didn't get to see her.

674
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,431
Forget it. It's nothing.

675
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm telling you.
That attitude of yours is the problem.

676
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,732
Depending on every little thing
that she says or does,

677
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,152
your mood fluctuates
from one end of the spectrum to the other.

678
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,696
Don't you know
the most basic rules of dating?

679
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,616
P and P. H and C.

680
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,743
-Push and pull.
-Hot and cold.

681
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,454
I told you
she won't fall for such tactics.

682
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,791
And last time
I followed your instructions...

683
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,878
This isn't just a theory, Your Highness.

684
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,172
It was proven to be effective
by our progenitors.

685
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,632
It is an eternal truth,

686
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,010
which holds the essence
of the history of mating.

687
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,762
Think about it.

688
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,765
When Ungnyeo came to Hwanung
and asked him to make her a human,

689
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,851
would she have found him charming
if he had said,

690
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,270
"Shall I?"

691
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,857
Because he only fed her garlic and mugwort
for 100 days

692
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,484
and kept her on pins and needles,

693
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,693
she fell for him hard

694
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,822
as soon as she became a human.
Then they got married right away

695
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,365
and had a child together!

696
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,663
Hence, you must never let women think
that you're easy.

697
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
Be mysterious,

698
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,834
aloof, and hard-to-read.

699
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,669
Do you understand?

700
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,216
About yesterday...

701
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,679
I showed you what you shouldn't have seen.

702
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,181
I'm sorry.

703
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,850
Well...

704
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,936
You don't really look sorry.

705
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,106
-What?
-Be honest. Aren't you grateful?

706
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,276
Neither Officer Yang
nor the Crown Prince could stop you,

707
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,820
but I ran after you
and told you not to give up.

708
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,363
Oh, that's...

709
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,701
You're right.

710
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,578
Thank you.

711
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,706
Who sounds that half-hearted and cold
when they're thanking someone?

712
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,624
Try to sound warm and sweet.

713
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,420
"Thank you, Hae-ryung." Like this.

714
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,256
But...

715
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,759
how could I call you by your first name?

716
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,011
Why not?

717
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,638
Other officers call me by my first name
sometimes.

718
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,015
Try it.

719
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,474
"Hae-ryung."

720
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,311
"Hae-ryung."

721
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,322
Hae.

722
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,618
Hae...

723
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,332
Gosh, why can't you do such an easy thing?

724
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,293
This is the problem with
all the noblemen in this country.

725
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,253
The useless obsession with authority

726
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,923
and the rigid hierarchy.
It's a serious problem.

727
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,008
It's nothing hard. Why can't you do it?

728
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,677
Your Highness, pretend
you're not bothered by this at all.

729
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,763
If you react now,
she'll think you're easy--

730
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:45,931
Apprentice Goo.

731
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,184
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

732
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,031
Follow me. Let's go to Nokseodang.

733
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,868
-Now, Your Highness?
-Yes, right now.

734
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,036
What is this about?

735
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,376
She is a historian.

736
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,879
She needs to know why she is
being summoned, Your Highness.

737
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,695
Please return to the office.
I'll be back soon, sir.

738
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,887
Please don't be offended

739
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,641
at what Officer Min said earlier,
Your Highness.

740
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,729
He wasn't trying to be fussy.

741
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,148
He was just worried about me. That's all.

742
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,442
That bothers me even more.

743
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,449
What do you think of Officer Min?

744
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,326
Pardon?

745
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,828
What do you think of that man?

746
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,292
I'd like to learn from him.

747
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,419
He is a wonderful mentor.

748
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,796
Is that really all?

749
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,217
Were you hoping there would be more?

750
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,888
What about other historians?

751
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,098
The youngest one.

752
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,142
What do you think of him?

753
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,772
Officer Kim Chi-guk is...
He's just like a cute little brother.

754
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,607
What about the big guy who looks kind?

755
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,985
Officer Son already has
three grandchildren.

756
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,655
-Then what about the good-looking one--
-Your Highness.

757
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,159
What is the matter with you today?

758
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,788
Is there something
you'd like to say to me?

759
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,962
I feel like...

760
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,341
I know nothing about you.

761
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,844
And...

762
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,472
I don't like it.

763
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,726
I can only have these kinds
of encounters with you,

764
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,436
so I can't know more.

765
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,735
I wonder what you are like
outside of Nokseodang,

766
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,946
who you spend time with,

767
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,656
and if you...

768
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,494
even take notice of me at all.

769
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,679
As for my family...

770
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,099
I have an elder brother.

771
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,145
The age gap between us is quite big,

772
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,981
but he adores me so much.

773
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,863
In my free time,

774
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,074
I either peruse objects
from the Western world

775
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,492
or read books.

776
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,828
I especially like books on astronomy.

777
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,539
Oh, right. You probably know this already,

778
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,750
but I simply cannot read romance novels.

779
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,963
They make me cringe.

780
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,552
I moved to Qing when I was six years old,

781
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,888
and I was a vicious,
feisty little girl back then.

782
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,223
The kids kept calling Joseon
a weak country,

783
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,558
and I couldn't take it.

784
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,686
After I beat up

785
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,397
about eight of them,
they finally stopped making fun of me.

786
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,193
But I obviously had no friends after that.

787
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,576
Oh, and...

788
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,871
I actually

789
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,873
lied to you once, Your Highness.

790
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,374
To me?

791
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,378
I told you I climbed mountains holding
my brother's hand when I was little.

792
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,713
That was...

793
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,673
a lie.

794
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,511
That never happened.

795
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,930
Why did you tell such a lie?

796
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,890
Because I had an ulterior motive.

797
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,561
Do you want me to hold your hand?

798
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,564
It's not that I have an ulterior motive.

799
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,775
Whenever I climbed mountains as a child,

800
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,693
my brother would always hold my hand.

801
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,571
Then nothing scared me anymore

802
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,865
because I could feel
that someone was next to me.

803
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,876
I think I've told you enough for today.

804
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,629
If I tell you too much in one day,

805
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,173
you may not want to know more about me.

806
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,802
I don't want that.

807
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,599
All right.

808
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,476
You may leave.

809
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,676
I told you to lie low for the time being.

810
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,761
Why are you so impatient?

811
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,347
I must inform the Queen Dowager
of an urgent matter.

812
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,547
Goo Jae-gyeong.

813
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,594
I want you to look into
Third Inspector Goo Jae-gyeong.

814
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,403
The Second State Councilor?

815
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,157
Yes, sir. I saw him walking toward
the Inner Palace with the head eunuch.

816
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,744
It looked like they were on their way
to have an audience with His Majesty.

817
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,332
Isn't it actually a good thing?

818
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,708
Had it been any other place,

819
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,127
Officer Min would have
definitely sent one of us.

820
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,047
But he can't send us
because they went to the Inner Palace.

821
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,758
Even so, he won't just sit back
and do nothing.

822
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:23,346
Lads, don't say anything to Officer Min
and just concentrate on your work.

823
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,140
Let's have at least one quiet,
problem-free day, please.

824
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,600
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

825
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,560
My gosh!

826
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,229
What were you talking about?

827
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,148
Life's hurdles.

828
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,609
We should overcome them.

829
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,320
Pardon?

830
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,212
You must enter the chamber no matter what.

831
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,173
Then I will proceed accordingly,
Your Majesty.

832
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,936
Your Majesty.

833
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,939
I'd like to ask you a question.

834
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:22,447
Is there anything about Prince Dowon
that you are hiding from me?

835
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,416
Who's there?

836
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,613
If anyone finds out about you...

837
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,657
I will endure it
if my feelings will wreak havoc.

838
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,202
A historian was arrested,
which is unprecedented.

839
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,662
It is time we filed an ultimate petition.

840
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,248
I shall teach those punks
a serious lesson.

841
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,250
We are historians who preserve history.

842
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,503
Do not back down!

843
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,755
Apparently they're holding out
with the doors locked.

844
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,757
She is my only family.

845
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,593
She committed a crime.
There is nothing I can do to help you.

846
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:29,597
You must be the only prince in the world
looking after an imprisoned woman.

847
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,058
You're the only woman
who makes a prince do these things.

848
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,102
Then I will go with you.
I will run away with you.

849
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,439
