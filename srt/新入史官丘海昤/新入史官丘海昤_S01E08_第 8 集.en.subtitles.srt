A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,505
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,605
What are you doing?

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,290
-Who might you be?
-His Highness Prince Dowon

5
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,334
is here as a wimusa. Be courteous.

6
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,922
Your Highness,
I apologize for not recognizing you.

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,424
I am Kim Hong-rok,
a former royal physician

8
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,634
at the Medical Office.

9
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,677
You were a royal physician?

10
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,763
Then why did you let her do that?

11
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,973
She was infecting the children.

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,683
No. She wasn't, Your Highness.

13
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,936
It is a medical procedure
called variolation.

14
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,521
"Variolation"?

15
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,398
Since ancient times, it's been known that
infecting healthy people

16
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,234
with fluid from those with active smallpox

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,944
immunizes them against the disease

18
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,488
after causing a mild case of it.

19
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,199
However, half of the people
who are variolated die.

20
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,034
It is a high-risk prevention method.

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,453
I tested it on 12 children,

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,038
and seven of them have fully recovered.

23
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,209
-Then what about the five of them?
-They aren't doing too well.

24
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,585
You wicked witch!

25
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,672
How could you conduct such a risky test
on children who are physically weak?

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,759
But she said she managed
to save seven of them.

27
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,010
She saved seven children.

28
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,929
Providence is what saved
those children's lives.

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,722
It has nothing to do with what she did!

30
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,976
Had she done nothing to the children,
even the dying ones

31
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,854
might not have caught the disease at all.

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,730
However, we couldn't just sit back

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,150
and hope they wouldn't catch the plague.

34
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
We ought to do something to save
at least one more life.

35
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,657
Your Highness. Please allow us to perform
variolation on more people here.

36
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,368
It is the best solution we have
at the moment.

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,290
No, you cannot.

38
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,086
We mustn't take such a huge risk
using people's lives.

39
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,839
Stop this now.

40
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,108
My dear, what on earth are you doing here?

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,443
What if someone sees you?

42
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,113
Why did you bring His Highness here?
You should've stayed in the office.

43
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,533
Well, I had no choice.

44
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,660
His Highness kept insisting
on coming here.

45
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,041
The epidemic is in full force,

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,544
so please make sure His Highness
never leaves the guest house.

47
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,005
He must return to Hanyang
as soon as possible.

48
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,800
I will do my best
to persuade His Highness.

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,927
By the way...

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,305
Are you all right, my dear?

51
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,890
Don't worry about me.

52
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,310
Just focus on taking good care
of His Highness.

53
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,148
Okay, I will.

54
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
-I hope I did the right thing.
-Pardon?

55
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,075
The procedure called variolation,
which the female physician was performing.

56
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,245
I did the right thing by stopping her.

57
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,872
Yes, I did the right thing.

58
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,459
Don't you agree?

59
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,754
Well, I'm not so sure.

60
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,799
Her explanation made sense.

61
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,593
I don't think she's wrong.

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,430
Oh, she actually stopped by earlier
and asked me

63
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,225
to make sure you never leave
the guest house

64
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,560
as you might catch the disease.

65
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,356
She's obviously concerned about you.
You were too unsympathetic earlier.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,983
What do you mean?

67
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,194
Protecting the people
is my duty as a prince--

68
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,655
Sure, of course. You're absolutely right.

69
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,573
Since you're a prince of this country,

70
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:47,328
you do not need to listen to what
a mere female physician has to say.

71
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,665
Anyhow, you've already made your decision,

72
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,127
so don't have second thoughts
and just get a good night's sleep.

73
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,379
Who cares about the people and smallpox?

74
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,425
What matters the most is you
finding peace of mind, Your Highness.

75
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,028
Since ancient times, it's been known that
infecting healthy people

76
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,904
with fluid from those with active smallpox

77
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
immunizes them against the disease

78
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,576
after causing a mild case of it.

79
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,396
Ma'am.

80
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,692
I'll do this.
You can take care of something else.

81
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,903
Okay, thank you.

82
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,994
Let's eat.

83
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,048
I'm very impressed by you.

84
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,968
I heard all the physicians in other towns
gave up and left

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,678
in fear of catching the disease,

86
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,224
but you came all the way here
to look after the ill.

87
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,976
It must be very stressful.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,603
It can't be as bad

89
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,939
as the pain these kids
are experiencing now.

90
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,192
Besides,
I'm responsible for this situation.

91
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,698
Well, about what His Highness said...
Please don't take it to heart.

92
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,160
He can switch from being tolerable
to totally obnoxious in a flash.

93
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,578
He can be quite moody.

94
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,387
She's burning up with fever.
We should try to lower her temperature.

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,111
Aren't you afraid of touching
those who are infected?

96
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,239
Judging from your skin,
I don't think you've ever had smallpox.

97
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,451
No, I'm not afraid.

98
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,082
I actually remember

99
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,127
something was put into my arm,
and I remember it really hurt.

100
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,712
They said it'd prevent smallpox.

101
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,382
Looking back,
I wonder if that was inoculation.

102
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,428
My father calmed me down
by explaining to me that I'd be fine

103
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,888
after suffering for a short while.

104
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,225
Do you remember roughly when that was?

105
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,605
I'm 26 years old now,

106
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,108
so it was probably around 20 years ago.

107
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,366
Your father must've been well versed
in medical knowledge.

108
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,162
Back then, not many people in Joseon

109
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,788
knew how to perform variolation.

110
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,251
He probably heard about it
through the grapevine.

111
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,130
He had no medical knowledge.
He just assisted a merchants' guild

112
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,508
and never held any public office.

113
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,552
He passed away when I was little.

114
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,681
My apologies.

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,184
I assumed you were
from a prestigious family.

116
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,727
I shouldn't have brought it up.

117
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,232
Gosh, please don't worry.
I'll take that as a compliment.

118
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm truly flattered.

119
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,862
You don't look like a court lady.

120
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,989
What brought you here?

121
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,492
Right, I should introduce myself.

122
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,744
I'm a female historian.

123
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,872
I'm Goo Hae-ryung, an apprentice
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,543
I'm Mo-hwa.

125
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,052
The news about the plague
only reached the capital recently.

126
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,055
Are you saying people are already
hoarding things in preparation for it?

127
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,122
Officer Seong.

128
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,215
-I apologize, Your Royal Highness.
-How rude.

129
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,051
His Royal Highness can't even sleep
due to his concern for our people.

130
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,346
How dare you doze off and even snore
in front of His Royal Highness!

131
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,017
Does the palace
look like your bedchamber to you?

132
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,811
As a historian, you must record everything
you see and hear.

133
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,271
How dare you fall asleep!

134
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,691
I sincerely apologize. Please forgive me.

135
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,986
Your Royal Highness, that historian dared
to mock the dignity of the court

136
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,113
and neglected his crucial duty
as a historian.

137
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,618
Please send him to the Royal
Investigation Bureau to be punished.

138
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,828
-Please punish him.
-Please punish him.

139
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,371
Enough, all of you.

140
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,207
Everyone is aware of
the historians' heavy workloads.

141
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,376
Who'd want to become a historian
if we punished him

142
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,921
-for something like this?
-But, Your Royal Highness--

143
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,759
Have you forgotten what we are supposed
to discuss at this meeting?

144
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,059
I will think about what to do
with the historian later on.

145
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,561
First, send all the rice
from other provinces

146
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,313
to Pyongan Province and Hwanghae Province.

147
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,398
I will open the Royal Treasury
if there isn't

148
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,150
enough money to buy all the medicine,

149
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,860
so search all over the country if you must

150
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,945
in order to obtain enough medicine
for everyone.

151
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,364
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

152
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,329
Officer Seong got caught dozing off.

153
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,122
-He dozed off?
-At the royal meeting?

154
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,415
While he was recording it?

155
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,709
Don't even get me started.

156
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,588
My legs were all wobbly,
and my heart was pounding like crazy.

157
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,256
Gosh!

158
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,390
Then what's going to happen
to Officer Seong now?

159
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,518
Will he get fired?

160
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,229
Then he should be grateful.

161
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,273
A long time ago, a historian
who had dozed off while on duty

162
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,651
was exiled to a faraway land...

163
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,824
That won't happen to him, right?

164
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,201
I'd love to send him

165
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,247
to the countryside to teach him a lesson,

166
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,165
but His Royal Highness

167
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,252
mercifully said he will be forgiven
if he submits a letter of apology.

168
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,214
Officer Seong, consider yourself lucky.

169
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,884
Had it been His Majesty instead of
His Royal Highness, you would've been...

170
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,387
I know.

171
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,265
I'm too ashamed to say anything.

172
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,184
Come on. It's not your fault.

173
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,812
We're swamped with work
because of the plague.

174
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,814
It's because we're short-staffed.

175
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,107
That is true.

176
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,235
We have to be there
for all the royal meetings and lectures.

177
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,987
Following around His Majesty
is enough work,

178
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,739
and we have His Royal Highness too.

179
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,199
And as you know,
our work doesn't end there.

180
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,077
We have to record
all the royal commands and send them out.

181
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,663
Also, we must put all of them
into the administration record.

182
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,584
I actually thought about visiting the guru
in Gyeryongsan

183
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,210
so that I can learn how to clone myself.

184
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,713
We have to record our opinions
on current events too.

185
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,673
Even when I go home,

186
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,009
I have to work as hard as I do here.

187
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,845
I don't even have time
to enjoy a glass of wine with my wife.

188
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,847
Officer Son, you said you missed

189
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,266
your second grandchild taking
his first step because of work.

190
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,024
Officer Yang, please file a petition
on behalf of all of us.

191
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,859
Either hire more historians

192
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,611
or reduce our workload.

193
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,905
Please do something.

194
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,742
Why are you taking it out on me again?

195
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,704
Look, did any of you have no idea
what you were getting yourselves into

196
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,998
when you decided to become historians?

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,084
Even during our Sungkyunkwan days,
our seniors always said,

198
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,670
"Don't ever work
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

199
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,216
The heavy workload will age you
like there is no tomorrow."

200
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,760
They warned us countless times.

201
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,845
Has any of you never heard that before?

202
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,350
Then why are you guys whining to me now?

203
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,311
I'd love to give each of you
a big smack in the head right now.

204
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,396
Now, get back to work!

205
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,199
And you. "Senior Ninth-rank Historian
Seong Seo-gwon

206
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,243
dozed off and snored while on duty."

207
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,829
Make sure you write that in your records.

208
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,705
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,013
Hello.

210
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,434
Ma'am.

211
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,563
I'm here to pick up your child.

212
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,315
There's a new isolation camp
in the other village.

213
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,512
My baby...

214
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,762
My lady.

215
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,558
Did something happen?

216
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,980
Because of me,

217
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,777
a child lost her life.

218
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,783
I could've saved her.

219
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,495
I could've protected her,

220
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,209
but I turned my back on her.

221
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,377
Thank you.

222
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,133
Are you feeling a little better now?

223
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
My lady, someone once told me

224
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,567
that it always gets windy and rainy
when flowers start to bloom

225
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,738
and that life is full of farewells.

226
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,619
You can neither blame yourself

227
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,913
nor others

228
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,833
for some things in life.

229
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,297
So please don't beat yourself up.

230
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,094
Instead, use that energy
to do the things that you can do.

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,571
VARIOLATION FOR COWPOX BY YEONGAN

232
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,956
Your Royal Highness, Her Majesty is here
for an audience with you.

233
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,125
She may enter.

234
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,300
Your Majesty.

235
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,096
I know that you're busy.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

236
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,056
Not at all. Please have a seat.

237
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,402
I heard a messenger arrived
from Pyongan Province.

238
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,864
I hear that the situation is very bad.

239
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,200
-Yes.
-Crown Prince.

240
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,579
Make sure Prince Dowon can return
as soon as possible.

241
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,831
I am so concerned about him

242
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,042
that I can neither eat nor sleep.

243
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,754
What if we hear some terrible news
one of these days?

244
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,423
I am awfully anxious

245
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,842
every single day.

246
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,762
I, too, would love to bring him back
as soon as possible,

247
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,306
but Father...

248
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,062
I will order him to return
as soon as possible.

249
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,690
Thus, please look after your health

250
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,319
so that you can welcome him
with a big smile when he returns.

251
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,822
Yes.

252
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,742
I should.

253
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,720
Your Highness, are you asleep?

254
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,265
No, I'm not.

255
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,477
Come in.

256
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,321
What's the matter? It's getting late.

257
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,624
What is this?

258
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,835
This book will tell us
how we can save everyone.

259
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,340
Cows were the solution, not people.

260
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,010
Using the fluid from cowpox lesions
can help us

261
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,054
stop the smallpox outbreak.

262
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,099
Use the fluid from cowpox lesions?
What do you mean?

263
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,476
I'm referring to the procedure
where the fluid

264
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,979
from cows with cowpox
is inserted into people.

265
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,897
Please don't be alarmed.

266
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,650
The fluid from smallpox lesions
can have bad effects

267
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,610
on healthy individuals
and can even kill them.

268
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,406
However, the fluid from cowpox lesions
only causes mild smallpox

269
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,783
without any life-threatening
adverse effects.

270
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,993
That makes no sense though.

271
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,413
The death rate is 50 percent
even with the fluid from infected humans.

272
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,998
How could animals'--

273
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,167
But in a European country called England,
they saved many lives

274
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,295
through this method using cowpox.

275
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,006
-Also near the Dead Sea--
-I don't want to hear it.

276
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,757
Stop talking about it.

277
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,019
Your Highness, I failed to understand

278
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,647
wanting to do anything

279
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,151
to save a dying family member.

280
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,363
It is my fault.

281
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,202
I've finally realized how cowardly it is

282
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,915
to just leave it up to heaven's will
when it comes to people's lives.

283
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm fully aware of how absurd
all of this must sound to you.

284
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,423
But if I were one of the people here,

285
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,301
who are just waiting to die,

286
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,514
I'd want to take my chances
on the absurd idea.

287
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,852
Because I'd be so desperate.

288
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,483
Please read it, Your Highness.

289
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,904
If you wish not to give us permission
to try it, you can still say so

290
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,906
after reading the book.

291
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,979
VARIOLATION FOR COWPOX BY YEONGAN

292
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,401
"Since ancient times,
people in Europe have believed

293
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,070
that women who milk cows
never catch smallpox.

294
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,575
This method originated from that belief.

295
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,747
All 36 people who were injected with the
fluid from cowpox lesions fully recovered,

296
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,252
and they will be immune to smallpox
for the rest of their lives.

297
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,339
However, I completely failed."

298
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,508
Wait...

299
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,553
"The people don't even want to listen
to me for they don't want

300
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,430
to be injected with pus from animals."

301
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,681
Is anybody inside?

302
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,476
"Bizarre rumors have spread
all over the city.

303
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,896
-My gosh.
-I could win the battle against smallpox,

304
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,106
but not against people's fear."

305
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,065
YEONGAN SEOMUN JIK

306
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,196
"This is our duty, which we ought to
fulfill even if it takes our whole lives.

307
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,240
Earning the people's trust

308
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,578
and freeing our country, Joseon,
from smallpox.

309
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,541
The era of solely trusting heaven's will
with people's lives must come to an end.

310
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:07,464
This is an era where people's lives
are saved by people."

311
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,737
Your Highness, I brought her.

312
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,959
Your Highness.

313
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,503
I read the book.

314
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,507
I spent all night thinking about it,

315
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,052
but still couldn't believe it.

316
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,473
The fact that this sick cow
can save people's lives.

317
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,351
I find it so hard to believe.

318
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,979
Everyone reacted the same way.

319
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,817
They all thought
it was a preposterous idea.

320
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,904
Right, it is a preposterous idea indeed.

321
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,658
However, I...

322
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,085
I'd like to believe
this preposterous idea.

323
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,838
I truly mean it.

324
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,300
So answer my question.
I find it awfully hard to believe.

325
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,553
How could you trust everything in the book

326
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,930
to be true?

327
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,558
I'm the female physician

328
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,893
you read about in that book.

329
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,609
I studied medicine at a place
called Seoraewon around 20 years ago.

330
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,694
My teacher and I

331
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,322
wrote the book together
while studying the variolation method.

332
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,035
I collected the fluid from cowpox lesions

333
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,413
and injected people with it
with my own hands.

334
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,998
Also, I saw

335
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,210
all the people completely recovering
with my own two eyes.

336
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,755
Can you prove

337
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,507
what you just said with your own life?

338
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,305
Yes, Your Highness.

339
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,268
Follow me.

340
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,696
What do you mean, Your Highness?

341
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,199
You wish to inject the people
with pus from cows?

342
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,409
You said yourself
that we mustn't take a risk

343
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,536
using the people's lives.

344
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,331
Back then, I was terrified by the idea.

345
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,626
But I am no longer afraid.

346
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,628
I won't just sit back

347
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,464
and watch the plague spread further.

348
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,925
Never in my life
have I heard of a medical procedure

349
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,844
that uses pus from animals.

350
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,471
How could we stop the outbreak

351
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,307
using such a preposterous method,
Your Highness?

352
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,642
We can stop the outbreak.

353
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,021
Both vanquishing the plague
and saving people's lives

354
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,191
no longer depend on heaven's will.

355
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,652
Your Highness.

356
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,779
With all due respect,

357
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,490
the people won't obey this order easily

358
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,867
even if you believe in this method,
Your Highness.

359
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,745
The female physician had a hard time

360
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,915
gathering the children
to test variolation on.

361
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,501
-If we are using pus from cows--
-Hence,

362
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,130
I want to reassure the people
by demonstrating it first.

363
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,633
Your Highness, you cannot do that.

364
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,760
Please don't, Your Highness.

365
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,517
Can you inject me

366
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,728
with the fluid from cowpox lesions?

367
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,607
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,577
Did you know about this?

369
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,418
Why did His Highness
suddenly change his mind?

370
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,381
I visited His Highness last night
and gave him a book.

371
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,927
It's a book about cowpox variolation.

372
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,096
Why did you do that?

373
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,516
I wanted His Highness to change his mind.

374
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,851
For what reason?

375
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,645
Because I thought
it was the right decision.

376
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,774
Do you think...

377
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,652
it was the right decision to make
even as a historian?

378
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,323
I am a subject of this nation
before I am a historian.

379
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,576
I can't just sit
and write historical records,

380
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,205
-knowing how many people are dying.
-That is your job as a historian!

381
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,584
Your job is to listen, not to speak.

382
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,252
You're not someone who makes decisions.

383
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,631
Your job is to record all the decisions.

384
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,592
Why do all that work to recruit

385
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,094
and train us
if all we have to do is record things?

386
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,848
Why don't they just hire anyone
who can write?

387
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,725
Many people know how to write,

388
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,103
but only a handful of people
know their place.

389
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,112
There are rights and wrongs
in every history.

390
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,865
And we, as historians,

391
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,284
ought to accept that fact.

392
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,079
The moment you decide
to right someone's wrongs

393
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,081
or change someone's opinion...

394
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,875
The moment you have such thoughts,

395
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,420
you turn into a novelist

396
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,966
who writes about history
however she likes.

397
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,719
Do you understand?

398
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,997
Mo-hwa!

399
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,335
My dear, what on earth are you thinking?

400
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,921
Will you actually inject His Highness
with pus from cows?

401
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,339
Didn't you hear?

402
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,218
-His Highness ordered me to do so.
-Even so, you shouldn't.

403
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,388
If anything bad happens to His Highness,

404
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,434
you will be decapitated.

405
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,811
You'll be beheaded!

406
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,941
Mo-hwa, please!

407
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,235
Gosh.

408
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,529
Mo-hwa!

409
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,201
It's Pyongan Province.
Go there and bring her back in one piece.

410
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,662
I have a lot to ask that woman.

411
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,922
Why are they putting
cow pus in His Highness?

412
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,673
What is this awful nonsense?

413
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,134
It is apparently
the medicine of Western barbarians.

414
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,886
It's to stop smallpox.

415
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,639
That's the most absurd thing
I've heard in my life.

416
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,682
I hope he doesn't become a cow.

417
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:26,361
Your Highness, please withdraw your order.
It's not too late.

418
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,696
This is too dangerous.

419
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,158
I'll be injected with cow pus instead.

420
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,285
I will gladly sacrifice this lowly body

421
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,703
for your will.

422
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,706
Your Highness!

423
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,292
We are all ready.

424
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,515
Roll up the screen.

425
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,137
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

426
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,397
Your Highness...

427
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,573
-Take her away.
-Yes.

428
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,396
Hop on.

429
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,357
Now!

430
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,822
Mo-hwa!

431
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,535
Mo-hwa!

432
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,458
Excuse me. Where is
the female physician who was here?

433
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,753
She didn't come in last night.
Wasn't she in the guest house?

434
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,757
Mo-hwa!

435
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,718
What? The female physician is gone?

436
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,722
Yes, she went out
to check on the children last night,

437
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,474
but she never came back.

438
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,560
She never came back to her residence.

439
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,563
-Where could she be?
-How is His Highness?

440
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,316
He is highly feverish
and isn't in his right mind.

441
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,153
I think he's sick with smallpox.

442
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,364
She probably ran away
because she couldn't deal with this.

443
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,409
Let the soldiers
search through the village immediately.

444
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,411
We must capture that physician.

445
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,495
Yes!

446
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,529
DO NOT ENTER

447
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,587
Goodness, why are you
taking that from my house?

448
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,090
You scoundrels! Stop. Stop, all of you.

449
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,927
Stop. Stop, all of you.

450
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,429
How dare you! You scoundrels.

451
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,556
-That's the last of it. Take it.
-What?

452
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,726
What? What's going on?

453
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,896
-We're good. Let's go.
-What's going on right now?

454
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,232
Why is my storehouse empty?

455
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,485
Why are they taking everything from me?

456
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,072
What? I did this per your order...

457
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,032
Have you gone senile?

458
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,660
When did I tell you to do this? When?

459
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,869
I am not lying.

460
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,956
Lady Sa-hui said it was your order.

461
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,208
What? Sa-hui?

462
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,419
Yes. She said you told me
to bring all the ingredients for samdueum

463
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,839
to the Public Dispensary.
She made herself very clear.

464
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,927
Where is she?
Where is that brat, Song Sa-hui?

465
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,263
Lord! My lord!

466
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,224
You have a message from the palace.

467
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,685
-What? The palace?
-Yes.

468
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,401
Have a seat, Section Chief.

469
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,319
Yes.

470
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,324
Were you surprised to hear from me?

471
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,035
No, Your Royal Highness.

472
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:13,833
But why did you call me out
all the way to Dongungjeon?

473
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,680
All right.

474
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:39,066
Your Royal Highness,
this is silk made with saturniid cocoon.

475
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,153
I heard you sent medicinal herbs
to the Public Dispensary.

476
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,197
I prepared something little in return.

477
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,285
Goodness, this is not little.
This is very precious. My gosh.

478
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,371
You are the one
who gave up something precious.

479
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,165
I've been quite worried for a while

480
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,126
because we couldn't find
any medicinal herbs within the city.

481
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,961
Thanks to you, we can look after

482
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,340
the people who are suffering
from the epidemic. It's a great help.

483
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,883
I am flattered.

484
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,095
I just bought out the herbs
with the money out of my own pocket

485
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,014
for the sake of the people

486
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,392
and donated it to the Public Dispensary.

487
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,564
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

488
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,200
Darn it.

489
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,912
Those herbs cost me a fortune.
This silk is nothing compared to them.

490
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,555
I'll get going now.

491
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,018
I know you did it.

492
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,447
I heard your father has been
hoarding things in his house,

493
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,533
and I've been trying to find evidence.

494
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,203
But he managed to avoid getting punished.

495
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,789
And you were even given a chance

496
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,209
to write down your father's good deeds.

497
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,045
I'm not sure if I should feel touched
by how much you love your father

498
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,465
or if I should feel disgusted.

499
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,805
Would you like to read it?

500
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,434
Or

501
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,769
should I read it to you?

502
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,980
What?

503
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,528
"The Section Chief of Personnel

504
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,155
sent medicine to the Public Dispensary.

505
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,032
-He had gathered the medicine
-That's enough.

506
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,118
-to earn money--"
-Enough!

507
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,125
You're a historian.

508
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,794
This should be kept a secret.
How dare you read it out loud!

509
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,754
You're the one who doubted me first,

510
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,883
Your Royal Highness.

511
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,761
I didn't send the medicine

512
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,680
to help my father avoid getting punished,

513
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,265
and I didn't do it out of love either.

514
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,645
I only did it because I thought of it
as a nobleman's duty.

515
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,497
Moutan.

516
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,542
Green tobacco leaves.

517
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,010
Your Highness.

518
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,306
Can I have some water?

519
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,270
Your Highness!

520
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,605
Your Highness!

521
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,942
Your Highness!

522
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,781
Your Highness! Your Highness!

523
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,828
Why did you have to sleep
for such a long time?

524
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,293
You have no idea how worried I was.

525
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,464
You know I can't live without you,
Your Highness.

526
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,509
Can you let me go?

527
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,475
Are you really okay?

528
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,021
Do you want to eat what the cows eat?

529
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,107
Or do you want to cry like a cow?

530
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,445
-Did you grow a tail on your bottom?
-That's enough.

531
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,447
The physician needs
to check his condition.

532
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,199
Oh, right. Yes, the physician should
check his condition.

533
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,380
Is there anything
that makes you feel uneasy?

534
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,301
I'm a little dizzy. Maybe it's because
I've been lying down for so long.

535
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,386
And I think

536
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,806
I'm starting to get rashes on my arm.

537
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,940
They're not rashes.
They're signs that you're getting better.

538
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,611
You're all better now, Your Highness.

539
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,748
By the way, where's the female physician?

540
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,917
I'm sorry to tell you this,

541
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,921
but she's been missing
for the past three days.

542
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,383
She went missing? What happened?

543
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,510
I don't know,

544
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,261
but I sent the soldiers to look for her.

545
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,558
Did you record the fact
that I was injected with cow pus?

546
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,185
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,397
Please send the record
to all the villages in Pyongan Province.

548
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,232
Yes, Your Highness.

549
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,984
I shall allow people

550
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,570
to get cured with cow pus.

551
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,806
You're all done.

552
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,151
Is this really okay?

553
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,570
I heard someone's son

554
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,572
turned into a cow after he got this.

555
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,867
Look over there.

556
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,454
His Highness is still human,
and he's completely fine.

557
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,457
-He's apparently the prince.
-Really?

558
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,168
He got better
after he got injected with cow pus.

559
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,712
-He got better?
-That's unbelievable.

560
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,214
-Really?
-My gosh.

561
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,050
-That's incredible.
-It will cure us too.

562
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,595
Your Highness.

563
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,433
People might think you're sitting here
against your will.

564
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,310
Why don't you smile a little?

565
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,606
Like this?

566
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,609
Why can't you make good use
of your handsome face?

567
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,902
Give them a big smile.

568
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:23,405
Show them how many teeth you have.

569
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,532
Smile like this. Like this.

570
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,270
Your Highness, what's wrong?

571
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,022
Do you feel sick?

572
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,401
No, it's because I had to wave
for such a long time earlier.

573
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,448
I'm so exhausted.

574
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,411
Of course. You had to sit
and smile for hours.

575
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,247
You really must be exhausted.

576
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,004
What's that?

577
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,345
I brought a special dish for you,

578
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,849
-Your Highness.
-Boiled pork?

579
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,142
How did you manage to get this?

580
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,688
My goodness, I went around asking for this

581
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,565
so I could get it for you.

582
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,692
And I even paid people to get it.

583
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,444
Here. Have a bite.

584
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,239
Eat it before someone smells it
and runs over here.

585
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,908
Wait. You can have this.
Can you get me some water?

586
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,159
Water?

587
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,622
Okay, wait here. I'll be right back.

588
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,517
Clerk Goo.

589
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,693
Where are you off to this time?

590
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,448
I won't be able to write anything
because it's too dark.

591
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,492
No, that's not it.

592
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,786
Take this.

593
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,332
It's my royal gift for you.

594
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,678
Boiled pork?

595
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,224
You're giving me boiled pork?

596
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,978
Yes, that's right. You must've been
very worried about me

597
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,732
judging by how much weight you've lost.

598
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,569
What? Are you sure?

599
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,032
I've been eating and sleeping really well.

600
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,912
-What?
-I don't have any superiors

601
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,664
asking me to do odd jobs here.

602
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,916
And the weather is
a lot cooler than Hanyang.

603
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,335
I've been taking walks
every day and night,

604
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,003
and I also helped treat the patients.

605
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,297
I've been very busy and well.

606
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,841
How could you have been well?

607
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,802
Your prince was lying sick in bed.

608
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,638
I was so close to losing my life.

609
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,227
My gosh, let's be honest.
It wasn't that bad.

610
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,144
Okay, fine.

611
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,523
I get that you weren't
worried about me at all.

612
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,444
Your Highness.

613
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,781
What?

614
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,202
I'm glad that you got better.

615
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,586
You... You're so...

616
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,898
Treating smallpox with cow pus?

617
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,109
I've never heard of that before.

618
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,570
Western people use this method
to prevent smallpox.

619
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,322
They use pus from cows instead of humans.

620
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,409
Then are you saying His Highness
ordered the people

621
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,620
to get cow pus
injected into their bodies?

622
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,873
Did he believe in that barbaric method?

623
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:47,002
Yes. That's not all.
He even got an injection himself

624
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,005
so he could give faith
to the people there.

625
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,843
How could he do something like that
to his royal body?

626
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,139
So what happened to him?
Is Prince Dowon okay?

627
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,683
He must be okay, seeing that he's going
around doing odd things.

628
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,354
I want you to send a letter right now.
Ban the treatment of smallpox using cowpox

629
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,190
and tell Prince Dowon
to return to Hanyang.

630
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,275
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

631
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,281
Cow pus?

632
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,161
That's nonsense. Why don't you just say
he ate dog poop?

633
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,789
I'm serious. Didn't you hear it as well?

634
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,374
It's apparently a method
to prevent smallpox.

635
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,295
They take out cow pus
from a cow that has cowpox.

636
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,298
Then they make a cut on your arm
and inject that into the cut.

637
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,550
Do you think that really works?

638
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,970
So if you get injected with cow pus,
you become immune to smallpox?

639
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,555
Who cares if it works or not?

640
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,933
Why would you do something like that
as a human being?

641
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,935
We were always taught that the first step

642
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,813
to respecting our parents
is to take good care of our bodies.

643
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,148
Injecting animal's pus is disgusting.

644
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,359
Only a few villages
will go ahead with the procedure.

645
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,444
Nine out of ten villages
apparently refused to do it.

646
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,904
They're doubting His Highness.

647
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,115
Of course. I wouldn't do it either.

648
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,326
Stop talking about pus. I'm eating.

649
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,578
You kept asking.

650
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,664
Look at them.

651
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,959
Officer Min can't even eat rice there,

652
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,004
but they eat three times a day
including all that meat.

653
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,257
They're so annoying.

654
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,467
Still, I'm relieved.

655
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,052
Should we hold

656
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,179
a welcome back party
when Apprentice Goo comes back?

657
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,015
-Count me out. I'll be busy on that day.
-My gosh, come on.

658
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,726
Stop pretending to be so cold-hearted.

659
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,770
Everyone has already heard the rumor.

660
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,856
I heard you sent medicine
to the Public Dispensary.

661
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,317
She's right. People are so surprised
to find out that Master Yes

662
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,944
has an incredible daughter like you.

663
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,446
They think you're better than your father.

664
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,615
"Master Yes"?

665
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,287
Is that what people call my father?

666
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,915
Well, it's not anything bad.

667
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:53,461
It's because he always says
"Yes, you're right."

668
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,005
to the Second State Councilor.

669
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:03,930
Apprentice Song.

670
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,267
-What is wrong with you?
-My gosh.

671
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,561
I did what you ordered
and brought her to Hanyang.

672
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,273
-She'll be safe for now.
-Okay, good job.

673
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,774
Yes, sir.

674
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,153
Wait in line.

675
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,822
-Can I have some?
-Wait in line.

676
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,617
-Hurry up.
-Who's next?

677
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,078
-Please stand in line.
-Hurry up and get your food.

678
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,539
-Come on over here.
-Don't fight.

679
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,585
My goodness, look at this.

680
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,338
Can I have a lot?

681
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,925
Are you just going to watch?

682
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,427
I starved for three days!

683
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,679
My gosh, don't cut in line.

684
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,854
Here.

685
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,864
Open your mouth.

686
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,075
Here. This is tasty. Open your mouth.

687
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,746
-Good job.
-Why aren't you eating?

688
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,460
You should just leave and start the fire.

689
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,921
But...

690
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,174
I think we're almost there, Your Highness.

691
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,511
-Let's keep going.
-Okay.

692
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,162
Why haven't you started the fire yet?

693
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,416
Haven't you ever started a fire
in your entire life?

694
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,383
And you've never entered the kitchen?

695
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,553
No.

696
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,101
You can leave and move the firewood.

697
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,691
Hurry up! Hurry!

698
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,870
Why can't they do this? It's so easy.

699
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,836
It's prickly. Be extra careful

700
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,338
not to get hurt.

701
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,050
Okay, Your Highness.
I will follow your order.

702
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,315
-Are you okay, Your Highness?
-I'm okay.

703
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,566
I'm okay too.

704
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,236
Prince Dowon may be good-looking
and good at writing,

705
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,156
but he's bad at everything else.

706
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,949
The same goes for Officer Min.

707
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,785
They'll starve to death

708
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,162
if they get abandoned
on a deserted island.

709
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,168
I think there are thorns here,
Your Highness.

710
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,545
I told you to be careful.

711
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,925
-One, two, three.
-One, two...

712
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,135
My gosh.

713
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,721
My goodness.

714
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,358
-Eat up.
-Okay.

715
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,527
Where are the side dishes?

716
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,404
Aren't there any side dishes?

717
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,451
I guess that doesn't really matter.

718
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,163
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

719
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,584
Your Highness.

720
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,545
Here.

721
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,339
My mother told me to give this to you.

722
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,554
Thank you. Please thank her for me.

723
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,230
What is it?

724
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,401
What is it? Is it seaweed?

725
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,862
It's called gaetteok.

726
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,157
The name means that it looks ugly.

727
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,575
Let me try one.

728
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,916
It's delicious.

729
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,258
We didn't even give out
that much barley today.

730
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:55,096
I guess she used most of it
to cook this for you, Your Highness.

731
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,890
Are you saying

732
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,143
they used the food they got
to cook this for me?

733
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,229
They've been starving for days.

734
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,316
But they did this for me?

735
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,048
It's delicious.

736
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,635
It's really delicious.

737
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,095
Try some, Officer Min.

738
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,473
Yes, Your Highness.

739
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,271
It's good, Your Highness.

740
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,566
I didn't know they were this good.

741
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,986
Whoever named it
did a good job of naming it.

742
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,989
-It's called gaetteok.
-Yes, gaetteok.

743
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,827
Your Highness, it's been over ten days
since we received orders from the king.

744
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,413
-You cannot delay--
-Okay.

745
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,469
Your Royal Highness, please keep calm.

746
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,347
-Are you that happy?
-Let's hurry.

747
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,150
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

748
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,757
Father, have you been well?

749
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,723
Have I been well?

750
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,809
How dare you ask if I've been well!

751
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,436
You ignored my orders.

752
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,146
Did you really think I'd be okay?

753
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,983
That's right.

754
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,819
I ignored your orders, Your Majesty.

755
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,989
You told me to stop the treatment

756
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,617
and return to Hanyang.

757
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,827
But I didn't do as I was told.

758
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,123
Please forgive me.

759
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,879
So you're finally
showing your true colors.

760
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,092
You ignored my orders,
but you don't seem sorry at all.

761
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,302
So this is what you're really like.

762
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,889
You're mistaken.
I just wanted to help the people--

763
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,974
How can you help them? You know nothing!

764
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,186
You've been locked up in the palace
your entire life. What do you know?

765
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,109
I will not let this slide.

766
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:40,446
Listen to me! I want Prince Dowon to be--

767
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,572
Father!

768
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,795
Father, please forgive him just this once.

769
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,382
-You can see he's trying to apologize.
-Do not interfere.

770
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,217
There are historians here.

771
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,095
The historians are watching,

772
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,056
Your Majesty.

773
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,781
Do you still resent me?

774
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,742
The fact that I'm your son
is already a big flaw to me.

775
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,660
I want to live outside the palace.

776
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,913
This is where you belong.

777
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,831
This palace is where you should be.

778
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,918
The crown prince fought
with the crown princess?

779
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,212
I don't need your apology
if you don't mean it.

780
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,340
This is when we'll be sleeping together.
Try your best so we can have a child.

781
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:26,135
I want to fall in love
with a good-looking but crazy man.

782
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,388
I don't mind keeping you near me.

783
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,307
Do not distance yourself from me.
