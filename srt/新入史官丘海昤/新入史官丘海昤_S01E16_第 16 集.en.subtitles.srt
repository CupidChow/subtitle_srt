00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,296
EPISODE 16

2
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
Welcome, Prince Dowon.

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,353
How have you been, Your Majesty?

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,231
It's always the same for me.

5
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,193
Come here and sit.

6
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,040
I did not know you could be so impatient.

7
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,417
Are you here to rush me

8
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,462
after you heard about the Garyecheong?

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,505
No.

10
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,051
I'm here

11
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,178
to ask you for a favor.

12
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,560
Please withdraw the order to find a bride

13
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,063
and put a halt to my wedding.

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,483
Prince Dowon.

15
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,819
I am already in love with someone.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,077
I love her very deeply.

17
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,498
And I do not wish to marry anyone else

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,294
other than her.

19
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,899
I will not ask who that lady is.

20
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,694
I do not need to know the name

21
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,697
of someone you are only casually seeing
for a short while.

22
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,533
-Your Majesty.
-Do you still not know?

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,451
You are

24
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,080
a prince of this kingdom
before you are a man.

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,540
And a prince's marriage

26
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,418
is not decided
based on your personal feelings.

27
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,003
It is a national, historic event.

28
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:56,426
Why must you make me teach you
such common sense?

29
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,142
I fully understand how much you wish

30
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,895
to be with this lady.

31
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,397
However,

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,151
you must not let such young, fleeting love

33
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,321
ruin one of the most important events
in your life.

34
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,406
Just bury

35
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,410
those feelings.

36
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,579
Be strong.

37
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,791
That is the best thing you can do
for yourself

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,168
as well as

39
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,880
for that lady.

40
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,406
I will

41
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,533
head back, then.

42
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,580
Why don't you seem bothered at all?

43
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,171
How can you be so nonchalant about it?

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,757
Does this situation

45
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,884
mean nothing to you?

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,641
I'm holding it all in.

47
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,646
-I don't want to be angry at you.
-I'd rather deal with that

48
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,733
than you congratulating me
and saying you should head back.

49
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,737
I want to know what you're thinking

50
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,906
and how you feel,

51
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,535
so please show me.

52
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,878
What I'm thinking?

53
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,383
Then what on earth
were you thinking earlier?

54
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,263
What if the Queen Dowager
accepted your request?

55
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,433
Then what? Were you going
to tell her that I am that lady

56
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,144
and pester her to allow you to marry me?

57
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,982
Did you think you could

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,526
just marry me like that
regardless of how I would feel?

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,323
I have made it clear to you

60
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,243
that I do not wish to live here
married to a prince.

61
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,370
I...

62
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,706
do not want that.

63
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,207
Even if you don't want it,

64
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,377
I do not care.

65
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,548
-Just put up with it and stay by my side.
-Your Highness.

66
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,632
Otherwise,

67
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,182
I will end up losing you.

68
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,232
Be honest with me.

69
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,109
Tell me that you do not want me

70
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,906
to marry another woman.
Say you're not okay with it at all.

71
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,329
-Hae-ryung.
-It's the King's orders.

72
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,375
You should obey him.

73
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,865
Your Highness, where have you been?

74
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,999
I mean, how could Clerk Yi
be Prince Dowon?

75
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
The gap is just too huge.

76
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,588
A clerk is a rankless position

77
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,131
that is the lowest of the low,

78
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,134
whereas a prince doesn't even need a rank

79
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,179
because he is His Majesty's son.

80
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,348
The gap is just...

81
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,476
Officer Yang, you treated a prince
of this kingdom

82
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
like a servant, scolded him,
and bossed him around

83
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,730
when you're a mere
senior seventh-rank officer.

84
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,691
He didn't just scold him.
He called him a lunatic.

85
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,361
I remember it clearly.

86
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,946
"Are you a lunatic?"

87
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,031
Shut your mouth, will you?

88
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,158
You're all accomplices, you fools.

89
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,827
But wouldn't you say
it's His Highness' fault?

90
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,872
Why not just stay at his residence
and enjoy his comfortable life?

91
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,499
Why bother coming here

92
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,917
dressed as a clerk?

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,127
That's exactly my point. He's so weird.

94
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,421
And why did he take Clerk Goo yesterday?

95
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,133
I swear I saw some sparks
between those two.

96
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,304
Come to think of it, it did look like
something was going on between them.

97
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,227
I'm suddenly so curious now.

98
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,688
Someone here must know what's going on.

99
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,358
Don't ask me. Please don't ask me!

100
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
I'm sorry I'm late.

101
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,742
Hey, come here and tell us. Yesterday--

102
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,244
Apprentice Goo. From today,

103
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,622
you'll go to Her Majesty's chamber.

104
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
Record everything about
the prince's wedding.

105
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,505
Prince Dowon's wedding?

106
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,011
I normally go to Her Majesty's chamber.
Why are you sending Apprentice Goo?

107
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,887
I'll go. You should go to Nokseodang...

108
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,224
She can't go there either.

109
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,602
I can go. I'll go to Nokseodang.

110
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,687
Apprentice Goo,
you can go to Junggungjeon.

111
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,856
Yes, that's perfect.

112
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,108
Queen Dowager Im's chamber,
Junggungjeon, and Nokseodang.

113
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:10,943
No, it's okay.

114
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,948
I'll just go
to Queen Dowager Im's chamber.

115
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
What are you waiting for?

116
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,142
His Highness must have woken up
a while ago.

117
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,394
Of course, we know that.

118
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,521
We're just afraid
he might take his anger out on us.

119
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,650
Still, do you realize what time it is now?
You little...

120
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,988
Your Highness.

121
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,366
It's me, Sam-bo.

122
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,790
Your Highness.

123
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,002
Your Highness.

124
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,299
-I woke up earlier than usual.
-Are you all right?

125
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,178
Why wouldn't I be?

126
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,766
Bring my breakfast now.

127
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,810
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Of course.

128
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,155
I'd rather deal with him
bawling his eyes out.

129
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,407
What is this?

130
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,076
I'm afraid His Highness
might lose his sanity at this rate.

131
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,830
That may have already happened.

132
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,881
Your Highness.

133
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,015
I am Apprentice Heo A-ran
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

134
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,283
MARRIAGE BAN
LOOKING FOR A PRINCE'S BRIDE-TO-BE

135
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,663
We are looking for
the prince's bride-to-be.

136
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,500
How come all the candidates
are ladies from such humble families?

137
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,129
We still have some time.
Please do not be concerned, Your Majesty.

138
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
How is Prince Dowon doing?

139
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
He has been quieter than usual
since that day.

140
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,679
But other than that, not much has changed.

141
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,432
I see. As time passes,

142
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,603
he will put it all behind him.

143
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,689
Tell Eunuch Heo
to serve him more attentively.

144
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,483
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,194
-Your Majesty.
-You may come in.

146
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,327
We just heard from Lord So Baek-seon.

147
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,746
He has submitted information
about his daughter.

148
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,164
Has he?

149
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,256
The Gyeongju So clan?

150
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,383
Are you sure it is the Gyeongju So clan?

151
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,721
Yes, I heard it myself
at the Office of Rites.

152
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,097
It is the Gyeongju So clan.

153
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,933
She is Lord So Baek-seon's
eldest daughter.

154
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,686
The military officials from that family
made many contributions during the war.

155
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,064
Why would that family want Prince Dowon?

156
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,276
Besides, Lord So is the commander
of the Military Training Corps.

157
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,612
Why would a military commander

158
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,240
wish to marry his daughter
into the royal family?

159
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,367
Something is fishy, my lord.

160
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,077
He doesn't even want to have

161
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,204
a drink with us ministers
in the royal court.

162
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,542
I'm sure there is an ulterior motive
behind this sudden move.

163
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,179
Please contact Lord So.

164
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,848
Certainly, my lord.

165
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,311
I'm surprised.

166
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,398
I did not know
Lord So Baek-seon had a daughter.

167
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,401
She is a precious child
he got after the age of 30.

168
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,112
She is 18 years old this year.

169
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,448
However, Your Royal Highness,

170
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,369
there are rumors going around
about how the Second State Councillor

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,830
has someone specific in mind.

172
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,486
I heard that the officials
trained at the Military Training Corps

173
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,114
are making many great contributions
all over the country.

174
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,700
Your exceptional bravery

175
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,119
must attract all the outstanding talents.

176
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,287
I am flattered, sir.

177
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,666
All I do is teach them that
it is their duty as military officers

178
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,210
to be loyal to our country and the people.

179
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,131
"Their duty as military officers"?

180
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,553
Why you do not know your rightful place
when you know what your duty is?

181
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,475
I am only saying this

182
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,186
as you seem determined to marry
your daughter into the royal family.

183
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,442
We, the civil officials,
are the core of the royal court.

184
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,654
There is no place
for you military officials,

185
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,906
who mindlessly brandish
your spears and swords all day.

186
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,874
Sir, you are being overly sensitive.

187
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,002
People say that this kingdom
is ruled by the Min family,

188
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,588
not the Yi dynasty,
because you always threaten everyone

189
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,466
and try to influence
every political decision like this.

190
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,096
I simply submitted information
about my daughter

191
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,847
as per the royal orders.

192
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,558
Unlike someone,
I do not intend on selling off my daughter

193
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,811
to gain power and authority,

194
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,980
so there is no need to worry.

195
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,865
Don't fool yourself.

196
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,330
I am letting you lead the Military
Training Corps because you are

197
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,250
a man of integrity
who has no interest in power,

198
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
not because I cannot replace you.

199
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,686
FIRST EVALUATION

200
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,539
I am Kim Jin-myeong, the second daughter

201
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,916
of Kim Yeong-sik.

202
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,128
I am Park Seon-jeong, the eldest
daughter of Deputy Magistrate Park.

203
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,927
I am the eldest daughter
of Commander So Baek-seon,

204
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,428
So Yeong-hwa.

205
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,874
I was taught that it is wrong
for women to study history

206
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,752
and to discuss manners.

207
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,088
Hence, I have never read any books

208
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,257
that are not about
essential lessons for women.

209
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,760
Rice must be warm like spring,

210
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,553
soup must be hot like summer,

211
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,223
tea must be cool like autumn,

212
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,975
and beverages must be cold like winter.

213
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,396
The wife of King Wen of Zhou, Tai Si,
who was known for her filial piety

214
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,899
and gentle temperament,
was the greatest wife in history.

215
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,235
And his mother, Tai Ren,

216
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,279
who thoughtfully educated him,
was the greatest mother in history.

217
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
Be honest with me.

218
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,399
Tell me that you do not want me

219
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,070
to marry another woman.
Say you're not okay with it at all.

220
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,997
He was right.

221
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm not okay with it.

222
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,500
What's wrong, kiddo?

223
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,545
Did those jerks bully you again?

224
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,297
No.

225
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,215
It's not that.

226
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,968
I just saw something strange.

227
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,803
"Something strange"? What?

228
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
What did you see? You seem so out of it.

229
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,893
-Let me see.
-Let's see.

230
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,270
What is this?

231
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,023
"The eldest daughter
of Deputy Magistrate Park Jae-hak will be

232
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,985
excluded from the third evaluation,
for she lied about her year of birth.

233
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,363
The eldest daughter
of the Section Chief of Personnel,

234
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,740
Song Sa-hui, will be added
to the list of candidates."

235
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,492
What?

236
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,078
Is this the Song Sa-hui that we know?

237
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,752
That girl, Song Sa-hui?

238
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,090
What's the matter, sir?

239
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,135
You're on the list of candidates
for Prince Dowon's bride-to-be.

240
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
Pardon me?

241
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,189
At this rate, you'll obtain
the senior first-rank before any of us do.

242
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,030
Maybe we should've been nicer to her.

243
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,573
Yes, I know.

244
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,583
Sa-hui, what are you doing here?

245
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,463
All of you, please kindly leave the room
for a few minutes.

246
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,842
Sa-hui, why... Gosh.

247
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,844
-Let's go.
-Hey.

248
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,555
-Go on.
-Sa-hui.

249
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,639
I mean...

250
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,067
-What is this about?
-Just as you read.

251
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,487
The deputy magistrate's daughter
lied about her age,

252
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,701
-and you've been chosen to fill her spot.
-Why was I chosen to fill her spot?

253
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,041
Please revoke this order. I do not...

254
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,171
wish to marry Prince Dowon.

255
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,635
-My lord!
-You were the one who came

256
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,637
to see me and said
you wish to work for me.

257
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,389
I decide where you are needed

258
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,057
and how I will use you.

259
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,270
And I've decided that you must marry
Prince Dowon.

260
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:45,066
What on earth can you get out
of me marrying Prince Dowon?

261
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,362
You will find out soon.

262
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,661
The candidates for the third evaluation
are staying at Byeolgung.

263
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,748
That is where you should be
starting tomorrow.

264
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,583
He has someone specific in mind?

265
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,128
He wants another family member
to marry into the royal family?

266
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,548
This time, it is not someone
from his own family.

267
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,717
I heard it is Section Chief of Personnel
Song Jae-cheon's daughter.

268
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,429
-That is...
-Yes.

269
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,766
It is Apprentice Song Sa-hui
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

270
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,902
Don't touch it.

271
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,865
She hasn't said a word all day.
She's scaring me.

272
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,785
Thank goodness
Clerk Song didn't come in today.

273
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,122
Had she come in,
there would've been so much tension.

274
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,750
By the way, will Clerk Song
never come back, then?

275
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,460
I have no idea.

276
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,713
What is happening these days?

277
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,673
We're losing our historians one by one.

278
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,591
At this rate,
I'll be the only one left soon.

279
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,811
Apprentice Song.

280
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,606
I said you must stay at Byeolgung
starting today.

281
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,109
I am still a historian.

282
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,620
You'd like Commander So Baek-seon

283
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,414
to be transferred
to Hamgyong Province as the governor?

284
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,502
I heard that Russian spies
often cross the Tumen River

285
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,797
to spy on commoners' houses
and our military camps these days.

286
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,633
Commander So Baek-seon
is extremely experienced,

287
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,218
so he should guard our borders.

288
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,971
The Military Training Corps Commander is
responsible for training our troops

289
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,724
and guarding the city,
which is extremely important.

290
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,727
I will not send him there
to catch a few mice.

291
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,686
Please leave.

292
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,773
I can find a suitable replacement for--

293
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,817
What is your real reason for this?

294
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,197
What got on your nerves this time?

295
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,492
Why are you trying to send our greatest
military official to the border region?

296
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,619
You are being outrageous,
Your Royal Highness.

297
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,831
I am only concerned
about our national security--

298
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,749
You are concerned about your own security.

299
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,585
You are afraid someone
who is not your supporter

300
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,505
might become part of the royal family.
I know what you are up to.

301
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,218
You are very smart, indeed.

302
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,480
Then please make a wise decision.

303
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,942
Prince Dowon doesn't have any power.

304
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,861
If something bad happens

305
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,196
to Commander So Baek-seon
because of the marriage,

306
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,741
who will protect His Highness?

307
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,202
Second State Councillor!

308
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,082
I shall leave now, Your Royal Highness.

309
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,870
You should leave, too.

310
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,768
He will not stop.

311
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,147
If not today, tomorrow.

312
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,275
If not tomorrow, the day after that.

313
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,029
He will pressure you

314
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,907
until he reaches his goal.

315
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,869
So what?

316
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,872
Do you want me to be under his control?

317
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,334
So you can become Prince Dowon's wife?

318
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,048
You said you became a female historian
because you had nothing.

319
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,550
I did not know

320
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,137
this is what you wanted
with the Second State Councillor's help.

321
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,433
-Do not jump to conclusions.
-I'm congratulating you.

322
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,227
You can live a life of luxury now.

323
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,145
You'll soon become someone

324
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,731
whom everyone looks up to,
not just a female historian.

325
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,193
Didn't you get what you wanted?

326
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,160
That is not what I wanted.

327
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,962
I wanted the freedom to choose.

328
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,717
I wanted to live my life
with my own choices

329
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,221
without getting swayed
or controlled by anyone else.

330
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,476
I thought I could live that life
if I became a female historian.

331
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,856
That is why I went to see him.

332
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,649
It did not mean

333
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,652
I wanted to leave
my entire life in his hands.

334
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,408
Even so,

335
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,911
do you still think I got what I wanted?

336
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,999
My life is hardly mine.

337
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,419
Do you know how devastated I am

338
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,338
after realizing that reality?

339
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,979
I came in

340
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,651
to say goodbye face-to-face,
because this may be the last time.

341
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,999
Stay strong, Your Royal Highness.

342
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,766
I know that feeling, too.

343
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,731
Realizing that

344
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,859
I cannot choose

345
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,363
my own life.

346
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,374
Have a seat.

347
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,752
I will hear you out

348
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,464
one last time.

349
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,218
"On the honeymoon night,

350
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,221
the prince arrives
at the prince's palace first.

351
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,224
Then he leads his wife into the room.

352
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,727
The prince faces west

353
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,188
and bows to his wife.

354
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,858
His wife faces east
and bows down to him twice.

355
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,027
After the prince bows down in return,

356
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,363
he bows to his wife once again
and takes a seat."

357
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,644
Your Majesty.

358
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,938
Your Majesty.

359
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,818
What is all this fuss?

360
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,238
Well, it's...

361
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,080
What's with those old fogeys?

362
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,875
Is there something on my face?

363
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,043
No.

364
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,094
Hey, what did you say?

365
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,847
They should make a better effort
before coming up with a rumor.

366
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,641
Clerk Song? My gosh, come on.

367
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,978
Yes, Scribe Jegal. You must be mistaken.

368
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,356
It would make more sense if she
talked back and got kicked out.

369
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,607
She wouldn't do such a thing.

370
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,194
-I'm telling you.
-I'm serious.

371
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,115
Court Lady Kim told Eunuch Park,
and Eunuch Park told Clerk Choe,

372
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,075
and I overheard them talk.

373
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,077
Hey, Clerk Song.

374
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,621
Wait, Apprentice Song,
you should tell him the truth.

375
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,624
He keeps on spreading a weird rumor.

376
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,875
What rumor?

377
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,628
Well, how can I put this?

378
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,840
It's that, you know,

379
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,552
someone saw Clerk Song
walk out of Dongungjeon this morning.

380
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,096
Come on, that makes no sense.

381
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,641
Apprentice Song
came in this morning with us...

382
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,061
She didn't come in with us.

383
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,862
Clerk Song,
why aren't you saying anything?

384
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,613
Tell them it's not true.

385
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,450
Apprentice Song?

386
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,293
It's true

387
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,546
that I was in Dongungjeon.

388
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,349
Wait.

389
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,225
What do you mean by that?

390
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,520
Wait, did you...
Did you and His Royal Highness...

391
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,357
It's not like that. I...

392
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,817
Then what is it?
Why would you spend the night there?

393
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,196
Hey, are you out of your mind?

394
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,365
How can a historian be with...

395
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,496
Officer Yang!

396
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,623
Officer Yang!

397
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,586
There's a court lady outside.

398
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,506
Her Royal Highness is
looking for Song Sa-hui.

399
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,924
Tell her that she cannot go.

400
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,259
Tell her Officer Min U-won said no.

401
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,471
-I tried telling her that, but...
-I'll go.

402
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,556
Apprentice Song.

403
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,149
What will happen to her?

404
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,611
What if something terrible
happens to Apprentice Song?

405
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,161
Where is she going?

406
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,579
Apprentice Goo!

407
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,296
Your Royal Highness,
Apprentice Song Sa-hui has arrived.

408
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,889
What do you think you're doing here?
You should go back.

409
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,393
She's an officer
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

410
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,772
Her Royal Highness cannot meet her
without a historian.

411
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,065
Tell her to come inside.

412
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,967
I want all of you to stay outside.

413
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,995
How brazen of you.

414
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,456
I expected you to get on your knees.

415
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,003
I'm not surprised
that you look down on me.

416
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,340
I'm being jealous

417
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,009
when I'm not even capable
of approaching the Crown Prince.

418
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,345
So you must find me foolish and revolting.

419
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,057
-That is not true.
-Then why...

420
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,144
Why don't you look guilty at all?

421
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,274
Is it because you feel superior
thinking that you managed

422
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,568
to sleep with His Royal Highness

423
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,238
when I've failed to do so
for over ten years?

424
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,157
Do you not fear me because you're sure

425
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,868
that you’ll soon become his concubine?

426
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,294
Don't get mistaken.

427
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,588
Regardless of how hard you try,

428
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,049
His Royal Highness
will never become yours.

429
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,260
I've never dared

430
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,556
to even wish for something like that.

431
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,230
All I wanted was for His Royal Highness

432
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,191
to acknowledge

433
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,194
my feelings.

434
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,030
Your feelings?

435
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,910
Are you even aware that your feelings

436
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,413
could snatch everything away from you

437
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,709
and ruin your life?

438
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,714
Yes, I am.

439
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,342
However,

440
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,555
I do not regret it.

441
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,457
What? The Crown Prince
and a female historian?

442
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,499
Yes.

443
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,587
And she's apparently
the Section Chief of Personnel's daughter,

444
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,797
one of the candidates
for Prince Dowon's bride.

445
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,968
How nice of her.

446
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,013
She helped me ruin
the Second State Councillor's plan.

447
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,142
However, this will turn into a big scandal
for His Royal Highness.

448
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,104
We could say it was just a false rumor
made by the court ladies...

449
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,692
I apologize, Your Majesty.

450
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,737
Your Majesty.

451
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,042
Baek-seon.

452
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,047
Your Majesty.

453
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,593
Have you been well?

454
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,348
Thank you.

455
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,975
I'm sure it wasn't easy

456
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,269
to get on Min Ik-pyeong's bad side.

457
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,940
It was a request from you,
so I had no reason to hesitate.

458
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,403
But I heard
that he's trying to have me transferred.

459
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,658
I also heard the news.

460
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:08,247
It's a pity,
but we will have to take a step back.

461
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,084
Our goal was to stop him
from getting Prince Dowon

462
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,378
to marry the candidate he had in mind.

463
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,047
There's no reason to push ahead
with the marriage

464
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,800
when your current position is at risk.

465
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,761
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,182
I'll try to find a decent husband
for your daughter,

467
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,436
so please console her
so that she doesn't feel distressed.

468
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,021
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

469
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,904
Didn't you once

470
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,283
tell me that you wanted to meet
Prince Dowon in person?

471
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,208
Is that him?

472
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,777
He must like reading books.

473
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,945
Yes.

474
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,824
He was always reading
ever since he was young.

475
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,078
He's very similar to His Majesty.

476
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,927
Let me take that.

477
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,394
What's the matter?

478
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,813
You haven't changed.

479
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,440
You still won't let others carry things.

480
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,656
How have you been?

481
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,827
Both you and that girl.

482
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,579
When I first went to Qing,

483
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,668
I was only focused on making a living.

484
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,629
I worked as an interpreter for merchants,

485
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,049
and Hae-ryung helped me
as she followed me around.

486
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,386
And I spent

487
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,305
the next few years struggling

488
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,934
because Hae-ryung asked me
every single day

489
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,312
regarding what happened to our teacher

490
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,607
and why we had to leave Joseon.

491
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,860
So tell me.

492
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,904
How much does she know?

493
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,409
She thinks her father passed away because

494
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,537
he was falsely accused.

495
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,542
She'll find out the truth one day.

496
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,711
And when she does,

497
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,672
she won't forgive you.

498
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,553
I have never thought about being forgiven.

499
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,599
I'm just scared that Hae-ryung
might not be able

500
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,894
to cope with the truth.

501
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,440
The fact

502
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,860
that I'm the one

503
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,237
who made her father die.

504
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,593
They look exquisite. I guess it's because
they were made for the royal family.

505
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,639
This looks like it was made
by a master craftsman.

506
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
What is all this?

507
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,488
We got it from the embroidery room.
They need to check the size

508
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,949
and whether His Highness
finds them comfortable.

509
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,952
Are you trying to make things worse?

510
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,622
-Must I do it today?
-No, not exactly.

511
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,290
Then let's do it next time.

512
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,126
You should leave.

513
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,894
Your Highness.

514
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,606
I looked into a few houses
outside of the palace.

515
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,857
Tell me next time.

516
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,068
Please don't be like this.

517
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,363
If you stay indoors,
you'll get bitten by mosquitos,

518
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,157
and you'll feel really hot and stuffy.

519
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,952
Why don't you go outside
and get some fresh air--

520
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:57,911
I don't want to.

521
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,875
Then why don't you at least
take a walk to the garden--

522
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,918
I said, no.

523
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,797
I know you don't want to,
but just do it anyway!

524
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:14,469
This entire room is filled with memories
of Apprentice Goo.

525
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,098
Nothing will get better
if you just stay indoors like this.

526
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,851
You should at least go outside
and keep yourself busy

527
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,812
so you don't think about her too much.

528
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,856
If you think about it positively,

529
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,483
this is your chance to get
what you've always wanted.

530
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,694
You'll get to move out of the palace.

531
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,614
You should go outside
and take a look at a few houses.

532
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,743
Then you'll think about how you
want to live in the future,

533
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,661
and start chattering about it to me.

534
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,750
It'll make you feel better
and cheer you up.

535
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,751
What do you say?

536
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,519
Let me tell you about this house.

537
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,397
The god of childbirth is very generous
to those who live here.

538
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:12,444
Every woman who lived here gave birth

539
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,863
to at least six or seven sons.

540
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,497
This is the famous
and priceless front gate

541
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,459
that was made with the jujube tree
that was struck by lightning.

542
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,045
It blocks all the bad energy
from coming inside

543
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,963
and brings money to those who live here.

544
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,299
This house is filled with good luck.

545
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:40,514
YEONRIJAE

546
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,768
Every couple that lived here
were happily married.

547
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,772
So they named this place Yeonrijae.

548
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,984
"Yeonrijae"?

549
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,238
Tell me more specifically.

550
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,617
Certainly, Your Highness.

551
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,787
When the branches of two trees
get tangled up,

552
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,039
they eventually become one,
and it is called "yeonriji."

553
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,083
And every married couple who lives here

554
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,878
is known to live
the rest of their lives as one

555
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,257
without ever breaking apart.

556
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,813
"I hope

557
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,816
you live

558
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,402
for a long time

559
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,323
and be the owner of my heart."

560
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,748
Hae-ryung!

561
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,543
Hae-ryung!

562
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,504
Hae-ryung!

563
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,381
Who are...

564
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,096
My goodness, where...

565
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,265
Where are you going?

566
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,186
Wait.

567
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,815
What are you doing?

568
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,234
You can't just barge
into someone's house like this.

569
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,447
Lady Hae-ryung, he just barged in here...

570
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,215
Please leave.

571
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,521
I'll just...

572
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,150
abandon everything.

573
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,287
You do not need to live as a prince's wife

574
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,207
if you don't want to.

575
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,792
I can just...

576
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,630
put down my title as a prince.

577
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,636
I can give up everything. I am fine

578
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,472
with abandoning everything.

579
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,104
Your Highness.

580
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,272
Let's just go to a place
where no one knows us.

581
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,776
Let's go to a place where no one knows us

582
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,487
and live happily there.

583
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,200
You can do what you want

584
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,244
and go where you want.

585
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,745
And I'll just...

586
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,293
stay by your side.

587
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,338
That's all I want.

588
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,779
Your Highness.

589
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,825
The world we live in

590
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,537
isn't a novel.

591
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,544
Running away like that

592
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,300
might sound like a beautiful ending
when you read it in a novel,

593
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,803
but the reality is different.

594
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,350
Unlike a book that has an ending,

595
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,645
we'll have to live the rest of our lives

596
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,901
feeling burdened and being chased.

597
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,196
I'm fine with that. I won't regret it.

598
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,740
No.

599
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,995
We will get tired as time goes by.

600
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,584
We will eventually get exhausted

601
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,380
and end up hating each other one day.

602
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,092
We will regret the choice we made

603
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,638
and live in resentment.

604
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,059
I promise.

605
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,520
I won't ever feel that way.

606
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,855
I swear.

607
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,653
It is not you that I do not trust.

608
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,280
I just don't trust myself.

609
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,957
What if I end up
feeling the slightest bit of regret?

610
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,043
And what if that feeling grows,

611
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,130
and I end up blaming and hating you?

612
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,052
Will you be able to endure that?

613
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,857
So please go back.

614
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,569
This is

615
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,363
the best I can do.

616
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,161
I hope you meet someone
who has a big heart

617
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,831
that can walk beside you,

618
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,333
wish the same wishes,

619
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,670
and love you wholeheartedly.

620
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,551
You can meet someone like that.

621
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,436
Hae-ryung.

622
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,252
You know

623
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,715
that you're everything to me.

624
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,496
I'm sorry.

625
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,582
I don't feel the same way.

626
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,863
He will not just sit back.

627
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,740
You never know what he might do to you.

628
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,200
Her Majesty even took Prince Dowon?

629
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,244
Make sure the Second State Councillor
doesn't find out.

630
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,954
You will be a great husband.

631
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,041
Any woman would be glad
to have you as her husband.

632
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,044
Ever since you came to Nokseodang,

633
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,837
I never once had a bad dream.

634
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,923
You practically killed everyone

635
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,675
including the King
and the people of Seoraewon!

636
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:25,593
Jae-gyeong?

637
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,930
That means he died the day I was born.

638
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,475
I saw the name "Ho Dam"
near the royal villa.

639
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,394
There's no reason or need
for him to be alive!

640
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,690
Prince Dowon is the first
son of the dethroned King.

641
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,694
