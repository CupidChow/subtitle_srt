EPISODE 9

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,230
OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES

3
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,449
You may leave for today.

4
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
Officer Min.

5
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,957
You must record everything.

6
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
As a historian, you must

7
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,798
record everything you see and hear,
no matter what it is.

8
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,571
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,119
Prince Dowon.

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,999
Have you been well and healthy?

11
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,292
Yes.

12
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,047
Prince Dowon, you have
grown into a fine young man.

13
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
You truly emanate royal elegance.

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,301
Feel free to sit down.

15
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,477
I apologize.

16
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
I did not return right away

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,357
even after receiving the letter
that I should return quickly and beg

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,483
for Father's forgiveness.

19
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,360
No.

20
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,362
You did the right thing.

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,573
I was concerned

22
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,368
that the King might reprimand you.

23
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,497
But you made the decision
to help the people,

24
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,500
even knowing all the risks
that were involved.

25
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,128
I am truly proud of you.

26
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,047
You are

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,800
-proud of me?
-Yes.

28
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,761
You did something
that no one else could do.

29
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,727
However, refrain from doing anything
that may be the cause of the King's wrath.

30
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,897
You know what his temper is like.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,481
Next time...

32
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,611
he will not be so tolerant.

33
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,615
I understand. I will behave properly,

34
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,450
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,835
You must have had...

36
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,715
such a hard time in that faraway town.

37
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,847
You have always liked

38
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,059
those pine pollen honey cakes
since you were a child.

39
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,854
I had good-quality pine pollen powder,
so I made some cakes with it.

40
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,106
I will tell them
to bring them in right away.

41
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,066
No.

42
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,486
It is okay. Actually...

43
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,907
I have a favor to ask of you.

44
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,954
I have already reached the age of yakgwan.

45
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,997
YAKGWAN: MALE WHO REACHED AGE 20

46
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,165
I want to...

47
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,460
live outside the palace.

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,799
Prince Dowon.

49
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,886
The palace is your home.

50
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,681
Where will you go if you leave the palace?

51
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,850
But all my younger siblings
have already left the palace.

52
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,229
I understand that I was born
and raised inside the palace,

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,190
but I do not think I belong here anymore--

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,483
You are wrong.

55
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,403
This is where you belong.

56
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,489
This palace is where you should be.

57
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,621
So please,

58
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,667
do not say
that you wish to leave the palace.

59
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,962
I rarely get to see you
even though we both live in the palace.

60
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,090
It will be even worse if you leave.

61
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,533
I'm back.

62
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,827
You left without a word.

63
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,829
Now you're telling me you're back?

64
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,669
You returned safe and sound, so it's fine.
Have a seat.

65
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,013
A position has opened up at Sungkyunkwan.

66
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,183
You will no longer have to travel
to dangerous places

67
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,643
or work all day and night.

68
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,813
It is not a key position,
but the job will suit you.

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,025
-I'll recommend you as a candidate.
-No, thank you.

70
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,153
You even turned down
the senior sixth-rank position.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573
You've done enough grunt work.

72
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,993
No one will say you got to where you are
because you're my son.

73
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,286
That that I am your son...

74
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,415
is already a big flaw to me.

75
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,260
Do you still resent me?

76
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,947
One day,

77
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,574
you will come to understand me.

78
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,759
Have just one more, okay? Here.

79
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,054
Gosh, I really can't eat anymore.
My stomach is about to explode!

80
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,473
It wouldn't be so bad to die
from a full belly.

81
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,934
Come on. Here.

82
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,394
Here!

83
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,483
You went through all that trouble
in that darned town.

84
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,903
You should do nothing but just rest
and eat well for the next few days.

85
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,700
You always make so much fuss
over even the littlest things.

86
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,454
Oh, right. I left the beef bone soup
on the stove.

87
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,414
-I'll bring it quickly.
-Hey.

88
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,751
You have to finish the whole bowl of soup
down to the last drop, okay?

89
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,171
Hey, wait! Seol-geum.

90
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,715
Leave her be. She has been
making food in the kitchen

91
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,884
ever since she heard
you would be returning.

92
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,601
I'm truly happy to see
that nothing has changed.

93
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,729
Seol-geum is still loud,

94
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,315
and you're still awfully sweet.

95
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,193
Did something happen there?

96
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,655
No. I'm just happy, that's all.

97
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,496
I should go and organize my notes first,
before Seol-geum follows me.

98
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,414
All right.

99
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,337
"His Highness left Pyongan Province
on the day of eulmyo...

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,176
and arrived in Hanyang on the day of muo.

101
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,811
Prince Dowon
returned to the palace and..."

102
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,319
Father, have you been well?

103
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,867
There are historians here.
The historians are watching, Your Majesty.

104
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,289
It's 5 p.m.
It's time to go home

105
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,708
Everyone's leaving right on time today?

106
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,167
-We should leave too.
-Okay.

107
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,546
Girls, where are you going?

108
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,090
We're leaving for the day too, sir.

109
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,844
Today is the day of gyeongsin,
which means you must stay awake tonight.

110
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,887
We must stay awake?

111
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,140
What do you mean, sir?

112
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,767
Don't you know the myth?
People in the olden days

113
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,061
believed that sleeping today
shortened your life span.

114
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,397
What? "People in the olden days"?

115
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,818
I can't believe she called me
someone from "the olden days."

116
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,154
Then were you born
just a few minutes ago or what?

117
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,991
But we do belong to different generations.

118
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,660
You're the only one born
during Qianlong Emperor's reign.

119
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,121
All of us were born
during Jiaqing Emperor's reign.

120
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,998
QIANLONG 1736-1795
JIAQING 1796-1820

121
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:24,915
But I mean...

122
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,877
Still, that should be common knowledge.

123
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,046
This is why I can't converse with people

124
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,173
who never attended Sungkyunkwan. Gosh.

125
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,507
Goodness, whatever.

126
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,259
Anyway, people say

127
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,637
that you'll be extremely unlucky
for three years

128
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:43,392
if you sleep on your first day
of gyeongsin after entering the palace.

129
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,605
So you should just stay here and lie low.

130
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
Who believes such a myth
in this day and age--

131
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,734
I do! I believe it, okay?

132
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,611
Since I'm from the olden days.

133
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,196
You clueless kids.

134
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,493
-Goodness.
-I'm so upset.

135
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,703
Gosh, seriously.

136
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:09,543
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin

137
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,547
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies

138
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,052
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin

139
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,139
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies

140
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,310
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin

141
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,815
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies

142
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,152
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin
-Stay awake on the night of gyeongsin

143
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,281
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies
-And expel the evil pests from our bodies

144
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,295
Gosh, seriously! I can't stop thinking
about how unfair this is.

145
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,507
If we have to follow this custom,
everyone should do it together.

146
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,051
They'll go out and drink all night.

147
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,763
It's so unfair that we have to
stay stuck inside the palace.

148
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,308
Shouldn't we be used
to their pettiness by now?

149
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,020
I feel bad for Apprentice Goo, though.

150
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,523
She hasn't even had a chance to rest
since her return.

151
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,443
Exactly. I'm so exhausted.

152
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,030
This is exhausting and boring.

153
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,912
It'd be so nice if we could have

154
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,414
a drink right now.

155
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,666
Shall we?

156
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,350
Why was that in there?

157
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,936
It's wine that Officer Yang hid in here.

158
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,331
The palace actually feels
quite cozy at night.

159
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,501
We're always so busy
being rushed around everywhere

160
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,378
that I'd forgotten
this is home to some people.

161
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,257
Still, I don't think I'll be able to live
in a place like this.

162
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,470
Even a mansion with 99 rooms
feels empty and spooky sometimes.

163
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,016
This huge palace
won't feel like home at all.

164
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,647
Does your house have 99 rooms?

165
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,526
I didn't mean to brag about it.

166
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,488
Yes, I was lucky to be born
into a wealthy family.

167
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,949
If your family is that wealthy,

168
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,660
you don't need to lift a finger
until the day you die.

169
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,579
Why choose this path
instead of a comfortable life?

170
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,623
Me?

171
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,920
I chose to become a historian
because I was so angry.

172
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,592
I'll be honest with you.
Sure, my family is rich,

173
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,220
but everyone in my family is a mess.

174
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,640
My father left us when I was a child

175
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,309
to go and live with his mistress.

176
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,898
And all my brothers are either
drunkards or gambling addicts.

177
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,068
Those troublemakers often end up
at the government office.

178
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,153
And my mother...

179
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,866
She's the worst one of them all.

180
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,368
Whenever she sees young, fit men...

181
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,625
Anyway, I thought, "Everyone in my family
does whatever they want to do.

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,587
Why am I the only one
who has to be stuck at home all the time?"

183
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,588
I was so angry.

184
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,009
Is that why you took the examination?

185
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,386
So that you could also do
what you wanted to do?

186
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,390
Apprentice Song.

187
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,727
I've been very curious about something.

188
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,813
As the daughter of the Section Chief
of Personnel, you were famous.

189
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,440
Everyone praised your beauty

190
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,443
and said that you'd make the best wife
in Hanyang.

191
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,988
I heard that many wealthy
and successful men wanted to marry you.

192
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,491
Why did you reject all of them
and decide to stay single?

193
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,164
Because I didn't want to live
like a flower.

194
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,878
That is how noblewomen
are expected to live, you know.

195
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,174
Like a well-kept flower tree,
a beautiful painting,

196
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,551
or an ornament
inside the women's quarters.

197
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,055
I didn't want to live that kind of life,

198
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,601
nor did I want to trust my life
to a man whom I didn't even know.

199
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,481
Wow. I'm totally with you on that,
Apprentice Song.

200
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,734
Let's be honest. Isn't it ridiculous?
We're the ones getting married.

201
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:47,196
Why do parents think they can choose
for us after exchanging a few letters?

202
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,324
Exactly. They should at least let us
speak with the guy beforehand.

203
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,702
What if I end up marrying a crazy lunatic?

204
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,914
Will someone else
live the rest of my life for me?

205
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,248
That's what I'm saying.

206
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,501
So you all have no interest
in getting married?

207
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,421
Well, I wouldn't say that.

208
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,884
I don't want to marry someone
based on their credentials alone.

209
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,095
I want to meet someone I can truly like

210
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,015
and marry him because I'm so in love
with him. That's what I meant.

211
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,185
I'm not sure how I feel about marriage,

212
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,940
but there is one thing I want to do
before I die.

213
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,733
What is it?

214
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,946
I want to fall in love
with a good-looking but crazy man

215
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,031
and have a crazy, passionate affair
with him.

216
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,579
What? Haven't you all thought about
something like that at least once?

217
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,750
All right. Be honest.

218
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:47,131
Raise your hand if you've ever imagined
dating a handsome lunatic.

219
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,139
Me! I have thought about
something like that.

220
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,810
Me, too.

221
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,191
Gosh, not me.

222
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,819
No, never.

223
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:14,992
Yes.

224
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,080
All right, ladies.

225
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,584
-Raise your glasses.
-Right now?

226
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,462
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

227
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,770
Your Highness.

228
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,773
What are you doing at this hour?

229
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,984
Today is the day of gyeongsin,
so we have to stay up.

230
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,660
You're expected to stay awake
on the night of gyeongsin.

231
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,205
It's said
that evil pests live in our bodies.

232
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
Apparently, they leave your body

233
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,835
when you're asleep
on the night of gyeongsin.

234
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,336
Then they ascend to the skies

235
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,089
and tell the gods about your sins
of the past 60 days.

236
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,925
Then the Great Jade Emperor
shortens your life span based on

237
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,051
the weight of your sins.

238
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,930
Is that why you are staying up all night?

239
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,931
Pardon me?

240
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,724
Are you afraid of the punishment?

241
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,397
Not at all. Why would I believe
such an old myth?

242
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,608
I was told that I'll be unlucky
for three years straight

243
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,652
if I sleep on my first night of gyeongsin

244
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,321
after entering the palace,
so I'm staying up just in case.

245
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,201
Why do you keep chuckling?

246
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,705
Aren't you still awake
for the same reason, Your Highness?

247
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,458
I went to the library
because I couldn't fall asleep.

248
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,418
I see.

249
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,921
All right, then. Enjoy your books.

250
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,715
Good night, Your Highness.

251
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,676
Wait.

252
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,848
I've committed so many sins
over the past 60 days

253
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,185
that I may never wake up
if I fall asleep tonight.

254
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,146
Hence, I need you
to keep me awake all night.

255
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,315
-Me?
-Yes, Clerk Goo.

256
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,485
You.

257
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,826
Look who's afraid of
the Great Jade Emperor.

258
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,484
I didn't doze off, I swear...

259
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,677
Your Highness.

260
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,516
Your Highness.

261
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,733
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

262
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,860
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

263
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,654
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

264
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,989
Your Highness!

265
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,826
Your Highness!

266
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,600
Hey.

267
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,812
Goo Hae-ryung.

268
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,816
Goo Hae-ryung.

269
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,072
-Goo Hae-ryung.
-Yes.

270
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,454
-Goo Hae-ryung.
-Yes.

271
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,666
Yes, what is it?

272
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,388
I apologize, Your Highness.
I was still half-asleep.

273
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,723
I apologize, Your Highness.

274
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,273
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

275
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,484
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

276
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,445
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

277
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,535
-Oh, my.
-Goodness.

278
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,539
His Highness did this again! Gosh!

279
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,008
You! Stop right there.

280
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,720
You, Goo...

281
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,264
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

282
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,869
This is crazy.

283
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,165
I must've been out of my mind.
What on earth did I do?

284
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,503
Your Highness, what on earth did you do

285
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,632
in this open space
where everyone can see you?

286
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,220
Try to come up with an excuse at least.

287
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,764
I'm so embarrassed that I cannot even--

288
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,683
-Sam-bo.
-Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,687
She smells nice.

290
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm talking about Goo Hae-ryung.

291
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,486
She smells so nice.

292
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,334
Gosh...

293
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,920
Gosh.

294
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,523
How come you're totally fine?

295
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,864
I guess it's because you're young.

296
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,467
Your Royal Highness!

297
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,664
What do you mean?

298
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,207
-Gosh!
-You scared us!

299
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,796
Where are Apprentices Oh and Heo going?

300
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,174
They were told to come
to Dongungjeon at this early hour.

301
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,885
I sent them because they were summoned,

302
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,263
but I'm getting a bad feeling
for some reason.

303
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,898
The Minister of Justice has a point,
Your Royal Highness.

304
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,734
We should decide
according to the precedent

305
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,112
-from the year of muin--
-What are you waiting for?

306
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,279
Inform him immediately.

307
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,533
Your Royal Highness, the Crown Princess--

308
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,786
We are discussing governmental affairs.
I will visit her chamber later,

309
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,079
so tell her to leave.

310
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,372
No, I do not want to.

311
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,509
I've lived in the palace for 15 years now.

312
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,304
Do you think
I'm still naive enough to believe that?

313
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,433
Princess.

314
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,685
You may enter.

315
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,529
What do you think you are doing?

316
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,490
-You may leave.
-Don't you dare leave.

317
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,578
What is the problem?

318
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,081
Weren't they hired to record
all the affairs of the Inner Palace?

319
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
You send the female historians

320
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,128
to the Queen Dowager, the Queen,

321
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,380
and even Prince Dowon,
who does nothing all day.

322
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,007
Yet are they not allowed to hear

323
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,926
or record the words
of a mere crown princess?

324
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,847
-I did not send them to you because--
-Right.

325
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,058
I am sure it was done out of
your thoughtful consideration for me.

326
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,104
Whatever you do,
you always say it was for my sake.

327
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,619
Then answer this question.

328
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,288
There are only a few days
during the year when we can

329
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,624
sleep in the same room,
but you always put it off.

330
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,793
Is that also for my sake?

331
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,007
I told you that I had to take care of
an urgent petition last night.

332
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,010
What a bizarre coincidence.

333
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,303
Why is it

334
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,598
that such important petitions
are only submitted on those days?

335
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,062
I understand that it probably
sounds like an excuse to you.

336
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,440
But looking after governmental affairs
is more important to me.

337
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,275
What's the use?

338
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,652
You don't even have an heir.

339
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,570
Princess, watch your tongue.

340
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,533
Yes, all I do is bite my tongue.

341
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,910
When I speak out, people say

342
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,329
a princess who produce no heir
is making excuses.

343
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,207
And when I raise my eyebrows,
people say that the overbearing

344
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,376
and vicious crown princess
is putting you down.

345
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,213
Thus, all I can do is live in silence
as if I don't exist.

346
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,178
It has been 15 years since I first
entered the palace as a little girl.

347
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,682
I never asked for your love,
Your Royal Highness.

348
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,310
I only asked that
I be able to give you an heir.

349
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,271
I begged you numerous times

350
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,147
to give me a chance to do my duty.

351
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,067
But how did you respond?

352
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,028
You rejected me countless times.

353
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,281
You never embraced me,
knowing that I'd be blamed

354
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,657
for not being able to conceive.

355
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,910
I am blamed
because you don't have an heir.

356
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,204
I am also blamed
for your lack of affection.

357
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,331
Do you know how I feel when everything,

358
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,126
from the turbulent political situation
to the famine...

359
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,421
is blamed on my lack of virtue?

360
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,759
I want to go out to the streets
and shout from the top of my lungs

361
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,138
that I cannot possibly conceive
the child of a man I barely get to see.

362
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,901
I never thought about
how hurt you could be by my actions.

363
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,612
I sincerely apologize--

364
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,449
No, I don't need your apology
if you don't mean it.

365
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,411
You will end up apologizing to me again
next year and the year after.

366
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,372
Then what can I do...

367
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,794
That is the next date.

368
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,006
Please take good care of your health
until that day

369
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,549
so I can conceive your heir.

370
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,095
If you ignore my earnest request
once again...

371
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,850
you really might see me
on the Street of the Six Ministries.

372
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,228
STREET OF THE SIX MINISTRIES:
CURRENT DAY GWANGHWAMUN STREET

373
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,774
Princess.

374
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,450
Did you write down every single word?

375
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,118
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

376
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,536
Come outside with me.

377
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,014
Apprentice Heo.

378
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,225
I need water.

379
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,935
Hey, what's going on? What's wrong?

380
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,438
What is it? Did you have to
go through another hazing ritual?

381
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,190
No, it's not that.

382
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,693
A couple's...

383
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,111
A couple's fight.

384
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,821
What? "A couple's fight"?

385
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,075
The Crown Prince fought
with the Crown Princess?

386
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,995
My gosh. Show me what happened.
Give it to me. Now!

387
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,294
She really said these things?

388
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,964
Yes, we wrote down everything we heard.

389
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,925
Her Royal Highness
kept on snapping at him and asking,

390
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,593
"Did you do this? Did you do that?"

391
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,805
I broke out in a cold sweat.

392
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,307
We did write down everything
as we were told to do,

393
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,269
but what should we do with this?

394
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,480
Do we have to leave this in the records?

395
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,567
I'm not sure. We never wrote down
anything like this before.

396
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,111
But this can hardly be called a fight.

397
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,697
His Royal Highness was just yelled at...

398
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,907
You should cross it out.

399
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,119
We record the history of the royal court,

400
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,787
not of someone's embarrassment.

401
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,750
You're right about that.
This has nothing to do with politics.

402
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,919
But aren't we also here to record

403
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,338
everything that happens
inside the Inner Palace too?

404
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,884
I don't think we should classify
what should and shouldn't be left out.

405
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,260
She's right.

406
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,513
If she was called in,
she should record everything.

407
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,974
A historian shouldn't
cross out something they wrote.

408
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,726
Think of it from another perspective.

409
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,770
We call this a couple's fight,

410
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,105
but Her Royal Highness
used female historians

411
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,274
to pressure His Royal Highness.

412
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,985
We can't leave such a precedent.

413
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,280
-But the rules are--
-Wait, quiet!

414
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,913
This isn't a matter...

415
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,877
that a senior seventh-rank can decide.

416
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,758
Chancellor!

417
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,177
Chancellor... Goodness, there you are.

418
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,599
Goodness. Why are you
making such a fuss in the palace?

419
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,309
You have to take a look at this.

420
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,229
Female historians got called in
and returned with this.

421
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,523
What is it?

422
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,618
-This is...
-What should we do?

423
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,663
Should we leave it in?
Or should we just cross it out?

424
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,794
-Chief State Councillor!
-Chief State Councillor!

425
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,212
Chief State Councillor!

426
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,215
Chief State Councillor!

427
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,310
What should we do, my lord?

428
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:55,987
Officer Yang.

429
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,531
What did he say?

430
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,241
Do we cross it out or leave it in?

431
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,869
The Chief State Councillor said,

432
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,372
"This isn't our decision,
because we hold other positions.

433
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,000
The Hanrim should make the decision."

434
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,087
That's so cheap.
Are they going to stay out of this?

435
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,173
They always
make all the important decisions,

436
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,717
then say we're in charge
in times like these.

437
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,845
I told you before
that if we got female historians,

438
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,681
I'd have to clean up
all the mess they make.

439
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,392
My gosh, those old fogies.

440
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,519
Why did they let them
go to the Inner Palace?

441
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,354
So what will you do?

442
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,818
I gave this a lot of thought
and came to this conclusion.

443
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,991
Officer Min needs to
make a decision on this.

444
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,912
Even if this causes trouble later,

445
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,247
you won't suffer that much.

446
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:57,048
-I...
-His Royal Highness is here.

447
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,177
Your... Your Royal Highness...

448
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,976
Officer Min, I must speak with you.

449
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,526
Do you remember?

450
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,071
When I was younger,

451
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,199
I begged the eunuch
to let me go play at your house.

452
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,369
I never imagined

453
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,455
that I would marry your sister,
whom I met back then.

454
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,540
Are you asking me to erase it?

455
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,837
This is why you're my old friend.
You already know what I want.

456
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,763
She brought the female historians
in order to threaten me,

457
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,766
but she meant every single word she said.

458
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,103
She came to show me how she feels,

459
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,231
to show me that she's in pain,
and that she wants my attention.

460
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,987
I do not want that image of her
to be on display for future generations.

461
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,367
I know I shouldn't ask you to do this.

462
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,160
But can you erase the record...

463
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,163
for her sake?

464
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,624
You already know

465
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,210
that I cannot do it.

466
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,755
What if I become angry?

467
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,176
What if I order you as the Crown Prince?

468
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,928
That, too, I must write in the sachaek.

469
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,019
You haven't changed a bit.

470
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,187
An inflexible man of principle.

471
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,024
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

472
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,695
No, I shouldn't have asked.

473
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,365
Your Royal Highness.

474
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,079
Please do not resent Her Royal Highness.

475
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,666
I do not.

476
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,878
She's stuck inside this palace,

477
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,255
waiting for a husband who never shows up.

478
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,715
I understand why she is angry.

479
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,678
So even if everyone else
points their finger at her...

480
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,473
please take her side.

481
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,310
She's a lonely person.

482
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,663
Move back.

483
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,292
More. A little more.

484
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,503
Just a little more.

485
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,090
Right there.

486
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:49,053
Now, look. Hae-ryung and I
were sitting about this far apart.

487
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,183
We were reading books, like this.

488
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,901
Then I fell asleep like this.

489
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,334
Then morning came,
and I opened my eyes like this.

490
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,879
Hurry. Come on.

491
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,760
-My gosh.
-Roll over.

492
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,012
-Roll over.
-My goodness.

493
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,774
Anyway, that's what happened.

494
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,025
Think about it carefully.

495
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,320
Do you really think
that she lay down next to me by accident?

496
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,405
She did it on purpose.

497
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,323
It's obvious that she did it on purpose.

498
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,700
Right?

499
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,786
No one rolls around like that
in their sleep.

500
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,622
I'm sure she purposely...

501
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,796
So what exactly is your point,
Your Highness?

502
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,674
Are you saying
you're going to use this chance

503
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,844
to date Apprentice Goo
since she obviously has feelings for you?

504
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,305
What are you talking about?
I'm a prince, and...

505
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,559
My point is that I don't
have any feelings for Hae-ryung.

506
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,437
You can't fool me.

507
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,398
I've been working in the palace
for 40 years.

508
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,734
And I've witnessed so many love affairs

509
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,195
between court ladies and eunuchs.

510
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,738
Let me tell you how you look.

511
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,073
"Did Court Lady Kim smile at me?

512
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,950
Or did she smile because I look funny?"

513
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,244
You look like Eunuch Park,

514
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,248
who once stayed up all night
thinking about that.

515
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,421
If you really want to win her heart...

516
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,926
I, Heo Sam-bo,

517
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,221
will do my best to help you,
Your Highness.

518
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,473
How exactly are you going to help me?

519
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,979
Don't tell anyone.

520
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,026
There's a secret method
that's passed down among eunuchs

521
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,488
that's known to work every single time.

522
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,669
I'm sorry.

523
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,550
He's going to use this
to tease me for days.

524
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,558
Your Highness.

525
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,270
This is Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

526
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,528
You may enter.

527
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,044
Why did you wish to see me?

528
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,859
Don't forget. The way you look at her
is the most crucial part.

529
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,238
You must look at her intensely
and say this with a passion in your eyes.

530
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,910
"I will make you mine."

531
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,455
This is how you need to look at her.

532
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:52,940
Your Highness.

533
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,237
I don't quite understand what's going on.

534
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,699
By any chance, do you feel unwell?

535
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,286
Or are you trying to scold me?

536
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,164
What?

537
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,667
If this is about what happened earlier,

538
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,253
I'd like to sincerely apologize
for my actions.

539
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,966
It happened while I was sleeping,
but I still made you feel uncomfortable.

540
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,263
But please don't use
such a peculiar method to scold me.

541
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,058
It's very embarrassing.

542
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,396
From now on, I'll be careful
not to get too close to you,

543
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,772
even if it is by accident.

544
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,150
So please forgive me.

545
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,456
Sam-bo, that ridiculous man.

546
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,964
I wasn't scolding you.

547
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,890
I was neither angry

548
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,683
nor offended.

549
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,062
I...

550
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,320
I don't mind...

551
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,699
keeping you near me.

552
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,959
So...

553
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,130
do not distance yourself from me.

554
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,617
I mean...

555
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,080
That doesn't mean
you can lie next to me when I'm asleep.

556
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,915
I'm just saying we should stay close

557
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,417
while keeping the right amount
of distance.

558
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,139
You may go now.

559
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,325
You may go.

560
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,975
What are you doing? You just came home.

561
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,605
I wanted to wake myself up
because I stayed up all night.

562
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,733
It’s because of the night of gyeongsin.

563
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,777
That doesn't look like the case to me.

564
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,072
What's bothering you this time?

565
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:33,660
Is it because of that senior first-rank?

566
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,704
No, that's not why. It's just...

567
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,209
Hey.

568
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,464
The thing is, I can't stop thinking about

569
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,299
what he said to me.

570
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,093
My gosh. Why? What did he say?

571
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,930
"I don't mind

572
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,600
keeping you near me.

573
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,020
Do not distance yourself from me."

574
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,565
What's his problem? He's so ridiculous.

575
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,735
Just because he's good-looking!
What's that man's name?

576
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,487
Why?

577
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,616
If he likes you,
he should be straightforward about it.

578
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,870
How dare he try to play hard to get
with my lady?

579
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,664
My gosh, I should teach him a lesson.

580
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,249
That was a confession of love?

581
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,043
Of course. It's obvious.

582
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,045
He likes you
but he's not confident enough.

583
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,130
That's why he's just
beating around the bush.

584
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,925
So tell me. What's his name?

585
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,678
I'll spread ugly rumors about him.

586
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:34,930
His name...

587
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:36,890
Clerk Yi.

588
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,518
Clerk Yi? Okay, got it.

589
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,105
It's been a while,
but I should gather my ladies.

590
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,817
Clerk Yi?

591
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,161
Do not distance yourself from me.

592
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,140
-You wanted to see me?
-Come and sit down.

593
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,361
I must have underestimated that woman.

594
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,739
What do you mean?

595
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,287
I sent my men to Pyongan Province,
but they lost her.

596
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,790
There were swordsmen waiting, as if
they knew my men were coming.

597
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,419
Who do you think they are?

598
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,839
She always appears and disappears
elusively without your knowing.

599
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,008
I'm sure ruffians are protecting her.

600
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,011
No, that's not what I think.

601
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,182
I think she's gathering people
from Seoraewon.

602
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,934
SEORAEWON: A SCHOOL
THAT TEACHES WESTERN STUDIES

603
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,270
If you think about it, it makes sense.

604
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,731
She may have the support
of Queen Dowager Im,

605
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:11,485
but she can't possibly have
that much power outside the palace.

606
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,819
My lord.

607
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,822
Everyone who used to study
at Seoraewon is dead.

608
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,532
You know that.

609
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,202
You also thought the same thing

610
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,537
until we found out that she was alive.

611
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,666
I want you to be in charge of this case.

612
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,214
You know about Seoraewon
better than anyone.

613
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,342
Yes, my lord.

614
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,808
-Lead the way.
-Yes, my lord.

615
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,892
I'm surprised to see you here.

616
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,104
I didn't know you were a Buddhist.

617
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,439
Please wait.

618
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,192
I'm not done praying.

619
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,203
Is this the place?

620
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,331
Yes, she was here until yesterday.

621
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,590
Who's there?

622
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,466
That's enough.

623
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,344
Are you okay, my lord?

624
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,116
You may leave.

625
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,739
Princess.

626
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,161
I'm sorry.

627
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,085
I'm sorry.

628
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,144
Dongungjeon?

629
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,188
Again?

630
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:40,193
Yes, all four female historians
were summoned to Dongungjeon.

631
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,114
What is it this time?
Why does he need four female historians?

632
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,075
Do you think His Royal Highness
is preparing his revenge?

633
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,827
Maybe he wrote down and memorized

634
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,162
what he wants to say
to the Crown Princess, right?

635
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,082
He's not you.
Why would he memorize what to say to her?

636
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,085
He's obviously going to scold them.

637
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,715
I didn't think he'd be like that,
but he's a man who holds a grudge.

638
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,135
You'd all better be careful
of what you say.

639
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:09,180
Tell him that all of Hanrim,
especially myself,

640
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,433
wanted to cross out the conversation.

641
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,935
But that Officer Min over there

642
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,354
insisted that it be kept.

643
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,523
Okay?

644
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,902
Answer me!

645
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,654
Okay.

646
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,865
Okay.

647
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,856
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness!

648
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:03,526
I really didn't want to write down
the conversation.

649
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,071
But the Crown Princess
didn't give me any choice.

650
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,324
I mean, I tried to have it erased
from the sachaek.

651
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:14,037
But Officer Min told us not to erase it.

652
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,622
Please forgive me.

653
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,629
Did you think I called you here
to scold you for that?

654
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,381
Isn't that why?

655
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,675
Sit down.

656
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,186
Open it.

657
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,908
This is a red writing brush.

658
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,619
Is this a gift for us?

659
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,205
Yes, female historians are known
to have used that brush

660
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,583
to record all the merits and flaws
of the royal family.

661
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,712
I'm giving you those brushes as a gift
so that you will not forget your duties.

662
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,174
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

663
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,970
Are you really okay?

664
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:18,059
Your private conversation
was left as a record.

665
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,438
So why aren't you scolding us instead?

666
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,486
Of course, I'm not okay.

667
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,906
I still feel quite humiliated.

668
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,786
However, you are my subjects.
I hired you all myself.

669
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,748
I'm glad that you have become historians
who are fair and just.

670
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,797
Oh, right. I have one more thing
that I want to give to all of you.

671
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,187
Jin, what brings you here at this hour?

672
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,272
Come with me.
Let's go and shoot some arrows.

673
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,690
"Shoot some arrows"?

674
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,859
I will decline today.

675
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,528
I'll make a fool of myself
in front of the female historians.

676
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:11,988
Don't worry.

677
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,116
We're free from them for today.

678
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,827
What do you mean?

679
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,871
I gave them a day off.

680
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,042
I told them to get some fresh air
by the valley outside Sukjeongmun.

681
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,628
My goodness.

682
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,798
-What's the matter?
-Your Royal Highness.

683
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,053
Do you really not know
what that place is known for?

684
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:36,971
What?

685
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,685
That's where the guards go to take baths
after they're done

686
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,020
with their military training.

687
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,774
It's a famous place that women visit
to enjoy the sight

688
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,527
of those well-built men.

689
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:55,031
Really? I guess I unintentionally
let them have some good fun.

690
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,910
Let's go. Let's make sure
you get at least one good shot today.

691
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,120
Come on.

692
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,500
Hae-ryung.

693
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,551
Bull's eye!

694
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,219
It's your turn.

695
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,030
-My goodness!
-Oh, gosh!

696
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,157
-This is incredible!
-My gosh!

697
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,160
-My goodness gracious.
-Look at that!

698
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,787
My gosh.

699
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,748
-No, stop!
-Come on.

700
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,719
Hae-ryung won't be like that.

701
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,888
There's no way she'll be like that.

702
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,266
No way.

703
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,523
My gosh.

704
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,193
-Apprentice Goo!
-Apprentice Goo!

705
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,535
Those stupid guards!

706
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,621
Pardon?

707
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,671
Bull's eye!

708
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,300
Your Highness, did you just...

709
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,594
Rim, your arrow just hit the bull's eye.

710
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,811
This is so nice.

711
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,147
It's been so long since we had a break.

712
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,234
I'm not even asking for a day off
once every two days like the court ladies.

713
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,030
But it would be nice to have a day off
at least once a month like this.

714
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,866
It'd be nice to spend a day
without seeing our superiors.

715
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,160
I agree.

716
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,957
Where did it go?

717
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,043
What's wrong? Is something missing?

718
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,714
I brought the meat,
but I forgot to bring the charcoal.

719
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,800
-What?
-What should I do?

720
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,012
Should I go back home?

721
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,057
No, it's okay.
I'll go and find some firewood.

722
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:27,975
Wait here.

723
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,288
-My gosh.
-Oh, no.

724
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,378
-My gosh, everything's getting wet.
-Goodness.

725
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,037
I was worried about you.

726
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,874
I can tell how you feel.

727
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,126
I can tell how you feel
about Prince Dowon.

728
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,378
How dare they do this
to the Office of Royal Decrees?

729
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,465
Only one man in the Ministry of
Personnel would mess with such matters.

730
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,008
Aren't you even embarrassed?

731
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,718
I'm giving you a chance.

732
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,512
I want to know if you think about me,

733
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,181
if you even take notice of me at all.

734
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,809
I actually lied to you once,
Your Highness.

735
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,268
Because I had an ulterior motive.

736
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,771
I want you to look into
Third Inspector Goo Jae-gyeong.

737
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,815
I'm not like you, Father!

738
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,233
I can't forget

739
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,985
about Dan-yeong or the things you've done.

740
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,612
I ask for the impeachment

741
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,489
of First Historian Min U-won.

742
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,576
