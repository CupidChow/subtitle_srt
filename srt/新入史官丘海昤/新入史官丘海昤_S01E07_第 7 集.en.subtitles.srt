A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,341
Stop!

3
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,613
EPISODE 7

4
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,156
How far has it spread?

5
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,824
To the north of Hwanghae Province.

6
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,159
How many have died so far?

7
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,621
Over 200 people in Pyongan Province alone,
Your Royal Highness.

8
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,251
The persistent and recurrent outbreaks
of smallpox are a problem indeed.

9
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,713
Your Majesty,
please do not concern yourself too much.

10
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,591
According to reports,
the plague has not spread that much yet.

11
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,009
Even so, we do not know

12
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,053
when or how the situation could change.

13
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,639
If the epidemic spreads beyond
Hwanghae Province

14
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,724
and moves south,
the capital will also be at risk.

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,519
Tell the Palace Medical Bureau
and the Public Dispensary

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,187
to send all the medicine available

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,855
and get the physicians ready.

18
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,775
Treating the patients
is our number one priority.

19
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,401
With all due respect,

20
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,153
I believe our number one priority

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,905
is calming the public,
Your Royal Highness.

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,283
-I beg your pardon?
-I am speaking

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,285
from my experience over the years.

24
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,330
The smallpox outbreak
will subside naturally over time,

25
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,250
whereas the public's anger
will only worsen with time.

26
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,293
If we do not calm them down quickly,

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,462
they will eventually rise up in rebellion.

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,131
You need not worry, Your Royal Highness.

29
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,174
If we hold a ritual to ward off the plague

30
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,635
and send them a royal edict
written by His Majesty,

31
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,471
the people will be moved.

32
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,265
Thousands are fleeing,

33
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,767
and theft and arson
are happening all over the nation.

34
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,894
Are you trying to silence them

35
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,396
with a mere letter from the palace?

36
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,899
Your Majesty, you wish to look after
the people with your magnanimous heart.

37
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,194
However, they do not understand
the depth of your concern for them.

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,698
Second State Councilor,
then what do you suggest we do?

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,037
Please send someone from the royal court
as a wimusa.

40
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,915
WIMUSA: A PACIFICATION OFFICIAL
SENT BY THE KING TO DISASTER AREAS

41
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,507
Second State Councilor,
that is utter nonsense.

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,009
Send someone from the royal court?

43
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,512
Are you trying to send His Royal Highness
to the site of the epidemic?

44
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,431
We must show the people
that the royal family

45
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,974
is there for them in times of crisis.

46
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,810
That is the only way
to restore His Majesty's dignity

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,313
and calm the people down.

48
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,106
No, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
The crown prince
is the foundation of this nation.

50
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,402
His duty is to take care
of his health so that he can

51
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,196
carry on the national legacy.

52
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,822
He must not be swayed

53
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,574
by a preposterous idea
and risk such danger.

54
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,784
"A preposterous idea"? How dare you!

55
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,871
I am merely concerned that an uprising
may threaten our national security.

56
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,414
How could you call it "preposterous"?

57
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,374
Those of you who are trying

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,044
to put our crown prince in danger
by using such an excuse

59
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,213
are true threats to national security.

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,257
Watch what you say.

61
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,010
How dare you make such rude a remark
in front of His Majesty?

62
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,220
Be quiet, all of you!

63
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,741
Father.

64
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,662
Please dispatch me to the region
as a wimusa.

65
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,164
Please, Your Royal Highness.

66
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,001
I wish to fulfill my duty as a filial son
as well as the crown prince.

67
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,545
I will bring the epidemic under control

68
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,130
and calm the people in Pyongyang,

69
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,801
so please stay here
and look after the people, Father.

70
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,704
Your Highness.

71
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,289
Your Highness!

72
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,169
Your Highness.

73
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,964
His... His Majesty is...

74
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,374
Father.

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,751
What brings you to my chamber?

76
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,255
Would you like some tea?

77
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,257
Do you think I came here for tea?

78
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,094
Sit down.

79
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,111
I need you to go to Pyongyang.

80
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,571
Pyongyang?

81
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,325
Do you mean Pyongyang in Pyongan Province?

82
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,619
Is there another Pyongyang
in this country?

83
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,497
The city where the provincial office is.

84
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,084
Smallpox is spreading in that region
and the people are concerned.

85
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,546
I'd like you to go there
to console the people

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,090
and save the royal family's face.

87
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,472
Your Majesty.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,227
Prince Dowon never had smallpox.

89
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,605
-If he goes to Pyongyang--
-How dare you interrupt me!

90
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,610
You needn't be overwhelmed.

91
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,489
The situation is not too bad.
We expect the outbreak to subside soon.

92
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,201
I am only sending you to calm
the public's concern about the epidemic,

93
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,954
so just go there and read some books.

94
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,206
I simply need you
to be seen by the people.

95
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,709
Certainly.

96
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,962
I will do as you say,

97
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,799
-Father.
-I like that you are not complaining.

98
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,816
Your Highness.

99
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,291
Weren't you going out for drinks?
Why are you back?

100
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,502
Drinks, my foot.
A royal command has been issued.

101
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,171
We had to run back after having a sip.
Just one sip!

102
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,632
Is this an unlucky year
for the Office of Royal Decrees?

103
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,342
Hardly a day goes by without trouble.

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,801
Maybe we've been cursed.

105
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,096
I mean, with all these women
in the sacred royal court...

106
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,892
Stop talking nonsense
and just answer my question.

107
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,352
Who wants to go to Pyongyang?

108
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,607
No one? Seriously?

109
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,819
All of you are such cowards.

110
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,154
Don't you want

111
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,324
to record history with your own hands
as historians?

112
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,618
How could you refuse
just because of smallpox?

113
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,619
My goodness.

114
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,412
Then why don't you go yourself, sir?

115
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,165
Go there and record history
with your own hands

116
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,626
or come back inside a coffin.

117
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,795
Hey, I'm...

118
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
I have a wife and children to support,
you know.

119
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,889
What will happen to my kids if I die?

120
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,015
My babies...

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,601
How will they sustain themselves?

122
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,019
He's right.

123
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,689
Everyone, let's be realistic

124
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,068
and exclude those who have kids.

125
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,986
Exactly.

126
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,946
I even have a grandchild.

127
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,158
Are you saying my wife can spend
the rest of her life alone as a widow?

128
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,910
Without a husband or child?

129
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,288
It will be so unfair if you make me go.

130
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,082
If I die, I'll turn into a vengeful ghost

131
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,751
and follow you everywhere, Officer Yang.

132
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,837
Why don't we just do a random draw?

133
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,963
No, we can't.

134
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,881
I'm a third-generation only son.

135
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,721
Well...

136
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,558
I've once suffered from smallpox.

137
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,074
Your Majesty.

138
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,661
Tell the king I am here.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,628
Mother, has everything been well with you?

140
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,837
Yes.

141
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,384
Managing the state affairs
must be exhausting.

142
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,512
How could I have such a mindset
when it is my duty?

143
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,222
Please have a seat.

144
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,481
I heard some strange rumors.

145
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,859
Apparently,
Prince Dowon is being dispatched

146
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,612
to the smallpox-ridden Pyongyang
to console the people.

147
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,491
An absurd idea, don't you think?

148
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,662
How could a prince of this country
be sent to such a dangerous region?

149
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,954
Am I wrong?

150
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,335
Your Majesty.

151
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,713
Please tell me that it is not true.

152
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,964
Only then

153
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,802
will I find peace of mind.

154
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,429
It is true, Mother.

155
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,016
In fact, I just returned from his chamber
after personally giving him my order

156
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,518
to go to Pyongyang.

157
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,939
Then withdraw your order immediately.

158
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,025
Prince Dowon is your legitimate son

159
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,194
and the crown prince's younger brother.

160
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,279
How could you send such a precious child

161
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,324
to that dangerous area?

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,536
I may be his father,
but I'm also the king.

163
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,913
How could I put my own child

164
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,249
before the welfare of the people?

165
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,459
You're doing this
because you're not his father!

166
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,262
Please lower your voice.

167
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,472
There are many ears in this palace.

168
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,766
Mark my words.

169
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,604
Nothing must happen to Prince Dowon.

170
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,398
He must return to the palace

171
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,693
completely unscathed
without a single scratch on his body.

172
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,822
Do you understand?

173
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,464
Do not concern yourself too much,
Your Majesty.

174
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,258
I'm sure His Highness will return safely.

175
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,801
He is a strong person, you know.

176
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,848
Send a message to Mo-hwa immediately.

177
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,768
She's the only one
who can protect Prince Dowon.

178
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,647
What were you girls doing?

179
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,274
Why let her in when we weren't here?

180
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,610
-We apologize, ma'am.
-We apologize, ma'am.

181
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,945
Tell her to leave at once.

182
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,696
That book will be too hard for you.

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,493
Instead of that book,

184
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,789
I'd like to recommend Elementary Learning,
which I used to read as a boy.

185
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,802
Did you pack warm clothes?

186
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,429
It gets quite chilly at night
in Pyongan Province.

187
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,515
Yes, I did.

188
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,767
Have you picked a horse?

189
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,979
There is a well-behaved horse
at the Royal Stable Offices.

190
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,355
-Take that horse--
-Jin.

191
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,649
I am delighted,

192
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,361
for it is the first mission
that Father has given me.

193
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,073
I wish to do my very best
with a grateful heart.

194
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,952
Aren't you afraid?

195
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,830
His Majesty is my father, after all.

196
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,791
He wouldn't send me there
if it's actually such a dangerous place.

197
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,382
You're being dispatched
to console the people in my place.

198
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,094
Act honorably and be confident
no matter who you meet.

199
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,721
And...

200
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,099
be sure to return safely.

201
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,895
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,152
Lord Min, you made
such a reckless remark earlier.

203
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,237
Even if you find the crown prince irksome,

204
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,906
he is still your son-in-law.

205
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,116
If your daughter becomes a widow

206
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,201
because the crown prince falls ill...

207
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,748
Thank goodness
His Majesty chose Prince Dowon instead.

208
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,666
Why do you think

209
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,003
that I was trying
to send the crown prince there?

210
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,092
The king is always strict
with the crown prince,

211
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,596
but he is not bold enough
to risk losing his heir.

212
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,852
Are you saying that you intended
to send Prince Dowon from the beginning?

213
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,490
"Mo-hwa"?

214
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,576
Did Her Majesty really say "Mo-hwa"?

215
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,913
Yes, sir. Her Majesty
said she is the only person

216
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,457
who can protect Prince Dowon.

217
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,423
Is she someone you know, sir?

218
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
Mo-hwa!

219
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,314
It looks like you have lost some weight.

220
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,526
Is your current residence uncomfortable?

221
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,445
No, not at all. Did you bring the letter?

222
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
Here.

223
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,672
Please let Her Majesty know
that I received the letter safely.

224
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,341
I heard you will be traveling far.

225
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,301
Please be safe.

226
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,554
Goodbye.

227
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,186
You too, my dear.

228
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,981
Be safe and take good care of yourself.

229
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,402
Make sure you don't skip meals, okay?

230
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,876
Hey.

231
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,086
Are you going to keep this up?

232
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,964
We'll be packing until sunrise
at this rate.

233
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,801
That sounds like a plan.
We'll pack all night and into the morning

234
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,054
so that you can't go to Pyongyang.

235
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,890
Stop glaring at me.

236
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,602
You're the one insisting on going there,
even though you might die.

237
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,230
No one can make a bigger fuss than you do
over such trifling matters.

238
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,900
Who says I will die?
I have a bright future ahead of me.

239
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,526
Exactly.

240
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,237
If you wish to enjoy
that bright future of yours,

241
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,365
don't go to Pyongyang. Please don't go!

242
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,369
You've never even had smallpox.

243
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,956
Why on earth did you volunteer
to go to Pyongyang?

244
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,335
Do you think your ancestors will
protect you because you're so special?

245
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,672
-Hae-ryung, are you inside?
-Yes, Jae-gyeong.

246
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,764
You came at the perfect time.
Please dissuade Lady Hae-ryung, my lord.

247
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,600
She keeps talking nonsense
about how she'll be fine

248
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,228
and how she won't be affected
by the epidemic.

249
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,147
Hae-ryung will be fine. You may leave.

250
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,774
-Pardon me?
-Go on.

251
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,244
Thank you, Jae-gyeong. Now, I can breathe.

252
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,079
Do not let your guard down.

253
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,748
People can be more dangerous
than epidemics.

254
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,918
And many eyes will be on you
because you're a female historian.

255
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,087
People may gossip
about even the smallest things.

256
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,381
"So don't get involved in silly things.

257
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,716
Just write the records quietly
and return safely."

258
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,301
Is that what you mean?

259
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,847
-Is that what it sounded like to you?
-Yes, it did.

260
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,268
However, what I'm afraid of
is neither the epidemic nor the people.

261
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,939
I'm afraid of being so far away from you.

262
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,150
Gosh, you silly goose.

263
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,069
I'll write you a letter every day,
Jae-gyeong.

264
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,155
Don't worry too much.

265
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,324
All right.
I'll write back to you every day as well.

266
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,843
Vice-Chancellor.

267
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,179
The prince is leaving on a long trip.

268
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,889
Shouldn't more people be seeing him off?

269
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,473
Have you not heard?

270
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,434
The physicians at the Public Dispensary

271
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,935
resigned, terrified of the epidemic.

272
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,856
These are all the people I could gather.

273
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,349
How refreshing.

274
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,228
It's giving me an appetite.

275
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,406
-This is nice.
-I can finally breathe now.

276
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,453
You can take a break.

277
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,372
Have some water.

278
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,005
Just remember what needs to be recorded

279
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,757
and write it down later.

280
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,762
Officer Min, did you know
that you're actually very sweet?

281
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,472
Me?

282
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,766
I mean, think about it.
You brought over a bowl of water

283
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,518
for this rookie and gave me some advice.

284
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,562
You even volunteered to come because
you were worried about sending me alone.

285
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,147
-Oh, that was--
-I know.

286
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,818
"I cannot send a mere apprentice alone,
unaccompanied by any official historian."

287
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,444
It was your sense of duty.

288
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,407
But let's just say your concern for me
took up about 20 percent of the reason.

289
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,158
It'll make me feel better, you know.

290
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,996
-Thank you for the water.
-Your Highness!

291
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,000
Your Highness,
I brought you some cold water.

292
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,548
I went all the way
to the cave over there...

293
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,990
Stop.

294
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,036
-What are you transporting?
-We don't know, my lady.

295
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,204
We were just told to do this.

296
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,756
Mung beans?

297
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,226
Stack them one by one.

298
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,603
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,604
Hurry up.

300
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,106
Be careful.

301
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,442
They're very valuable.

302
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,196
Be careful, you fool!

303
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,949
Soon, these beans will cost
more than you do.

304
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,786
You careless punk. Hey, pick them up.

305
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,913
These beans...

306
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,416
Are you back?

307
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,295
Sa-hui.

308
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,256
I don't know about other things,

309
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,385
but you need to learn
money-making skills from me.

310
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,887
It is not a skill you are born with.

311
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,306
You need to know
what's going on in the world,

312
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,433
and you must know
how to handle people as well.

313
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,105
Is that why you bought
all the ingredients for samdueum?

314
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,731
SAMDUEUM: A TEA TO PREVENT SMALLPOX

315
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
Yes, that's right.

316
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,901
Isn't it a brilliant idea?

317
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,112
People aren't so worried now.

318
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,656
But in two weeks, rumors that the epidemic

319
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,826
has almost reached the capital
will spread all over the city.

320
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,162
Then those mung beans,
adzuki beans, and black beans

321
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,289
will be ten times more expensive...

322
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,668
No, we'll be able to sell them
for 20 times more than what they cost now.

323
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,839
-How could you be so greedy?
-What?

324
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,676
You've saved up more than you can spend
in a hundred years.

325
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,971
What more do you want? Why must you
earn money in such a dishonorable way?

326
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,139
"Dishonorable"?

327
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,641
How could you say such a thing
to your father?

328
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,853
All the assets and money
that Yi Dun hid in his storage

329
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,521
are gone now,

330
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,107
whereas people are still moved
by the story

331
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,984
of Fan Zhongyan
sharing barley with his friend.

332
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,446
Send the samdueum ingredients to
the government office when the time comes.

333
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,241
Choose moral influence that will go down
in history over your selfish greed.

334
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,244
How dare you.
I told you not to lecture me on excerpts

335
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,829
from the classics!

336
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,458
And if I cared
about things like moral influence,

337
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,710
you wouldn't be enjoying
such a comfortable life,

338
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,503
living in a fancy house like this!

339
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,006
You can read your books leisurely

340
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,924
and roam around
calling yourself a historian

341
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,344
because of the wealth
I've built over the years.

342
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,305
Dear me.

343
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,266
You're my only daughter,
yet you're not even affectionate.

344
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,436
All you do is try to lecture me.

345
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,647
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm sick and tired of it!

346
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,837
Clear the way
for His Highness Prince Dowon!

347
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,970
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

348
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,018
Thank you for coming all the way here.

349
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,895
We are much obliged.

350
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,396
It is my duty.

351
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,107
We prepared a temporary residence for you.
This way, Your Highness.

352
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,326
I am Yun Dae-eup,
the governor of Hwanghae Province.

353
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,827
It's an honor, Your Highness.

354
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,625
I am Jang Seok-hyeong,
the governor of Pyongan Province.

355
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,794
It's an honor to meet you, Your Highness.

356
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,222
Tell them to be seated.

357
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,144
-You may be seated.
-Thank you.

358
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,449
So what is the situation like here?

359
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,202
The outbreak is subsiding by the day,

360
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,870
so you needn't be concerned.

361
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,291
All the medicine bestowed upon us
by His Majesty has arrived safely,

362
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,252
and those affected by the epidemic
are receiving the treatment they need.

363
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,879
The situation in Pyongan Province
is also improving.

364
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,882
We have placed those who have been
taken ill in strict quarantine,

365
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,467
so the disease has stopped spreading.

366
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,262
The people are greatly delighted
by the news

367
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,264
that you have come to console us.

368
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,266
I am truly relieved.

369
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:46,104
Yes, we owe it all
to His Majesty's magnanimous kindness.

370
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,400
We're doing our best to make sure
that you'll have nothing to worry about,

371
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,944
so please relax
and enjoy your stay in Haeju,

372
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,487
Your Highness.

373
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,205
Thank you for coming all the way here.

374
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,958
I heard you're Lord Min Ik-pyeong's son.

375
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,959
Yes, sir.

376
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,795
You're very handsome, just as I've heard.

377
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,592
Give my kind regards to Lord Min
when you return to Hanyang.

378
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,179
Lord Jang.

379
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,225
You're the governor of Pyongan Province,
so that's where you should be.

380
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,270
What are you doing here in Haeju?

381
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,984
That's because...

382
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,280
I mean, His Highness came all the way here
to console the people

383
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,740
of Pyongan Province.

384
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,826
I had to come here
and greet him in person, of course.

385
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,206
Don't concern yourself with silly things.
Get some rest.

386
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,041
Your meal will be ready shortly.

387
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,876
Let's go, Lord Yun.

388
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,555
Earlier, it felt like we were crossing
the bridge to the underworld.

389
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,684
But now that we're here,
this actually feels like a vacation.

390
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,269
Everyone is thanking us

391
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,480
and taking care of everything for us.

392
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,484
Do you know what Haeju is famous for?

393
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,824
Haeju is famous for bibimbap.

394
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,786
Since we're in Hwanghae Province,

395
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,331
we have to try pumpkin dumplings,
yeonansikhae, and...

396
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,586
You weren't asking about food, were you?

397
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,132
Haeju has always been known
for its mild, warm climate

398
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,051
and fresh air.
Many people come here to rest.

399
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,637
There are mountains and beaches.

400
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,098
Don't you think
it's the perfect vacation destination?

401
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,516
-Beaches?
-Oh, right!

402
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,436
You've never been to one, have you?

403
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,230
What do you say?

404
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,734
Would you like to take a nice walk
along the beach with me?

405
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,612
No, thanks. I should go to bed early.
Bring some water for washing up.

406
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,698
But the sun is still high up in the sky--

407
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,700
I must be tired from the long journey.
Hurry.

408
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,286
Are you quite exhausted, Your Highness?
Gosh...

409
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,544
Is this one better?

410
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,311
Your Highness.

411
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,522
Are you going somewhere?

412
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,110
Your Highness.

413
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,537
Where did he go? He even took off his...

414
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,249
That, again?

415
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,253
Is His Highness
seriously doing this again?

416
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,303
You said
this was an undercover inspection.

417
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,933
There isn't a single soul here.
What is there to inspect?

418
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,352
Are we meeting the Dragon King of the Sea?

419
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:17,065
I snuck out, so it can be considered
an undercover operation.

420
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,860
Then why did you want
a historian to tag along?

421
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,529
What should I record?

422
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,241
"The prince walked this way
and that way." Things like that.

423
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,286
With all due respect, Your Highness,

424
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm utterly exhausted at the moment
as I walked

425
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,502
for two nights and three days
all the way here from Hanyang,

426
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,213
while you traveled the same distance
in comfort on your horse.

427
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,049
Please enjoy this undercover inspection
by yourself.

428
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,551
I will head back.

429
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,137
Wait!

430
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,099
Actually...

431
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,437
To tell you the truth,

432
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,274
this is my first time at the beach.

433
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,402
You see,

434
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,366
I've always wanted to see the ocean,

435
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,536
and I wanted to enjoy

436
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,998
this delightful moment with someone.

437
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,508
Take them off.

438
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,344
What?

439
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,388
You said this is your first time.

440
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,307
Don't just look with your eyes.

441
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,393
You should remember this experience
with your hands and feet as well.

442
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,614
This is what it feels like
to walk on sand.

443
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,282
Try it.

444
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,622
How does it feel?

445
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,543
It feels weird.

446
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,337
It's very weird.

447
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,423
Try to run. It'll feel even weirder.

448
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,800
Run? Here?

449
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,218
Yes.

450
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,018
Come on.

451
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,989
Dip your feet in the water.

452
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,075
-My feet?
-Are you scared?

453
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,326
Dip my feet? In the water?

454
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,204
It'll be fine. Trust me and do it.

455
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,334
-Wait a second.
-It's okay. Come on.

456
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,284
The places I want to visit?

457
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,539
There are so many places.

458
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,166
You know, in Italy,

459
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,460
there is a tower that leans.

460
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,045
I want to see that.

461
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,341
How? How can a tower stand
if it leans like this?

462
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,884
Does it not collapse?

463
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,886
That's why I want to see it.

464
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,346
That's not all.

465
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,599
In Egypt, there are tombs
that are thousands of years old.

466
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,643
And I hear they are as big as mountains.

467
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,688
You can't even see the top
if you are standing on the ground.

468
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,025
Tell me more. What else is across the sea?

469
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,903
This time, I'd like to hear from you.

470
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,615
Is there somewhere you'd like to visit?

471
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,662
I don't even know what's in Joseon.

472
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,415
The East Sea.

473
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,710
Somewhere in the East Sea,
there's a little island called Dokdo.

474
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,130
I heard that odd-looking sea animals
called sea lions live there in herds.

475
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,798
They travel freely

476
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,385
between the sea and the land,
but they do not get lonely.

477
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,475
So I once thought
that I will make sure to visit Dokdo,

478
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,310
to see the sea lions.

479
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,856
If you do go there someday,
please take me with you.

480
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,024
I want to see them too.

481
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,235
I'll do that.

482
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,128
-Lady Hae-ryung?
-Scholar Lee?

483
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,552
I guess we were meant to meet.

484
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,680
We meet again in Haeju,
which is not even in Hanyang.

485
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,018
Have you been well?

486
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,814
Yes, I have been very well.

487
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,609
I heard you became a female historian.

488
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,820
Now I see it with my own eyes.

489
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,488
Congratulations.

490
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,449
It's all thanks to you.

491
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,993
Thank you...

492
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,707
-Thank you for what you did that day.
-Gosh.

493
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,130
Don't mention it. After that day,

494
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,173
my parents stopped rushing me
to get married.

495
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,013
Anyway, what brings you to Haeju?

496
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,618
I am sorry
that I had to ask you to come here.

497
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,581
It's difficult to speak with you privately
in the provincial office.

498
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,251
Don't mention it. I heard you are
the magistrate of Songhwahyeon.

499
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,503
Why did you want to see me?

500
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,137
Your Highness, I beg of you.

501
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,515
Please help and save our people.

502
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,895
What do you mean?

503
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,566
The reports made to the royal court
are all lies.

504
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,236
Over 500 people died in Hwanghae
Province due to the smallpox outbreak.

505
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,863
And there were

506
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,077
too many deaths in Pyongan Province
to keep up the count.

507
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,080
That is not all.

508
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,750
The ill are dying helplessly
due to the lack of medicine.

509
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,627
Even the healthy people

510
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,795
are stuck in their villages

511
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,256
and are starving to death.

512
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,966
The royal court already sent

513
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,052
some relief food and medicine.

514
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,972
And the governors of Pyongan Province
and Hwanghae Province said that--

515
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,266
You must not trust a word they say!

516
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,103
Governor Yun Dae-eup
of Hwanghae Province gave an order

517
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,814
to take food from the sick villages.

518
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,816
Governor Jang Seok-hyeong of Pyongan

519
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,152
ran down to Haeju when smallpox

520
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,613
broke out in Pyongyang

521
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,241
and left the people behind.

522
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,497
Officers are busy
avoiding their responsibilities,

523
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,457
and the people cannot ask for help

524
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,793
because they are tied down.

525
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,338
Your Highness.

526
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,716
Please show mercy on these people.

527
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,387
Save them.

528
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,683
I beg of you.

529
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,459
Your Highness, I beg of you.

530
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,836
Please help and save our people.

531
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,297
You must not trust a word they say!

532
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm sorry.

533
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,975
Let me ride you for a moment.

534
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,021
I'm not that heavy. Okay?

535
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,483
Your Highness.

536
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,196
Were you not asleep?

537
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,284
What about you?
What are you doing here at this hour?

538
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,495
I am...

539
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,999
heading over to Songhwahyeon.

540
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,836
Aren't you here to do the same?

541
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,384
If you aren't,
please pretend you didn't see me.

542
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,845
I won't be gone long.

543
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,930
I have no idea either.

544
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,143
I don't know who to trust,

545
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,645
and even if things are that bad here,

546
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,023
I'm not sure what I can do.

547
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,608
That's why...

548
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,655
I thought it might be better
for me to live obliviously.

549
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,867
I have no idea how I feel.

550
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,372
Your Highness.

551
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,126
I am not so sure either.

552
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,839
I'm just trying to learn
what I don't know.

553
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:06,862
Stop!

554
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,327
We're heading to Songhwahyeon.

555
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,037
Please let us through.

556
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,790
We were told not to let anyone in.

557
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,084
-Go back.
-But...

558
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,884
Let's find another way in.

559
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,860
Stop!

560
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,030
If you're tired, we can take a break.

561
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,656
I'm not tired.

562
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,867
I work out all the time,

563
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,245
so this feels like a walk in the park.

564
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,039
Okay, then. Let's keep going.

565
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,541
But

566
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,377
if you insist on taking a break,
I'll keep you company.

567
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,757
Let's sit over there.

568
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,728
I think we came this far.

569
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,945
Go down slowly! Be careful!

570
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,458
Songhwahyeon?

571
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,963
Are you saying you're heading to the place
where the epidemic broke out

572
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,840
instead of trying to run away from it?

573
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,009
We have our reasons.

574
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,430
By any chance, is there a side road
that leads to Songhwahyeon?

575
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,558
Forget about the side road.

576
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,477
If you want to stay alive,
you'd better not go near that place.

577
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,146
Do you want to die at an early age?

578
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,149
Is it that bad?

579
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,901
Yes, of course.

580
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,238
I've never seen such a mess.

581
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,031
When an epidemic breaks out in a village,

582
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,617
they surround it with straw ropes
and lock people inside.

583
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,203
So you'll either die
from the epidemic or of hunger.

584
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,746
They're basically telling you to die.

585
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:09,378
But if that place is so dangerous,
what were you doing there?

586
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,342
Well, we didn't exactly want to go.

587
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,638
We may be merchants,
but we couldn't stand by

588
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,056
and just watch our people die.

589
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,018
So did you give them some food?

590
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,895
That's what we were planning to do.

591
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,648
We took some millet and barley there,

592
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:34,361
and we were going to sell them
at a slightly higher price than usual.

593
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,072
But as soon as we went in,
they started begging and crying,

594
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,866
asking us to sell our stuff to them.

595
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,661
We eventually started selling our stuff
ten times more than usual.

596
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,623
I didn't intend to do so,

597
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,375
but I ended up earning so much money.

598
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,880
I earned a year's worth of earnings
in just three days.

599
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,303
-How--
-You wicked man.

600
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,850
You are one wicked man.

601
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,812
What?

602
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,440
You should be helping those
who are suffering.

603
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,400
But you're just focused on earning money?

604
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,320
Do you have no conscience?
Aren't you embarrassed?

605
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,323
You'd better watch what you say.

606
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,326
I didn't steal the relief food
or lock people up in the village

607
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,535
like the officials did.

608
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,288
If you think about it,
I saved a lot of lives.

609
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,124
You are no different

610
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,252
from those corrupt officials
who stole the relief food.

611
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,962
You're all thieves.

612
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,756
What? "Thieves"?

613
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,342
Did you just call us virtuous civilians
thieves?

614
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,386
Yes, that's right.
You're a bunch of thieves.

615
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,805
You're starting to get on my nerves,
young man.

616
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,392
You don't know
how hard I can punch, do you?

617
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,560
What do you think you're doing? Let me go.

618
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,270
You little punk!

619
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,190
What do you know, you fool?

620
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,947
My goodness!

621
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,784
No, come on. Let's go. Hurry.

622
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,868
But...

623
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,538
-Hey!
-Come on!

624
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,997
-Hey!
-Those little...

625
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,883
They won't be able to follow us this far.

626
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,850
Are you that angry?

627
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,768
Yes, I'm angry.

628
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,439
If you hadn't stopped me,
I would've taught him a lesson.

629
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,569
That's odd.
You ran away too fast for that.

630
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,285
But you did a good job.

631
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,538
They need to know
that what they did was wrong.

632
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,377
Hang in there.

633
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,421
We're almost there.

634
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,218
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

635
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,512
That magistrate of Songhwahyeon.

636
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,265
How do you know him?
You two seemed quite close.

637
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,769
Oh, he used to be my husband.

638
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,776
"Husband"?

639
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,236
Does that mean you were married?

640
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,614
Yes, kind of.

641
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,409
Be more specific.
When, where, and how did you meet him?

642
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,994
And what made you break up...

643
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,915
No, I'm pretty sure he wanted you to stay

644
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,750
since he also has eyes of his own.
Am I right?

645
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,339
Why are you so interested in me?

646
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,678
He broke off our engagement
because I have so many flaws.

647
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,598
So stop asking questions.

648
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,558
He broke it off?

649
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,061
How dare he dump you?

650
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,190
Anyway, that means
you never liked him, right?

651
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,662
Is anyone inside?

652
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,206
Is anyone inside?

653
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,059
Are you from the government office?

654
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,437
No.

655
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,732
We're also trying to avoid the royal army.

656
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:22,941
Please don't be scared.

657
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,667
You should wait outside.

658
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,300
How did you end up hiding here?

659
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,887
Why aren't you getting treated
in the village?

660
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,849
The village ran out of medicine
a long time ago.

661
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,519
And the doctors
no longer visit the village.

662
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,481
I figured I'd end up losing my child

663
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,859
if I waited there to get treated.

664
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,240
My lady.

665
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,076
This may sound shameless,
but could you do me a favor?

666
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,037
Can you

667
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,706
please take her?

668
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,375
What?

669
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,211
I heard the epidemic hasn't reached
the southern part of the country.

670
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,798
I wanted to do my best to save my child.

671
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
But the royal army killed my husband,

672
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,470
and if I end up dying as well,

673
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,767
there's no way she'll be able to survive.

674
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,523
I'll repay you even after I die.

675
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,028
Please save my child.

676
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,739
Please, my lady.

677
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,673
Don't come inside.

678
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,018
We can't take her?

679
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,103
What do you mean?

680
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,690
Like I said,

681
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,777
we can't...

682
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,404
take her... No.

683
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,699
We shouldn't do it.

684
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,494
Why not? Look at her mother
pleading for help from us.

685
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,330
Do you know how many lives
could be at risk?

686
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,457
There was an epidemic in her village.

687
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,753
And she's been
living with a patient all this time.

688
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,799
She may seem fine on the outside,
but she might have the disease already.

689
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,550
What if we take her to Haeju,

690
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,177
and the smallpox starts to spread?

691
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,762
But we can't be sure of that yet.

692
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,388
We can isolate her and watch--

693
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,058
If smallpox could have been prevented
by isolating people,

694
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,560
it wouldn't have spread this far.

695
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,565
On top of that,

696
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,443
if people find out about her,

697
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,862
they will not stay still.

698
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,658
It's safer for her to stay here.

699
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,701
Then are you saying...

700
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,247
that we just have to leave her here?

701
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,582
Even if she might...

702
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,128
die here?

703
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,133
We brought quite a lot of food
and medicine.

704
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,343
If we leave them here with them,

705
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,138
they'll be able to survive for a while.

706
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,557
We've finished the preparations
for the ritual to fight the epidemic.

707
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,143
Why isn't His Highness there yet?

708
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,605
He must be very tired
after the long journey.

709
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,357
-His Highness is still sleeping.
-What?

710
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,652
Please be patient.

711
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,030
You said the same thing two hours ago.

712
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,741
Is he even inside?

713
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,911
Then are you saying he could've

714
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,788
gone outside without even telling me?

715
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,373
I must see His Highness for myself.

716
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,752
But... Governor Yun!

717
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,587
Your Highness.

718
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,845
We've been waiting for you, Your Highness.

719
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,015
Let us go and attend the ritual
for the epidemic.

720
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,850
There will be

721
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,810
no ritual.

722
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:06,660
What do you mean, Your Highness?
Why would the reports be false?

723
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,287
I don't know where you heard such rumors,

724
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,872
but it's not true at all.

725
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,292
I met the people in person
and heard their stories.

726
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,127
Are you still going to claim...

727
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,256
that they are false rumors?

728
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,678
The people are always angry.

729
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,014
They're always busy
badmouthing the officials.

730
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,433
They're just complaining.

731
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,894
You must not believe every word they say.

732
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,355
Your Highness, I will do my best

733
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,108
to look into what's going on.

734
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,110
No, there's no need for that.

735
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,904
I sent the false report.

736
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,739
Governor Yun.

737
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,785
But I had no other choice.
It was for our people.

738
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,037
You sent a false report to His Majesty,

739
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,957
and you're using the people as an excuse?

740
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,041
"Excuse"?

741
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,922
Ever since the epidemic broke out
in Pyongan Province,

742
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,550
there are many more people
who suffered from damages

743
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,969
due to plundering, arson, and theft

744
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,430
than people who died
due to the epidemic itself.

745
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,350
If I had reported the truth
about what was going on here,

746
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,563
that would have led people in Hanyang
finding out about the epidemic.

747
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,066
Then what would have happened to Hanyang?

748
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,902
And what would have happened
to the 200,000 people

749
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,738
who live there?

750
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,740
Then what about the fact

751
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,452
that you stole the relief food
that my father sent to the region?

752
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,872
And the fact that you made healthy people
die by confining them to their village?

753
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,373
Did you also do that for the people?

754
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,210
The sacrifice of a hundred lives
could save thousands.

755
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,381
All I did was make a choice.

756
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,427
No, you did not make a choice.
You just gave up.

757
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,686
Prepare the medicine and the relief food.

758
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,022
I must go to Pyongan Province right now.

759
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,867
I thought he was just a greenhorn.

760
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,870
How did he manage to find out about that?

761
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,332
Officer Min.

762
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,543
Can you please help us out?

763
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,713
If you send a letter to your father,

764
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,674
I'll try to see what I can do.

765
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,018
What are you doing?

766
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,896
"The governor of Pyongan Province,

767
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,232
Jang Seok-hyeong,

768
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,859
begs a historian

769
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,363
to save his life."

770
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,036
-That's what I wrote.
-What?

771
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,918
Hey.

772
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,878
Pyongan Province?

773
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,381
His Highness went to Pyongan Province?

774
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,134
Yes, that's what it says
on the report we got from Haeju.

775
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,010
Does he want to die or something?

776
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,596
-Why would he go there?
-Exactly.

777
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,226
But wasn't he dispatched to
Pyongan Province in the first place?

778
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,978
Why are you all so surprised?

779
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,230
That's only if things are okay there.

780
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,065
But I heard that place is a mess.

781
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,819
Then he should come back to Hanyang
as soon as he finishes the ritual.

782
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,572
He just had to show the people
that he dropped by out of concern.

783
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,948
My gosh.

784
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,993
Then what about Officer Min?

785
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,537
He's never had smallpox before.

786
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,206
Hey, can't you already tell by his looks?

787
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,125
He's handsome, smart,
and from a good family.

788
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,461
He was born with all the good luck
that a man could have.

789
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,588
He won't get shot by an arrow
if a war breaks out.

790
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,173
He'll never get smallpox.

791
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,926
Since when did smallpox ever choose
whom to infect?

792
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,054
If you say it like that,
you should've gotten it a long time...

793
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,519
I'm going to go to the Royal Secretariat.

794
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,856
Hey! You have to really observe
my features to realize I'm handsome.

795
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,150
It takes at least three years...
Hey! Clerk Heo!

796
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,527
Will you be able to live for three years?

797
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,720
Your Royal Highness,
you have been out here for an hour now.

798
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,015
I am worried you might ruin your health.

799
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,143
Bring me more arrows.

800
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,895
Your Royal Highness.

801
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,171
Don't be so hard on yourself.

802
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,803
You weren't the one

803
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,764
who sent Prince Dowon.

804
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,063
You are out of line.

805
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,041
Did you also know that she's still alive?

806
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,211
I only recently found out.

807
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,424
I guess that's why you haven't been
visiting me so often these days.

808
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,761
I have found out where she is.

809
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,891
She's in Pyongan Province.

810
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,363
Please save me.

811
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,247
Please save me.

812
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,001
Help us.

813
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,502
Your Highness.

814
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,505
You cannot go any further.

815
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,425
You've seen enough.

816
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,636
Let's go back to the provincial office.

817
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,096
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

818
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,631
Please help us.

819
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,841
-Here you go.
-Is it good?

820
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,555
Look.

821
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:17,817
What are you doing?

822
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,857
It was probably around 20 years ago.

823
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,359
Something was put into my arm,
and I remember it really hurt.

824
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,446
I'm the female physician
you read about in that book.

825
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,531
This book will tell us
how we can save everyone.

826
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,366
Please read it, Your Highness.

827
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,495
The moment you decide to change
someone's opinion,

828
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,080
you turn into a novelist
who writes about history.

829
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,332
It's Pyongan Province.

830
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,292
I have a lot to ask that woman.

831
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,461
I want to reassure the people.

832
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,339
Can you inject me
with the fluid from cowpox lesions?
