EPISODE 15

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,011
FIFTEEN DAYS AGO

3
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,338
ON THE DAY OF IMO

4
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,673
PRINCE DOWON HAD AN AUDIENCE
WITH THE KING AT DAEJOJEON

5
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,441
ON THE DAY OF IMO

6
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,611
PRINCE DOWON

7
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,551
On the day of imo,

8
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,011
Prince Dowon had an audience with the King

9
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,429
at Daejojeon.

10
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,809
I'm the one
that the Royal Investigation Bureau

11
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,603
should be looking for.

12
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,731
I helped the Westerner.

13
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,192
I'm the one who helped him hide.

14
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,654
And I'm the one who helped him
leave the palace.

15
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,740
So I'm the one

16
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,870
whom you should punish.

17
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,706
How could a prince think of helping
a barbarian from the West?

18
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,004
THE KING ASKED HOW A PRINCE
COULD HELP A WESTERNER

19
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,179
This is why you never deserved
to be a prince.

20
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,390
You may be a prince on the outside,

21
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,351
but you just can't hide your filthy roots.

22
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,402
I need to go to the palace. Get ready.

23
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,862
Yes, my lord.

24
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,425
You are becoming
even more stubborn by the day.

25
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,887
I declined, but you insisted
that I join you for drinks.

26
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,849
I am afraid I do not have many friends
as I am not a kind man.

27
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,101
Please understand, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,695
Please allow me to pour you a glass.

29
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,989
No, thank you.

30
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,201
My stomach is quite upset today.

31
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,619
Let me pour you one instead.

32
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,092
Your Majesty,
are you afraid that if you drink,

33
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,010
you might say something you should not?

34
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,138
What do you mean by that?

35
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,517
There is nothing I can't say to you.

36
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,898
Then please tell me truthfully.

37
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,943
You have not given me your answer
to the question I asked the other day.

38
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
I asked you if there is anything
about Prince Dowon

39
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,325
that you are hiding from me, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,332
They say that alcohol makes you
fear no one.

41
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,793
How dare you spew such nonsense?

42
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,088
I have been hiding him from the world
for he still has a lot to learn.

43
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,549
I am doing it to protect him
since I, as his father,

44
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,176
am concerned
that others may speak ill of him.

45
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,095
How could you
twist my intentions like that?

46
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,727
I am already full of concerns
about his future.

47
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,938
Don't make me more stressed
than I am already.

48
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,943
You need not worry about him,
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,738
I think Prince Dowon

50
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,948
is a brave young man
who is certainly of the royal blood.

51
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,579
He disobeyed your royal order

52
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,373
and managed to protect the foreigner
from the palace guards.

53
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,002
His wit and intelligence
cannot be seen as ordinary.

54
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,887
It's time for you
to let go of Prince Dowon.

55
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,099
A prolonged silence often breeds rumors.

56
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,834
Move over, please!

57
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
Gosh, could you please... There.

58
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
-Seol-geum.
-Yes, my lady.

59
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,674
Can you turn the page for me?

60
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,635
Goodness.

61
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,930
Look at you. You look like a puppy
rolling around in a bush clover field.

62
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,225
Are you really going to stay like this
all day long without even getting dressed?

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,230
It's my first day off in so long.
Why must you do this?

64
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,857
Don't ask me to do anything.

65
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,527
I won't even lift a finger today.

66
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,991
Even so, you should at least get up

67
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,411
and walk around the front yard
or something.

68
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,663
Come on, sit up.

69
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,041
You'd better not ask me
for a shoulder massage later.

70
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,751
Okay, I heard you.

71
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,588
You nag as much as Officer Yang.

72
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,761
Don't lie back down.

73
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

74
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,968
You said it's your day off.

75
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,887
So I came to see you.

76
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,014
No one else is inside, right?

77
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,477
It is a lady's room.

78
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,520
You cannot enter in broad daylight.

79
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,274
Then are you saying
I should come back at night?

80
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,821
You may come in.

81
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,561
Right, you can come in now.

82
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,293
What are you looking so carefully for?

83
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,090
-It's not like it's your first time here.
-But this time, it feels different.

84
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,342
It was just Clerk Goo's room back then,

85
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,636
whereas it's my woman's room now.

86
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,141
-"My woman"?
-Am I wrong?

87
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,354
I thought that's how we felt

88
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,605
about each other.

89
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm not sure.

90
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,987
Don't you think it's still too early
to say

91
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,364
that we belong to each other?

92
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,533
What must I do

93
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,244
for you to think that it's not too early?

94
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,045
Would this help?

95
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,216
Or...

96
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,014
what about this?

97
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,524
You really have a bad attitude today.

98
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,361
You seem very determined.

99
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,447
What if I am

100
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
determined?

101
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,162
What do you think?

102
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
I should go lock the door.

103
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
I'd love to see you every day like this.

104
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,883
Somewhere outside the palace.

105
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,260
Without any sachaeks or uniforms.

106
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,138
Not as a historian and a prince.

107
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,016
Just...

108
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,477
like this.

109
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,488
In the mountains behind my house,
there is a pavilion

110
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,491
that overlooks a beautiful landscape.

111
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,246
No one ever goes there,

112
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,042
so no one knows even if a tiger shows up

113
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,961
or if it suddenly thunders.

114
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,982
Is Officer Seong not here yet?

115
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,235
It's almost 9 a.m. already.

116
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,445
Let's wait.

117
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,906
He'd never come in late
because of a hangover.

118
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,449
I'm sure he has his reasons.

119
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,119
What kind of reasons, though?

120
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
We haven't even heard a word from him.

121
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,124
Last time, he came in
even though he was burning up with a fever

122
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,917
and ended up passing out while working.

123
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,336
That is true.

124
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,172
-Shall I go to his house and check?
-No, there's no need.

125
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,050
-Officer Kim.
-Yes?

126
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,469
Yes, sir.

127
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,811
Why is he so cranky today?

128
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,154
I will issue an official approval
about the decision soon.

129
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,031
Tell them to hold off the execution
until then.

130
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,867
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

131
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,292
This petition was submitted by Officer Min
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

132
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,631
"I, Historian Min U-won
of the Office of Royal Decrees

133
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,135
ask that Senior Ninth-rank Historian
Seong Seo-gwon be impeached.

134
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,306
Seong Seo-gwon

135
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,850
betrayed the trust
of his fellow historians by divulging

136
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,727
information contained in the sachaeks,

137
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,688
thereby disgracing the mission
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

138
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,815
I ask that he receives the punishment
he deserves."

139
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
What? What is going on?

140
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,655
How could a historian request
the impeachment of a fellow historian?

141
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,325
Continue reading.

142
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,368
What exactly is he guilty of?

143
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,747
-Well, the petition ends here.
-What?

144
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,126
Officer Min, why don't you
explain this to us yourself?

145
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,045
We need to know exactly what he did

146
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,881
for us to decide whether
we should impeach him or not.

147
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
I accept

148
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,851
Officer Min's request.

149
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,735
Dismiss Officer Seong Seo-gwon
and have him banished

150
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,530
to somewhere 500 ri away from the city.

151
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,990
But Your Royal Highness, I do not think

152
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
we should impeach him
without knowing what he is guilty of.

153
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,954
We at least need to know
whom he told and what--

154
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,121
Then are you saying

155
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,416
that you expect Officer Min to read the
contents of the sachaek aloud right here?

156
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,549
Wanting to know
what is in the historians' sachaeks

157
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,552
is a crime that is just as serious
as divulging the information in them.

158
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,223
So please do not argue about this anymore.

159
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,684
Read the next petition, please.

160
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,948
-Hey, Officer Yang.
-My gosh, sir.

161
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,243
You don't need to greet me.

162
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,745
Just tell me.

163
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,040
What kind of information
did Officer Seong disclose?

164
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,002
Pardon me? What do you mean, sir?

165
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,380
Come now. I also belong to the Office
of Royal Decrees. Don't play dumb.

166
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,132
I am talking about the petition

167
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,342
filed by Officer Min,
demanding his impeachment.

168
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,137
I'm sure you know the details
of what he did.

169
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,972
"Impeachment"?

170
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,851
Well...

171
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,687
I beg your pardon, sir?

172
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,147
Who...

173
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,190
Who filed what?
A petition for impeachment?

174
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,119
Officer Min.

175
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,376
Is it true?

176
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,296
You filed a request
for Officer Seong's impeachment?

177
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,175
I heard everything. Answer me at once!

178
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,135
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,723
I requested
that Officer Seong be impeached.

180
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,896
You didn't even consult me.

181
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,564
What is your reason?

182
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,399
What did Officer Seong do wrong?

183
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,402
His Royal Highness forbade
any further discussion regarding this.

184
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,780
Do not ask.

185
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,657
How could you say such a thing?

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,408
You've ruined
a promising historian's life!

187
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,035
Let him explain first.

188
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,496
I'm sure he did it for a reason.

189
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,331
Even if that's the case,
this is simply wrong.

190
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,166
When Clerk Goo was arrested,

191
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,961
we even went on a strike.
You did everything you could.

192
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,922
But with Officer Seong,
you file a request for his impeachment?

193
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
How could you do that
to a fellow historian?

194
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,219
You're so heartless.

195
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,263
You know what it's like to have
a petition filed for your impeachment.

196
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,517
I cannot let this slide.

197
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,770
-Let's go and protest or something!
-That won't work.

198
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,648
No matter how angry you get,

199
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,943
the fact that he committed a crime
does not change.

200
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,779
-Officer Min!
-Get back to work.

201
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,162
Does he think he's the only one
with integrity?

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,915
We're all scared to work with you now!

203
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,929
Officer Min.

204
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,729
Is it because of Nokseodang?

205
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,109
That is the only reason I can think of.

206
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,820
Officer Seong

207
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,531
knew about what happened at Nokseodang.

208
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,075
He...

209
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,953
told someone about it, didn't he?

210
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,790
Isn't that
why those Catholics were let go?

211
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,417
Didn't you hear?

212
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,920
-His Royal Highness forbade us--
-Then punish me as well.

213
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,512
If Officer Seong

214
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,057
is guilty of disobeying the royal orders
to save lives,

215
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,435
then I should receive the same punishment.

216
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,440
I, too, kept my lips sealed when I knew

217
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,150
about the Westerner

218
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,735
hiding in Nokseodang.

219
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,654
That is the difference.

220
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,450
You faithfully did your duty
as a historian,

221
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,119
whereas he crossed a line
that he shouldn't have crossed.

222
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,954
Our methods may have been different,

223
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
but we had the same goal.

224
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,500
You still don't see

225
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,211
how big of a difference that is?

226
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,675
The sachaek is a double-edged sword.

227
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,471
If we, historians,
can save innocent lives using it,

228
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,599
it also means it can be used
to kill innocent people.

229
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,729
Thus, a sachaek shouldn't be a weapon,
no matter how good your intentions are.

230
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,942
That is the one basic rule
we must follow even if it costs us

231
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,860
our lives.

232
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,239
Do you

233
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,908
understand?

234
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,667
No.

235
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,586
I do not wish to understand.

236
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,548
How can you put

237
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,092
principles above people?

238
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,182
I will see you later.

239
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,084
That poor thing.

240
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,462
He worshiped Officer Min's words
more than Confucius' teachings,

241
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,756
but he got stabbed in the back by him.

242
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,845
As they say,
trust is indeed the mother of deceit.

243
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,140
After all, Officer Min
is the Second State Councillor's son.

244
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,475
I bet we're just temporary
fellow historians to him.

245
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,187
Officer One,
Officer Two, and Officer Three.

246
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,981
He won't even remember our names
in five years.

247
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,525
Don't be all talk and no action.

248
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,819
Let's gather some money for him, okay?

249
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,280
I heard he spends all his stipend
on his father's medicine.

250
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,993
I wonder if he'll even be able to afford
a house with a roof at his place of exile.

251
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,329
Gosh, I know.

252
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,080
He'll have to buy some slaves, too.

253
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,541
He'll have a lot of expenses.

254
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,715
Clerk Song.

255
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,510
Why aren't you pitching in?

256
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,428
Your family is rich.

257
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,890
You'd better not say
you came empty-handed.

258
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,143
Why are you all

259
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,020
so simpleminded?

260
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,193
Have you not thought
that maybe Officer Seong actually made

261
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,154
-a serious mistake?
-What?

262
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,907
That means... You must know something.

263
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,492
We don't need to hear it.

264
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,704
He probably just let something
insignificant slip but was accused

265
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,872
of divulging information
contained in the sachaek.

266
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,125
He threatened His Royal Highness.

267
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,046
He threatened His Royal Highness

268
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,173
that he'd reveal everything in the sachaek

269
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,217
if His Royal Highness

270
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,386
didn't release the Catholics.

271
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,930
That is what Officer Seong
is truly guilty of.

272
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,643
Stop spewing complete nonsense.

273
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,062
That is considered high treason.

274
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,398
Why would he do such a thing
for Catholics--

275
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,400
Why do you think he did that?

276
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,944
Obviously, he's one of them.

277
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,280
What a lunatic.

278
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,660
Hey, how do you know this?

279
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,329
Did you hear it from Officer Seong?

280
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,749
Officer Min visited Dongungjeon

281
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,294
before leaving the palace yesterday.

282
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,054
He apologized to His Royal Highness
on Officer Seong's behalf

283
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,515
and begged His Royal Highness
to at least spare his life.

284
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,894
His Royal Highness accepted
his earnest request.

285
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,230
That is why Officer Seong is being exiled
instead of

286
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,358
receiving a harsher punishment.

287
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,366
Apprentice Song.

288
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,993
You should have told us sooner,

289
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,705
-before I was that rude to Officer Min.
-That's nothing.

290
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,290
I yelled and talked back to him.

291
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,750
You two

292
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,336
were still nicer than Officer Hwang was.

293
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,047
He basically took a run at him
with glaring eyes.

294
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,382
Right, you did.

295
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,888
What is the matter with him?

296
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,973
He could've just told us.

297
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,352
Why keep it to himself
and drive everyone around him crazy?

298
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,646
Haven't you known him long enough?

299
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,733
He'd much rather take all the blame
than talk about others' faults.

300
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,403
I told you that there must be a reason.

301
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,340
Officer Min.

302
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm sorry I don't have much to offer.

303
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,983
Had I known you'd be coming,
I would've bought some meat.

304
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,784
Take this.

305
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,579
It'll help you with the preparations.

306
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,423
I have no right to accept this.

307
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,884
Officer Seong.

308
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,845
Will you continue

309
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,973
to make me feel uncomfortable?

310
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,563
Thank you,

311
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,732
Officer Min.

312
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,278
I thought I was as good as dead.

313
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,155
Thanks to you, I can live.

314
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,452
Don't thank me. His Royal Highness'
decision saved your life.

315
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,374
Living in exile won't be easy,

316
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,252
but hang in there.

317
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,088
Our office isn't the only place

318
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,715
where you can work.

319
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,636
You'll be able to return
to the palace soon.

320
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,808
No.

321
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,102
I no longer wish to work
for the government.

322
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,274
When I was young, I did nothing
but study to be a civil servant.

323
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,819
After becoming a historian, all I've
been doing is work on the sachaek.

324
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,574
Now, I wish to live in the real world
instead of being engrossed in books.

325
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,121
I'd like to teach people how to write
and help them with legal matters.

326
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,583
I won't make lots of money,
but I will earn enough

327
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,335
to at least support my family.

328
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,925
Is it so important to you?

329
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,556
That faith of yours, I mean.

330
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,353
Is it significant enough for you

331
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,981
to give up the path you've been on

332
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,026
your whole life without any hesitation?

333
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,072
It is not significant yet.

334
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,783
That is why

335
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,369
I wish to protect it with all my might.

336
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,252
I am leaving because of my sins,

337
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,671
but if you're okay with it,

338
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,924
I'd like to write to you from time to time
and stay in touch with you.

339
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,972
Sure.

340
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,767
I'll wait for your letter.
You can write to me anytime.

341
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,774
Let me pour you a drink.

342
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,452
Cheers.

343
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,046
Get home safely, Officer Min.

344
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,915
No earnings again today.

345
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,419
Welcome!

346
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,051
Are you looking
for anything specific, sir?

347
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,721
-Well...
-Yes.

348
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,606
I'm looking for a book,
which I should be discreet about.

349
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,694
That is my specialty, sir.

350
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,320
You've come to the right place!

351
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,074
There are stacks of such books
in the back room.

352
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,285
My goodness. It's okay, sir.

353
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,415
The drawings are very realistic.

354
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,134
Let's be discreet, please.

355
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,141
And that's not what I'm looking for.

356
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:03,158
Why on earth are you looking for this book
when you know what's going on these days?

357
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,827
Gosh, my heart is racing.

358
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,287
Here you go.

359
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,874
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

360
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,584
Wait, sir.

361
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,505
You must never tell anyone about this.

362
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,551
If you do, both you and I will be
dead meat. Do you understand?

363
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,693
THE TRUE MEANING OF THE LORD OF HEAVEN

364
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:43,281
GOSPEL OF MARK

365
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,544
No.

366
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,714
A mere apology won't do.

367
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,718
First, you should get on your knees,
Officer Hwang.

368
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,846
Then if he seems less angry,

369
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,765
Hong-ik and I will--

370
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,142
How could you expect me
to get on my knees all by myself?

371
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,229
Then do you want me to do it?
I used to be his superior.

372
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,525
We should just bawl our eyes out
in front of him.

373
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,860
Surprisingly,
such things strike a chord with him.

374
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,073
What do you say?
You can cry on the count of three, right?

375
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,283
Pardon me?

376
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,787
-I'm not good at things like that.
-Hey, you're doing it now.

377
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,623
Keep doing it. Think about something sad.

378
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,583
-Be sad.
-Your wife is mad at you.

379
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,627
Your wife hit you.

380
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,505
She kicked you out.

381
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,554
Sorry to interrupt,
but Officer Min is already here.

382
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,391
-Officer Min...
-My gosh, Officer Min!

383
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,728
-What?
-I'm so sorry.

384
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,231
Don't tell on me
to the Second State Councillor, please.

385
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,190
What's the matter?

386
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,609
I heard everything.

387
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,445
I had no idea Officer Seong
would do something so crazy.

388
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,822
My goodness.

389
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,327
You fool. Do you have no pride
as a historian?

390
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,621
Officer Min, I hope you know

391
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,625
that I've always been on your side
from the very beginning.

392
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,087
I just lost my composure
for a short moment.

393
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,006
Me too.

394
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,967
I was simply offering a word of advice

395
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,219
as your former supervisor.

396
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,681
I never took a run at you
like Jang-gun did.

397
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,892
Sir.

398
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,815
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

399
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,777
Do you really mean it?

400
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,072
Then you won't tell on us
to the Second State Councillor, right?

401
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,908
Obviously, he's just saying it.

402
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,953
Let's just have him punch you
and put an end to this.

403
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,039
-Pardon me?
-It'll get rid of his anger.

404
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,833
Yes. Just let him punch you once,
and that will be it.

405
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,169
Come on, Jang-gun. Live up to your name.

406
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,213
It's not my fault
that my name means "general."

407
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,758
I've been a scholar all my life.

408
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,553
Officer Min's mood is not
what's important right now.

409
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,140
We need his promise that he will never
tell the Second State Councillor

410
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,433
and then Officer Min...

411
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,354
-What on earth...
-Why aren't you using your eyes?

412
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,064
He left a while ago.

413
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,483
Then why didn't you use your mouth?
You should have told us!

414
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,320
Officer Kim, you should have cried first!

415
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,364
You should have stayed focused.

416
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,742
-Why didn't you?
-It's all because of you!

417
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,747
Why are you blaming me?

418
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,960
You should've done that just now!

419
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,598
Officer Min!

420
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,813
What is it?

421
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,484
I'd like to apologize
for what I did yesterday.

422
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,822
I got angry
without knowing the full story.

423
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,993
There is no need to apologize.
If you've understood, it's fine.

424
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,829
I'm only apologizing for getting angry.

425
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,792
I don't mean that
I can understand what you said.

426
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,336
What do you mean?

427
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,090
You said a sachaek should never be used,
no matter how good our intentions are.

428
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,468
I still cannot agree with that.

429
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,181
If I had to save someone,

430
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,184
I would use it without hesitating.

431
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,148
Do you think I'll let you do that?

432
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,111
Then you can impeach me if I do.

433
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,321
-You--
-The Royal Secretariat, right?

434
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,034
That's my...

435
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,500
That Goo Hae-ryung.

436
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,471
Go ahead first.

437
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,942
You said you still have
something left to do.

438
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,780
-Mo-hwa.
-It doesn't mean that I'll forgive you.

439
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,616
But just like you, I also have

440
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,203
something I must do.

441
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,796
Apprentice Heo.

442
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,800
Why did you return so soon?

443
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,220
Because the Queen said
she is going to take a nap.

444
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,638
What about you?

445
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,391
The Queen Dowager also went out.

446
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,186
That means we can...

447
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,773
Let's go.

448
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,992
Why did you suddenly come here?

449
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,537
There are so many bugs.

450
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,208
When we're inside,
you try to write everything down.

451
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,920
So I'm drawing a line
between your work and your personal life.

452
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,213
Starting now,

453
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,383
this is our personal time.

454
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,888
A historian doesn't get
any personal time in the palace.

455
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,642
Give it back while I'm asking nicely,
before I write everything.

456
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,520
What will you write?

457
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,358
"Prince Dowon had romantic feelings
for a historian

458
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,861
and took her to a desolate place"?

459
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,382
Clerk Yi?

460
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,217
Clerk Yi?

461
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,597
Prince Dowon?

462
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,946
How could you do this to us?

463
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,907
We're historians, Apprentice Goo.

464
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,575
If we're historians,

465
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,036
shouldn't we share all of our secrets?

466
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,663
How could you two
be all lovey-dovey behind our backs?

467
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,957
This is unbelievable. I feel so betrayed!

468
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,086
So what's going on?
When did you fall for...

469
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:59,217
I mean, since when did you two
have romantic feelings for each other?

470
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,803
Apprentice Oh, it's not like that--

471
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,138
In my case,

472
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,558
it was since the first day we met.

473
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,480
Then you've had feelings for her
since then?

474
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:13,940
Wait.

475
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,402
Have you two held hands?

476
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,489
Wait, have you... Have you two kissed too?

477
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,200
No. Come on.

478
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,202
Nothing like that ever happened.

479
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,163
Your Highness!

480
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,710
We got caught anyway,
so why should we lie?

481
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,714
Go back to the Office of Royal Decrees
and tell everyone

482
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,633
that Goo Hae-ryung is already taken,

483
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,510
so don't even look her in the eyes

484
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,095
or take her to any get-togethers.

485
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,472
Make sure they just let her do her job

486
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,724
and let her go home right on time.

487
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:53,145
Are you telling us to spread the news?
What's your intention?

488
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,856
-My "intention"?
-Yes. Let me be honest.

489
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,484
You can just have fun with her
and be done after that, right?

490
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,445
This is a matter of life and death
for Apprentice Goo.

491
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,115
She might not be able to marry,
and she may get kicked out.

492
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,742
She's right.
What about Apprentice Goo's life?

493
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,497
Are you going to be responsible
for this innocent girl's life?

494
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,083
Ladies, please calm down--

495
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,751
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

496
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,963
You two!

497
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,174
"This innocent girl"? Nonsense.

498
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,261
She hit on him first.
Why should he be responsible?

499
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,178
"Hit on him"?

500
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,723
-What? She hit on him?
-Yes.

501
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:33,394
I have no idea what kind of life
Apprentice Goo lived outside the palace,

502
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,732
but His Highness has lived
a foolish life like an idiot,

503
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,027
reading his life away at Nokseodang,
knowing nothing about women.

504
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,155
-Okay?
-Look, I'm not that bad--

505
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,197
What are you saying?

506
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,991
Are you implying that Apprentice Goo

507
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,618
dated all sorts of men
outside of these walls?

508
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,078
Don't you have eyes?

509
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,748
Look at how pretty she is.

510
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,125
I'm sure guys will
sell off their houses to date her.

511
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,501
They would never pass her by!

512
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,754
That's because you don't know her.

513
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,757
Not everyone can approach
our dear Apprentice Goo

514
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,008
because of her bad temper.

515
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,094
She was half forced to live as an old maid
until the age of 26!

516
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,512
How dare you insult her like this?

517
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,766
And it's not like
His Highness doesn't have good looks.

518
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,851
You can see how handsome he is
in a single glance.

519
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,396
I'm sure all the court ladies
fell for him.

520
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,397
What did you say?

521
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,483
How dare you two speak like that to us?

522
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,068
You're the ones who started this!

523
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,737
Hey! We've worked in this palace
for at least ten years more than you have!

524
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,490
So what? We passed an exam to work here!

525
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,450
You're nothing but court ladies!

526
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,952
-What? "Nothing but court ladies"?
-Yes, you're nothing!

527
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,662
-"Nothing"?
-"Nothing"?

528
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,708
-Come here!
-Hey!

529
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,876
-I'm a historian!
-Hey!

530
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,587
-Hey, stop it!
-You little brat!

531
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,839
-Let go of me!
-How dare you!

532
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,883
-Darn you!
-You little brat!

533
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,719
-Who do you think you are?
-Hey!

534
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,766
What are you all doing?

535
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,351
Move. Move aside!

536
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,187
What's with you?

537
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,778
A group fight in the middle
of the Inner Palace?

538
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,115
What if someone like that big mouth,
Eunuch Park, saw you guys?

539
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,575
Were you planning
to let everyone in this country find out

540
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,121
that Prince Dowon and a female historian
fell in love with each other?

541
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:19,125
They kept talking as if His Highness
was some kind of beast.

542
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,751
We couldn't stay silent to that.

543
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,922
There are only six people in this world
who can badmouth His Highness.

544
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,466
His Majesty, His Royal Highness,
the Queen, the Queen Dowager,

545
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,510
and us two.

546
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,305
Do you still not understand
what you did wrong?

547
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,975
See? I told you to stop.

548
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,271
You didn't do anything good either.

549
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,110
As you already know,
you have your room here in Nokseodang.

550
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,239
Why did you have to walk around with her
so openly like that

551
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:54,368
when you could just spend time with her
here in this room?

552
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,286
Why?

553
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,832
Thank goodness
you got caught by her colleagues.

554
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,543
If you got caught
by the fussy Court Lady Choi,

555
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,880
the Queen Dowager would've
summoned Apprentice Goo to her palace.

556
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,256
And without anyone knowing...

557
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,134
My goodness.

558
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,595
I don't know if I'm a eunuch

559
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,222
or a babysitter
who's taking care of three children.

560
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,184
I'll die early at this rate.

561
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,686
Sam-bo.

562
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,522
I didn't fight, though.

563
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,820
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

564
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,951
What's with the long face?

565
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,996
-Did the court ladies bully you again?
-Apprentice Goo...

566
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,087
It's nothing.

567
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,300
I'm just really annoyed
because the weather is so nice.

568
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,053
Apprentice Goo.

569
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,430
Let's talk in private.

570
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,525
I get the feeling they had a fight.

571
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,695
Maybe that fight is still ongoing.

572
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,615
Gosh.

573
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,950
Gosh!

574
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,997
I'm really not happy about this.

575
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,125
I don't care if he's a prince.
How dare he covet Apprentice Goo?

576
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,087
Be honest with us.

577
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,673
Were you threatened?

578
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
Are you being forced to date him?

579
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,345
By any chance,
did he use his title as an excuse

580
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,764
to hug you and make physical contact?

581
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,978
No, I'm the one who first...

582
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,527
I'm seeing him

583
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,821
because I like him.

584
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,367
What on earth do you like about him?

585
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,537
A glimpse of his surroundings
is enough to know his character.

586
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,125
His court ladies
are nothing but rude and impolite.

587
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,962
That's probably because they learned
from the person they serve.

588
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,256
Back when he pretended to be Clerk Yi,

589
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,675
he was so slow-witted and weak.

590
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,760
He was far from attractive.

591
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,473
What do you mean he's not attractive?

592
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,685
He's kind and considerate.

593
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,562
He has such an innocent smile.

594
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,314
He's very serious when he reads.

595
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,275
And he looks very peaceful when he sleeps.

596
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,693
"When he sleeps"?

597
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:42,077
Apprentice Goo, how do you know
what he looks like when he sleeps?

598
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,705
No way.

599
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,874
Already?

600
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,338
Don't be mistaken.
On the day of the gyeongsin ritual--

601
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,633
No wonder you suddenly
disappeared that night.

602
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,092
I can't believe you did it already.

603
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,511
-My goodness.
-No...

604
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,890
Nothing happened. Nothing happened at all.

605
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,976
Don't even try to get out of this.

606
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,064
You'd better tell us everything in detail.

607
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,234
The look in his eyes, the way he touched,
and the way he moved.

608
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,820
Tell us every little detail!

609
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,989
My goodness.

610
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,992
-Get over here.
-Catch her.

611
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,411
Hurry up.

612
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,288
My gosh, I just slept
with my head on his arm.

613
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,749
-What did you do?
-Hurry up and tell us.

614
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,918
We did nothing.
I just used his arm as a pillow.

615
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,127
She used his arm as a pillow.

616
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,935
What happened? Did you explain everything?

617
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,145
Don't even ask.

618
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,065
They locked me up in the library
and interrogated me.

619
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,567
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,861
I never planned
to put you through any trouble.

621
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,948
If you were going to apologize like this,

622
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,616
why did you have to tell them

623
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,702
that you liked me
from the day we first met?

624
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,036
I said that

625
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,664
because no one around you

626
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,208
knows about our relationship.

627
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,379
It felt like you were
keeping my existence a secret.

628
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,715
And I didn't like that.

629
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,847
It's actually for the better.

630
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,687
Now, I can talk to them freely about you
without keeping it a secret.

631
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,314
So if you ever make me upset,

632
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,568
I'll talk behind your back
and badmouth you.

633
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,821
I'm the purest and noblest man
you'll ever find.

634
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,907
We'll have to see about that.

635
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,893
Don't record this.

636
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,332
Your Majesty.

637
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,377
You're here.

638
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,506
Did something happen?
It seems like something's on your mind.

639
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,633
No.

640
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:30,180
It has been so long since I've set foot
outside the palace like this.

641
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,600
Isn't it funny?

642
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,019
The past couple of years

643
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,106
have been so tough and difficult for me.

644
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:44,361
But the world seems so calm and peaceful.

645
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,739
Your Majesty.

646
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,662
I guess I became a little emotional
now that I'm outside the palace.

647
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,295
So tell me. Did you bring what I asked?

648
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:11,680
It's the letter that Dominique
wrote to his little brother.

649
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:15,058
He wrote about the situation
at Seoraewon in that letter.

650
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,271
If only

651
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,358
I got this letter 20 years ago...

652
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,819
It's not too late.

653
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,323
You are still very healthy and strong.

654
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:30,991
Yes.

655
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,411
That day will soon come.

656
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,580
Thank you.

657
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,957
Not at all, Your Majesty.

658
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,627
By the way,

659
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,087
I have something to tell you.

660
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,050
When I recently visited
Third Inspector Goo's house,

661
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,344
I met his sister there.

662
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,012
Your Majesty.

663
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,392
A message came from the palace.

664
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,656
Your Majesty,
the Queen Dowager has arrived.

665
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,459
Your Majesty.

666
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,890
I heard you went outside the palace.

667
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,644
If you need some air,
you can stay at the royal villa--

668
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,897
I have no reason to leave the palace.

669
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,944
I don't intend to leave,
so don't even look forward to it.

670
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,448
I heard you needed to talk to me
about something.

671
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,784
What is it?

672
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,620
The thing is,

673
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,290
I'd like to discuss
Prince Dowon's marriage.

674
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
-His marriage?
-Yes.

675
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,672
Prince Dowon is 20 years old now.

676
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,674
There are many eyes,

677
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,177
and we cannot keep him single
for the rest of his life.

678
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,681
Please allow him to get married now.

679
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,769
Of course.

680
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,527
I have actually been considering it.

681
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,989
Prince Dowon is a grown man now,

682
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,492
so it is time that he finds himself
a good wife.

683
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,848
Your Majesty,
if you install the Garyecheong,

684
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,267
the Second State Councillor
will surely try to get involved.

685
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,812
Why did you approve
of Prince Dowon's marriage?

686
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,899
On top of that,
we cannot guarantee his safety

687
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,692
if he leaves the palace.

688
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,653
Do you think I don't know that already?

689
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,741
I only approved
of Prince Dowon's marriage.

690
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,827
That does not mean the King
gets to choose Prince Dowon's wife.

691
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,875
I want you to send a letter

692
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,961
to Lord So Baek-seon.

693
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,671
Yes, Your Majesty.

694
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm really proud of myself right now.

695
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,906
I had such a hard time keeping the secret

696
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,491
to myself yesterday.

697
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,326
I really wanted to tell someone

698
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,495
that Prince Dowon
and Apprentice Goo are dating.

699
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,873
But I held back and kept it to myself.

700
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,169
Are you sure that you didn't tell anyone?

701
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,879
I did tell my dog.

702
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,467
You can understand that, right?

703
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,178
Okay, I'm really proud of you.

704
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,014
I'm so jealous of you, Apprentice Goo.

705
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,893
I hate coming to work every morning.

706
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,270
But this isn't work to you.

707
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:32,190
You're coming here to spend time
with your dear lover.

708
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,028
That is nonsense.
I'm very strict when it comes to work.

709
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,031
I go there as a historian
to write history--

710
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,117
Of course, you're writing history.

711
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,327
The history of a love affair
between a man and a woman.

712
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,126
It's time to go. I'll be off now.

713
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,461
She must be embarrassed.

714
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,713
-Yes, let's go.
-Let's go.

715
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,924
Your Highness!

716
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,843
Your Highness!

717
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,138
Your Highness!

718
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,562
Will you please stop
yelling my name like that

719
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,355
every time you need to talk to me?

720
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,608
I get so startled every time you yell.

721
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,443
This time,

722
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,112
it really is a big deal.

723
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,407
I heard they're going to install
the Garyecheong.

724
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,410
For a royal wedding?
Who's getting married?

725
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,329
Who do you think?

726
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:32,375
There's only one person who's old enough
to get married in the royal family.

727
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,341
Me? Prince Dowon?

728
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,093
Yes! It's for you, Your Highness!

729
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,555
His Majesty gave orders
to arrange your marriage.

730
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,032
Hae-ryung.

731
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,583
Congratulations.

732
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,766
Hae-ryung.

733
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,726
Hae-ryung.

734
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,940
Why are you congratulating me?
This is totally absurd.

735
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,651
You've been wanting

736
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,405
to leave the palace for a very long time.

737
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,616
Your wish finally came true, so I should--

738
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,827
This isn't how I wanted
to leave the palace.

739
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,953
I wanted you...

740
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,042
Don't worry.

741
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,255
I don't intend on marrying anyone else.

742
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:05,969
If you

743
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,055
feel the same way...

744
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,765
What if I feel the same way?

745
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,771
Are the consequences of my feelings

746
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,109
going to keep me tied down as your wife
for the rest of my life?

747
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,805
-The Garyecheong?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

748
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,140
The Garyecheong
will be installed tomorrow.

749
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,142
Then they will start
accepting the candidates.

750
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,854
All right, you may leave.

751
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,531
What is bothering you,
Your Royal Highness?

752
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,785
This is something to celebrate.

753
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,496
But you seem very troubled.

754
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,126
A royal family's marriage
isn't a joyous event.

755
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:07,132
It's an act of calculating
what you can gain from one another.

756
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,467
It's just politics that involves
making the right moves.

757
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,639
And that's how a person ends up
living his or her life like a chess piece.

758
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,184
Yes.

759
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,896
You must understand
since you are from a noble family.

760
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,567
If you hadn't become a female historian,
the same would have happened to you.

761
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,654
However,

762
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,907
you still have a chance.

763
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,535
You don't need to obey
the Second State Councillor

764
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,371
just because he helped you become
a female historian.

765
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,017
-My lord.
-You're here.

766
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,895
Why are we suddenly
installing the Garyecheong?

767
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,397
You know how fickle His Majesty can be.

768
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,941
Have you found someone
from a decent family?

769
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,445
Yes, I'm sending letters
to all the families I can think of.

770
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,113
But it won't be easy.

771
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,325
Prince Dowon may be a prince,

772
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,745
but everyone knows that His Majesty
thinks of him as an eyesore.

773
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:22,290
Who would want their daughter
to marry someone like that?

774
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,917
You do have a point.

775
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,963
My lord, let's just choose a decent person

776
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,215
and get it over with.

777
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,927
No, there is no need for you
to go through any trouble.

778
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,390
I already have the right person in mind.

779
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,019
What? My lord,

780
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,605
you do not mean...

781
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,278
Your Highness.

782
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,745
Where did he go?

783
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,500
Your Highness!

784
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,846
Okay, then.

785
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,891
Let's have a drink
after we see Officer Seong leave.

786
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,685
Officer Hwang said he'll buy tonight.

787
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,521
I only ate a little for lunch
so I could enjoy the feast.

788
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,689
Good job.

789
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,614
Clerk Yi, what are you doing here?

790
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,533
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

791
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,954
What did you just say?

792
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,258
Follow me.

793
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,512
My work is done for the day.

794
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,889
Do you want me to drag you out of here?

795
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,125
What just happened?

796
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,933
Your Majesty, Prince Dowon is here.

797
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,897
Tell him to come inside.

798
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,120
Welcome, Prince Dowon.

799
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,293
How have you been, Your Majesty?

800
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,630
It's always the same for me.

801
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,508
Come here and sit.

802
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:32,063
I did not know you could be so impatient.

803
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,108
Are you here to rush me

804
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,944
after you heard about the Garyecheong?

805
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,363
No.

806
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,409
I'm here

807
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,744
to ask you a favor.

808
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,920
Please withdraw the order to find a bride

809
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,589
and put a halt to my wedding.

810
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,593
Prince Dowon.

811
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,346
I am already in love with someone.

812
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,148
I love her very deeply.

813
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,527
And I do not wish to marry anyone else

814
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,615
other than her.

815
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,740
He has submitted information
about his daughter.

816
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,700
Why would that family want Prince Dowon?

817
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,744
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

818
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:13,080
Please do not worry.
Unlike someone, I do not intend on

819
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,541
selling off my daughter
to gain power and authority.

820
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,127
Is this the Song Sa-hui that we know?

821
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,963
You're on the list of candidates
for Prince Dowon's bride-to-be.

822
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,173
You are afraid someone might

823
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,550
become part of the royal family.
I know what you are up to.

824
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,052
You are very smart, indeed.

825
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,764
All I wanted was for him
to acknowledge my feelings.

826
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,058
I'll hear you out one last time.

827
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,227
He's very similar to His Majesty.

828
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,187
Hae-ryung won't forgive you either.

829
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,648
How much does she know?

830
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,942
It's the King's orders.
You should obey him.

831
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,485
I'll just

832
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,278
abandon everything.

833
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,699
