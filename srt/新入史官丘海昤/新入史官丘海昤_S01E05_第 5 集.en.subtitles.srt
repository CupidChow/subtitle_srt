1
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,385
Maehwa?

2
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,770
I'm...

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,190
Prince Dowon,

4
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,567
the prince of Joseon.

5
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,405
-What?
-Do you really think

6
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,283
you can kill me?

7
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,178
My gosh.

8
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,681
Maehwa.

9
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,392
Are you all right?

10
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,317
Maehwa.

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
Sir.

12
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,280
Sir!

13
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,576
Sir.

14
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,537
Sir.

15
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,445
EPISODE 5

16
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,154
How is he doing?

17
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,822
Is he very unwell?

18
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,117
He seems to be suffering
from a qi deficiency.

19
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,370
He keeps having nightmares.

20
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,082
But he is young, so he'll wake up soon.

21
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,459
By the way,

22
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,128
who is he?

23
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,047
Judging from his hands,

24
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,425
it seems like he's never done
any hard work his entire life.

25
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,428
He must be from a prestigious family.

26
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,891
Is he your lover by any chance?

27
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,019
Gosh, no. Not at all.

28
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,856
Of course not.
He is just an acquaintance of mine.

29
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,483
An "acquaintance"?

30
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,277
Yes.

31
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm telling the truth.

32
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,329
He is very handsome.

33
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,466
I am Prince Dowon,

34
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,509
the prince of Joseon.

35
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,701
Why am I here?

36
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,662
We're at the apothecary.

37
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,415
I couldn't leave you there alone.

38
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,302
Are you feeling all right?

39
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,846
I must go.

40
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,227
Sir, at least have some herbal medicine
before you go...

41
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,357
What? Prince Dowon?

42
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,443
Stop spewing utter nonsense!

43
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,906
Lord Min, I am certain
that some trickster fooled him.

44
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,784
I mean, Prince Dowon, of all people?

45
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
That greenhorn who is stuck in Nokseodang?

46
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,081
Why would he
go to the Royal Investigation Bureau?

47
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,833
My goodness.

48
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,754
I suppose the Crown Prince
has a new minion now.

49
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,757
A "minion"?

50
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,219
Deliver the message to the
Chancellor of Royal College of Literature.

51
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,303
Yes, my lord.

52
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,436
Then,

53
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,772
are you saying that man was murdered?

54
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,191
I cannot tell you for certain.

55
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,696
However, he was found dead as soon as
the suspicious-looking man left.

56
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,074
I witnessed it with my own two eyes.

57
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,077
But you said he was seriously injured.

58
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,081
-You might be suspecting an innocent man.
-He was a good swordsman.

59
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,002
Besides, no ordinary person would dare

60
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,088
to go to the Royal Investigation Bureau
in disguise.

61
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,676
How did you know that he was a swordsman?

62
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,724
Did you come face-to-face with him?

63
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,856
-Rim.
-He was the only lead I had.

64
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,774
I didn't want to lose him.

65
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,360
Even so, you should not have
done such a reckless thing.

66
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,822
You didn't even take the guards,
saying you wanted to go alone.

67
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
It was my mistake
for dragging you into this.

68
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,496
Take your hands off this at once.

69
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,914
Jin.

70
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,958
But you also know.

71
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,172
From the banned books to this incident,

72
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,759
bizarre things that don't make sense
keep on taking place.

73
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,678
For some reason, I have a feeling

74
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,890
that The Story of Ho Dam
might be at the center of this.

75
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,565
Hence,

76
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,442
I would like to know

77
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,112
what The Story of Ho Dam is about

78
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,822
and who Ho Dam is.

79
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,242
I must find out.

80
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,410
No, you shouldn't.

81
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,169
Do not dig into what that book is about.

82
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,713
It is an order.

83
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,961
RECORD OF APPEARANCE

84
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,978
PRINCE DOWON YI RIM

85
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,315
Are you lost?

86
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,405
You must come back tomorrow,
the day after tomorrow,

87
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,740
and even the next day.

88
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,451
You must keep coming back every single day

89
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,244
until Prince Dowon forgives you.

90
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm Prince Dowon,

91
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,208
the prince of Joseon.

92
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,007
Apprentice Goo.

93
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,599
What are you reading?
You didn't even hear us.

94
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143
This is the Record of Appearance.

95
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,522
By the way, why has this page
been left blank?

96
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,442
The page for Prince Dowon.

97
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,444
Everyone else has a portrait
on their page.

98
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,112
Only this one has been left blank.

99
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,240
Apprentice Goo, have you not heard
about Prince Dowon?

100
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,077
There are those rumors about him.

101
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,206
Prince Dowon is the prince
who was sent into exile at Nokseodang,

102
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,625
the place hidden deep inside the palace.

103
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,629
Rumor has it that his entire body
is covered in boils.

104
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,466
I heard he's like a monster
who resembles neither man nor animal.

105
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
I heard a different story.

106
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,223
I heard His Majesty had no choice
but to lock him up.

107
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,103
Apparently,
he was born a complete lunatic.

108
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,605
-Your Highness, please don't kill me.
-He used to threaten...

109
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,690
-Please spare my life.
-...and hit the court ladies.

110
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,236
I heard he's even killed a few.

111
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,826
-But do you think it's true?
-Of course. I mean, if he's a prince,

112
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,829
why is he still living in the palace
without even getting married?

113
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,832
He can't attend any birthday celebrations,
the neunghaeng, or the joha.

114
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,334
NEUNGHAENG: KING'S VISIT TO ROYAL TOMBS
JOHA: GREETING CEREMONY

115
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,047
Clerks, come outside for a second.

116
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,310
Do you think this makes sense?

117
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,895
Don't be ridiculous.

118
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,647
This means that I have to take the fall

119
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,191
if they go there and cause trouble.

120
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,069
I, too, cannot let this happen.

121
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,822
Officer Yang is our leader, you know.

122
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,283
Why does the Chancellor think
he can make such a decision?

123
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,953
Officer Yang only has authority
over you historians.

124
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,830
Here, after the Chief State Councillor,

125
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,833
the Chancellor of Royal College
of Literature has the most power.

126
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,503
Besides, the Crown Prince
has already approved it.

127
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,589
Why are you all so dissatisfied?

128
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,382
Just do as you're told!

129
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,140
This concerns us historians.

130
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,684
Mind your own business,
and please leave now.

131
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,437
This guy makes me so uncomfortable.

132
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,772
Isn't it a good thing?

133
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,736
-We will send them.
-Are you out of your mind?

134
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,489
Have you gone mad?
Do you even realize where...

135
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,286
Is there something wrong, sir?

136
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,207
You'll work at the Inner Palace
starting today.

137
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,375
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

138
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,420
Go and get your books and brushes.

139
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,889
Your Highness!

140
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,475
We have a big problem!

141
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,560
Your Highness!

142
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,939
Female historians? They will come here?

143
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,357
Yes, that's right.

144
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,359
These people didn't even care

145
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,945
about Nokseodang whatsoever
for the past 20 years.

146
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,656
Why send those girls here, of all places?

147
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,033
Prince Eunseong, Prince Eunwi,
and Prince Eunhyo.

148
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,494
There are so many other princes,
but why here?

149
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,038
This is driving me crazy.

150
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,292
Your Highness, we have no time to waste.

151
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,835
Please get changed.

152
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,588
If that young lady sees your face--

153
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,965
No, it's okay.

154
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:06,011
I may be able to fool her again,
but I shouldn't deceive our historians.

155
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,307
Besides,
I no longer wish to deceive her anyway.

156
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,435
Your Highness, then--

157
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,062
Bring my royal robe.

158
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
NOKSEODANG

159
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,922
Your Highness,
the female historian is here.

160
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,009
Your Highness.

161
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,720
Tell her she may enter.

162
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,288
I'm Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung
from the Office of Royal Decrees,

163
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,874
Your Highness.

164
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,861
I am Prince Dowon,

165
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,155
Yi Rim.

166
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,077
I was hoping you weren't.

167
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,369
Eleven o'clock.

168
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,039
Female historian Goo Hae-ryung
arrives at Nokseodang.

169
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,802
-Prince Dowon is reading--
-Yesterday,

170
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,973
I had to leave in a hurry
due to exceptional circumstances.

171
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,564
Your Highness.

172
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,654
I am here

173
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,492
as a historian.

174
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,223
As per your instructions,

175
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,934
we sent the governor of Jinju,
Kim Seung-hak, as a relieving officer

176
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,186
to help those who are suffering

177
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,271
from the aftermath of the flood.

178
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,150
However, if His Majesty finds out...

179
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,496
I will take care of it,
so please do not be concerned.

180
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,417
However, the floods and droughts
that occur every year

181
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,962
are causing the people
a great deal of concern.

182
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,089
I'd like you to try
to come up with a solution.

183
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:57,302
Is there a book that explains the sewage
and reservoir systems in detail?

184
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,360
Gosh, why are you being like this?

185
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,571
I told you that I have to go inside!

186
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,489
Let me in!

187
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,412
Okay, fine.

188
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,917
Since you are trying to intimidate me
by outnumbering me, I shall fight

189
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,878
with my unbending spirit.

190
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,046
I won't budge an inch

191
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,550
until you let me in.

192
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,737
I feel like more people inside the palace
are watching than ever before.

193
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,032
Showing your face is not an issue,

194
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,826
as long as the expressions on it
cannot be read.

195
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,331
So? How did it go?

196
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,918
-We were too late.
-Then...

197
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,837
did all of them die?

198
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,132
We treated one person who was still alive,

199
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,136
but that person died the next day
at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

200
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:29,061
It must've been
the Second State Councillor.

201
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,773
All of this was Min Ik-pyeong's doing.

202
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,944
Books have been banned,

203
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,698
and bookstores have disappeared.

204
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,845
HIS HIGHNESS TURNED ANOTHER PAGE

205
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,315
HIS HIGHNESS TURNED ANOTHER PAGE

206
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,110
What are you writing?

207
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,947
All I'm doing is reading this book.

208
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,324
I want to know what you are writing.

209
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,203
I cannot tell you what I am recording,
Your Highness.

210
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm not asking you to...

211
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,586
Are you writing down what I just said?

212
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,340
Are you really doing it?

213
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,467
Are you... Have you been...

214
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,574
The fake Maehwa.

215
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
The impersonator, who scammed

216
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,288
innocent people
out of their hard-earned money.

217
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,916
On top of that,
she disobeyed a royal command

218
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,918
and even trespassed on Nokseodang.

219
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,462
Goo Hae-ryung is a criminal,

220
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,590
I have something to say to her.

221
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,221
Are you going to write that down too?

222
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,915
Hey.

223
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,375
I will take my leave, Your Highness.

224
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,467
Stop with the act.

225
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,677
I told you
that I need to have a word with you.

226
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,018
You had many opportunities.

227
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,647
What do you want to say to me now,
after all this time?

228
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,903
Or is there something
you'd like to hear from me?

229
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,368
I did not know that you were a prince.
"I apologize. Please spare my life."

230
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,327
Something like that?"

231
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,913
Then I will apologize.

232
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,419
What in the world must I do
to be forgiven by Prince Dowon this time?

233
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,717
I wanted to thank you.

234
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,388
I do not know

235
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,391
why you were there last night,

236
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,853
but thank you for not walking away.

237
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,981
I appreciated your concern.

238
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,901
That was what I wanted to say.

239
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:13,994
And since I deceived you first,
you do not need to ask for my forgiveness.

240
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,208
I hope that there will be
no more ill-fated encounters between us.

241
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,210
You may leave.

242
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,756
I thought...

243
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,722
we could be friends.

244
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,644
We started off on the wrong foot,

245
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,565
and we weren't friendly with each other.

246
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,320
But I thought it'd be nice to have someone

247
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,157
I could be comfortable around

248
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,828
in this huge palace.

249
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,626
Why...

250
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,546
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

251
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,609
NOKSEODANG

252
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,977
I was concerned when I heard
that a stranger would be joining us,

253
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,522
but I hear the Second State Councillor
is very fond of you.

254
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,901
He's just comfortable with me
because he's known me for a long time.

255
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,280
That fussy man, Lord Min,
is keeping you by his side.

256
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,364
There must be a reason.

257
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,116
-Did you look into it?
-Yes, sir.

258
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,536
There is no court lady
who stepped out of the palace today,

259
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,539
but the records show
that a eunuch's wife visited earlier.

260
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,999
A "eunuch's wife"?

261
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,834
"Park, the wife of Eunuch Heo Sam-bo."

262
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,544
That's what it said.

263
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,678
Hey!

264
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,057
Is this supposed to be a joke?

265
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,851
This is practically useless!

266
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,480
Even dogs would've done
a better job than this.

267
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,731
A much better job!

268
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,734
Sir, we did our best to--

269
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,277
You didn't even do any work.

270
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,530
Rather, it sounds like you've
befriended Her Majesty.

271
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,907
Gosh, I'm speechless.

272
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,118
My gosh. The pastries were delicious,
"and I was elated

273
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,829
to find out that
we are both from the same town.""

274
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,712
Are you girls getting a kick out of this?
Are you?

275
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,549
Apprentice Oh, the court lady
kicked you out before you could

276
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,301
even enter the Queen Dowager's chamber.

277
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,638
And Apprentice Goo, you filled 30 pages

278
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,307
with this one sentence,
"His Highness turned another page."

279
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,976
Do you really all
find this situation amusing?

280
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,898
You too. You're a tiny bit better
than these girls here,

281
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,859
but you still have a long way to go
if you want to become a true historian.

282
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,905
You have been here
for just over a month now.

283
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,324
What exactly have you learned here?

284
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,410
Have you been busy chatting
and admiring the palace?

285
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,956
When I was a rookie,
by the end of my first month...

286
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,087
I can't stand the sight of you,
so get out.

287
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,424
I said, get out!

288
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,268
Train them properly, will you?

289
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,190
This is a lonely fight.

290
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,943
A lonely one.

291
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,161
Am I the only true historian
in the entire land of Joseon?

292
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,206
How could he be so harsh on us?

293
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,958
He said dogs would outdo us.

294
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,086
We were sent to the chambers
without any preparation.

295
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,505
He should be grateful
that we didn't faint.

296
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,050
Come on. It sounds like
you had a great time.

297
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,180
You had tea with the Queen
and even got to chat with her.

298
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,059
Do you know how worried I was though?

299
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,355
I was so worried that something bad
might happen to Apprentice Goo,

300
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,566
who volunteered to go to Nokseodang
instead of me.

301
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,819
So? Did you check?

302
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,281
-Sorry?
-You volunteered to go to Nokseodang,

303
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,867
saying that you had to check something.

304
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,995
I bet you wanted to find out if the Prince
really is a monster or a lunatic,

305
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,830
as the rumors say.

306
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,416
-Oh, that was--
-Seeing how Apprentice Goo

307
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,503
managed to return unscathed,
he probably isn't a lunatic.

308
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,506
I knew it. He has boils all over his body!

309
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,216
How bad is it?

310
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,677
Does Prince Dowon
look absolutely horrific?

311
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,851
No.

312
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,937
He doesn't look horrific at all.

313
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,236
I'm being serious. He is very tall,

314
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,904
and his skin is as white as snow.

315
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,448
He has nice eyes too.

316
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,659
He's very handsome.

317
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,663
So they were all groundless rumors?

318
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,542
Yes. If you ever hear anyone
speaking ill of Prince Dowon,

319
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,918
tell them that they're wrong.

320
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,045
He does not look horrific,

321
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,713
nor is he a murderous lunatic.

322
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,301
Just tell them
that he is mildly ill-tempered.

323
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,362
I am here as a historian.

324
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,073
Yes, you are a historian.

325
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,783
I know that, obviously.

326
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,330
Your Highness!

327
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,167
Why are you picking that precious flower?

328
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,963
I've never even seen you picking grass.
What's gotten into you?

329
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,507
Are you angry about something?

330
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,261
No, I'm not.
I wish to be alone, so do not come in.

331
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,941
I'm getting this strange feeling
that he may be going through

332
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,485
something that is beyond my grasp.

333
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,613
What could it be?

334
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,099
Are you doing your job properly?

335
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,644
You said you located the bookstore
but have found out nothing.

336
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,439
Only strange rumors about
unknown medical practices are spreading.

337
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,401
I suppose you are getting old too.

338
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,945
You have lost your sharp shrewdness.

339
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,156
All you are doing
is causing unnecessary trouble.

340
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,993
Do you remember, Your Majesty?

341
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,161
Two decades ago,

342
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,540
there was a girl
who studied foreign medicine at Seoraewon.

343
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,043
She was a slave named Mo-hwa.
The deposed king took care of her.

344
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,880
-So?
-I am sure you've heard rumors

345
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,799
about that girl, Your Majesty.

346
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,468
She was known
as an incredibly skilled physician.

347
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,263
She even revived people from
the brink of death using strange methods.

348
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,265
Are you saying that girl...

349
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,893
Are you saying she's alive?

350
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,193
How dare a traitor live
in the country that I rule?

351
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,071
Send out the Ministry
of Military Affairs' soldiers.

352
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,282
Find that witch and bring her to me
even if you have to

353
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,075
search every mountain and river!

354
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,995
Your Majesty, please calm down.

355
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,874
She has shown herself after a long time.

356
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,627
We may never be able to catch her
if we act recklessly and scare her.

357
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,213
Are you saying I should just sit back
and do nothing?

358
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,133
A crane will stand out in a brood of hens,

359
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,303
and an awl inside a pocket
is bound to show.

360
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,265
She may have managed to go into hiding,
but she cannot hide her skills.

361
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,023
-Bring the Chief Royal Secretary.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,579
Your Highness,
the female historian is here.

363
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,632
Tell her she may enter.

364
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,931
I am Apprentice Oh Eun-im from

365
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,225
the Office of Royal Decrees,
Your Highness.

366
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,393
You are...

367
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,737
Your uniform suits you well.

368
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,868
-I am flattered, Your Royal Highness.
-I need to read a book today,

369
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,829
so you may rest comfortably.

370
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,414
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

371
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,122
Right, I heard you went
to Nokseodang yesterday.

372
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,582
I beg your pardon?

373
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,210
Yes, I did.

374
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,298
How did Prince Dowon react?
He must have been surprised and flustered.

375
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,177
His Highness

376
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,221
read books all day long.

377
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,017
He is not used to interacting with people.

378
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,438
Please be a little understanding,
even if he offends any of you.

379
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,107
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

380
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,237
I've got an idea.

381
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,532
Follow me.

382
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,927
Bull's-eye!

383
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,141
It's been a while
since I last shot arrows. It feels good.

384
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,976
It's quite stress-relieving.

385
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,689
I'm happy to hear
that you're enjoying yourself.

386
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,084
Your Highness,
the female historians are watching.

387
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,170
I hope you hit the bull's-eye.

388
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,326
What on earth is wrong
with this bow today?

389
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,880
You see, archery
is an extremely challenging sport.

390
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,175
Your arms. You must have strong arms,
and you need to keep your balance.

391
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,887
Anyway, the fact that the arrow
went that far is still pretty good...

392
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,940
If you think my skills are that funny,

393
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,736
come and try it for yourself.

394
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,865
They say you see the bull but not the ram.

395
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,451
You need to try it yourself
to see how hard it really is.

396
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,079
If you manage to hit the bull's-eye
even just once,

397
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,665
I shall grant you the right

398
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,585
to laugh at me as much as you like.

399
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,839
Don't say no to this.

400
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,718
Being a woman, when else
will you get to hold a bow if not now?

401
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,513
Plus, he is offering to grant you
the right to laugh at a prince

402
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,057
as much as you want.

403
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,986
How many arrows will you need?

404
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,323
A hundred? A thousand?

405
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,035
You told me to hit the bull's-eye
just once.

406
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,996
I only need one.

407
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,055
-Bull's-eye!
-My gosh!

408
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,441
You are quite the archer.
Who taught you how to shoot arrows?

409
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,361
I spent my childhood days in Yanjing.

410
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,696
And it was

411
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,491
a hobby of mine.

412
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,246
I see. Prince Dowon had no clue
and handed you an arrow.

413
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,708
But I guess he was just
trying to teach a fish how to swim.

414
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,003
Aren't you here as a historian?

415
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,301
It seems like you've forgotten
what your duty is.

416
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,640
I apologize, Your Highness.

417
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,145
I will make sure I don't leave out
a single word you just said.

418
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,738
That wasn't for the records.

419
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,157
Don't write...

420
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,325
Apprentice Goo.

421
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,286
Don't be so harsh on her.

422
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,787
You picked her.

423
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,206
You should be proud
that she's working hard.

424
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,387
That was so embarrassing.

425
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,308
You had 20 arrows,
and none of them hit the target.

426
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,603
I thought you'd hit the target
at least once.

427
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,022
You were neither good nor lucky.

428
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,068
I'm only saying this because I'm worried.

429
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,989
That disastrous incident
would've gotten recorded.

430
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,951
You'll be humiliated
for thousands of years

431
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,912
as the prince
who lost to a female historian.

432
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,456
What do you want me to do?
They already recorded everything.

433
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,961
We shouldn't have hired
female historians in the first place.

434
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,506
Darn it.

435
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,385
Your Highness, Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung
is here to see you.

436
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,437
Do you still have more left to write?

437
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,690
I'm here to ask you something.

438
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,863
Earlier, I heard His Royal Highness say

439
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,740
that you picked me.

440
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,825
What did that mean?

441
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,287
I don't know.

442
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,499
Because if I had the power
to choose female historians,

443
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,252
you wouldn't be here right now.

444
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,008
Right. Okay.

445
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,720
I'm sorry to have bothered you
with an unnecessary question.

446
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,431
I'll be off, then.

447
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,643
Right.

448
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,813
I do remember saying this
to His Royal Highness.

449
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,567
I told him that if he sees a strange woman
who is as stubborn as an ox

450
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,361
and is as courageous as a general,

451
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,448
then he should hire her as a historian.

452
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,118
Then

453
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,706
are you saying I was picked as a female
historian because I'm as stubborn as an ox

454
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,208
and as courageous as a general?

455
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,377
There's no need to thank me.

456
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,976
He's just as strange.

457
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,397
He can't even shoot arrows properly.

458
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,986
Do you want to die?

459
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,739
Is your job a joke to you?

460
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,580
My ears are ringing.

461
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,291
We'll still understand him
even if he speaks quietly.

462
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,002
Does he really
have to yell at us like that?

463
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,837
Just leave him be.

464
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,256
If he ends up losing his voice,

465
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,425
that'll be his loss, not mine.

466
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,637
My gosh, why are you so happy today?

467
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,598
It's only natural that I'm happy.
Today's the big day.

468
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,183
What day?

469
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,645
Today's our first payday.

470
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,732
-Is it our payday already?
-Yes.

471
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,860
To be honest,
I was this close to quitting this job

472
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,238
even just three days ago.

473
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,366
But as our payday approached,
I couldn't care less

474
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,327
even if Officer Yang yelled at us.

475
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,787
And I felt the same way

476
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:11,041
whenever Officer An kept teasing us.

477
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,002
I guess this is why they say
that empathy and generosity--

478
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,796
Come from their pockets.

479
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,216
My mother says that every day.

480
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,759
You know what?

481
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,053
Let's all go to my house
after we collect our stipend.

482
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,848
Let's have some cold noodles
in radish water kimchi broth.

483
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,517
And how about a drink?

484
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,486
GWANGHEUNGCHANG

485
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,655
Lee Il-seong from the Medical Office.

486
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,323
-Over here.
-Hold it properly.

487
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,290
Jeong Hong-geun from the Medical Office.

488
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,583
Over here!

489
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,294
Kwon In-son from the Medical Office.

490
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,256
Doesn't something
seem to be a little strange?

491
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,551
Those clerks.

492
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,304
He's calling out names
of government officials,

493
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,264
but the clerks are collecting the stipend.

494
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,559
That's because they were told to do so

495
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,311
by the government officials.

496
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,065
-I feel so bad for the clerks.
-Kim Chan from the Medical Office.

497
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,152
Hey, Officer Park!

498
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,488
It's me!

499
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,824
Jeong Man-sik
from the Office of Interpreters.

500
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,660
Please get out of the way. Come on, hurry.

501
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,164
Have you been well?

502
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,958
-I'm always grateful.
-Goodness, don't mention it.

503
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,002
Let's have a drink together soon.

504
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,253
Take it safely.

505
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,217
Goodbye.

506
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,969
What was that all about?

507
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,764
That's it for this month.

508
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,599
Come back next month.

509
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,267
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

510
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,561
-This is so tiring. Let's go.
-Unbelievable.

511
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,355
I knew this would happen.

512
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,690
-I don't know how many months it's been.
-Tell me about it.

513
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,444
My lord, what do you mean?

514
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,279
What do you mean, this is it?

515
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,073
You didn't even call our names.

516
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,742
Female historians?

517
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,911
I didn't know you got paid too.

518
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,956
We're not crazy.
Why would we work for free?

519
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,416
Could you please take a look?

520
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,460
-We're supposed to--
-There's no need.

521
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,712
The warehouse is empty.
We have no more rice.

522
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,089
What can I do?

523
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,426
If you're that upset,
come here early next month.

524
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,470
You're so lazy.

525
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,476
Am I the only one who doesn't get this?

526
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,397
How... How can the warehouse be empty?

527
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,737
My stipend...

528
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,535
My precious stipend...

529
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,422
Let's have a drink.

530
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,425
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

531
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,926
I heard it's a lean year.

532
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,512
I guess the government office
isn't doing well either.

533
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,807
Still, they promised to give us everything
next month.

534
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,933
So cheer up.

535
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,520
She's right. We don't even
get paid much anyway.

536
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,481
So it won't matter
even if we get it a month later.

537
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,359
It does matter to me.

538
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,863
I'm pretty sure the loan sharks

539
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,365
are waiting in front of my house

540
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,659
to get their hands on my stipend.

541
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,202
You took out a loan?

542
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,873
My father is a senior eighth-rank
civil officer.

543
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,251
How would he have been able to afford
all the food and drinks

544
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,462
for the hazing ritual we had?

545
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,006
There was no choice but to borrow money.

546
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,091
Come on!

547
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:53,221
Ma'am, please give us
the most expensive alcohol you have

548
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,266
along with an endless amount of food.

549
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,934
-Yes!
-That's right!

550
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,436
Officer Hwang.

551
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,565
Hey.

552
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,194
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

553
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,453
I don't know
if it's because Chi-guk's buying today,

554
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,456
but the alcohol tastes great
and I feel so happy.

555
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,377
But why is Officer Kim
suddenly buying everyone drinks?

556
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,212
Did you get in trouble for something?

557
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,173
What are you saying
on a good day like this?

558
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,009
Today is a historic day.
Chi-guk finally received

559
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,263
his full stipend for the first time ever.

560
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:40,352
Then are you saying
that he was never paid properly until now?

561
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,436
That's right.

562
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,273
The first couple of months,
they only gave me a portion

563
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,733
because I was apparently late.

564
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,821
The next couple of months,
it was because of the lean year.

565
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:55,242
And after that, it was because
there was a cold wave.

566
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,162
That's why I told you
to hire an assistant clerk

567
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,373
and become close to the officials
at Gwangheungchang.

568
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,624
I told you that so many times.

569
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,168
Assistant clerks?

570
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,714
Are you talking about the clerks
who were at Gwangheungchang?

571
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,800
Yes, they're actually clerks
from the Ministry of Personnel.

572
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,970
But it's so hard for everyone to get paid,
so the officials ask them for help.

573
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,180
Help, my foot.

574
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,266
You have no idea how much money they get

575
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,560
in return for helping them
collect their stipend.

576
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,770
The same goes for the officials
at Gwangheungchang.

577
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,440
You need to bribe them
in order to get your pay

578
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,816
before the warehouse gets empty.

579
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,360
They're a bunch of thieves.

580
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,696
That's so absurd.

581
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,365
You need to bribe them to get paid?

582
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,951
Then the ones who are too poor
to bribe them

583
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,202
will continue to be poor,

584
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,122
and the ones who are wealthy enough
will continue to be wealthy.

585
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,667
That's the custom around here,
and customs are

586
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,836
much scarier than the law.

587
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,881
You ladies should also look
for assistant clerks

588
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,883
instead of wasting your time.

589
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:58,847
That's enough. Let's not get depressed
by talking about money.

590
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,891
Let's just get drunk
and forget about it all.

591
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,517
Here. Cheers!

592
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,150
I wrote down everything I saw and heard
in the Inner Palace.

593
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,070
There's not much that will be of help,

594
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,988
but it won't hurt to know.

595
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,367
I'll be the one to judge
whether something will be of help or not.

596
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,746
You just need to continue
to be a loyal historian.

597
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,268
What brings you here?

598
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,187
You know that my father

599
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,023
is good friends
with the Second State Councillor.

600
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,735
I'm here to relay an urgent message
from my father.

601
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,200
Your family has dozens of servants.

602
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,077
But he decided to send you instead

603
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,621
at this late hour?

604
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,957
It's sometimes hard to trust servants

605
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,502
when it comes to discussing
political affairs.

606
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,132
As you said, it's late.

607
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,010
I should go now.

608
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,308
Be careful.

609
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:17,152
A historian should not build
personal relationships with others.

610
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,906
It could end up backfiring on you
in the future.

611
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,576
I'll keep that in mind.

612
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,880
My gosh, look who's here again.

613
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,008
-Does he have nothing better to do?
-Who is Goo Hae-ryung?

614
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,762
Who is Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung?

615
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,476
Is it you?

616
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,187
Are you the lunatic
who wrote this petition?

617
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,397
Sir, wait.

618
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,108
I don't know what this is about,
but please calm down.

619
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,862
Read that petition,
and you'll find out why I'm so angry.

620
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,621
"Please ban the recruitment
of assistant clerks

621
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,665
to prevent stipend corruption.

622
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,709
And make the officials
come to Gwangheungchang themselves..."

623
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,465
Do you think you're
the only smart one around here?

624
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,134
Do you think
we're staying quiet about this

625
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,260
because we're idiots?

626
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,472
Even the Three Offices
can't do anything about this issue

627
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,810
because it involves thousands of people.
So who are you to cause a fuss?

628
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,187
Who do you think you are
to raise this issue?

629
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,856
If His Majesty had found out about this,

630
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,527
everyone here, including you,
would've gotten fired.

631
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,820
Do you know that?

632
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,906
You already crossed the line
by entering the palace

633
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,241
when you're nothing but a woman.

634
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,662
So the least you can do
is try your best not to cause trouble.

635
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,830
Sir!

636
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,542
Be careful with your words.

637
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,839
I'm already trying my best

638
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,425
not to curse at her right now.

639
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,176
Do you have a problem with that?

640
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,056
You guys are just a bunch
of weak-hearted fools.

641
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,936
No wonder she was
able to do something like this.

642
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,027
The Office of Royal Decrees
is a complete mess.

643
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,870
Clerk Goo.

644
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,998
-What is your--
-I don't mind getting scolded.

645
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,837
But I'd at least like to know
what I did wrong.

646
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,255
What?

647
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,759
I can't believe you have the guts
to say that right now.

648
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,220
I noticed an irregularity,
so I only asked that things be set right.

649
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,057
I only did what I should have done,

650
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,391
so why...

651
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,273
Why do I need to be reprimanded for that?

652
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,276
I cannot understand it.

653
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,406
-Hae-ryung...
-Sir, it's time to enter a meeting.

654
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,117
-You can deal with her later.
-Do you only care about yourself?

655
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,577
Sir, come on.

656
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,954
-Who do you think you are?
-Sir.

657
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,124
You should be trying to learn!
But all you think about is yourself!

658
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,626
Why isn't she coming?

659
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,120
-Sam-bo.
-Yes?

660
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,914
Isn't it way past noon?

661
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,501
Yes, I think it's a little over 1 p.m.

662
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,084
Your Highness,
the female historian is here.

663
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,339
Tell her she may enter.

664
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,728
Something fun must've happened

665
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,564
seeing that you came late.

666
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,874
Did something happen?

667
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,379
No.

668
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,389
You can cry.

669
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,607
No one comes here.

670
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,360
So no one will hear you.

671
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:00,823
So...

672
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,035
you can cry out loud.

673
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,664
You can cry all you want.

674
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,670
It's okay.

675
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,861
