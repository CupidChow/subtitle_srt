1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,254
Officer Min, please.

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,465
Are you addicted to being
the center of attention?

3
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,801
Come on. Let's please let this one slide.

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,137
Don't get involved and wreak havoc.

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,930
Get ready.

6
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,893
-I need you to go to Daejojeon.
-Hey!

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,312
I beg your pardon? Daejojeon?

8
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,231
That is His Majesty's bedchamber.

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,902
Officer Min. The female historians
have never entered the bedchamber yet.

10
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,403
First we should ask permission--

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,573
Since when did we, historians,
need permission to do our job?

12
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,580
The Second State Councilor is there.

13
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,873
You must enter the chamber

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,374
no matter what.

15
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,736
So?

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,405
Why did you request
an audience with me this time?

17
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,617
Any progress in tracking down

18
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,369
the remnants of Seoraewon?

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,330
Since disappearing in Pyongan Province,

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,833
they've completely fallen off
the face of the earth.

21
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,127
However,

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,380
I have found out
who the mastermind behind them is.

23
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,925
What did you say?

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,095
Tell me at once.

25
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,307
Who has the audacity
to gather traitors in my kingdom?

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,227
The Queen Dowager.

27
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,815
We have confirmed that
her chief lady-in-waiting met with Mo-hwa.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,025
Apparently, they exchanged letters.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
Your speculations proved to be right
after all.

30
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,495
The Queen Dowager and her retinue

31
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,207
have been in league
with the remnants of Seoraewon.

32
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,387
Due to Her Majesty's connection
to this matter,

33
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,931
I cannot make any rash decisions.

34
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,059
I will follow your orders, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,068
EPISODE 11

36
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,931
Hello, sir.

37
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,350
I am a female historian.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,897
I'm here to record His Majesty's meeting.
Please let His Majesty know.

39
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,982
How dare a female historian
set foot in here.

40
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,235
Leave at once!

41
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,530
I heard the Second State Councilor
is having an audience with the King.

42
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,283
-I must enter the chamber--
-What are you waiting for?

43
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,706
What are you doing?

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,876
Let go. I'm a historian too.

45
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,087
What is all this ruckus about?

46
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,131
It is nothing, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,425
Drag her out at once.

48
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,390
Okay, I understand.
I said I can walk out of here on my own.

49
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,016
Let go. Gosh!

50
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,201
You must enter the chamber

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,412
no matter what.

52
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,915
Then I will proceed accordingly,
Your Majesty.

53
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,342
Your Majesty.

54
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,094
I'd like to ask you a question.

55
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,183
Is there anything about Prince Dowon

56
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,685
that you are hiding from me?

57
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,945
Who's there?

58
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,960
You brazen wench!
I clearly told you to leave.

59
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,838
How dare you eavesdrop
on His Majesty's conversation?

60
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,632
Step aside.

61
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,304
What did you write down?

62
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,061
I asked you what you wrote down!

63
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,734
This is a sachaek.

64
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,571
Therefore I cannot tell you.

65
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,449
What did you say?

66
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,124
Officer Min!

67
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,750
Officer Min!

68
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,296
Officer Min!

69
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,297
Officer Min!

70
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,382
Officer Min!

71
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,593
Officer Min.

72
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,336
What did you just say?

73
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,173
Who is where?

74
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
What happened?

75
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,051
Apprentice Goo.

76
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,888
She was dragged
to the Royal Investigation Bureau

77
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,723
for disobeying a royal order.

78
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,187
What do you mean? Why did they take her?

79
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,981
What kind of royal order did she disobey?
How? And why?

80
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,525
I don't know yet.

81
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,154
Your Highness, please calm down first.

82
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,366
I will go and find out the details.

83
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,618
No.

84
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,994
My royal robe.

85
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,622
-Bring my royal robe.
-Your royal robe?

86
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,249
Yes. I shall go have an audience
with Father. Hurry.

87
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
Please don't get yourself in trouble.

88
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,003
What will you do
if you get to see His Majesty?

89
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,546
I must try everything in my power.

90
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

91
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,091
You must stay out of this.

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,261
You have no grounds for getting involved.

93
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,596
I have no grounds?

94
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,768
I can tell him that...

95
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,775
Tell him what? "I am head over heels
for that lady, Father.

96
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,401
Please forgive her just this once."

97
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
Will you whine like that?

98
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,032
Your Highness, you are well aware
of how His Majesty is.

99
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,326
When someone gets
on the wrong side of him,

100
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,453
he never changes
his opinion of that person

101
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,165
no matter how hard you try
to shed light on the truth.

102
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,875
Even if you step in now,

103
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,045
it won't help Apprentice Goo at all.

104
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,548
It'll further ignite His Majesty's wrath,
if anything.

105
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,886
Please don't worry too much.

106
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,557
Apprentice Goo is a historian, after all.
Nothing will happen to her.

107
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,059
She will be released soon. I'm sure of it.

108
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,650
Can you guarantee it, though?

109
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,318
If anything bad...

110
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,863
happens to Hae-ryung...

111
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,415
The criminal, Goo Hae-ryung,
shall drink the poison!

112
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,801
Poison isn't enough.

113
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,637
She should be beheaded.

114
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,417
Let's just get it over with, okay?

115
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,803
I can't just wait here.

116
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,055
I shall get on my knees and beg.

117
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,016
You can't go, Your Highness.

118
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,435
You absolutely mustn't get involved,
Your Highness.

119
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,896
If you keep this up,
you'll get in trouble too.

120
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,398
Let go before I get mad at you.

121
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,274
I ought to go and save Hae-ryung.

122
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,194
Gosh, please worry about yourself first.

123
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,821
Why are you just standing there?

124
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,157
Hurry up and nail down the doors
or something.

125
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

126
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,203
Your Highness, you cannot leave.

127
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,872
-I won't go easy on you anymore.
-No, please!

128
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,208
Your Highness!

129
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,636
Lord Min.

130
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,140
I heard the Office of Royal Decrees'
female historian

131
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,726
was put behind bars
at the Royal Investigation Bureau today.

132
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,645
That is correct.

133
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,649
She wasn't even willing to back down
in front of His Majesty.

134
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,571
She reminded me of you
when you were young.

135
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,991
She is a lot like you.

136
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,617
What a daring young lady.

137
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,579
You knew?

138
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,002
It is all my fault
for I coddled her as I felt bad

139
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,045
that she had to grow up
without her parents.

140
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,131
Please help her.

141
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,551
She is my only family.

142
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,846
She was caught while eavesdropping
on the King's conversation.

143
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
There is nothing I can do to help her.

144
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,229
All we can do is wait for His Majesty
to change his mind.

145
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,107
Lord Min.

146
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,082
You fool!

147
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,335
I clearly told you to just let it slide.

148
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,087
Why must you be so bullheaded
for your own good

149
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,633
and cause all this trouble?
Shouldn't you know better by now?

150
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,677
It is not Officer Min's fault, sir.

151
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,432
It is our duty as historians to sit in
on the King's meetings with his subjects.

152
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,435
That's not what she did.
She practically spied on the King.

153
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,146
She's one fearless girl.

154
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,107
How dare she eavesdrop at Daejojeon?

155
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,568
Then what about the historian,
Min In-saeng?

156
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,447
The historian during the reign
of King Taejong.

157
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,783
He eavesdropped through the doors

158
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,118
and even from behind the folding screens.

159
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,121
That's why he's still highly respected
as a historian to this day.

160
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,040
Why are you calling Apprentice Goo a spy?

161
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:57,044
I completely agree. Apprentice Goo
simply did her duty as a historian.

162
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,171
His Majesty should have allowed her

163
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,382
to sit in on the meeting
in the first place.

164
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,467
Hey, Clerk Heo. You and your mouth...

165
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,971
-Watch your mouth!
-Everything I said is true.

166
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,641
I really don't think
we should let this slide.

167
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,311
All of you shouldn't let
your guard down either.

168
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,729
The first time is the hardest.

169
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,191
Who knows which one of us
will get arrested next time?

170
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,192
Hey!

171
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,195
Even so, we're legitimate historians.

172
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,572
We are too.

173
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,575
We passed the civil service exam as well.

174
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,451
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
So what's our plan?

176
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,457
Will we protest against the King
and demand her release?

177
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,919
It is time we filed an ultimate petition.

178
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,213
I will go bring an axe!

179
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,590
Hey, calm down.

180
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,216
He always talks about an axe...

181
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,509
Stay put.

182
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,389
In any case, it is true that
Apprentice Goo disobeyed the royal order.

183
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,226
If we side with her now,
it won't end with just her being exiled.

184
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,439
All of us could be reprimanded, sir.

185
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,774
But we can't just sit back
and do nothing about it.

186
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,319
A historian was arrested,
which is unprecedented.

187
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,877
I've made my decision.

188
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,632
What? After much consideration,

189
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,719
did you decide to make Officer Min
make the final decision once again?

190
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,678
No, you punk!

191
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
As historians, we ought to...

192
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,962
Why aren't the historians here yet?

193
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,049
Chancellor,
go bring the historians at once.

194
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,717
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,184
Chancellor.

196
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,813
Lads, what are you doing here?

197
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,440
You've kept His Majesty waiting
for 15 minutes. Come in.

198
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,653
We'd like to go in, of course.
But what should we do?

199
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,906
We've completely run out of paper
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

200
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,575
We cannot go in empty-handed.

201
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,827
We're truly embarrassed.

202
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,538
You've run out of paper?
Don't give me such nonsense.

203
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,961
Okay, fine. Then why didn't you contact
the Procurement Office

204
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,547
and put in a request for more paper
before you ran out?

205
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,592
Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung is in charge
of managing the inventory of our supplies.

206
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,885
But...

207
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,389
because of what happened to her...

208
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,850
Please wait just a little longer.

209
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,769
Our clerks are washing ink
out of our daily records at Segeomjeong.

210
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,854
They're removing ink?

211
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,356
Then will you not be joining us
until they remove ink

212
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,733
and dry all the paper?

213
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:12,031
It is a sunny day,
so I believe two hours will be enough.

214
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,700
It might take about four hours.

215
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,077
My goodness.

216
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,337
Officer Yang!

217
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,722
Officer Yang.

218
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,976
Hey, have you finished
the records of royal orders?

219
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,688
Can you hurry up?
The Chief Royal Secretary keeps asking.

220
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,107
-What?
-The records of royal orders.

221
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,444
Oh, right. You said it was urgent.

222
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,237
It's very urgent. Hurry up already.

223
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,240
What are you doing? Get moving!

224
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,993
-Shall I get started?
-Yes, please. You're so good at your job.

225
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,453
Come on. Hurry.

226
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,497
Gosh.

227
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,585
-Hey, what's wrong?
-My stomach...

228
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,754
-Are you all right? Hold on.
-My stomach. Gosh!

229
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,716
I must go relieve myself. Don't wait.

230
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,552
All right, hurry up.

231
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,056
-Hey. Jeez!
-My gosh, is it coming out...

232
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,349
-Gosh, quick!
-No, it's not.

233
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,101
I'm really about to...

234
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,060
No!

235
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,104
Officer Son! Jeez.

236
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,817
Officer Son! How come
you haven't sent the document yet?

237
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,902
It has already been four hours.

238
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,613
What? Hey, what's wrong?

239
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,739
Officer Son.

240
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,534
-Get back here.
-We're talking to you here.

241
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,576
Officer Son!

242
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,876
I have to relieve myself.

243
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,842
My stomach is upset. I should...

244
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,468
Are you going to the privy?

245
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,721
Wait, lads.

246
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,725
Lads, where are you going?

247
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,727
What on earth is happening?

248
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,521
Goodness.

249
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,064
Officer Min,

250
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,233
did they all eat something weird?

251
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,193
What is the matter with them?

252
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,073
You, too?

253
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,534
What's going on?

254
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
Number two?

255
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,044
Gosh, number two...

256
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,339
Oh, no. I pooped my pants.

257
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,136
Don't wait for me.

258
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,514
First they said they couldn't join us
as they had no paper.

259
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,476
Now, they're saying they can't
complete the records as they're all ill.

260
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,439
How dare they mock the King like this?

261
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,983
Do they think that I am a complete fool?

262
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,362
They are obviously doing this
to protest against me.

263
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,698
No, Your Majesty.
Please don't get the wrong idea.

264
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,783
They're all so young and passionate that--

265
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,743
I see.

266
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,412
You belong to
the Office of Royal Decrees as well.

267
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,208
Will you take responsibility
for their duty dereliction?

268
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,501
I usually work
at the Office of Special Advisors,

269
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,630
so I am not that well acquainted
with the historians.

270
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,966
Those insolent fools.

271
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,763
Come to think of it, historians
are like rogues of the royal court.

272
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,515
They come at me,
saying they must record my flaws,

273
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,268
but they never show their records
to anyone.

274
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,395
Thus, who knows
if what they record is true?

275
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,814
And who will record their flaws?

276
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,277
I shall teach those punks
a serious lesson.

277
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,447
-Chief Royal Secretary.
-Please calm down, Your Majesty.

278
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,158
You are well aware of how historians are.

279
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,701
They even record speech errors

280
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,870
to humiliate all of us
for generations to come.

281
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,831
That is why people say that no king

282
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,626
can win against historians.

283
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,461
Fine.

284
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,340
Then I shall be the first king in history
to win against historians.

285
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,634
-Chief Royal Secretary.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,135
Go to the Office of Royal Decrees.

287
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,513
Yes, Your Majesty.

288
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,758
The Royal Secretariat!
They're on their way here now!

289
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,786
Chief Royal Secretary,
what brings you all the way

290
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,164
to the humble abode
of the Office of Royal Decrees?

291
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,874
I came to take care of something.

292
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,793
Obviously not because I wanted to see you.

293
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,468
Then let's hear it. What is it about

294
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,805
that you had to bring all your minions?

295
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,060
His Majesty has ordered us to inspect
the Office of Royal Decrees.

296
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,278
I need to take the administration record.

297
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
Clear the way.

298
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,866
"The administration record"?

299
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,203
"The administration record"?

300
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,252
Why are you being like this when you're
well aware of how things are done here?

301
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,798
The administration record
is what makes up the annals.

302
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,300
No king in history has read
our administration record,

303
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,135
and it must stay that way.

304
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,013
Please leave now.

305
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,181
Are you saying

306
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,266
you wish to disobey the royal command?

307
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,309
As historians,

308
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,104
our priority is obeying
the law of this country.

309
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,483
Fine. If you won't clear the way,
we will have to force our way in.

310
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,696
All right. Officer Son.

311
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,706
Sir, that's the guy.

312
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,668
The Black Bear of Bukchon.
Back in his Sungkyunkwan days,

313
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,295
he used to smash inkstones
with his bare hands.

314
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,464
It is His Majesty's royal command!

315
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
We must get our hands
on the administration record.

316
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,136
We are historians who preserve history.

317
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,765
Do not back down!

318
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,351
-Let's go!
-Let's barge in!

319
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,779
Hey, Gyeong-muk. Can't you do better?

320
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,460
Good. That jerk. Get him.

321
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,135
You piece of...

322
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,973
Officer Min, did you learn that?

323
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
You, come here!

324
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,439
Officer Son, no!
Don't kill anyone, please.

325
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,940
-Are you all right, sir?
-Get him.

326
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,192
He's the Black Bear.

327
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,943
What are you doing?

328
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,112
Must we really do this...

329
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,281
We must, since it is His Majesty's order.

330
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,074
Here I come.

331
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,707
Hey, Jegal Tak. What do you want?

332
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,459
-I'm sorry, buddy.
-What?

333
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,086
Gosh, Si-haeng. Are you all right?

334
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,880
Let's just buy some time, okay?

335
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,383
Hey, a man should never...

336
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,303
Now, you're doomed for life!

337
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,393
I am a historian of Joseon!

338
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,034
Are they...

339
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,827
Are they our superiors?

340
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,456
You're so dead, you prick.

341
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,084
-Gosh.
-Get lost.

342
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,930
Go. Just go.

343
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,723
I said, just go! Hey!

344
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,641
It hurts!

345
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,311
-I said, it hurts!
-Show them, female historians!

346
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,730
Fight!

347
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,065
-It hurts!
-Keep it up!

348
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,150
-You little...
-Let go!

349
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,279
Hey, I'm sorry. I said, I'm sorry!

350
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,492
Do not tell anyone that I'm here!

351
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,369
Keep going!

352
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,580
Keep it up!

353
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,016
Goo Hae-ryung.

354
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,183
Your Highness.

355
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,605
Are you all right? No injuries?

356
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,772
Yes.

357
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,608
I'm all right.

358
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,446
You should leave, though.

359
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,782
If anyone sees you,
you'll get in trouble as well.

360
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,701
Don't worry about me.

361
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,286
I bet you haven't eaten anything.

362
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,708
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought all sorts of things.

363
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,211
I brought this so that
you can sleep comfortably.

364
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:11,963
And...

365
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,384
Give this to the guard
when you get thirsty.

366
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,802
He will bring you some water.

367
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,305
What else did I bring?

368
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,641
Why are you laughing?

369
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,854
You are probably
the only prince in the world

370
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,898
looking after an imprisoned woman.

371
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,777
And you are the only woman
who makes a prince do these things.

372
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,786
Don't worry too much.
Nothing bad will happen to you.

373
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,540
I'd like to think so...

374
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,836
but I should prepare myself mentally.

375
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,260
After all, I ended up behind bars here
for disobeying a royal command.

376
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,680
I cannot expect to be released unpunished.

377
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,685
Whether it's being kicked out of
the palace or banishment from Hanyang,

378
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,603
I will be punished.

379
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,313
Then I will go with you.

380
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,442
If you are dismissed,

381
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,445
I'll leave with you
and be your next-door neighbor.

382
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,114
If you are sent into exile,

383
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,075
I, too, will leave Hanyang and follow you.

384
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,994
And if...

385
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,913
This would be the worst-case scenario,

386
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,457
but if the punishment
is even worse than that...

387
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,548
I will run away with you.

388
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,848
Do you really mean it?

389
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,225
Yes.

390
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,770
We'll hide somewhere deep in the woods
or in an uninhabited island.

391
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,421
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

392
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,886
I mean, you can write,
but there is nothing else you can do.

393
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,264
I saw that you don't know how to make
a fire, and you can't split firewood.

394
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,516
I'll probably end up doing everything.

395
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,310
I can learn those things--

396
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,730
Gosh, I'll grow old and die
before you can learn all those things.

397
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,315
Forget it.

398
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,526
I'd much rather live all by myself
than live with such a burden.

399
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,196
How dare you call me a burden?

400
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,740
What burden looks
this exquisitely handsome?

401
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,202
Take a good look.
I'm a treasure, not a burden.

402
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,877
Your Highness! Time is up.

403
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,633
What are you doing in there?

404
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,093
Oh, I was just...

405
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,388
I just wanted to see how sturdy these are.

406
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,602
-This is built well.
-Anyway, we should leave at once.

407
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,605
That guard is such a money-grubbing pig.

408
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,025
He'll start counting. He wants one nyang
each time the number goes up.

409
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,485
Hurry, let's go.

410
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,529
My gosh.

411
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,030
Okay.

412
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,615
I'm on my way.

413
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,200
I am.

414
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,437
Your Highness.

415
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,948
Have a safe journey back.

416
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,101
-Come on.
-What do you mean, you can't do it?

417
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,519
Here.

418
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,981
Of course I can do this, you fool.

419
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,882
LOVE

420
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,352
LOVE

421
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,951
Hey, watch it.

422
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,833
I should have thrown him
out of the palace.

423
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,521
Password?

424
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,318
If I can destroy my enemy,
I will even risk my life.

425
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,427
This is all I could get in a hurry.
Eat up.

426
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,428
Great work.

427
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,972
Here.

428
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,487
What about the Royal Secretariat clerks?
Are they still outside?

429
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,280
Yes.

430
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,118
They're roaming about
looking for a chance.

431
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,454
It looks as if they will come in
and take the administration record

432
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,081
as soon as we go home.

433
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,417
Those tenacious jerks.
Let's show them what we're made of.

434
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,504
None of you are going home today.

435
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,132
No, until His Majesty
takes back his order,

436
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,801
we are not taking a step
outside of this room.

437
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,850
Let us die in hunger protecting history,

438
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,562
instead of becoming a coward
who gave up the administration record!

439
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,604
-Yes!
-Yes!

440
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,111
Hey. Gyeong-muk, Hong-ik, and Chi-guk.

441
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,238
Why aren't you answering me?

442
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,198
Aren't you historians?

443
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,576
Of course we're historians.

444
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,743
We are.

445
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,872
But you don't have to go that far.

446
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,208
It's not like His Majesty told us
to rewrite the daily records.

447
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,668
We can just

448
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,963
let them take a peek
at the administration record.

449
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:19,093
And you keep mentioning the law,
but the law can always change

450
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,555
this way or that way.

451
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,642
But if you lose your life once,
you can never get that back.

452
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,562
If you think about it,
my life might be more important

453
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,357
than my pride as a historian.

454
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,194
On top of that, I am

455
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,487
an only son of three generations.

456
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,780
Hey!

457
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,161
All of you.

458
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,665
You're all talking nonsense just because
you have that hole in your face.

459
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,751
Do you...

460
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,088
Do you think I'm doing this
just for the sake of our pride?

461
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,926
Okay. Let's say we let him read
the administration record this once.

462
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,969
You think His Majesty
will read it and say,

463
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,263
"Goodness, you have
such pretty handwriting!"

464
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,681
Would he let it go like that?

465
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,101
No way. He'll ask, "Why did you
write this here? What about this?"

466
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,354
It's the beginning of
never-ending nitpicking.

467
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,564
After he makes
a couple of amendments there,

468
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
he'll move onto the daily records,
then annals.

469
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,237
That's how you end up becoming a puppet
that only humors your superiors!

470
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,532
Hey, do you think historians have always
entered halls freely

471
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,117
and written sachaek at ease?

472
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,370
Ever since the foundation,

473
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,331
it took 100 years
for a historian to sit down.

474
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,709
And it took 300 years for us
to look straight into His Majesty's face.

475
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,754
Our predecessors wrote petitions,

476
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,297
were exiled, and fought hard

477
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,466
to make that happen!

478
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,510
If we...

479
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,180
If we let him read
the administration record...

480
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,479
who knows if it'll take 10 years
or 100 years for that to be corrected?

481
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,826
Hey,

482
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,828
what's wrong?

483
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,749
I'm sorry, Officer Yang.

484
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,546
I know the importance
of the administration record...

485
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,924
but I was too scared.

486
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,097
I missed my wife...

487
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,893
and I wanted to go home.

488
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,897
That's why I said that. I apologize.

489
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,905
Officer Kim.

490
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,247
Hey. You.

491
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,583
Don't cry.

492
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,377
Who said we can't go home?

493
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,630
We will surely walk out of
the Office of Royal Decrees...

494
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,342
and go...

495
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,143
Hwang Jang-gun.

496
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,354
What's with you too?

497
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,861
All of you.

498
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,530
Remember your tears.

499
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,658
The tears that protected history!

500
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,078
Come here.

501
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,373
Come here, my boys.

502
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,874
Cry as much as you want.

503
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,378
The tears that protect history are noble!

504
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,879
Let us protect!

505
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,547
-We'll protect!
-We'll protect!

506
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,219
Cry as much as you want.

507
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,847
-Let us protect!
-It'll be a long night.

508
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,645
-I agree.
-I'm proud of you guys.

509
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,400
Let us protect!

510
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,777
The administration record?

511
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,695
Isn't that something

512
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,573
that the historians made
by gathering all the daily records?

513
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,616
Yes.

514
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,577
His Majesty asked to read
the administration record so he could

515
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,329
inspect the Office of Royal Decrees.

516
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,918
That's quite a reckless move
even for His Majesty himself.

517
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,798
None of the previous kings
asked to read the administration record.

518
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,175
So,

519
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,178
how are the historians reacting to this?

520
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,806
Apparently, they are holding out
with the doors locked.

521
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,767
And people keep sending petitions
regarding the matter.

522
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,644
I see.

523
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,315
It's because they all know
that this is a very serious issue.

524
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,697
This is going to be very interesting.

525
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,285
I can't believe this is happening.

526
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,413
The historians shouldn't be doing this.

527
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,707
-Look at that.
-My goodness.

528
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,585
What should we do?

529
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,088
-My gosh.
-What is going on?

530
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,774
There are more petitions?

531
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,445
Yes, this is about
half of the total amount.

532
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,573
I already received enough in just one day.

533
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,451
Stop bringing them to me.

534
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,245
-There's no point in reading them.
-Your Majesty.

535
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,206
They're all the same.

536
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,124
They're all telling me I made a mistake.

537
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,586
"Don't turn your back on the historians.
Please withdraw your royal order."

538
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,964
Tell them to have a dozen historians

539
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,676
follow them around all day long
and see if they still feel the same way.

540
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,139
So,

541
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,141
how did the morning meeting go?

542
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,061
Were people in support of
the Office of Royal Decrees?

543
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,688
Well, the Crown Prince refused
to hold a meeting

544
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,358
without the presence of a historian.

545
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,026
So they all had to go back.

546
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,278
And it's not just the morning meeting.

547
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,865
The official documents written
by the Six Ministries and Three Offices

548
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,993
need to be confirmed
by the Office of Royal Decrees first.

549
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,662
But they can't do anything

550
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,622
because the historians aren't working.

551
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,959
We're also having trouble
receiving reports from the suburbs.

552
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,585
Are you saying the entire royal court

553
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,629
can't do anything
because of the historians?

554
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,093
Your Majesty!

555
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,803
Your Majesty.

556
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,756
Your Majesty!

557
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,384
Please withdraw your royal order
regarding the inspection

558
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,428
of the administration record!

559
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,389
If you refuse to do so,

560
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,391
you can go ahead

561
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,186
and behead me with this axe.

562
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,855
My gosh, I can't believe
he's crazy enough to risk his life.

563
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,775
Shouldn't we be joining him?

564
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,986
Hey, do you think that axe is a joke?

565
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,322
He's literally risking his life.

566
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:21,659
He's telling His Majesty to kill him
if he's not going to do as he asks.

567
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,504
That's...

568
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,513
My goodness,
I can't believe Officer Min is...

569
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,351
Your Majesty!

570
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,687
If you go against the law

571
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,272
and decide to inspect
the administration record,

572
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,776
it'll forever remain as a flaw to you!

573
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,030
So please withdraw your order!

574
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,705
Officer Min!

575
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,373
What do you think you're doing?

576
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,542
How could you bring an axe
to the royal palace?

577
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,546
Please get up.

578
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,715
This isn't something to be stubborn about.

579
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,091
Do you think

580
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,386
I'm incorrect?

581
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,060
As the Chancellor and historian
of this country,

582
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,896
do you really have nothing against

583
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,399
the inspection
of the administration record?

584
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,195
-I mean, I'm just--
-Get lost immediately!

585
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,545
Just because it was against the law,

586
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,757
historians were free from being restrained
for hundreds of years.

587
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,551
And you're trying to go against me

588
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,636
just because you don't agree
with my order?

589
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,847
That is more of a reason
why we cannot give in.

590
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,309
I'm sorry to say this,

591
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,687
but why do you think the law
and our previous kings

592
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:18,150
decided to protect the historians
for such a long period of time?

593
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,070
It's because they wanted us

594
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,323
to record historical events

595
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,700
without having to succumb to authority.

596
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,702
I never asked you to succumb to authority!

597
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,040
All I want to do is check
if you're doing a proper job!

598
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,084
Is that so revolting and incredulous?

599
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,254
You have no right...

600
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,635
to read and inspect
the administration record!

601
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,138
What?

602
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,728
-My goodness.
-That little...

603
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,234
I have "no right"?

604
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,196
How dare you say that to the King!

605
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,324
How dare you!

606
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,203
-Your Majesty!
-Please calm yourself.

607
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,705
-Your Majesty!
-Let me go!

608
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,250
I will show you what kind of right I have.

609
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,793
-Let go!
-Your Majesty!

610
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,170
-Your Majesty!
-Please calm down.

611
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,893
They're scholars from Sungkyunkwan,
Your Majesty.

612
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,320
Officer Son, isn't that your cousin?

613
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,655
He's the Sungkyunkwan chief.

614
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,033
It's the wailing protest.

615
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,453
WAILING PROTEST: A PROTEST CARRIED OUT
BY THE SCHOLARS OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

616
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,218
The 400-year-old history
of our honorable country

617
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,179
is at risk in the name of inspection.

618
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,266
The future of this country
is dark and gloomy.

619
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,312
How are we going to endure
this sadness and sorrow?

620
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,278
If the King takes the life of a historian
just because he makes him feel uneasy,

621
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,072
our lives as scholars will
equally be considered worthless.

622
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,867
How are we, the scholars of Sungkyunkwan,

623
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,788
supposed to respect our King
in this kind of situation?

624
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,704
I'm sorry to say this, Your Majesty.

625
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,666
But I think it might be best for you
to withdraw your royal order.

626
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,753
I am saying this
for your sake, Your Majesty.

627
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,382
Right now, it's just a couple
of dozen scholars from Sungkyunkwan.

628
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,009
But as time goes by,

629
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,178
more scholars from all over the country
will join the protest.

630
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,015
Then it'll be too late for you
to withdraw--

631
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,641
I don't want to hear it!

632
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,603
You call yourselves my subjects,
but you don't care how I feel.

633
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,480
You just care about saying what's right.

634
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,858
Get out of here!
I want nothing to do with you!

635
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,083
Why aren't you leaving?

636
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,961
Are you also going to disobey my order?

637
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,975
Your Majesty.

638
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,895
Did you forget how this all started?

639
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,858
The female historian got locked up
for secretly eavesdropping

640
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,234
on our private conversation.

641
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,529
If this becomes a bigger issue,

642
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,740
people will start to wonder about

643
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,452
what she heard and wrote that day
rather than what happened to her.

644
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,164
It's not beneficial for you to attract
more attention to this issue.

645
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,917
You should withdraw your order.

646
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,171
But like you said,

647
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,965
I haven't even confirmed
what she wrote and heard

648
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,675
that day.

649
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,798
Officer Yang.

650
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,179
If you're here to convince us,
just know that it's not going to work.

651
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,143
That's enough.

652
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,270
His Majesty has withdrawn his order.

653
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:32,941
Are...

654
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,651
Are you serious?

655
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,944
Yes.

656
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,114
He promised to never meddle
with the administration record.

657
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,992
So you should get up and go back to work.

658
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,371
Is that all?

659
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,169
Did His Majesty

660
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,005
really change his mind that easily?

661
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,283
Ladies.

662
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,744
Apprentice Goo, we won.

663
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,331
His Majesty is going to allow us
to enter all the chambers

664
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,373
with no limits!

665
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,543
-Even Daejojeon?
-Yes, even Daejojeon.

666
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,755
You'll never have to go through
something like this again.

667
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,258
But what happened?

668
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,719
What happened overnight?

669
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,138
You should go home
and get some rest for now.

670
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,266
-Let's go.
-Okay.

671
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,101
Come on.

672
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,983
-My lord.
-My goodness, she's here.

673
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,028
Lady Hae-ryung.

674
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,656
Lady Hae-ryung.

675
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,913
If you ended up dying,
I was going to die as well.

676
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,416
I even looked into a nice spot
for your grave.

677
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,919
A place that gets a lot of sunlight

678
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,296
and where there aren't a lot of animals.

679
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,101
-Jae-gyeong.
-You must be tired.

680
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,186
You should get some rest.

681
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,278
Let's go, Lady Hae-ryung.

682
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,031
You didn't get to eat
a single grain of rice, did you?

683
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,118
Well...

684
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,453
-No.
-No wonder.

685
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,040
Your face is all dry and bony.

686
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,625
You look ghastly.

687
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,463
I'll cook tofu soup, braised tofu,
and tofu pancakes.

688
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,174
I'll cook up a feast.

689
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,512
Forget about what happened
and just start anew as a virtuous subject.

690
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,534
Your Highness.

691
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,079
Something feels very odd.

692
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,500
You chewed on stone earlier
while you were eating rice

693
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,628
but you didn't even get angry about that.

694
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,215
You keep smiling for some unknown reason.

695
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,134
And you look so happy.

696
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,345
Did you get possessed

697
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,389
or bewitched by something?

698
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,810
It's neither.

699
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,021
It's just that

700
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,649
I finally realized how beautiful

701
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,735
this world is.

702
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,658
You may leave if you're done.

703
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,702
I should go to sleep early tonight.

704
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,872
Why? Is tomorrow a special day?

705
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,582
Hae-ryung got released.

706
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,001
It's been a while since she came by,

707
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,753
so I should get a good night's sleep

708
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,505
and greet her with a glowing face.

709
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,177
Your face is already glowing like the sun.

710
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,179
You can't possibly glow any brighter.

711
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,933
Are you trying to become the moon
or something?

712
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,476
"The moon"?

713
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,146
That doesn't sound so bad.

714
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:45,652
I'll be able to look down
and see my love every night.

715
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,666
What a bunch of nonsense.

716
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,172
Your Highness, you should hurry up
and go to bed.

717
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,092
Get a good night's sleep
so you can wake up feeling refreshed.

718
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,011
Girls, come on out.

719
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,556
His Highness wishes to go to bed!

720
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,892
Why is it so hot?

721
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,557
Jae-gyeong.

722
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,561
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

723
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,982
I must've gotten used to prison already.

724
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,485
I can't seem to sleep at home.

725
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,825
Gosh.

726
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,828
It was just a joke.
Don't pull a straight face like that.

727
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,291
It's not too late.

728
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,627
You should quit.

729
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,797
No one can be safe in the royal palace.

730
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,258
People act polite on the outside,

731
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,842
and they talk about being moral,

732
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,179
but anyone in the palace
can suddenly become...

733
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,517
as cruel as an animal if they need to be.

734
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,068
I should never have let you enter
such a dangerous place.

735
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,076
I won't force you to get married anymore.

736
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,704
I'll let you do anything you want.

737
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,582
So please quit working there.

738
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,293
It's not just because of what happened.

739
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,795
-If anyone finds out about you--
-No.

740
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,005
Hae-ryung!

741
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,634
All my life,

742
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,887
I was jealous of you.

743
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,352
You always had somewhere to go
every morning.

744
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,689
And you had a job to do
once you left the house.

745
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:14,110
It may not be anything grand,
but you still had a life.

746
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,030
Meanwhile...

747
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,451
I could only see the world
through the books I read.

748
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,916
I wanted to live like you

749
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,003
for at least just one day.

750
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,800
I wanted to become someone useful
even for a short moment.

751
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,887
I've been longing that for so long.

752
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,265
And now, I'm living...

753
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,393
the kind of life I longed for.

754
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,523
If my longing

755
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,026
wreaks havoc in any kind of way...

756
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:01,324
I will endure it wholeheartedly
and just think of it as a consequence.

757
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,521
Your Highness! Wake up!

758
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,897
Your Highness!

759
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,528
Your Highness!

760
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,426
Who's here at this hour?

761
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,443
Who's here at this hour?

762
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,987
This is His Majesty's command!

763
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,892
I'm sorry for making you
go through all this trouble.

764
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,394
I must've been really disobedient
in my past life.

765
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,771
I want to push through.

766
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,939
He's quite intelligent and ambitious.

767
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,900
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

768
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,402
I grew up outside of the palace.

769
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,113
I know I'm no longer able
to spend time like I used to.

770
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,406
I come out once in a while

771
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,409
so that I won't ever forget
who I used to be.

772
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,828
I haven't seen you
ever since you ran away that day.

773
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:11,871
You disloyal punk.

774
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,123
When will he get a chance to drink
with a nobleman?

775
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,667
If you can't tell me
what you wrote that day...

776
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,503
I'll grant whatever wish you have!

777
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,506
Are you really willing to grant me

778
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,007
whatever I ask of you?
