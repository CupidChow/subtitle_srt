00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,048
EPISODE 12

2
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,606
Why is His Majesty doing this?

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,483
Why must I visit the Queen Dowager?

4
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,277
He has never summoned me
in the past 20 years.

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,029
How would I know?

6
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,657
I still can't believe
that this is truly happening.

7
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,368
Please get dressed, Your Highness.
We don't have much time.

8
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,082
Goo Hae-ryung!

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,336
-What brings you here?
-I'm going to the Queen Dowager's chamber.

10
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,714
You too, Your Highness?

11
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,594
Why are you standing here? You must hurry!

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,688
Gosh, why won't you listen to me?

13
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,609
Your Highness, let's hurry.
This way, please.

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,078
Go stand over there.

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,549
What has gotten into him?

16
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,094
Even on the holidays,
all he does is send a eunuch.

17
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,138
Why pay me a visit out of the blue?

18
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,099
He is already waiting outside,
Your Majesty.

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
Take your time.

20
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,943
Getting soaked with the early morning dew

21
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,195
wouldn't be a bad experience for him.

22
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,764
I apologize for keeping you waiting
for so long.

23
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,433
You may enter now.

24
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,193
Go on. Follow them inside.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,904
Pardon?

26
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,950
Go in.

27
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,945
Your Majesty, have you been doing well?

28
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,112
Yes.

29
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,449
You have been well and healthy too, right?

30
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,494
Yes. It is all thanks to you.

31
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,288
Be seated.

32
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,174
I hope I didn't disturb your sleep

33
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,635
for I came to see you
at such an early hour.

34
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,929
No, not at all.

35
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,016
I am just touched by your visit.

36
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,476
I hardly ever see you,

37
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,021
even on my birthdays.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,901
I apologize. The governmental affairs
have been keeping me so busy

39
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,112
that I have not been able
to visit you often.

40
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,571
I understand.

41
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,491
Even though the Crown Prince

42
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,702
has been looking after
such matters as a regent,

43
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786
I am sure

44
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,415
you have had a fair share of matters
to attend to.

45
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,128
As it seems that I have hurt
your feelings very much,

46
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,464
I feel horrible for having been
inattentive to you over the years.

47
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,635
From now on,
I will be sure to visit you often.

48
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,264
I would like to visit you
around this time every morning

49
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,640
and pay my respects.

50
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,268
What do you think?

51
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,522
It is your duty as a son
to visit your mother often

52
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,982
and pay your respects.

53
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,861
Sure, I won't reject your proposition.

54
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,198
I shall expect you to visit my chamber
every morning at this time.

55
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,761
Your Majesty,
your breakfast should be ready now.

56
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,388
-Let us head to your bedchamber.
-No.

57
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,768
I plan to join the royal lecture today.
Get ready immediately.

58
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,521
There is over an hour left until 7 a.m.

59
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,899
I am sure the lecturers
have not even arrived yet.

60
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,859
Then send someone to rush them.

61
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,319
They teach the Crown Prince.

62
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,446
They should arrive early and practice!

63
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,740
Yes. I will follow your instructions,
Your Majesty.

64
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,705
Do not think of these lectures as hassles.
You must study diligently.

65
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,041
When I was your age,
I always skipped breakfast

66
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,834
and went for my morning lectures.

67
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes, I will remember that.

68
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,089
Right.

69
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,342
Does the Second State Councilor come too?

70
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,968
Yes, he joins me every day.

71
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,431
Dowon.

72
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,606
There are six behaviors

73
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,651
in which a king should never engage.

74
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,695
The first one is deriving joy
out of winning against others.

75
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,782
The second, being embarrassed
by hearing about one's shortcomings.

76
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,118
The third is giving excuses
using one's eloquence.

77
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,079
The fourth is boasting
about one's brightness.

78
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,581
The fifth is threatening others
using one's authority.

79
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,252
The sixth is
being cantankerous or stubborn.

80
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,213
These are called Gunsangyukpye,
the six behaviors

81
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,173
from which all kings must abstain.

82
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,050
GUNSANGYUKPYE: SIX CONDEMNED BEHAVIORS

83
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,385
Hearing about this

84
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,138
is making me reflect on my past.

85
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,307
Then let me ask all of you.

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,145
Which one of the six condemned behaviors
have I engaged in?

87
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,864
You may be honest with me.

88
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,409
Only then can I reflect on my past conduct
and make sure I won't do it again.

89
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,495
Your Majesty,
such a question is unnecessary.

90
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,789
I have never seen you engaging

91
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,167
in any of the six condemned behaviors

92
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,294
in the past 20 years of serving you.

93
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,630
That is correct. There is no need
for you to reflect on anything.

94
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,305
Dowon, do you think so too?

95
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,143
Pardon?

96
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
I...

97
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,041
Your Majesty, I think

98
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,878
you have engaged in three
of the six condemned behaviors.

99
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,887
Did you say "three"?

100
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
Three of the six condemned behaviors?

101
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,725
Yes.

102
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,978
You have engaged
in three of the six behaviors.

103
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,402
Do I seem that unqualified as a king
in your eyes?

104
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,114
The six condemned behaviors

105
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,158
are not about finding faults.

106
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,745
They are simply behaviors
from which a sage king should refrain.

107
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,420
Then explain why you believe
that I have engaged in three of them.

108
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,673
First...

109
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,176
you intimidated the historians

110
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,720
to stop them from entering your chamber.

111
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,849
Thus, you demonstrated
that you derive joy from others' defeat.

112
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,727
Second...

113
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,107
you ordered the Royal Secretariat
to inspect the historians.

114
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,486
Hence, you abused your power
to keep your subjects under your control.

115
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,197
And third...

116
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,830
After imprisoning a female historian,

117
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,124
enraged by her listening in
on your conversation,

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,419
you summoned her at 5 a.m.
to give her a hard time.

119
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,088
Therefore, you have demonstrated

120
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,924
that you are unforgiving and fussy.

121
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,034
I see. You are very honest.
You take after me.

122
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,370
You certainly deserve to be called
a prince of this kingdom.

123
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,751
Yes, Your Majesty.
He is very straightforward and outspoken.

124
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,878
He surely takes after you.

125
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,613
Your Highness!

126
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,491
Have you lost your mind?

127
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,827
How dare you say such a thing!

128
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,996
The six condemned behaviors?
Three of the six?

129
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,832
But it is true that Father is at fault.

130
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,128
Besides, he was the one who told me
that I could be honest with him.

131
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,590
Do you think he really meant it?

132
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,134
"Say I've never engaged in any of them

133
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,637
no matter how many times I ask."
That's what he meant.

134
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,515
How could you be so clueless?

135
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,642
In any case, he complimented me, so--

136
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,269
Obviously, that was not a compliment.

137
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,732
"I am letting it slide for now,
but I will teach you a lesson someday."

138
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,071
That is what he said
with his glaring eyes!

139
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,534
Don't you know that His Majesty
holds a grudge for a long time?

140
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,245
Poor me.

141
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,665
What did I do in my past life
to end up becoming a eunuch...

142
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,001
Gosh, poor me. I pity myself so much.

143
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,461
Sam-bo.

144
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,967
So when I was saying
those things earlier...

145
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,637
how did Hae-ryung react?

146
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,099
Did she seem moved by what I said?

147
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,600
Did she look smitten?

148
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,270
Tell me.

149
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,481
What? Why...

150
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,568
Why won't you tell me? How did she react?

151
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,361
Sam-bo!

152
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,614
Your Majesty, please be understanding
about what Dowon said earlier.

153
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,326
It was his first time joining the lecture
and meeting the officials.

154
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,412
He made a mistake
because he was too eager.

155
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,164
Don't try to protect him.

156
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,791
He probably thought
it was the perfect chance to bash me.

157
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,960
-How has he been suppressing it?
-Your Majesty.

158
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,796
I am not saying what he did is wrong.

159
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,217
I thought he was just a fool who could do
nothing but write romance novels.

160
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,887
However, he's quite intelligent
and ambitious.

161
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,016
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

162
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,396
I will look after the affairs
of the state. Get some rest.

163
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,274
And make sure you visit
the Crown Princess.

164
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,984
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,792
Then I shall return
to the Office of Royal Decrees.

166
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,168
Follow me.

167
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,004
You are to accompany me
in all of my meetings starting today.

168
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,844
What does that mean?

169
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,599
What does His Majesty mean by that?

170
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,309
When did I agree to that?

171
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,312
-When?
-Just follow me.

172
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,322
He just had a spoonful of rice with beans.

173
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,411
Now, he is having a spoonful of dongchimi.

174
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,332
Seasoned bellflower roots...

175
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,168
No, he is having
seasoned mung bean sprouts.

176
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,091
Another spoonful of rice with beans.

177
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,970
Now, he is eating
grilled bonnet bellflower roots.

178
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,138
He is having seasoned mung bean sprouts.

179
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,432
Now, he is eating seasoned spinach.

180
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
He just picked up some bracken fern...

181
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
No, he's having some boiled pork.

182
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,816
Now, a spoonful of dongchimi.

183
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,529
He is eating some egg now.

184
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,782
Take it to the Palace Medical Bureau.

185
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,035
PALACE MEDICAL BUREAU: OVERSAW
MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION

186
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,470
Oh, it's that way.

187
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,765
Apprentice Goo!

188
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,110
-Good morning, Apprentice Goo.
-Good morning, my foot.

189
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,156
Is this what you meant
by me entering the Inner Palace?

190
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,451
Following His Majesty everywhere
all day long? And all by myself?

191
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,329
So how was it?

192
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,249
Isn't it amazing to see His Majesty
as soon as you wake up?

193
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,002
Do you know what I had to do just now?

194
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,296
I was summoned when I was barely awake,

195
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,090
and I even had to clean up his feces!

196
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,720
What on earth happened?

197
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,763
Look at that ill-bred wench.

198
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,390
Hey.

199
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,059
Why are you complaining about it
to Officer Yang?

200
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,730
His Majesty is being unreasonably stubborn
to win against us historians.

201
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,108
He wants to win against the historians?

202
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,444
Some stuff happened
while you were imprisoned.

203
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,282
Shall I call it a subtle power struggle
between His Majesty and us?

204
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,743
There was nothing "subtle" about it.

205
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,662
Nosebleeds, pulling hair out,
and all that crying and yelling.

206
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,206
It was like a gang fight.

207
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,668
That is why you got
on the wrong side of His Majesty.

208
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,838
Many are filing petitions
about our jobs being obstructed,

209
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,590
but he can't pressure historians.

210
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,092
Since you are a mere apprentice
and an easy target,

211
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,804
he is deliberately giving you a hard time
to teach you a lesson.

212
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,059
But if you really think about it,
it is actually a great opportunity.

213
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,810
You get to watch and record

214
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,271
His Majesty's daily activities
all day long.

215
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,191
You see, not everyone gets
such a special opportunity.

216
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,194
How could you call it an opportunity?
It is torture.

217
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,113
Torture can be beneficial for you.

218
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,284
My uncle's hair started growing again
after he was flogged ten times.

219
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,620
He wore a topknot for the first time
in ten years.

220
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,373
Anyway, Clerk Goo,
the pride of the Office of Royal Decrees

221
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,085
and the future of you female historians
depend on this war.

222
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,004
Even if you end up fainting
while on the job,

223
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,255
you will never back down.

224
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,134
Until the day His Majesty surrenders,
keep going at full strength!

225
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,179
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

226
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,972
Everyone, louder. Keep going!

227
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,099
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

228
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,810
Let's shout together!

229
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,279
He mistreated his faithful wife
because of his mistress?

230
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,697
What a scoundrel.

231
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,284
Kim Yong-seon shall be flogged ten times
for harming public morals,

232
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,912
and let his wife divorce him
if she wishes to.

233
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,084
Not that one.

235
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,211
Read that one first.

236
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,712
Yes, Your Majesty.

237
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,513
Park Bong-jo,
the governor of Gyeonggi Province,

238
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,432
submitted this to inform us of
the loopholes in the relief system.

239
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,350
Let's see. Unroll it.

240
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,822
"I, Park Bong-jo,
have given 25,200 seok of grain as alms

241
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,993
to 557,852 people in Gyeonggi Province

242
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,787
for the past four months.

243
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,747
The details per region are as follows.

244
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,422
Gwangju, 580 seok.

245
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,383
Yeoju, 896 seok.

246
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,427
Paju, 642 seok.

247
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,763
Suwon, 1,234 seok.

248
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,640
Bupyeong, 561 seok.

249
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,393
Incheon, 949 seok.

250
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,896
Namyang, 727 seok."

251
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,856
This is going to take forever.

252
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,358
-Read faster.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,531
"Pungdeok, 675 seok. Tongjin, 556 seok.

254
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,826
Goyang, 722 seok. Ansan, 853 seok.

255
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,911
Gimpo, 691 seok.

256
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,871
-Sir.
-Gwacheon, 776 seok.

257
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,166
Yongin, 845 seok. Yangju, 787 seok.

258
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,503
-Juksan, 699 seok. Anseong, 728 seok."
-Sir.

259
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,010
I lost you there.

260
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,972
How much grain did Paju get?
It was 600 something.

261
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,933
Paju? Paju...

262
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,353
Paju...

263
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,397
Oh, Paju is here. It's 642 seok.

264
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,528
-"Icheon, 866 seok."
-Sorry to interrupt, sir.

265
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,114
What now?

266
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,868
I actually couldn't write anything down
after Suwon.

267
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,085
Don't miss anything this time.

268
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,004
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,678
"Suwon, 1,234 seok.

270
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,888
Bupyeong, 561 seok."

271
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,143
Your Royal Highness.

272
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,774
I won't be at Dongungjeon today.
You should leave.

273
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,653
Are you leaving
for an undercover inspection?

274
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,340
Sir.

275
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,969
Sir, come and have a look.
We sell many great things.

276
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,638
Ladies love the things that we sell.

277
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,265
-Is that so?
-Come have a look.

278
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,642
-Let's see what you have.
-What about this hairpin?

279
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,407
All right.

280
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,723
This is not easy. Why don't you try?

281
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,080
All right.

282
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,415
Here.

283
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,210
-One.
-Thank you.

284
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,087
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

285
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,630
-Thank you.
-No problem.

286
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,006
-Thank you.
-All right.

287
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,996
Why are you staring at me like that?

288
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,665
Because I'm not used to this.

289
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,670
This is my first time seeing you smile.

290
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,093
Are you that excited about
stepping out of the palace?

291
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,513
If I say that I am...

292
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,726
will you write that the Crown Prince
neglects his work for outings like this?

293
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,526
I do not plan to write anything
about today.

294
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,908
Look around.

295
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,244
Here,

296
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,329
no one looks at me.

297
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,542
Hence, I do not have to worry about things

298
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,669
like dignity or political factions here.

299
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,672
And no one calls me "Crown Prince",
which frightens me sometimes.

300
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,010
I am just a passerby
who is walking through the crowd.

301
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,305
One clad in expensive clothes.

302
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,729
I grew up outside of the palace.

303
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,483
There was a time when I was a naive boy
running through the woods and fields.

304
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,193
Back then, I wanted to be...

305
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,654
a general who fights on battlefields.

306
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,990
Just for one reason.

307
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,076
I wanted a big, black horse.

308
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,334
I know I'm no longer able
to spend time like I used to.

309
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,085
But every time I leave the palace,

310
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,129
I can catch faint glimpses
of those moments.

311
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,590
So I use an undercover inspection
as an excuse

312
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,300
to come out once in a while

313
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,177
so that I won't ever forget

314
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,554
who I used to be.

315
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,289
Excuse me. We'd like to pay.

316
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,588
-How much...
-Two nyang, please.

317
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,926
Here you go.

318
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:09,859
Oh, wait.

319
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,955
What is this, Your Royal Highness?

320
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,542
I bought it from that woman earlier.

321
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,669
I felt bad about not buying anything.

322
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,840
What's wrong?

323
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,925
Is this gift too humble for your liking?

324
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,431
Why aren't you asking?

325
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,935
When I said I'd tag along,

326
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,605
you could have definitely told me
not to come.

327
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,190
But you let me follow you.

328
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,068
Wasn't it because you wanted
to ask me something?

329
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,366
"What did Apprentice Goo hear and record

330
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,327
that His Majesty got so angry?"

331
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,496
Isn't that what you want to know?

332
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,478
You should go home.

333
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,513
Are you exhausted?

334
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,186
You're still here.

335
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,899
Here. I made a list of all the petitions
for tomorrow

336
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,485
and everyone who will be visiting
to pay their respects.

337
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,117
I hope it helps at least a little.

338
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,162
This will be tremendously helpful.

339
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,166
Thank you. You're the best, Officer Min.

340
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,740
You hold your brush too tightly.

341
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,367
Writing fast isn't the only skill

342
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,578
historians need.

343
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,457
Relax your hand and use your arm.

344
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,918
You're not inscribing the words.

345
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,212
It has to flow seamlessly.

346
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,589
Learn to write like that.

347
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,676
You'll have to hold your brush more often
from now on.

348
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,262
"From now on"?

349
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,974
Do you think

350
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,978
that I have a promising future
as a historian?

351
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,193
I've already been put behind bars once

352
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,570
even though I only joined
the royal court recently.

353
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,449
Don't you think I'll probably be exiled

354
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,785
to somewhere far like Jeju-do
in about six months?

355
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,745
I will never let...

356
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,082
something like that happen again.

357
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
Just like how you filed
the ultimate petition this time?

358
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,968
I heard about it.

359
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,096
Thank you.

360
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,729
Oh, I can do it.

361
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,281
I'm sorry...

362
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,243
for making you go through
all this trouble.

363
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,914
If you tell me you wish to give up...

364
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,334
I'll understand.

365
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,920
No one will resent you.

366
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,968
I must've been really disobedient
in my past life.

367
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,262
Hearing you say that

368
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,098
makes me more determined.
I want to push through.

369
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,309
Apprentice Goo.

370
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,811
You don't have to apologize.

371
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,898
The Office of Royal Decrees
is not the reason

372
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,150
why His Majesty is so mean to me.

373
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,949
His Majesty might think
I'm a powerless weakling,

374
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,161
but I'm confident I won't lose
as I am strong physically and mentally.

375
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,914
He can bully me all he wants.

376
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,168
Well...

377
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,255
That is one insolent remark.

378
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,216
Didn't you know? This is my specialty.

379
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,928
Being rude,

380
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,888
doing things I'm told not to do,

381
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,307
and paying someone back twice as much
when I suffer.

382
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,811
And you're proud of that?

383
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,939
Yes.

384
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,154
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

385
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,204
Your Highness, you must go to bed.

386
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,873
If you read books
until this late at night,

387
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,875
Eunuch Heo will scold us later.

388
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,835
If he scolds you,

389
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,045
I will scold him too.

390
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,798
And

391
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,634
shouldn't you two be helping me?

392
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,555
If I say smart things
during the royal lecture,

393
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,557
His Majesty will begin to adore me.

394
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,436
And one day, he will give me permission
to live outside the palace.

395
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,815
Then I can marry Hae-ryung

396
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,275
and live happily ever after...

397
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,620
Anyway, I need to continue to study

398
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,332
for both of you and me
to stop living in confinement

399
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,334
in this Nokseodang.

400
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,712
So stop bothering me.

401
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,260
Then you have to scold
Eunuch Heo tomorrow, okay?

402
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,652
I'm not surprised about
His Majesty's whimsical nature,

403
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,446
but this is unexpected.

404
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,784
He never even gave Dowon a good teacher
until this day,

405
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,288
but he suddenly took him
to the royal lecture himself?

406
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,664
That's not all.

407
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,207
Although His Highness

408
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,127
frankly pointed out His Majesty's fault,

409
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,629
he did not scold him
but gave him a huge compliment.

410
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,925
Was the Second State Councilor there too?

411
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,969
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,106
Your Majesty,
it's time for you to wake up.

413
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,548
Your Highness.

414
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,225
The way of a king is
founded upon one's studies.

415
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,894
However, it also depends on the power

416
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,938
that assists him by his side.

417
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,816
During Emperor Renzong's reign
in Song Dynasty, Du Yan...

418
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,073
During Emperor Renzong's reign
in Song Dynasty,

419
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,574
Du Yan returned an order

420
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,535
from the palace dozens of times.

421
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,251
Emperor Renzong said to Ouyang Xiu,

422
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,920
"I had to stop many times to this day

423
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,715
because of Du Yan's rejection!"

424
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,110
Your Majesty.

425
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,371
I...

426
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,250
I was not asleep.

427
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,335
I just had my eyes closed.

428
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,092
Chancellor, continue.

429
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,138
Yes, Your Majesty.
An excellent subordinate like Du Yan

430
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,599
has the ability to stop the King

431
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,226
before they begin
to go down the wrong way.

432
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,899
Your Majesty. It's 4 a.m.

433
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,740
Your Majesty,
the female historian is already here.

434
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,123
Does that girl ever sleep?

435
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,130
They are here to pay their respects.

436
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,967
OFFICIALS PAY RESPECTS TO THE KING
BEFORE THEY DEPART TO THEIR POSTS

437
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,601
Next.

438
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,395
This time, they are here to thank you.

439
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,440
FIRST-TIME OFFICERS THANK THE KING
BEFORE THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENT

440
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,596
How long will this go on?

441
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,767
Can you give me a break for 15 minutes?
Just 15 minutes!

442
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,491
Did every single officer in this country
come here this morning?

443
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,327
Why won't they stop coming?

444
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,788
We recently had personnel changes.

445
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,457
Shall I ask the Medical Office
for some tonic?

446
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,835
Drinking tonic won't make me younger.

447
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,088
If I had been ten years younger,

448
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,007
I wouldn't have to go through this.

449
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,678
This won't do.

450
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,764
I have to put an end to this.

451
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,395
Sparrow.

452
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,356
Sparrow!

453
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,453
Sparrow.

454
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
Will you keep calling me Sparrow?

455
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,933
Why not? It's cute. Sparrow.

456
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,853
It's small, homely, and plump.

457
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,024
I don't look plump at all.

458
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,735
I was born stylish and elegant...

459
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,284
You haven't had breakfast, have you?
You had to come in early.

460
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,579
I'll leave some food under this wall.

461
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,581
Come and eat some when you can.

462
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,460
Thank you.

463
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,091
Apprentice Goo!

464
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,310
Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

465
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,985
Where were you? Hurry up.

466
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,386
Come here and sit down.

467
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,067
Aren't you tired of this?

468
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,698
You're having a drink with the King.

469
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,200
I want you to behave with me

470
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,995
as a subject, not a historian.

471
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,498
-But--
-What's wrong?

472
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,959
Were you taught that a historian
isn't a subject?

473
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,840
Go ahead and drink.

474
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,180
Drink that,

475
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,557
and let us forget about our duties
for now.

476
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,894
Pardon?

477
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,242
Your Majesty.

478
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,870
Never decline when I pour you a drink.

479
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,538
The thing is...

480
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,875
my tolerance for alcohol is very high.

481
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,462
If you're trying to get me drunk...

482
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,548
it'll be useless.

483
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,431
Then how can I get you to talk?

484
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,600
You stayed quiet in prison,

485
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,894
when I made you work
for three days straight,

486
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,437
And even when I made you drink.

487
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,690
Do you have no shame?
Or are you just dull-witted?

488
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,401
Do you really not know how bothered I am

489
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,279
-about what you did that day?
-I do know, Your Majesty.

490
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,617
Then why are you trying to win a fight
against the King?

491
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,953
This isn't about winning or losing.

492
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,289
It's about whether or not

493
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,124
I keep my duty as a historian.

494
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,793
Don't give me that lame excuse.

495
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,755
Do you think historians are people
who get protected by the deities?

496
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,008
Back when a war broke out,

497
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,596
there were historians who ran away
just so they could spare their lives.

498
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,265
Yes, I know.

499
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,685
Thus, they got dismissed
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

500
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,354
And they're remembered as historians

501
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,772
who abandoned their duties.

502
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,817
That's not all. During the days
of King Myeongjong,

503
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,610
one historian even succumbed to power

504
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,237
instead of sticking to his duty.

505
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,157
In return for exposing the contents
of the sachaek,

506
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,285
he got to live his life in luxury.

507
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,538
However, he made innocent people die.

508
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,250
And this is what his fellow historians
wrote about him.

509
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,545
"He's wicked, evil, menacing,

510
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,839
violent, greedy, arrogant,

511
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,341
obscene, and biased."

512
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,303
How is it that you're talking back
to every word I say?

513
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,473
Fine.

514
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,603
If you can't tell me
what you wrote that day,

515
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,064
you don't need to tell me.
I won't ask you about it anymore.

516
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,441
Instead...

517
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,736
get rid of it without questioning me.

518
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,614
Burn it or soak it in water.

519
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,365
You wrote it in secret,

520
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,534
so I want you to erase it
in secret as well.

521
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,663
I promise I won't tell anyone
until the day I die.

522
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,127
Or I'll grant you whatever wish you have!

523
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,254
If you want wealth, I'll give you that.

524
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,672
If you want a husband,

525
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,841
I'll find you the best man
you could marry.

526
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,680
Are you trying

527
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,059
to make me die of anger?

528
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,151
Are you really...

529
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,987
willing to grant me...

530
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,573
whatever I ask of you?

531
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,921
-Officer Yang.
-What?

532
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,715
I received a letter
from the Royal Secretariat.

533
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,633
And?

534
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,802
The thing is,

535
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,639
this was given to us
from His Majesty himself.

536
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,266
"His Majesty"?

537
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,401
He wrote us something?

538
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,985
What is it about?

539
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,197
I was too scared to read it,
so I haven't opened it yet.

540
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,829
If, by any chance,

541
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,997
we're all getting fired,

542
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,209
I'm going to curse you forever...

543
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,337
Why would you say that?

544
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,981
"I’ve failed to acknowledge
the importance of the situation

545
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,567
and persecuted the Office of Royal Decrees

546
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,361
which is surely an act of abuse
as the King,

547
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,363
and I’m embarrassed by my actions.

548
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:46,452
However, the historians did not succumb
to my royal order

549
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,371
and kept their sense of duty.

550
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,624
So I could not help but admire
their strong will."

551
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,501
"Therefore, from now on,

552
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,796
I shall allow the historians
to enter the chambers

553
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,798
without having to seek
my royal permission,

554
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,259
and whoever tries to stop them

555
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,554
will have to go through

556
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,807
a strict interrogation carried out by me."

557
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,103
Hae-ryung, that psycho.

558
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,647
What did she do?

559
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,076
Thank you, Your Majesty!

560
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,899
Apprentice Goo!

561
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,824
Clerk Goo!

562
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,659
-Clerk Goo!
-Clerk Goo!

563
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,369
-Clerk Goo!
-Clerk Goo!

564
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,454
-Clerk Goo!
-Clerk Goo!

565
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,456
-Clerk Goo!
-Clerk Goo!

566
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,960
-Clerk Goo!
-Clerk Goo!

567
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,927
That cunning brat.

568
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,639
Are you really willing to grant me...

569
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,350
whatever I ask of you?

570
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,477
Yes, you can ask for anything.

571
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,356
I'll give you anything you want
except for my royal throne.

572
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,618
I cannot

573
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,663
get rid of what I wrote that day.

574
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,003
And that's because
I never actually wrote anything.

575
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,591
It's true that I tried to eavesdrop,

576
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,093
but I failed to hear anything.

577
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,928
And that's why

578
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,306
I couldn't write anything.

579
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,641
But...

580
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,643
But you had the sachaek...

581
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,897
Even if I couldn't write anything,
I should always have it with me.

582
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,693
How dare you?

583
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,530
Are you saying you made a fool out of me
with that empty sachaek?

584
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,994
You are unbelievable.

585
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,749
So tell me something.
How did it feel to make fun of the King?

586
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,543
Did you have fun

587
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,087
seeing how desperate I was?

588
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,047
No.

589
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,469
I was able to see
what a great King you actually are.

590
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,306
What?

591
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,977
A great historian is someone
who doesn't fear the King,

592
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,521
and a great King is someone
who fears historians.

593
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,523
From what I saw,

594
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,735
you feared a female historian
who's still only an apprentice,

595
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,446
listened to the voices of scholars,

596
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,698
and withdrew your wrongful royal order.

597
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,993
And instead of using your power
to threaten me,

598
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:20,415
you tried to communicate with me
so you could change my mind,

599
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,335
which was very admirable.

600
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,299
And I'm going to record
that admirable side of you...

601
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,344
in this sachaek.

602
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,725
So, Your Majesty,

603
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,728
please do not hate the historians.

604
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,359
A historian isn't someone
who only write your flaws.

605
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,322
The reason historians always try
to remain by your side

606
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,492
isn't just to keep an eye on you
by recording your every move,

607
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,787
but it's also to record
your admirable words and behaviors

608
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,999
so the next generation
can read and learn from it.

609
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,961
In the end, historians are also

610
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,672
your people

611
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,133
and subjects.

612
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
I ask you...

613
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,272
not to distance yourself
from the historians anymore.

614
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,316
This is

615
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,069
my one and only wish.

616
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,883
She is one interesting person.

617
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,314
He says

618
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,816
he's going to come here.

619
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,361
Let's get ready. I need to go to Uiju.

620
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,030
Yes, my lady.

621
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,203
Cheers.

622
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,038
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

623
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,050
It's good.

624
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,895
Clerk Goo, let me be honest.
From the moment I met you,

625
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:52,317
I instantly knew
that you'd do amazing things.

626
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,443
You remember, right?

627
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,905
When His Royal Highness asked them
to find a way to stop the solar eclipse,

628
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,075
she wrote that not even Zhuge Liang
has the ability

629
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,452
to stop the solar eclipse.

630
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,122
That is exactly
what a true historian should do.

631
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,998
We must write the truth!

632
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,878
What are you talking about?
You bullied her so much.

633
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,297
You should've been nice
from the beginning.

634
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,009
Come on. People show love
in different kinds of ways.

635
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,471
Love can be soft and tender,
but it can also be

636
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,223
strict and sensitive.

637
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:27,185
Anyway, keep in mind that I made you
become who you are today.

638
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,312
-You have to be good to me, okay?
-Okay.

639
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,565
Okay. I'm really proud of you.

640
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,775
-She left the palace early today...
-I made you.

641
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,944
...just so she could drink
with those punks?

642
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,283
What are you looking at?

643
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,828
Officer Yang!

644
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,955
Look who's here.

645
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,040
What? Clerk Yi.

646
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,877
I haven't seen you
ever since you ran away that day.

647
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,921
-You disloyal punk.
-Come here and sit down.

648
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,799
He still helped us out that day.
He deserves to get a drink.

649
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,551
That makes sense.

650
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,011
Okay, then.

651
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,267
-There are empty seats over there.
-I'd like a drink.

652
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,062
Okay, sure. This is how generous we are.

653
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,523
We're offering a drink
to a guy who ran away.

654
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,491
How does it taste?

655
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,411
It's my special way of mixing drinks.

656
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,331
It totally burns your throat, doesn't it?

657
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,957
Drink up.

658
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
-Make him drink amply.
-Okay.

659
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,672
Did you drink a lot?

660
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,678
Why are you here?

661
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,222
I was passing by.

662
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,142
Three cups of that is enough
to end your life.

663
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,228
I'll drink yours from now on.

664
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,022
I can't let you do that.

665
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:58,109
By the way, Clerk Yi.
Where did you get that nice outfit?

666
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,988
Did you recently get married
to a woman from a rich family?

667
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,991
No, that's not it.

668
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,827
Our family's pretty wealthy.

669
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,581
Hey, how wealthy
can a middle-class family be?

670
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,583
His family probably just got lucky.

671
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,211
Clerk Yi, let me pour you a drink as well.

672
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:19,965
Here.

673
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,810
-My goodness.
-He drinks so well.

674
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,645
Here.

675
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,356
My goodness, why won't you
let him take a break?

676
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,566
-This isn't a hazing ritual.
-What do you mean?

677
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,694
When will he get to drink with a nobleman?

678
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,779
He should be honored. Right, Clerk Yi?

679
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,908
-It sure is an honor.
-There you go.

680
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,993
Drink up.

681
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,962
It's really not good to drink so much
on an empty stomach.

682
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,090
There's no time to eat.

683
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,301
-My gosh.
-There's no time.

684
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,552
Here.

685
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,804
Chief State Councilor.

686
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,472
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

687
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,194
Have you gone blind?
How is that the Chief State Councilor?

688
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,905
Really? He really looked similar.

689
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,076
My goodness.

690
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,163
My gosh, you finished your drink already?

691
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,332
People who didn't study at Sungkyunkwan

692
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,958
are known to have no patience.

693
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,917
Here.

694
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,047
Hello, Third State Councilor.

695
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,049
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

696
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,140
Do you want to die? He's not...

697
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,561
You really scare me sometimes.

698
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,480
Go ahead and drink it all.

699
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,023
You should've asked for some.

700
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,151
Look at her. She's beyond imagination.

701
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,737
-Let's sit down.
-My gosh.

702
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,698
Okay, then.

703
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,911
Now that we've had enough alcohol

704
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,662
and food,

705
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,374
don't you think there should be something

706
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,335
to heighten this exciting and happy mood?

707
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,836
-Son Gil-seung!
-Son Gil-seung!

708
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,381
-Son Gil-seung!
-Son Gil-seung!

709
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,257
-Son Gil-seung!
-Son Gil-seung!

710
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,177
-Son Gil-seung!
-Why are you making me sing?

711
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,470
Son Gil-seung!

712
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,556
I think he wants you guys
to shout a little louder!

713
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,102
-Son Gil-seung!
-Son Gil-seung!

714
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,937
Well, this is a happy day.

715
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:48,488
Pheasant

716
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,116
-Pheasant, pheasant
-Pheasant, pheasant

717
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,493
-Let's go hunt a pheasant
-Let's go hunt a pheasant

718
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,291
-Pheasant, pheasant
-Pheasant, pheasant

719
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,669
-Let's go hunt a pheasant
-Let's go hunt a pheasant

720
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:07,048
-Let's hunt a pheasant at Jirisan
-Let's hunt a pheasant at Jirisan

721
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,843
-Climb Jirisan and Mudeungsan
-Climb Jirisan and Mudeungsan

722
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,469
-And Geumseongsan
-And Geumseongsan

723
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,139
-That's when I see a pheasant
-That's when I see a pheasant

724
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:18,351
-And I hear the bell on its tail
-And I hear the bell on its tail

725
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,856
-Let's go hunt a pheasant
-Let's go hunt a pheasant

726
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,278
Officer Yang!

727
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,701
All my resentment

728
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,828
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

729
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,587
Look at you. You're in no condition
to walk me back to the palace.

730
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,673
But you drank five cups.

731
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,342
I drank five cups,
but you drank five bottles.

732
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,644
Well, I'll be off now.

733
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,396
I'll see you tomorrow.

734
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:09,777
Wait.

735
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,753
"I am

736
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,923
the prince of this country."

737
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,219
"Go on!"

738
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,809
"Go on."

739
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,773
This is really nice.

740
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,235
My gosh, this is so stiff.

741
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:44,414
I HOPE YOU LIVE FOR A LONG TIME
AND BE THE OWNER OF MY HEART

742
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,450
What are you doing out here?

743
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,496
To get some air?

744
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,838
It's warm honey water.

745
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,258
This will make you feel better.

746
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,483
Do you feel sick?

747
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,947
What is it?

748
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,800
"I hope you live...

749
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,720
for a long time...

750
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,188
and be the owner...

751
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,780
of my heart."

752
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,947
Ask him why he came to Joseon.

753
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,617
-I've never seen anyone from the West.
-He looks so strange.

754
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,952
He struggled so much to come to Joseon.

755
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,580
If he ever happens to mention Seoraewon,

756
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,291
the Second State Councilor
won't stand still.

757
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,794
Do you think someone might be
protecting him?

758
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,296
If there's a Catholic in the palace...

759
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,090
I can even sacrifice my life
to protect this belief.

760
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,134
What can I do? I like it.

761
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,303
You should get used to this.

762
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:30,932
Everyone was born free and equal.

763
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,518
Then are you from a place
where there's no king?

764
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,562
I can't believe I ran into you here.
This is where I live.

765
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,149
The place where dawn comes to greet you.
Do you know where that is?
