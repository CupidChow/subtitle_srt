1
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,688
Why are you getting all dolled up today?

2
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,901
You said you just need to get the sleep
out of your eyes before going to work.

3
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,528
The weather is nice today.

4
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,742
Goodness. Was it winter yesterday or what?

5
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,536
Seol-geum.

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,915
Where is the rouge
you bought the other day?

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,249
"The rouge"?

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:30,965
Here you go.

9
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,501
You're being like this again.

10
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,172
Your Highness,
why do you keep zoning out?

11
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,594
Please wash your face first.

12
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,054
Okay.

13
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,533
Your Highness.

14
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,077
Are you okay, Your Highness?

15
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,474
What are you

16
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,852
thinking about?

17
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,397
Nothing.
I'm not thinking about anything.

18
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,748
Goodness, why is he acting strangely
instead of washing his face?

19
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,292
I'll see you later.

20
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,934
Your Highness.

21
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,144
Why are you here so early?

22
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,356
Starting today, I'll be here at 9 a.m.
unless otherwise instructed.

23
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,274
Isn't that great news?

24
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,987
Yes.

25
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,616
What were you doing here by the way?

26
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
Were you meditating?

27
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,414
I was trying to cultivate my mind.

28
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,460
-"Cultivate"?
-To cultivate the inner strength

29
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,629
to resist all temptations.

30
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,115
It's none of your business.

31
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,492
Go on in. I'd like to stay out here.

32
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,830
What would a historian
do all alone in an empty room?

33
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,750
This is actually good.

34
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,378
I'm also constantly plagued
by temptations these days.

35
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,216
Then you stay here.

36
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,926
I'll be in the room.

37
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,553
Your Highness.

38
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,184
What is the matter?

39
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,894
Do I make you uncomfortable?

40
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,444
-Is it because of yesterday--
-No, it's not that.

41
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,199
You see, I...

42
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,329
I don't think

43
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,250
I should be in the same room as you.

44
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,301
Why not? Why can't we be
in the same room together?

45
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,890
Don't tell me you're afraid

46
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,476
that I might bite you.

47
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,312
What? How could you say such a thing?

48
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,524
-What a flippant remark--
-You should get used to this.

49
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,072
To things like this.

50
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll only get used to it
if you do more of it.

51
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
AMROK RIVER

52
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,467
Hey, Kim!

53
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,219
Are you back from fishing already?

54
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,681
If I were an early bird like you,

55
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,058
I'd be filthy rich by now.

56
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,316
Kim?

57
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,222
The Amrok River, not the Yellow Sea?

58
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,932
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

59
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,144
He was captured in Uiju and has been sent
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

60
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,855
It is very strange indeed.

61
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,733
All the foreigners
who have drifted into Joseon so far

62
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,611
were seafarers on merchant vessels
who were headed to Japan.

63
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,698
If he crossed the Amrok River,

64
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,451
that means he intended to come to Joseon.

65
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,538
Hence, the officials
in the Royal Investigation Bureau

66
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,125
are speculating that he may be a spy
sent from the West.

67
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,713
Had he actually been a spy,
he wouldn't have entered Joseon like that.

68
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,677
I should meet this man in person.

69
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,720
Your Royal Highness.

70
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,376
Officers, what's going on?

71
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,628
What is it?
Did something happen?

72
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
Haven't you heard?

73
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,965
A foreigner from the West
was captured in the northwestern region.

74
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
"A foreigner from the West"?

75
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,346
Come with us. They're interrogating him
in front of Dongungjeon.

76
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,574
Look at the color of his hair.
It's like the fur of a calf.

77
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,201
I've never seen anyone from the West.

78
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,912
His face looks blanched.

79
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,291
He looks so strange.

80
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,293
My gosh.

81
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,340
All bow to the Crown Prince.

82
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,069
Where are you from?

83
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,742
Where are you from?

84
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,582
Where are you from?

85
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,339
Did you come with anyone?

86
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,969
Did you come with anyone?

87
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,766
Did you come with anyone?

88
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,335
Did you...

89
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,129
Did you come with anyone?

90
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,926
He is reacting to my words.

91
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,929
Ask him why he came to Joseon.

92
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,597
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

93
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,435
Why did you come to Joseon? Why...

94
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,273
Why did you come to Joseon?

95
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,484
I don't understand Dutch.

96
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,319
-What?
-He said something.

97
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,237
Goodness.

98
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,864
What did he say?

99
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,198
What is he saying?

100
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,286
I do not think he is speaking Dutch.

101
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,250
Your Royal Highness, there is nothing
we can find out from this man.

102
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,128
We should follow the customs
and send him to the Qing.

103
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,671
No.

104
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,257
He came to Joseon for a reason.

105
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,343
I am sure he will return
if we make him leave.

106
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,728
Take him to the Royal Investigation Bureau
and imprison him.

107
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,606
The Office of Interpreters,
find someone who can interpret his words.

108
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,024
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,445
-Listen, I'm French!
-Let's go.

110
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,821
I'm French!

111
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,782
-What's he saying?
-Do you not understand French?

112
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,158
-What's he saying?
-Gosh.

113
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,577
I'm French! I said I'm French!

114
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,705
-What do you think he's saying?
-Do you not understand? I'm French!

115
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,624
Could he be a Beopranseoin?

116
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,459
BEOPRANSEOIN: A FRENCH NATIONAL

117
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,768
Gosh, my stomach...

118
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,853
My stomach hurts.

119
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,439
-My stomach hurts.
-What is the matter with him?

120
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,690
-My stomach hurts.
-What?

121
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,608
My stomach...

122
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,027
-Look here!
-My stomach!

123
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,737
Is it here?

124
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,948
Here? Is it here?

125
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,081
-Get him!
-Gosh.

126
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,541
Give that back!

127
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,542
Take it from him!

128
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,545
Get him!

129
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,046
-Hurry.
-Hey!

130
00:13:59,129 --> 00:13:59,964
Quickly!

131
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,135
Get him!

132
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,557
Get up!

133
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,021
What are you waiting for? Shoot. Now!

134
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,028
He has been sent to the prison
at the Royal Investigation Bureau?

135
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,613
Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,456
Go and find out what's going on.

137
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,333
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,813
What? What's going on?
Was that a gunshot?

139
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,362
Your Royal Highness.

140
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,873
-Get him!
-Get him!

141
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,516
-He's not here, sir.
-Not here either.

142
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,583
Is he here?

143
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,418
I'm not sure.

144
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,429
Hey, you are distracting us.

145
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,890
Don't you have work to do?
Get going already!

146
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
My gosh.

147
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,562
Officer Yang, are you not even worried?

148
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,649
A foreign intruder is wandering
inside the palace, for goodness' sake.

149
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,236
And there are many places
in the Inner Palace where he can hide.

150
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,363
What if we run into him?

151
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,910
That's why you are
nothing but just clerks to this day.

152
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,205
I mean, back in my day,

153
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,250
tigers would come into the palace
and lurk around

154
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,751
the Office of Royal Decrees,

155
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,295
but we still went
to write the daily records,

156
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,215
did our night duties, and kept on working.

157
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,094
Stop making a fuss
because of a foreign intruder.

158
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,806
It's because you have no idea,
Officer Yang.

159
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,976
That intruder
is awfully good at martial arts,

160
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,020
so even when guns were fired at him,

161
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,313
he did this

162
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,774
and hit the bullets away.

163
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,611
He can make it up to the roof
in a single jump.

164
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,615
And he can move to another roof
in an instant with another single jump.

165
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,036
That's why even the palace guards
are having a tough time catching him.

166
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,579
Goodness, what now?

167
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,290
Why don't you say that he flies
through the skies

168
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,250
on a leaf and shoots out strong winds too?

169
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,418
I'm being serious.

170
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,295
Be quiet and get out
on the count of three.

171
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,464
Otherwise, I'll make you all
do the night duty today.

172
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,174
-One.
-May I be exempted?

173
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,801
Two. Do you want to do the night duty?

174
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,137
If I say two,
you'll be a step closer to doing it.

175
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,228
Officer Son.

176
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,398
Can you come to the toilet with me?

177
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,692
Again?

178
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,780
Okay, fine.

179
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,575
Goodness. You're like a child.

180
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,162
Look at them.

181
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,915
How does he call himself a historian
if he can't even go by himself?

182
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,210
Wait for me!

183
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,557
Look here. how many times
do I have to tell you?

184
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,809
I apologize.

185
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,861
Goodness, those rude rascals.

186
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,739
I'm going to tell on you
to the Crown Prince!

187
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,991
Just let it slide.

188
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,954
They're only following the King's orders.

189
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,874
Everyone thinks you are a joke

190
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,418
because you are so easy on everyone.

191
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,378
Tell them,

192
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:55,217
"You rascals! How dare you
try to go through a prince's dwelling?"

193
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,431
At times like these, you should
scold them and kick them in the shins

194
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,267
to make sure they fear you!

195
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,061
Will I become someone important

196
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,147
by bullying my subordinates?

197
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,108
-That just sounds like a crazy man.
-Wait...

198
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,611
Let's go inside.
They probably made a mess.

199
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,614
Goodness.

200
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,493
Those jerks.

201
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,794
The foreign intruder!
The Western intruder!

202
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,047
Wait! Wait one second!

203
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,719
Wait! Excuse me!

204
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,637
Wait!

205
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,266
Let go of me!

206
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,228
Someone help me! Darn you.

207
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,313
My goodness!

208
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,525
I'm going to get you.
Wait right there.

209
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,154
I'm going to get you.

210
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,976
Sam-bo. Sam-bo?

211
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,686
I'm going to get you.

212
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,253
What happened?

213
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,588
Why is he at Nokseodang?

214
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,507
I don't know. He just

215
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,761
dropped down from the sky.
Just like that.

216
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,306
You have no time to be curious about that.

217
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,060
Make sure you hold him down
so that he doesn't escape.

218
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,604
I'll go and inform
the Royal Investigation Bureau.

219
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,772
Wait.

220
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,694
Do you have to tell them?

221
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,239
Should I go to the Ministry of Defense,

222
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,449
not the Bureau?

223
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,952
That's not what I mean.

224
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,997
If we send him
to the Royal Investigation Bureau,

225
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,999
he might lose his life.

226
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,211
What? That goes without saying.

227
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,006
Should we award him with a public office

228
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,300
for roaming about in the palace
with a knife?

229
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,095
He was just trying to run away.
It's not like he hurt someone.

230
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,224
Your Highness, he's from France.

231
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310
If he came this far,

232
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,895
I'm sure he has a reason.

233
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,111
Your Highness,
you don't have to think twice.

234
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,487
He is a Western intruder.

235
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,199
If you get involved with him,
you'll be taken the wrong way.

236
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,201
Apprentice Goo is right.

237
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,788
He'll die immediately if we send him
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

238
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,498
Your Highness!

239
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,252
Did you tie him tightly?

240
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,712
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

241
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,300
Wait, Your Highness!

242
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,045
Please move aside.

243
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:11,431
My goodness. Where on earth did he go?

244
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,517
We definitely bound him tightly.

245
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,176
Amen.

246
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,946
-Officer Min.
-Yes?

247
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,576
Are you going in to record?

248
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,829
Yes, to the King's palace.
Go and bring the sachaek.

249
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,497
Yes.

250
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,895
What were you thinking
when you got yourself into this?

251
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,772
How dare you bring in
a Western intruder into the palace?

252
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,442
I apologize, Your Majesty.

253
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,120
How is the search going?

254
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,955
All the palace guards
have been dispatched,

255
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,458
but they are yet to find him.

256
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,793
Your Majesty.

257
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,213
Please flee to Yigung for now.

258
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,509
That wicked man drew a sword
before one of our officers!

259
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,637
-If he sneaks into your hall...
-Nonsense!

260
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,848
Why should I run away
because of a Western intruder?

261
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,769
I am sure he has already left the palace.

262
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,438
Tell the Police Bureau
to close down all the city gates

263
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,732
and dispatch the soldiers.

264
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,318
He is still inside the palace grounds,
Your Majesty.

265
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,158
He is a Western man with blond hair.

266
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,410
If he had been seen outside of the palace,

267
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,663
there would have been
a huge uproar among the people.

268
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:45,252
Come to think of it, there was no news
of any uproars in the city.

269
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,422
Then did he fly up into the sky
or disappear into the ground?

270
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,134
Over 100 palace guards are after him.

271
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,682
Do you think someone might be
protecting him?

272
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,478
In the past, there were Catholics
who were in league

273
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,355
with Western intruders.

274
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,149
If there's a Catholic in the palace,

275
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,402
it would be easy
to hide someone from the guards--

276
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,153
He has a point, Your Majesty.

277
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,906
There was a cross among the things
that were confiscated from him

278
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,741
by the Royal Investigation Bureau.

279
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,494
That means he must have come to Joseon

280
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,787
to spread Catholicism.

281
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,638
Starting now, root out all the Catholics
that are in the palace.

282
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,642
No place and no person
will be considered an exception!

283
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,270
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,631
THE HOLY BIBLE
NEW TESTAMENT

285
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,753
How dare you bring your armed guards here?

286
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,213
Go back immediately!

287
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,049
The King gave a royal command
to exempt no one.

288
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,678
-Please move aside.
-These are Her Majesty's dwellings.

289
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,014
-You will not take another step--
-Carry out the royal command. Now!

290
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,391
-Yes!
-Yes!

291
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,184
Stop right there!

292
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,236
How dare you become suspicious
of the Queen Dowager's palace?

293
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,948
These are grounds that I govern
as the head of the Inner Court.

294
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,283
However, His Majesty--

295
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,578
In that case, you can search me first.

296
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,501
Undo my breast-tie
and search my body first!

297
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,718
What happened?

298
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,722
I thought you were going to
bring him from Uiju yourself.

299
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,349
I was too late.

300
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,020
He must have been found by the officers
before I got there.

301
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,828
Things have become complicated.

302
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,582
He's only treated
as a Western intruder for the time being,

303
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,377
but if he ever happens to
mention Seoraewon,

304
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,131
the Second State Councillor
won't stand still.

305
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,633
He struggled so much to come to Joseon.

306
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,344
He won't open his mouth that easily.

307
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,973
We cannot be sure about that.

308
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,976
You already know

309
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,396
that Min Ik-pyeong is a man
who always gets his way,

310
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,523
no matter what it takes.

311
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,864
I hope this never happens,

312
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,618
but if he ever does get caught,

313
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,661
you must make a tough decision.

314
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,789
The Second State Councillor

315
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,001
must not get to him.

316
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,420
Not when he's alive,

317
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,131
and not when he's dead.

318
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,931
Yes, Your Majesty.

319
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,126
Hey, that's an expensive incense pouch...

320
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,551
I'm just saying.

321
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,099
My gosh.

322
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,769
Even my wife doesn't touch me this much.

323
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,021
Goodness.

324
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,358
My gosh, am I allowed to enjoy this?

325
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,656
No, not there. Yes.

326
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,172
Let's just get this over with.

327
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,680
Give it to me.

328
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,309
Come on.

329
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,522
Come on.

330
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,275
-No.
-Officer Seong.

331
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,131
I don't have anything.

332
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:19,938
Show me your hands.

333
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,495
Show me your hands.

334
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:58,935
Leave him.

335
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,074
Now, show us the library.

336
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,245
What? "The library"?

337
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,580
I can't believe this man's nerve.

338
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,666
There are daily records in our library.

339
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,043
No one other than historians
are allowed in.

340
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,671
They aren't looking for the daily records.

341
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,174
Stop making things worse, okay?

342
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,216
Hey, stop! Stop right there.
That's enough.

343
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,011
See?

344
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,347
There is nothing in this sacred library
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

345
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,184
There isn't even an ant in here.

346
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,742
What on...

347
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,786
Hey, they didn't even apologize.

348
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,664
Hey! What are your names?

349
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,333
I'll write your names in the sachaek!

350
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,139
How many people were arrested?

351
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,770
Eight court ladies who had hidden
books on Catholicism in their dwellings,

352
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,899
fifteen eunuchs and government officials
who had a cross on them,

353
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:15,154
and their families too.
A total of 73 people, Your Royal Highness.

354
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,534
How...

355
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,327
How will they be punished?

356
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,747
They will be executed

357
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,083
at the royal command.

358
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,924
Your Royal Highness,
do not blame yourself.

359
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,843
They are people

360
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,929
who were seduced into the illegal heresy
of the Western barbarians.

361
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,056
Even if it wasn't today,

362
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,476
they would have received
their due punishment.

363
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,019
But

364
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,230
I am the one

365
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,733
who stole their lives from them.

366
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,612
-Your Royal Highness.
-That's all.

367
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,948
You may leave.

368
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,528
-Please excuse me--
-Stay there...

369
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,992
for a moment.

370
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,117
Have you still not managed to find him?

371
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:30,289
Well, the thing is...
I was walking around looking everywhere,

372
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,501
then got caught by a palace guard
and was questioned just now.

373
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,505
I mean, how does this face

374
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,216
look at all suspicious?

375
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,177
I look so innocent.

376
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,058
How is the Outer Palace?

377
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,645
There is much unrest, as they are
trying to track down Catholics.

378
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,814
But no one said they saw a Westerner.

379
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,358
Goodness. Your Highness,
you should stop minding him.

380
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,443
You've done more than enough.

381
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,989
If he had stayed, he could have had
something to eat before he died,

382
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,033
but he made up his own choice to leave.
He has no one to blame.

383
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,410
Even so, I still feel bad.

384
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,414
He was all alone and wasn't welcomed

385
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:12,999
by anyone.

386
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,898
Who... Who are you?

387
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,608
Show yourself.

388
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,199
Don't be alarmed. It's me.

389
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,036
You know me. The Western intruder.

390
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,873
-He's speaking.
-Wait, I...

391
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,222
Are you a Catholic?

392
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,100
-Yes.
-Since when?

393
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,519
It has been a while.

394
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,526
Do you know that you could die

395
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,987
because of that?

396
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,326
And it's not just you.

397
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,745
You and your entire family

398
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,456
almost lost their lives

399
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,792
because of this petty thing.

400
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,628
It is not a petty thing.

401
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,548
I can

402
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,927
even sacrifice my life
to protect this belief.

403
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,305
Have you ever thought about this?

404
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,516
Everyone was born as a human being.

405
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,476
But why are some noble and others lowly?

406
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,147
Some people starve their entire lives.

407
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,734
Some people get sold for money
as if they're an animal.

408
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,693
But I...

409
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,654
Why do I get to enjoy a plentiful life

410
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,406
while they shed so much sweat and blood?

411
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,243
In Catholicism,

412
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,704
they teach us that we're
all the same children of the Lord.

413
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,125
We're taught that everyone
equally deserves respect.

414
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,462
I believe that we deserve to live
in a world like that.

415
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,714
And

416
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,968
I don't think my belief is wrong.

417
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,343
Oh, my.

418
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,356
Thank you.

419
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,776
My gosh, don't mention it.

420
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,820
What's your name?

421
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,406
Your name. You do have a name, right?

422
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,243
My name is Park So-hyang.

423
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,954
His name is Heo Sam-bo.

424
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,998
He's Prince Dowon, Yi Rim.

425
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,168
What's your name?

426
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,546
Jean Baptiste Barthélemy.

427
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,507
What?

428
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,553
Jean Baptiste Barthélemy.

429
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:02,811
How dare you make that noise?
It's like you're blowing your nose.

430
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,522
Hurry up and answer her question.

431
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,150
I wasn't blowing my nose. It's my name.

432
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,778
Jean Baptiste Barthélemy.

433
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,698
"Jean Baptiste Barthéle..."

434
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,913
Well, at least we know
that his last name is Jang.

435
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,998
-Jang.
-"Jang"?

436
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,419
I thought he was just a wild barbarian,
but I guess he has a last name.

437
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,130
Hey.

438
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,300
Where did you learn our language?

439
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,802
I'm a merchant.

440
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,971
I sell books from the Qing
to Joseon people.

441
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,182
Why do you keep talking to me
like I'm your friend--

442
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,350
That's not important.

443
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,479
So why are you here?

444
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,649
Why

445
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,111
did you come to our country, Joseon?

446
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,448
To get my money.

447
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,410
-"Money"?
-Isn't it obvious?

448
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,788
Someone must've fled to Joseon
without paying him.

449
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,959
So do you know
where that person lives then?

450
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,045
-Hanyang.
-Where in Hanyang?

451
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,298
That's all I know.

452
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,009
Do you know how many
houses there are in Hanyang?

453
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,053
Then what's that person's name?

454
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,763
Tell us that person's name.

455
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,683
Kim.

456
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,853
No, don't tell us the last name.
Tell us that person's first name.

457
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,147
I just know that it's Kim.

458
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,401
He sounds like a lunatic.

459
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,822
Anyone who has a sound mind
wouldn't think of coming to Hanyang

460
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,533
just to find someone
with the last name Kim.

461
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,993
I'm not a lunatic.

462
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,287
My wife's angry at me
because I lost our money.

463
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,706
I either have to find that money

464
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,541
or just die.

465
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,795
That's why I came.

466
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,133
Can you tell us anything else
other than his surname and where he lives?

467
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,969
Where did you meet that person?

468
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,262
What does that person do?

469
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,683
-Books.
-"Books"?

470
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,018
"Books"?

471
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,771
-He runs a book rental store?
-Yes.

472
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,483
A guy with the last name Kim
who runs a book rental store in Hanyang?

473
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,403
What does he look like?

474
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,616
Does he look selfish and shameless?

475
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,119
Are his eyes full of greed for money?

476
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,331
Does he talk eloquently

477
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,376
and treat you really kindly
as if he'd do anything for you?

478
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,089
Does he look somewhat like a swindler?

479
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,216
He's really hard to like at first,

480
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,551
but once you get to know him,

481
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,054
you find out that he actually is
a swindler, right?

482
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,307
You guys know Kim?

483
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,684
Don't even get me started.

484
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,478
I lost so much hair because of him.

485
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,898
I almost got kidnapped
by a bunch of roughnecks because of him.

486
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,775
I would've had to write books
until I died.

487
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,610
My goodness.

488
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,656
Your Highness, he's a pitiful fellow.

489
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,241
He must've been very upset and angry

490
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,743
seeing that he even risked his life
to come here.

491
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,705
Yes, you really must have
gone through a lot.

492
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,747
Eat up.

493
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,750
My goodness, eat up.

494
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,252
Eat this as well.

495
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,296
-Here. Eat.
-Eat up. My goodness.

496
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,589
Your Highness.

497
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,550
Could we talk outside for a moment?

498
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,976
Do you actually believe
everything he said?

499
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,102
What?

500
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,396
Isn't it a little weird?

501
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,483
Kim may be a little sly at times,

502
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,695
but he's not brave enough
to scam someone in the Qing.

503
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,405
And he's kind in his own way.

504
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,366
You can say that because you haven't
dealt with him properly.

505
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,161
He almost sold me off
to a bunch of roughnecks.

506
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,583
I also find it strange
that he speaks our language very well.

507
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,961
Merchants who buy
and sell things in the Qing

508
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,588
are all very fluent in Mandarin

509
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,466
because they suffer big losses
if they cannot communicate.

510
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:05,554
So everyone uses Mandarin
to do deals there.

511
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,557
So I don't understand
how he managed to learn our language.

512
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,643
Our pronunciation and grammar
are all different.

513
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,022
So it's a lot harder for Westerners
to learn our language than Mandarin.

514
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,733
Well, maybe he just happened

515
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,360
-to learn it--
-No.

516
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,283
I think he learned our language

517
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,660
on purpose.

518
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,082
So don't let your guard down

519
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,418
and send him away
once the chaos dies down.

520
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,214
He might not be a merchant.
He could have an ulterior motive.

521
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,967
You can't keep him here forever.

522
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,806
Why are you laughing?

523
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,727
I'm just glad to see
that you're worried about me.

524
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,023
That's what came to your mind
in this situation?

525
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,651
What can I do? I like it.

526
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,532
Look at you two.

527
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,453
Don't mind me. Keep talking.

528
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,996
I'm on my way to pee.

529
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,623
Gosh.

530
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,251
Do you know where the bathroom is?

531
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,754
Hey, what are you doing?

532
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,507
Hey, pull up your pants.

533
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,260
Hey, wear your... You barbarian!

534
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,303
Hey, pull up your pants!

535
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,681
Hey! Hurry up and...

536
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,184
Pull up your pants! Pull them back up!

537
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,645
-Just leave me to pee.
-Wear your pants!

538
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,064
Pull your pants back up!

539
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,899
My gosh! Hey!

540
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,575
Did you see

541
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,996
how anxious His Royal Highness looked
back in the Royal Palace?

542
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,125
It looked like he was
about to burst into tears!

543
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,589
I'm sure His Majesty
will learn this time around

544
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,133
that if you leave a kid
to rule the country,

545
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,802
it will bring about nothing but chaos.

546
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:17,019
By the way, where did that barbarian
from the West disappear to?

547
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,606
I can't even walk around
because I'm worried

548
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,941
that he might suddenly
show up out of nowhere.

549
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,320
My goodness, why are you so worried?
The palace guards are standing guard.

550
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,780
He'll die the moment they spot him.

551
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,533
But then,

552
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:36,788
we won't be able to find out
with whom he's been communicating.

553
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,875
It's already obvious.

554
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,046
There's only one place that
the palace guards failed to search today.

555
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,592
Are you saying...

556
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,263
that it's the Queen Dowager?

557
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,205
Officer Seong.

558
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,916
I guess your work finished late.

559
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,250
Yes.

560
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,795
What about you?
Are you on night duty today?

561
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,881
His Majesty summoned a late-night meeting.

562
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,551
I'll finalize your sachaek for you.

563
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,928
You should go home.

564
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,974
No, it's okay. I can do it myself.

565
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,476
One of us needs to
review it for you anyway.

566
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,812
If Officer Son or Officer An
sees it tomorrow,

567
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,356
they'll only try to pick on you
for no reason. I'll do it.

568
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,538
No, wait.

569
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,835
Officer Seong.

570
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,921
You know very well

571
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,842
that what's written inside a sachaek
is not allowed to leave

572
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,136
the Office of Royal Decrees, right?

573
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,097
Everybody knows that.

574
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,890
Why do you ask?

575
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,686
I just wanted to make sure.

576
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,651
So don't let your guard down

577
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,945
and send him away
once the chaos dies down.

578
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,491
He might not be a merchant.
He could have an ulterior motive.

579
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,911
You can't keep him here forever.

580
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,471
Have you forgotten that you're a criminal
on the loose?

581
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,474
What if someone sees you out here?

582
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,268
Don't worry.

583
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,312
I won't tell anyone that you helped me
even if I get caught.

584
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,151
You said that you're from France.

585
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,361
What kind of place is it?

586
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,739
Do you also have big towers
in your country?

587
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,076
Like buildings
that are as tall as the sky, for example.

588
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,914
Well, not exactly.
But we do have a famous palace

589
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,041
and a room painted with gold.

590
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,294
And we even have water
that spurts out from the ground.

591
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,379
Water spurts out from the ground?

592
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,214
Is it like a well?

593
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,175
No.

594
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,680
Water spurts from there
and all the way up to there.

595
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,850
It keeps coming out.

596
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:11,229
How does water flow
from the ground to the sky?

597
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,152
That palace must be really magnificent
and majestic.

598
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,780
Yes, it is. The King built that palace
so that he could boast about his fortune.

599
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,243
Isn't it so interesting though?

600
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,788
We live in the same world
and in the same era,

601
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,290
but we live so differently.

602
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,336
Here in Joseon, the King gets scolded
by his vassals

603
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,879
if he lives an extravagant life.

604
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,216
He gets scolded if he doesn't study
and also if there's a drought.

605
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,431
It would've been better to be born
as a prince in France.

606
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,268
I would've been able to sleep
in that room painted in gold.

607
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,813
You'll regret it.

608
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,149
Why?

609
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,361
Is your king also very scary
like my father?

610
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,654
No.

611
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,117
Our king died.
The people of our country killed him.

612
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,621
-What?
-I'm being serious.

613
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,832
My parents told me
that they saw the king die.

614
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,337
How could they kill their own king?

615
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,716
He wasn't a good king.
He made his people starve.

616
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,469
Then what about the next king?
Who became the next king?

617
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,264
There was no next king.

618
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,351
Instead, people got together
and made a promise.

619
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,480
"Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres
et égaux en droits."

620
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,234
"Everyone is born free and equal."

621
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,654
Then are you from a place
where there's no king?

622
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,990
Do the people rule the country?

623
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,286
Well, we do have a new king now.

624
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,538
But he'll probably get dethroned one day

625
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,083
because we've finally learned
that we can live without a king.

626
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,588
My gosh, that's absurd.

627
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,800
Hey, Yi Rim.

628
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:09,597
The place where dawn comes to greet you.
Do you know where that is?

629
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,557
SEORAEWON

630
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,475
"The place where dawn comes to greet you"?

631
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,152
Never mind. Goodnight.

632
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,238
Aren't you the physician?

633
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,539
You're the physician I met
at Pyongan Province.

634
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,004
I was so worried because
you suddenly disappeared.

635
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,423
Is everything okay?

636
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,342
Yes.

637
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,469
I can't believe I ran into you here.

638
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,262
This is where I live.

639
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,312
We really must have been destined to meet.

640
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,148
Let's go inside.
Let me treat you to something.

641
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,734
No, it's okay.

642
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,611
Please don't decline.

643
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,447
I should do a lot more for you,

644
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,825
considering how much
you helped me back then.

645
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,204
It's okay.

646
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,430
Hae-ryung.

647
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,393
Do you have a guest?

648
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,770
Yes.

649
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,106
Do you need something?

650
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,694
No.

651
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,863
I'll leave you to talk.

652
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,949
One moment, please.

653
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:45,003
She's not just any old guest.
She's a very important guest.

654
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,380
You should come inside and greet her too.

655
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,631
Come on.

656
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:54,304
My goodness, who are you so excited
to introduce me to?

657
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,913
She's a physician who helped me
in Pyongan Province.

658
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,165
I ran into her in front of our house.

659
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,375
Isn't it such a coincidence?

660
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,628
He's my older brother.

661
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,591
My name is Goo Jae-gyeong.

662
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,804
You should treat your guest
with something better.

663
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,850
Go and bring the herb wine
that's in my room.

664
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:44,896
But that's

665
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,815
your favorite wine.

666
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,693
Yes, I know. Go on.

667
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,418
Since when...

668
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,089
did you have a younger sister?

669
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,344
Your father died before you were born.

670
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,516
And the only family you had
was your sick mother.

671
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,810
So since when...

672
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,835
I actually remember

673
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,464
something was put into my arm,
and I remember it really hurt.

674
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,633
They said it'd prevent smallpox.

675
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,970
Looking back,
I wonder if that was variolation.

676
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,017
My father calmed me down
by explaining to me that I'd be fine

677
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,518
after suffering for a short while.

678
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,772
Do you remember roughly when that was?

679
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,277
I'm 26 years old now,

680
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,488
so it was probably around 20 years ago.

681
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,132
She's not...

682
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,636
your younger sister.

683
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,267
She's...

684
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:50,938
She's...

685
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,735
What in the world

686
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,071
were you thinking?

687
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,157
Why would you?

688
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,785
-How could you?
-Please don't tell anyone.

689
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,539
There's still something

690
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,959
I need to do.

691
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,297
Please

692
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,675
keep it a secret until then.

693
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,469
My sister.

694
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,726
Jae-gyeong.

695
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,938
You're unbelievable.

696
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,526
There's hardly any left.
How can we give this to our guest?

697
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,157
Jae-gyeong?

698
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,725
Teacher.

699
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,601
Teacher.

700
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,949
The place where dawn comes to greet you.

701
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,534
Seorae... It sounds familiar.

702
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,620
If the person who helped or hid

703
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,748
the barbarian from the West
doesn't show up...

704
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,999
I helped the Westerner.

705
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:18,336
I thought of him as a fellow human being
who is no different from myself.

706
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,922
Do you think it hurt a lot?
Do you think he was scared?

707
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,591
You told me that you know
where he's buried, right?

708
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,093
Can you take me there?

709
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,428
How can you call yourself a historian?

710
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,515
You did something
that a historian should never do.

711
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,017
I'll enter the chamber.

712
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,394
I want you to bring me her sachaek.

713
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,731
I've been hiding here my entire life.

714
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,150
I will no longer live that way.
