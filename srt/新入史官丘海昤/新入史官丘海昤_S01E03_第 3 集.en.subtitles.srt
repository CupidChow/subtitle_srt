00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,673
EPISODE 3

2
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,910
Excuse me.

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,329
Where are you coming from?

4
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
-Pardon me?
-Your hair.

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,211
Thank you.

6
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,182
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING

7
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,373
An exam for a female historian?

8
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,969
I came by unannounced, even though I know

9
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,138
how discourteous it is to do so.

10
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,349
I apologize for surprising you.

11
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,310
No, it's okay.

12
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,272
I was worried about your family.

13
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,405
Sir.

14
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,116
Lady Hae-ryung, why...

15
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,160
Please don't...

16
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,959
Why are you being like this?

17
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,336
Please call off the wedding.

18
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,882
I cannot go ahead with this marriage.

19
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,635
I cannot break off the engagement

20
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,470
when you did nothing wrong.

21
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,932
You should be the one to reject me.

22
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,434
Lady Hae-ryung.

23
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,521
Did my family
hurt your feelings in any way?

24
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,025
Or is it because
I am not good enough for you?

25
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,028
My heart is to blame.

26
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,866
I tried to accept you into my heart.

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,703
I tried to think
that it was simply my fate,

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,913
but...

29
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,000
I cannot control my heart.

30
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,131
I do not think I can spend
the rest of my life as a naive noble lady,

31
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,883
nor do I wish to live such a life.

32
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,884
I...

33
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,846
I truly cannot...

34
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,058
Lady Hae-ryung, it's okay.

35
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,559
That is...

36
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,188
That is not your fault.

37
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,398
However,

38
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,401
our marriage was decided by our families.

39
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,238
It is not something we can call off

40
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,490
just because we don't want to do it.
Besides...

41
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,912
Lady Hae-ryung.

42
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
If...

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,043
I reject you,

44
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,381
people will point their finger at you
for the rest of your life.

45
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,467
You may not be able to get married.

46
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,010
Would you rather...

47
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,347
go through all that...

48
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,142
than marry me?

49
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,252
I'm sorry. I cannot...

50
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,007
I cannot go ahead with this marriage!

51
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,235
Where are you going,
all dressed up like that?

52
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,989
I want some fresh air,
so I'm heading out for a walk.

53
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,326
Your Highness, do you take me for a fool?

54
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,163
You are going to the examination site
to see all the ladies.

55
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,874
It's written all over your face.

56
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,208
I have no interest in...

57
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,921
I'm on my way to check out the exam.

58
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,300
If you think about it, I'm the one
who came up with the question.

59
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,593
Don't I deserve to be there?

60
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,595
Hang on.

61
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,640
What happened when you went
to check out the book rental store

62
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
the other day?

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,227
What happened that day again?

64
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,399
I nearly got abducted by some roughnecks.

65
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,776
And...

66
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,321
what happened when you snuck out
and went to the book reading event

67
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,238
without telling me?

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,324
That was because of that weird woman--

69
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,493
What happened that day?

70
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,706
I was arrested and detained
at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

71
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,794
All right.
Then let's do some thinking here.

72
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,923
Should you go out and expose yourself

73
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,842
to all sorts of dangers
and the crazy commoners?

74
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,762
Or should you stay at Nokseodang,

75
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,931
where safety and peace are guaranteed?

76
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,685
This time, I'll stay out of trouble
and just quietly observe the examination.

77
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,563
Girls, are you there?

78
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,652
We prepared sturdy ropes, sir.

79
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,903
Shall we tie him up now?

80
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,789
Fine, I won't go anywhere!

81
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,720
We will now announce the topic!

82
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,996
Our ancestors believed that solar eclipses
are heaven's way of chastising kings

83
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,248
for their shortcomings and wrongdoings.

84
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,544
So they tried to right their wrongs
through the solar eclipse ritual,

85
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,006
but heaven's wrath continues to this day.

86
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,052
What must a king do

87
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,888
to prevent solar eclipses?

88
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,017
The topic is wrong.

89
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,648
Goodness, what should we do?

90
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,901
My gosh...

91
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,487
Did you know about this?

92
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm asking if you knew!

93
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,743
Well, Lady Hae-ryung
practically begged us.

94
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,370
Then you should have come to me.
You should have told me!

95
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,583
Please forgive me, my lord.
It is all my fault.

96
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,629
I thought it would be the best thing
for Lady Hae-ryung.

97
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,388
You have 15 minutes to submit your sigwon!

98
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,640
SIGWON: ANSWER SHEET

99
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,023
Seol-geum.

100
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,316
My lady, is the exam over now?

101
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,444
Is Jae-gyeong very angry?

102
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,491
I told you. How could you
abandon your own wedding

103
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,368
for this exam?

104
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,954
-I told you not to leave.
-I'm sorry.

105
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,627
Have some.

106
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,839
Lord Goo sent these for you,
saying you'll probably be hungry.

107
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,385
Even after what I did today?

108
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,850
-How knowledgeable.
-Oh, my.

109
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,394
-Her writing is excellent.
-My goodness.

110
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,188
How dare she!

111
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,773
Look, sir.

112
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,693
I've never seen
such an arrogant answer before.

113
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,653
Who on earth submitted this?

114
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,364
This brazen wench.

115
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,117
I bet she has read those barbaric books
from the West.

116
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,494
The Crown Prince wanted answers
about virtuous governance

117
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,621
and the heavenly order.

118
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,789
How dare she try to lecture--

119
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,499
Who wishes to lecture me?

120
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,710
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

121
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,924
I am getting restless
just sitting around and waiting.

122
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,969
If there are any good answers,
may I have a look at them?

123
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,138
We are still evaluating them,
Your Royal Highness.

124
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,433
And we have not come across
any answers that deserve your attention.

125
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,980
This analogy is wrong.

126
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,691
There was an earthquake
after a solar eclipse

127
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,736
at the Weiyang Palace of Han,
not the Xianyang Palace of Qin.

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,491
And here, the phrase "good governance"
would work better

129
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,368
than "A king's good deeds are profound."

130
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,925
And for some of these answers,
the handwriting looks identical.

131
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,303
It looks like they hired someone
to solve the question for them.

132
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,014
We also thought it was odd.

133
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,767
Hence, we had already excluded them,
Your Royal Highness.

134
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,020
Then please look into it
and report all the details to me.

135
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,815
I will show everyone
that it is a serious offense

136
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,858
to cheat on examinations.

137
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,578
Officer Min, I'd like you
to recommend an answer for me to read.

138
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,623
Being a historian, I'm sure you can
recognize the kind of talent we need.

139
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,334
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

140
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,470
Officer Min, how could you recommend
such a brazen answer?

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,181
That answer is extremely insolent,
Your Royal Highness.

142
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,481
Eclipses occur when the sun, the moon,
and the earth line up perfectly.

143
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,818
A solar eclipse occurs
when the moon covers the sun.

144
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,779
A lunar eclipse occurs
when the earth covers the moon.

145
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,197
ASTRONOMICAL CHART

146
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,075
It is not heaven's way of chastising us.

147
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,081
It is simply a phenomenon caused
by the movements of heavenly bodies.

148
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,627
Nothing, not even Zhuge Liang's
resurrection, can prevent its occurrence.

149
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,513
However, what we make of these occurrences

150
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,098
is completely up to us.

151
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
We fear it
for we do not know why it happens.

152
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,581
And because we fear it,
we think that it is an ominous sign.

153
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,300
Once you learn
how the celestial bodies move,

154
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,888
you will realize that eclipses are merely
fun spectacles, not calamitous signs.

155
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,391
"Jiyusuya Bulryujeukbu."

156
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,187
Knowledge is like water.
If it doesn't flow, it becomes stale.

157
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,691
History books that are written in Chinese
are too difficult to understand.

158
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,111
One reader-friendly history book
written in Korean will open the floodgates

159
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,616
for the knowledge
to reach all the people in this country.

160
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,744
"Knowing and seeing correctly

161
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,957
is the only way we can prevent the damage

162
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,250
caused by eclipses."

163
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,054
What a brazen answer.

164
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,475
My lady!

165
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,227
My lady.

166
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,571
-The results?
-The results?

167
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,949
Let's go.

168
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,743
Please be careful.

169
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,089
Over there.

170
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,383
"Hae-ryung".

171
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,386
That's you, right?
It means you passed the exam!

172
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,890
No, this isn't the list
of candidates who passed.

173
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,476
COME TO DONGUNGJEON BY 3 P.M. TODAY

174
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,065
-Dongungjeon?
-Yes!

175
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,151
The Dongungjeon that we know?

176
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,153
Where the Crown Prince lives?

177
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,571
Yes.

178
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,199
I clearly read, "Come to Dongungjeon
by 3 p.m. today."

179
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,660
Why is he summoning the examinees
to his residence?

180
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,871
What is the Crown Prince thinking?

181
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,497
Isn't it obvious?

182
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,207
"Choose the person who looks better."

183
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,418
He wants to see who's better-looking.

184
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,840
Is he choosing his concubine or what?

185
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,511
My deep insight is telling me

186
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:34,516
that this is a highly strategic
and diplomatic way of saying, "Screw you."

187
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,893
"A strategic and diplomatic way"?

188
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,436
I mean, think about it.

189
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,605
It's not like he wanted
to create this position.

190
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,607
He agreed because he was threatened by...

191
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,864
Anyway, he held the examination
and acted like he was hiring for the role,

192
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,492
but he actually doesn't want to...

193
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,620
He doesn't want to hire anyone.
Not even one bit.

194
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,539
So instead of announcing
the passing candidates,

195
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,124
he's summoning them to Dongungjeon--

196
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,960
If he scolds them harshly one-on-one--

197
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,753
Then no one would want the position.

198
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,588
Bingo!

199
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,218
And thanks to him,
we have nothing to worry about now.

200
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,262
How nice is this?

201
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,726
Officer Seong.

202
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,687
Yes, sir.

203
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,641
Even the King can't always make
the right decisions.

204
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,525
I am Goo Hae-ryung, the sister
of Fifth Counselor Goo Jae-gyeong--

205
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,695
Did you think I wouldn't know your name?

206
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,701
Tell me about Guan Longfeng.

207
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,751
Guan Longfeng was executed

208
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,669
because of his frank advice to King Jie--

209
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,129
Then what about Wang Zhang?

210
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,136
Wang Zhang was one of the key officials
in the Later Han.

211
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,513
-Emperor Cheng killed him because--
-What about Bi Gan?

212
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,855
Bi Gan...

213
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,401
was a minister of the Shang Dynasty who
was killed because of his frank advice

214
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,904
to King Zhou.

215
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,238
Correct.

216
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,327
All of them paid for their words
with their lives.

217
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,621
You know what this can cost you,

218
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,003
and yet you have the audacity
to write something like this.

219
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,715
Do you think I'm wrong?

220
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,262
I asked you if you think I'm wrong.

221
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,517
You are being impertinent. Answer at once.

222
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,814
Your Royal Highness,

223
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,859
if you think there is a way
to prevent solar eclipses...

224
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
Yes, you're wrong.

225
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,746
It is not my personal opinion.
I am simply stating the facts.

226
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,207
We, humans, cannot

227
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
control the will of the heavens.

228
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,464
The solar eclipse rituals seem effective

229
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,759
because they are held
until the solar eclipse ends.

230
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,720
The ritual has no real effect.

231
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,530
How many people in Joseon
do you think can eat

232
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,782
at least one satisfying meal a day?

233
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,620
And how many people in Joseon do you think
can visit a physician

234
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,290
when they are ill?

235
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,461
-I--
-I bet you have no idea.

236
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,423
You were born into a noble family,

237
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,259
and you've never had to struggle
in your entire life.

238
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,764
Did you say one book will be able to teach
all the people of this country?

239
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,226
Joseon is a poor country.

240
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,813
Five out of ten fall asleep
worrying about the next day's meals.

241
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,900
Six out of ten can't afford to get treated
even when they're ill.

242
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,862
Commoners cannot even give their children
proper burials if they die.

243
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,364
They cannot afford to be sad
as they must find food to survive.

244
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,159
Thinking about things like books
and celestial bodies

245
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,330
is a luxury to them. Do you realize that?

246
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,584
Even learning and realizing things

247
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,379
is a privilege,
which only people like us can enjoy.

248
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,257
Are you aware of that?

249
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,642
The royal court
holds the solar eclipse ritual

250
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,269
to give the people peace of mind.
There is no other reason.

251
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,022
"Nothing bad will happen.
Do not be afraid."

252
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,732
The ritual is held to impart this message.

253
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,151
Because that is the only thing we can do.

254
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,197
That is why we bow to the sky
and play our musical instruments.

255
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,033
Therefore, the topic of the exam,

256
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,162
and your answer were both wrong.
Do you have any objections?

257
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,776
All bow to His Royal Highness.

258
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,204
Raise your heads.

259
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,582
We will announce the results.

260
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,295
Oh Eun-im, the third daughter
of Oh Bok-seon

261
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,671
from the Royal Cuisine Office.

262
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,008
Heo A-ran, the eldest daughter
of Heo Man-gyun

263
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,634
from the Office of Interpreters.

264
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,806
Goo Hae-ryung, the sister
of Goo Jae-gyeong

265
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,100
from the Office
of Diplomatic Correspondence.

266
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,938
The highest score went to

267
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,192
Song Sa-hui, the eldest daughter
of Song Jae-cheon,

268
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,610
the Section Chief of Personnel.

269
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,282
All those who have passed, come forward

270
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,200
and show your respect
to His Royal Highness.

271
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,553
Second State Councilor.

272
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,561
SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES

273
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,190
GOO HAE-RYUNG

274
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,082
Lady Hae-ryung.

275
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
Where is Jae-gyeong?

276
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,470
Who's there?

277
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:44,649
"False wages, embezzlement, and excuses."

278
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,737
Did that man, Sim Hak-bong,
truly do all these things?

279
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,198
We are interrogating those
who are connected with this,

280
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,867
but we have yet to obtain
concrete proof, Your Majesty.

281
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,287
The Third Inspector of the Inspector
General Office is a crucial role.

282
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,830
His job is to inspect the officials.

283
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,916
This rumor is enough
for him to be rebuked.

284
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,376
Banish him from the capital immediately

285
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,337
and find his replacement.

286
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,841
I will no longer tolerate
my royal advisors' arrogance.

287
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,517
Sir, didn't you hire
Third Inspector Sim yourself?

288
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,604
Who'd dare to sabotage
one of your men, sir?

289
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,190
It's a scheme against the Office
of the Inspector-General.

290
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,691
I will look into it, sir.

291
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,195
He has already been dismissed.

292
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,780
Don't waste your energy.

293
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,366
Find his replacement quickly.

294
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,492
Yes, sir.

295
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,378
The examination went well, thanks to you.

296
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,590
Open it.

297
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,308
"Officer of the Junior First Rank,
Jahagun Yi Seung-hwi."

298
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,310
Jin, Uncle--

299
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,145
I wanted to thank you for your help.

300
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,231
He is a member of the royal family,

301
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,942
so that will give you a free pass
no matter where you go.

302
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,656
I can't even
step out of Nokseodang freely.

303
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,409
When will I get a chance to use this?

304
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,289
Father is at the yigung right now.

305
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,999
YIGUNG: THE ROYAL VILLA

306
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,458
And I hear that Jahagun

307
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,961
is suffering from a bad skin disease
at the moment.

308
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,966
His physician said he should go bathe
in the hot springs.

309
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,594
Do you mean to say... Onyang...

310
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,763
Onyang?

311
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,182
Sam-bo!

312
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,065
When can I leave?

313
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,114
I haven't been
to the royal villa in years.

314
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,325
Wait, if we're going to Onyang...

315
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,453
We should stop by Suwon for some ribs

316
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,787
and by Yongin for some sundae--

317
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,582
There is something we have to do
before that.

318
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,306
Oh, boy.

319
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,813
What brings you here?

320
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,859
"What"? You ungrateful prick.

321
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,237
We did business together for years.

322
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,114
How dare you sell Maehwa out?

323
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,326
What are you talking about?
I never sold him out.

324
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:46,122
-I just introduced him to--
-You're still such a blabbermouth!

325
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,417
You're dead meat!

326
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,441
My tooth! How dare you!

327
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,113
What will you do about my face now?
My handsome face!

328
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,368
Do you even know
who you're dealing with here?

329
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,162
Let go. Get off me.

330
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,789
-Back in my prime,
-That's enough.

331
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,749
people used to call me Stone Ax.

332
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,043
-Break it up.
-Let go. I said, let go.

333
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,169
I said, break it up.

334
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,883
Your High...

335
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,764
My lord!

336
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,892
Oh, dear. Let me see.

337
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,062
My gosh, I can't believe he did this
to your handsome face.

338
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,273
Such insolence!

339
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,609
You shall be punished
according to the law...

340
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,028
All right.

341
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,198
As for this,
I'll pretend I tripped and fell.

342
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,367
I have a question for you though.

343
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,744
That lady...

344
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,787
Where can I find that woman?

345
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,248
"That lady"? Who?

346
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,916
The fake Maehwa.

347
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,085
From the book reading event.

348
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,754
You mean, Lady Hae-ryung?

349
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,674
The name of that woman

350
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,635
is Hae-ryung, is it?

351
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,100
ROYAL VILLA IN ONYANG

352
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
How did you get in here?

353
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,309
I guess you're hungry.

354
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,270
There's probably some food
in the kitchen over there.

355
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,566
Don't be so friendly.

356
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll get attached to you.

357
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,185
"Ho Dam and Yeongan.

358
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,438
This is where the path was made"

359
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,958
Ho Dam!

360
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,307
Your Highness, why did you already...

361
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,935
Your Highness!

362
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,415
Your Highness, what is the matter?

363
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,501
Please tell me what's going on.

364
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,461
-Why...
-Your Highness.

365
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,839
I clearly saw the tombstone right here.

366
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,884
"Ho Dam and Yeongan.
This is where the path was made"?

367
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,386
It was written on the tombstone.

368
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,805
Did anyone come here?

369
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,057
Or was there anyone other than us?

370
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,476
What do you mean?

371
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,937
Even the servants left long ago

372
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,064
upon the order of His Royal Highness.

373
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,858
Then where on earth
is the tombstone that I saw?

374
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,027
Your Highness. By any chance,

375
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,531
have you been hearing things?

376
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,535
Do you suddenly get angry
or see something odd--

377
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,120
-It's not like that.
-Ho Dam.

378
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,885
Your Highness. I am sure
you're still tired from traveling.

379
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,389
You should get some sleep now.

380
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,734
Your Highness.

381
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,569
Come.

382
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,311
DAERUCHEONG

383
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,076
Hello.

384
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,580
You're here early.

385
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,667
We're all in the same office
as apprentices.

386
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,001
Let us be good friends.

387
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,628
My name is Heo A-ran.

388
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,964
And this lady right here is...

389
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,215
I am Oh Eun-im.

390
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,093
-I am--
-How dare you sit down

391
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,386
when you're still on probation?

392
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,222
Where are your respect and discipline?

393
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,271
I apologize, my lord. Please take a seat.

394
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,440
What will happen to this country?

395
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,738
They took the civil service exam.

396
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,741
With no sense of shame,
they won't have any manners either.

397
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,174
It's because of my father.

398
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,303
From now on,
come to Daerucheong an hour later.

399
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,514
Things like this won't happen
if I'm around.

400
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,476
Are you Apprentice Song?

401
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,395
I am Sa-hui.

402
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,982
I am Hae-ryung. Goo Hae-ryung.

403
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,785
Isn't this so exciting?

404
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,954
Now that we are in the palace
in our uniform,

405
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,374
it finally feels like we have
become true female historians.

406
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,919
I couldn't sleep all night.

407
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,797
I still can't tell
if this is a dream or a reality.

408
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,136
Right, I heard there are handsome
historians at the Office of Royal Decrees.

409
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,513
The smartest of the smartest,
the scholars of all scholars.

410
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,849
When they walk around the palace in a line

411
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,101
with a brush and a history book
by their side,

412
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,645
I've heard they look amazing.

413
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,985
Are you going
to the Office of Royal Decrees?

414
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,156
You're going in the wrong direction.

415
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,909
Do you see Jinseonmun right here?

416
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,370
If you pass through there,
you'll see Sukjeongmun.

417
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,538
Past that, you'll see the high officials'
meeting room.

418
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,750
And you take a left, a left,

419
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,461
and a right, a total of three times.

420
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,422
And there you'll find
the Office of Royal Decrees.

421
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,758
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

422
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,848
Yes, hurry along.

423
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,892
-Goodbye.
-And get out of the palace.

424
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,569
THE OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES

425
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,739
-You're still here?
-Hello.

426
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,033
Weren't you on night duty?
Why are you still here?

427
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,744
We hung around
to meet the female historians.

428
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,496
-I guess they're running late.
-What?

429
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,623
"Late"?

430
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,209
Isn't it a given
that they come early on their first day

431
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,877
to greet their seniors?

432
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,005
They never learned to fear their seniors

433
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,673
because they didn't attend Sungkyunkwan.

434
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,717
Girls who spent their entire life

435
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,844
doing embroidery won't know a thing.

436
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,511
I'm sorry.

437
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,597
Goodness, I'm sorry.

438
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,432
You see, this crazy idiot...

439
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,645
is here.

440
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,065
Why? What about the crazy idiot?

441
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,988
Hello, I am Oh Eun-im, a female historian.

442
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,032
I am Heo A-ran, a female historian.

443
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,618
I am Song Sa-hui, a female historian.

444
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,703
I am Goo Hae-ryung, a female historian.

445
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,255
I am Seong Seo-gwon,
a senior ninth-rank officer.

446
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,174
Goodness, there's no need
to introduce yourself

447
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,926
to those that came late on the first day

448
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,053
and got the job
without even taking the official exam.

449
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,931
We will do our best.

450
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,266
Please teach us well.

451
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,108
-Officer Yang!
-Yes?

452
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,526
She wants to be a good historian.

453
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,861
Really? Tell her to go ahead and do that.

454
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,712
You are not a historian.

455
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,687
That was unlike you.

456
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,732
They took an irregular examination,
but they are still probationary officers.

457
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,943
If you're trying to make them quit...

458
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,280
She won't quit.

459
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,865
Pardon?

460
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,034
I know her.

461
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,338
Did you hear what Officer Min said?

462
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,048
Female historian, my foot.

463
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,343
You're just a group of low-level clerks.

464
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,221
-Officer.
-"Officer"?

465
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,768
You mean, "My lord."

466
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,274
I'm suddenly really thirsty.

467
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,611
Whom should I send? Clerk Goo.

468
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,697
Bring me some water.

469
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,450
-Pardon?
-Didn't you hear him?

470
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,286
He said he wants to drink some water.

471
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,954
Clerk Goo.

472
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,254
Then...

473
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,177
Should I bring cold water?

474
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,180
Sure.

475
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,313
Walk quietly.

476
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,902
-Clerk Goo.
-Yes?

477
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,906
Take this.

478
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,990
-Clerk Heo.
-Yes?

479
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,993
-Clerk Oh.
-Yes?

480
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,917
What are you doing?
Can't you see how dirty this area is?

481
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,378
You should be cleaning the dirty area,
not the clean area.

482
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,130
My lord, I brought everything.

483
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,757
Pardon?

484
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,345
Here you go.

485
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,639
No, take them to Chi-guk.

486
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,558
Go on. Give them to Chi-guk.

487
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,190
My lord, these are for you, right?

488
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,567
No?

489
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,410
It's delicious.

490
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,546
What's this?

491
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,922
-Clerk Goo.
-Yes?

492
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,133
The tofu just fell.

493
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,761
The tofu just fell.

494
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,432
Yes, I can see that.

495
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,267
The tofu fell on the floor.

496
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,146
-Why? Are you tired?
-No.

497
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,397
If you're tired, go home.

498
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,921
If you're so sleepy,

499
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,423
run 20 laps around the building.

500
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,720
Do you want to run 50 laps?

501
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,388
No, my lord.

502
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,019
My gosh.

503
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,647
Move your leg so I can put the table down.

504
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,443
Seol-geum.

505
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,490
I've come to respect you so much
after what I've been through today.

506
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,410
Stop talking nonsense and eat.

507
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,788
I heard you even skipped lunch.

508
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,331
I really mean it.

509
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,960
After working really hard today,

510
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,045
I realized that this job
isn't for everyone.

511
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,214
You cook and clean every single day.

512
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,091
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

513
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,305
Then you should get back to your senses

514
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,807
and look for a nice man to marry.

515
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,976
You can take me with you as your servant

516
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,936
and help me live a comfortable life.

517
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,688
What are you talking about?

518
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,190
I worked so hard to get this job.
I'm not going to quit.

519
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,110
Are you saying you're going
to continue slaving away

520
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,528
for those historians?

521
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,781
I may be nothing but a clerk for now,

522
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,616
but I'm sure
they'll let me write something

523
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,452
after a couple of years.

524
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,999
Wouldn't it be a waste not to make use
of a smart woman like me?

525
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,127
-Lady Hae-ryung.
-Yes?

526
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,046
You know you make it really hard
for people to like you, don't you?

527
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,716
Yes, I know.

528
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,551
I'm glad you do.

529
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,305
This is delicious.

530
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,141
They say that greed knows no bounds.

531
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,976
After a few days of good rest,

532
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,228
I really don't want to go back to Hanyang.

533
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,189
Why don't you talk to His Royal Highness

534
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,733
and ask if we could live here instead?

535
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,153
We will be able to live
a very fun life here.

536
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,696
Then what about your wife?

537
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,577
Let's go. We need to be there
before 7 p.m.

538
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,579
My goodness.

539
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,874
-By the way, Sam-bo.
-Yes?

540
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,793
-About that tombstone--
-That again?

541
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,296
We've already discussed this.

542
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,174
You were extremely tired,

543
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,801
and you dozed off
because of the warm water.

544
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,094
But the more I think about--

545
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,305
You told me you saw a dog.

546
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,848
And inside the palace at that.

547
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,558
That proves
that it was just a silly dream.

548
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,147
Do you really think it was a dream?

549
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,900
I told you that it was a silly dream

550
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,902
because there was
nothing logical about it.

551
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,405
But you're driving me mad

552
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,701
by asking me
why I think it was a silly dream.

553
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,708
Your Highness, how about
if we just forget about that

554
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:17,960
and drop by Suwon

555
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,963
to have some ribs before we go back?

556
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,550
He's sullen again.

557
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,720
If you don't want ribs
how about some rib stew?

558
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,732
My gosh, we're working like slaves here.

559
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,236
Look at how wrinkly my hands have become.

560
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,948
I never even poured myself
my own cup of water at home.

561
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,826
But here, I'm busy doing the dishes.

562
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,247
I've never been mistreated like this
during my 18 years of being alive.

563
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,294
I'm practically eating all the meat
at the butcher's these days.

564
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,212
I'm always exhausted, so I need to eat

565
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
at least three to four dishes of beef
to get some energy.

566
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,300
Wait.

567
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,760
Do you think they're trying to haze us?

568
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,638
Is that why they're being so mean to us?

569
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,683
The Office of Royal Decrees
is notorious for its hazing rituals.

570
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,185
The newcomers are stripped and beaten
at a kisaeng house.

571
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,729
They even have to roll in the mud.

572
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:23,233
But didn't His Royal Highness forbid them
from hazing us?

573
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,444
That's probably
why they're being so mean to us.

574
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,947
They can't stand that we get to skip
everything that they had to go through.

575
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,407
They're upset and jealous.

576
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,576
Come to think of it, you're right.

577
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,953
I heard Yulgok Yi-i also got kicked out

578
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,038
because he tried

579
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,498
to avoid the hazing ritual.
I heard he even got bullied.

580
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,418
Then is that why they kept
calling us low-level clerks

581
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,919
and made us do petty chores?

582
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,630
-That's right.
-That's right.

583
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,549
And is that why they also told us
that we're not historians?

584
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,968
-That's right.
-That's right.

585
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,930
Ladies.

586
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,060
A "hazing ritual"?

587
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,442
Do you even know
what a hazing ritual consists of?

588
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,319
Yes, I do.

589
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,571
You can beat us up,

590
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,156
make us dance,

591
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,116
and even make us

592
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,369
strip naked.

593
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,667
We can't do that to a woman.

594
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,752
Go back.

595
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,754
Is it because women

596
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,964
can't be government officials?

597
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,261
We got to this position
by taking the civil service exam

598
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,596
just like everyone else.

599
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,725
But why are we exempted
from going through a hazing ritual?

600
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,271
Is it because we're women
and can't be accepted as historians?

601
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,398
No, that's not it.

602
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,067
Well, that's what it seems like

603
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,652
to me.

604
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,201
Here are the place and time of the ritual.

605
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,203
I hope to see you there.

606
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,183
Officer Yang!

607
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,185
-Officer Yang!
-What is it?

608
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,521
-Take a look at this.
-What is this?

609
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,276
They're doing what?

610
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,278
A hazing ritual?

611
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,449
Do they think we're going to accept them

612
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,617
if they do this?

613
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,119
This is good news.

614
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,871
I still get so angry
every time I think back

615
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,289
to my own hazing ritual.

616
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,249
-We should blow off our steam--
-Wait.

617
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,002
We're the ones who performed
your hazing ritual.

618
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,215
And thanks to you,
I've become a great historian.

619
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,551
What should we do?

620
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,053
Spray dirty water on them?
Make them drink soy sauce?

621
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,513
Or should we

622
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,433
-pour cow's urine on them?
-We can't do that to noble ladies.

623
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,354
I'm going to greet our female historians

624
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,984
with the utmost respect.
I'm going to keep things traditional.

625
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,330
My goodness, you're here.

626
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,125
We didn't want to keep you waiting,

627
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,586
so we asked everyone
to gather a little early.

628
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,422
This is our way of paying our respects

629
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,090
to you.

630
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,802
And this croaker from the south

631
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,179
is an expression of our sincerity.

632
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,850
Sincerity, my foot.
We'll have to pay for all that.

633
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,358
Okay, then. You should start off
by greeting us with a bow.

634
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:02,244
Okay, great. I hope you'll be
very obedient to your seniors.

635
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,957
Take your seats.

636
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,881
Now, drink the whole thing.

637
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,846
No, not that one. The one next to it.

638
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,975
What? How can we finish this?

639
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,768
No.

640
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,687
Why? Because you're a woman?

641
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:35,235
I guess the hazing ritual
is a bit too much for you ladies.

642
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,445
It's absurd for noble ladies
to receive drinks

643
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,780
from men at a kisaeng house.

644
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,409
That is utterly unimaginable in Joseon.

645
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,368
I agree.

646
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,246
My goodness, let us go
and have some drinks on our own.

647
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,416
-I'll drink it.
-Who just said that?

648
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,104
I have to say, Clerk Song is very bright.

649
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,065
Okay, then. Have another bowl.

650
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,237
This smells amazing.

651
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,415
Here.

652
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,090
My goodness, that looks delicious.

653
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,569
Now, that's the kind of spirit you need
to become a historian.

654
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,322
-Officer An.
-Yes, sir.

655
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,414
Here.

656
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,217
Wait.

657
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:23,843
I will

658
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,304
drink this one.

659
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,610
However,

660
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,905
your affection for us is very touching.

661
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:47,867
So I must return the love.

662
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,453
-What?
-King Wen of Zhou

663
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,414
became a true leader
when he was imprisoned.

664
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,958
And Qu Yuan wrote Li Sao

665
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,668
after he was banished from Zhou.

666
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,128
So the Analects of Confucius say,

667
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,090
"Making someone suffer
comes from true affection."

668
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,471
It means you give people hardships
because you love them.

669
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,031
So please accept it.

670
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,825
It is a token of my respect.

671
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,753
Over here!

672
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,672
Let's do this!

673
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,727
Don't regret it.

674
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,521
You brought this upon yourself.

675
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,111
Cheers.

676
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,529
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

677
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,897
Scoop as much as you can.

678
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,406
Your Highness, it's already past 9 p.m.

679
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,075
Must you stand here
in the middle of the bridge?

680
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,745
I'm waiting here because this is
where we agreed to meet.

681
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,622
And I didn't know

682
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,333
there'd be so many people here.

683
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,631
You've been waiting for over an hour.
You should get the message by now.

684
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,217
She's not going to show up.

685
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,889
You sent her a letter out of nowhere
asking her to apologize.

686
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,891
I doubt anyone would show up to apologize

687
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,852
after receiving a letter like that.

688
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,654
Your Highness, what was that face
just now?

689
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,616
You look like a man
who has been stood up by his lover.

690
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,245
What kind of nonsense is that?

691
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,914
"Lover"?

692
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:25,752
How could you call my lifetime enemy
a lover?

693
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,969
Forget it if I'm wrong.
You don't have to get so angry about it.

694
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,014
My goodness.

695
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,058
Goo Hae-ryung.

696
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,612
My goodness.

697
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,156
Gosh.

698
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,160
Are we done?

699
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,960
That's enough.

700
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,254
-Give me that.
-Enough.

701
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,215
My gosh.

702
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,467
Give it to me.

703
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,642
You're...

704
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,519
You're crazy.

705
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,731
You're really a crazy...

706
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,318
You're a crazy woman.

707
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,279
I know.

708
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,548
Drink again?

709
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,600
I miss my mother.

710
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,695
My gosh.

711
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,282
Did you...

712
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,034
We won!

713
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,411
-Sir!
-We did it!

714
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,871
-You did it!
-Sir.

715
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,039
Wake up.

716
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,083
You did it!

717
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:30,877
Sir, wake up.

718
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,755
-My goodness.
-Sir, wake up.

719
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,423
Sir, please.

720
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,844
-Sir!
-We did it!

721
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,807
-I can't believe this.
-This is unbelievable.

722
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,684
-Sir!
-Wake up!

723
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,895
Sir, wake up.

724
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,855
My goodness, gracious.

725
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,112
Lady Hae-ryung.

726
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,158
-My goodness.
-I'm okay.

727
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:11,959
My gosh, be careful.

728
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,178
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

729
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:24,806
My gosh.

730
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,559
I was so worried. How much did you...

731
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,895
-My goodness!
-Hae-ryung!

732
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,564
Jae-gyeong.

733
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,237
Why are you lying on the ground?

734
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,410
It's cold. You'll get sick.

735
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,621
-Seol-geum.
-Yes, my lord.

736
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,957
-Can you please hold this?
-Okay.

737
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,083
Here.

738
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,669
Let's go.

739
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,005
-Jae-gyeong.
-Gosh.

740
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,925
Let's go. Lead the way.

741
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,069
-My gosh.
-Lady Hae-ryung.

742
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,906
Lady Hae-ryung! Your shoes!

743
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,581
-I'll be off.
-Okay, bye...

744
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,255
I work at the Office of Royal Decrees.

745
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,009
I am Hae-ryung, a probationary historian
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

746
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,428
The Office of Royal Decrees gave orders

747
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,054
to not let anyone in after 7 a.m.

748
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,097
Pardon?

749
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,225
What kind of nonsense is that?

750
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,602
Please let me in.

751
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,333
I know a way you can get inside.

752
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,959
Really?

753
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,552
There's a small hole at the back
that leads to the palace.

754
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,041
Lady Park!

755
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,214
Lady Choe!

756
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,175
Hey!

757
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,428
Where is everyone?

758
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,055
Hey!

759
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,307
My goodness.

760
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,101
Court ladies

761
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,812
are strictly forbidden
from entering Nokseodang.

762
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,605
So make sure you don't get caught.

763
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,205
Are you lost?

764
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,218
Maehwa?

765
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,179
Sparrow?

766
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:11,908
It was unpleasant.

767
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,576
I don't need your help.

768
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,578
I can take care of myself.

769
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,289
I'll teach them starting from tomorrow.

770
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,249
Someone was murdered in a deserted house.

771
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,085
Isn't it a bit too meticulous
to be done by a group of ladies

772
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,587
who are working in the palace?

773
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,380
I met someone interesting in the palace.

774
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,592
He's a man who's incapable
of loving a woman.

775
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,260
Where's the person I asked for?

776
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,971
I will teach you all a lesson!

777
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,890
What's the name of that book?

778
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,643
Did you just say "Ho Dam"?
