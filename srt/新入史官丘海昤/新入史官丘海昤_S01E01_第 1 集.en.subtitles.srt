EARLY 19TH CENTURY
HANYANG, JOSEON

2
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,530
Everyone, come and listen
to the romance novel!

3
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,742
Moonlight Love Affair by Maehwa!

4
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,411
Come and listen to the romance novel!

5
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:23,500
-It's starting. Please excuse us.
-Moonlight Love Affair by Maehwa!

6
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,881
"In the hands of Master Kim,

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,177
were a single bunch of magnolia blossoms.

8
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,973
Ja-gyeong could only exclaim in surprise.

9
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,600
'Oh, my!'"

10
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,689
"'Master Kim, magnolias won't bloom
for another month. Am I wrong?'

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,942
Ja-gyeong asked.

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,904
Then Master Kim answered
with a delightful smile on his face."

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,117
"'I brought them from Jeju-do.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,704
I wanted you to be
the first one to see them.'

15
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,544
Then Master Kim walked up to Ja-gyeong."

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,548
"Ja-gyeong closed her eyes.

17
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
-Her heart..."
-"Her heart"!

18
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,135
-"Her heart..."
-My gosh!

19
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,471
"It felt like her heart would explode."

20
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,181
-Gosh!
-Oh, my!

21
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,642
"Then when their lips

22
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,228
were about to meet..."

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,023
-At that very moment!
-My gosh!

24
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,404
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

25
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,499
Hurry.

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,169
Here, quick!

27
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,927
"Ja-gyeong's...

28
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,680
trembling..."

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,975
"All his limbs...

30
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,476
THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,729
...were paralyzed.

32
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,652
The bullet had pierced
through Werther's right eye

33
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,447
and gone through his brain.

34
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,203
His brain...

35
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,415
had splattered everywhere.

36
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,340
When a vein in his arm was cut,
blood spouted from it like a fountain,

37
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,799
but it was all in vain.

38
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,302
He was still breathing.

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,012
Judging from the blood on the chair,

40
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,723
it seemed like Werther
had pulled the trigger

41
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,894
while sitting at his desk."

42
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,938
Wait, hold on.

43
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,065
Is that how Werther dies?

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,192
He dies a bachelor?

45
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,530
A noble lady mustn't be so impatient.

46
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,244
It is an ordeal he must overcome
in order to meet his true match.

47
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,582
How about if you just skip
to the wedding night?

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,093
This is how the story ends;
with Werther's death.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,601
I mean, he shot himself in the head.
Who can survive that?

50
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,396
It's not like
he can stitch his brains back together.

51
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,689
What?

52
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,985
You've been reading a story
in which they don't even end up together?

53
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,738
You said this novel was from the West.
I was waiting for a steamy...

54
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,743
I mean, I expected it
to be a little different.

55
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,830
It has to have something
that we never get to see in Joseon.

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,749
It certainly is "different."

57
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,919
Seeing the young and foolish Werther
completely ruin his own life

58
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,755
because of his fleeting feelings
teaches us

59
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,300
that we shouldn't live like that.

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,927
Where else can you learn
such a valuable lesson?

61
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,267
I'm speechless.
How could you call this a romance novel?

62
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,144
I never said it was a romance novel.

63
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,314
I said it's a story of a man
who devotes his body and soul to--

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,775
I get the soul part,
but when did he devote his body to her?

65
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,404
You just heard it.
He did it through his death.

66
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,161
So what you meant by "body and soul"

67
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,416
was a lovesick man taking his own life?

68
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,169
That's correct.
That is the highlight of this novel.

69
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,797
Compared to other romance novels,
this one is on a whole new level.

70
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,891
Dol-soe!

71
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,102
Gosh, let go. Let go of me, will you?

72
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,687
Goodness.

73
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,401
My lady. You can kick me out,
but you should pay me first.

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,444
Pay me for my work.

75
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,905
You expect to get paid
for reading us this garbage?

76
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,239
Get lost!

77
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,870
I read to you for two weeks
until my voice was almost hoarse.

78
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,705
How could you do this to me?

79
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,125
How dare a lowborn talk back to noble
ladies after fooling them so shamelessly?

80
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,962
Should I order some punishment
to knock some sense into you?

81
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,199
"Policies change,

82
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,412
as do family customs.
This results in changes

83
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,914
to teachings and rules.

84
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,042
Being preoccupied

85
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,211
with the nation's gains and losses

86
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,713
leads to a harrowing moral breakdown.

87
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,801
Saddened by the brutality
of punishments and rules,

88
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,513
we lament and sing of our innate empathy

89
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,932
so that we can

90
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,643
transcend change--"

91
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,978
My lady.

92
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,355
I'm your book reader.

93
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,486
I'm sorry about the other day.
I should've been more thoughtful.

94
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,156
I brought the books you asked for,

95
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,991
so please forgive me.

96
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,371
I will continue to comb through
the collection at the book rental store

97
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,041
and try to find
as many steamy and erotic books as I can.

98
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,585
I'll be off, then.

99
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,222
UNCOVERED YOUTH

100
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,932
MY INSATIABLE LUST

101
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,311
What's all this?

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,192
Honey!

103
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,278
Honey!

104
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,575
Honey!

105
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,209
My gosh, stop!

106
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,799
-How dare you!
-Sir.

107
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,510
How dare a eunuch and a court lady

108
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,471
fool around here, knowing
His Majesty is right around the corner?

109
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,307
Do you realize
that this can cost you your lives?

110
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,642
She didn't do anything.

111
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,269
I practically dragged her here.
It's all my fault, sir.

112
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,731
No, he didn't do anything wrong.
I asked him to meet me here.

113
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,275
I planned all of this
because of my infatuation for him.

114
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,611
-Punish me instead!
-Why, you little...

115
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,573
Are you both that smitten?

116
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,789
Do you like each other that much?

117
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,959
Enough to sacrifice your lives
to protect each other?

118
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,004
May I ask who you might be?
Why are you asking such--

119
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,882
-Answer his question truthfully, now!
-Yes, I'm completely smitten.

120
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,469
I love him so much that I would gladly
sacrifice my life for him.

121
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,304
Hong-yeon.

122
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
Tell me how it began.

123
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,021
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

124
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,525
Tell me about the day
the two of you first met,

125
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,986
the day you found out
that you like each other,

126
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,946
and the day you first held hands.

127
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,324
Tell me how you fell in love
with each other.

128
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,909
I want to know everything.

129
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,998
Well, the place where
I saw Hong-yeon for the first time...

130
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,878
Congratulations, Your Highness.

131
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,798
You obtained
some invaluable information today.

132
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,716
Goodness.

133
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,386
Why is it so hard for you
to compliment me?

134
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,140
I went through hoops to make sure
we could catch them in the act today.

135
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,683
I almost got beaten up

136
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,477
by that cranky Court Lady Choe
when I snuck into the ladies' chamber.

137
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,315
And in order to coax Eunuch Kim's friend
into spilling the beans,

138
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,985
I gave him with 50 yagwas as gifts.
No less than 50, I'm telling you!

139
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,282
Kick those two out of the palace.

140
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
Pardon me?

141
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,120
Feelings are considered a sin here.

142
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,749
Isn't it a pity they have to live
with that burden all their lives?

143
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,130
I was going to come up with an excuse
to kick them out anyway.

144
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,176
That way, they can be lovey-dovey
and live happily ever after.

145
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,178
-Sam-bo.
-Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,764
Have you ever...

147
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,434
felt such deep feelings for someone?

148
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:50,358
Are you implying that a eunuch
isn't even considered a man?

149
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,528
Look at you, getting all riled up again.
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

150
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,869
Back in the good old days,
I used to imagine

151
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,288
all sorts of things in my head

152
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,332
whenever a lady's gaze met mine.

153
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,377
Wait, hold on.

154
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,674
How would you feel about
basing this novel on my story?

155
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,678
The title can be "Eunuch Heo
and His Three Thousand Ladies."

156
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,349
The protagonist is
the manliest man of all time, Heo Sam-bo.

157
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
THE CLOUD DREAM OF THE NINE

158
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,044
You're late, Lady Hae-ryung!

159
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,297
Lady Hae-ryung! Gosh, my lady.

160
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,426
Oh, dear.

161
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,096
Lady Hae-ryung, you're late.
Wake up, okay?

162
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,433
Please wake up! Come on!

163
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,352
Gosh, it's still so early.
Let me get a little more sleep.

164
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,772
What are you talking about?
It's well past 9 a.m.

165
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,607
What? 9 a.m.?

166
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,778
Why didn't my alarm go off?

167
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,448
That piece of junk breaks all the time.

168
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,534
If I were you, I'd much rather rely on
the rooster next door.

169
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:28,038
Why bother working as a book reader
every night? It's such a waste of time.

170
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,417
-That's why you always sleep in.
-It's not a waste of time.

171
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,879
I get paid to read interesting books
and have meaningful conversations.

172
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,630
I can't think of a better job.

173
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,341
Sure thing.

174
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,511
The job is so fantastic

175
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,222
that you always get on those
noble ladies' nerves and get kicked out.

176
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,477
And they say all kinds of nasty things
to you. You don't even get paid at times.

177
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,237
In Master Kim's eyes,

178
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,115
a faint...

179
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
Faintly...

180
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
A faint...

181
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,337
A faint beam of light flickered.

182
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,768
In Master Kim's eyes,

183
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,773
a faint beam of light flickered.

184
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,151
I love you so much

185
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,738
that I would gladly sacrifice my life
for you.

186
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,990
I love you so much

187
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,828
to the point that I would gladly
give up my life for you.

188
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,380
"When you are eating with your husband,

189
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,841
do not take big mouthfuls

190
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,260
and do not spill your soup.

191
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,514
Take small bites and swallow quickly."

192
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,884
I have no idea.

193
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,430
Can't we just have our servants
figure these things out for us?

194
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,019
Why don't you ask Hae-ryung?

195
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,356
She's the most experienced one
out of all of us.

196
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,568
That's right. Who knows?
All those lonely years of being single

197
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,237
might have taught her
how to calculate these things.

198
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,284
Hae-ryung, tell me what you think.

199
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,621
When would be the best day
to conceive a baby boy?

200
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
The answer is...

201
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,293
It should be September 23.

202
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,254
Did you refer to the chart?

203
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,757
No, I just calculated it on my own.

204
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,884
Then tell us
how you arrived at the answer.

205
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,179
You told us that two conditions
must be met in order to conceive a boy.

206
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,098
First, it has to be an odd-numbered day
within the four days

207
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
after the cotton
inside your underwear turns gold.

208
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,227
Second, we must consider
the sexagenary cycle.

209
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,313
Gap and eul for spring,
byeong and jeong for summer,

210
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,690
gyeong and shin for autumn,
im and gye for winter.

211
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,776
-And?
-September 20 is the day of muo

212
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,195
in the month of gyeongsul
that falls in the year of jeongmyo.

213
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,280
It's autumn, so if we look for days

214
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,992
that fall on gyeong or shin,
there are two days, September 22 and 23.

215
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,371
It's said that girls are conceived
on even-numbered days,

216
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,498
so September 22 can't be the right day.

217
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,875
That leaves us with September 23.

218
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,378
The day of shinyu, the month of gyeongsul,
year of jeongmyo.

219
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,422
Do you expect us to believe
you calculated all that just now?

220
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,176
I bet she cheated. Please check.

221
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,390
All those lonely years of being single
taught me how to calculate these things.

222
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,559
You're wrong.

223
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,520
It's wrong. Try again.

224
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,356
It can't be. I'm certain
that my calculation is correct.

225
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,899
I'm not talking about your answer.

226
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,485
I mean that arrogant attitude of yours
is wrong.

227
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,238
A virtuous woman must hide her talents

228
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,991
and not speak about
the things that she knows.

229
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,535
Why are you always so eager
to show off your brightness?

230
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,203
The Classic of Poetry states

231
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,666
that women mustn't do
anything bad or great.

232
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
Do you understand?

233
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,046
Yes.

234
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,895
Hae-ryung, let's go for a walk.
We can enjoy the night breeze too.

235
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,981
I don't want to go. Just go by yourself.

236
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,819
Will you say no to even this?

237
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,053
You're such a bad influence.

238
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,724
Drinking with a sister
who's past the marriageable age?

239
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,726
You're spoiling me.

240
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,437
And that's why everyone picks on me.

241
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,272
Who picked on you?

242
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,399
I shall teach them a lesson.

243
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,404
I do not want to receive bridal lessons.

244
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,370
I do not want to get married either.
Please just cancel everything.

245
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,917
I really can't take it anymore.

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,836
I'll grow old and die as the spinster
Goo Hae-ryung of Sajik-dong.

247
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,217
-Hae-ryung.
-I really mean it.

248
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,136
I mean, can't we just live like this?

249
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,847
We can read all day.

250
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,641
And when we see a fascinating object,

251
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,393
we can bring it home
and dissect it together.

252
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,398
And from time to time,
we can drink together like this.

253
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,778
Can't I live a fun, joyful life like this?

254
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,160
Do you think your marriage
only concerns you?

255
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,790
When there is an old maid in a village, it
is the headman who gets punished for it.

256
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:49,086
That's the custom of this country.
I've been doing my best to protect you,

257
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,842
but with time, there will come a day when
an appeal about you will reach the Court.

258
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,887
And eventually, your name will be added
to the list of people to be married.

259
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,853
Then I'll probably have to marry
some ruined nobleman in the countryside

260
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,438
or a widower somewhere as soon as I can.

261
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,693
That is why I am trying to find you
a man that suits you

262
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,319
while the opportunity still allows.

263
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,573
Someone who will cherish
and understand you.

264
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,241
Someone who is good-hearted.

265
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,745
That's sweet of you, but do you know
what that sounds like to my ears?

266
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,542
"What will you choose?
Dog poop or cow poop?"

267
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,631
I suppose I did teach you badly.
You are too spoiled indeed.

268
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,092
Yes, that is right.
I am a defective person.

269
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,512
So don't marry me off to anyone.

270
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
Just let me live with you forever.

271
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,062
My lord.

272
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,435
THE STORY OF HO DAM

273
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,271
This novel written in the Korean alphabet
is popular in the northwest.

274
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,107
Have you heard of it?
It's called The Story of Ho Dam.

275
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:41,698
My lord, if you could tell us
what the book is about...

276
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,533
Fifth Counselor Goo,
do you not know about it?

277
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,078
No, my lord. I have never heard of it.

278
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,961
Then I suppose its popularity
hasn't reached the capital yet.

279
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,464
This is why
I gathered all of you here today.

280
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,343
We must destroy
every single copy of this book.

281
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,138
There should be no copy of this book
left in Joseon.

282
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,853
THE STORY OF HO DAM

283
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,741
I must marry Hae-ryung off soon.

284
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,997
Deliver this letter to that family.

285
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,123
Yes, my lord.

286
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,432
It's fixed. It's ticking again.

287
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,644
My gosh,
you sure have such skillful hands.

288
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,066
I can't fix people, but I'm very good
at repairing things like this.

289
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,609
You certainly are.

290
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,488
My gosh. Here, be careful with it.

291
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,073
-Thank you.
-No problem.

292
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,498
-Get home safely.
-Thank you.

293
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,794
A freight wagon is behind you! Make way.

294
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,882
A freight wagon is behind you! Step aside.

295
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,095
A freight wagon is behind you! Make way!

296
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,016
A freight wagon.

297
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,518
Hey!

298
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,313
You!

299
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,940
What's going on?

300
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,902
Stop right there.

301
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,654
You're a pretty good runner.
You little rascal.

302
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,030
Let go!

303
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,158
You should've done a proper job
if you didn't want to get caught.

304
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,077
You don't even know the basics
of pickpocketing.

305
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,788
Why steal something
so heavy and big to begin with?

306
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,834
What? Goodness.

307
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,632
See? What kind of pickpocket
runs toward a dead end?

308
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,934
Where do you live? Where is your father?

309
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,186
Lead the way.

310
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,400
I'll take you to the Police Bureau
if you don't answer.

311
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,235
I don't have one!

312
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,146
What's going on? Where's the money?

313
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,234
You have to bring me money
if I tell you to!

314
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,966
What do you want?

315
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,510
Excuse me!

316
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,975
What do you think you're doing?
He's still a child.

317
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,852
Are you crazy? Mind your own business!

318
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,105
As if telling the boy to steal
wasn't enough, you're now hitting him.

319
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,900
And you call yourselves men?

320
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,026
What?

321
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,739
Do you want to see for yourself
whether we're men or not?

322
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,576
Threatening women and children
using your strength

323
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
is a vile act.

324
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,454
What?

325
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,123
I will take this child.

326
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,212
-How dare you--
-Don't touch me with that filthy hand.

327
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,966
-Are you out of your mind?
-You will be beheaded.

328
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,426
Any lowborn who hits someone
of noble birth

329
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,179
gets beheaded. Did you know?

330
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,600
-Damn it.
-What's all this commotion?

331
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:05,272
Boss, this wench barged in here and...

332
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,734
You fool, I told you to do something
about that foul mouth of yours.

333
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,988
You can't go around calling
everyone a wench. You coarse fool.

334
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,159
And who might you be?

335
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,121
Why are you causing a commotion
in my front yard?

336
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,708
I don't know what kind of relationship
this child has with you people,

337
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,876
-but I will take him with me.
-To do what?

338
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,755
If he has parents,
I will take him to them.

339
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,174
If not, I'll try to find someone
who can adopt him.

340
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,677
Goodness. Find what?

341
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,430
Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,017
This kid is my slave.

343
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,686
His dad sold him
to pay off his gambling debt.

344
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,982
In other words, no one can say anything
even if I boil him to death

345
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,484
or beat him up and feed him to the wolves.

346
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,571
I can do whatever I want
because I'm his master.

347
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,533
Even if he is your slave,
you shouldn't treat him like this.

348
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,703
Then go and complain to the King.

349
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:06,333
Escort her out nicely.
She's starting to get on my nerves.

350
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,792
Yes, Boss.

351
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,792
What do you think?

352
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,004
Tell me what you think.

353
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,390
Your Highness,

354
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,268
this will make even the most
ruthless ruffian burst into tears.

355
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,020
It's a true masterpiece.

356
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,691
It's heartbreaking.

357
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,527
It's heartbreaking, Your Highness.

358
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,696
It's "heartbreaking"?

359
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,283
Its sublime beauty
cannot be described in words.

360
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,618
Master Kim...

361
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,162
Gosh, that poor man...

362
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,088
You're lying.

363
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:40,427
Last time, you also said
that it was a heartbreaking masterpiece.

364
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,179
You said the exact same thing and cried.

365
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,224
Why is your reaction exactly the same
every single time?

366
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,852
Well,

367
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,063
I only cried because the tears flowed.

368
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,733
If you ask me why I'm shedding tears,

369
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,069
what am I supposed to do?
Shed snot instead?

370
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,282
I just want to know your honest opinion.
What do you think of my writing?

371
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,826
How many times must I tell you?

372
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:09,038
The scribes cried so much
while transcribing your novel

373
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,500
that they all have puffy eyes now.

374
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,752
There's more.

375
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,962
People have been waiting in line
since last night

376
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:20,508
to read Maehwa's new novel
as soon as it comes out.

377
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,427
They even set up tents to camp out.

378
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,887
That's why...

379
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,056
That's why I hate my situation.

380
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,018
All I can do is hear about it through you.

381
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,980
I can't see it for myself.

382
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,578
I'm curious.

383
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,999
I want see whether people
actually enjoy my stories.

384
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,212
and if my novels
actually make them laugh and cry.

385
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,342
I wish to leave this palace

386
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,512
and see for myself.

387
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,224
Even if it's just once.

388
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,397
Sam-bo.

389
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,901
Your Highness!

390
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,320
Please! My goodness.

391
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,655
Your Highness!

392
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,408
Reconsider your decision. Please?

393
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:33,957
His Majesty clearly ordered
that you never leave Nokseodang.

394
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,042
But what? You'll leave the palace?

395
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,795
And you'll go today of all days,
when the streets will be bustling

396
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,507
with people who are excited
for the release of Maehwa's new novel?

397
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,968
If you get even the slightest cut
on your precious body,

398
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,386
who will be punished for it?

399
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,390
Who says I'm that precious?
My father, who's confining me here?

400
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,935
Strictly speaking, His Majesty
didn't say that, but...

401
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,646
I mean, he didn't.

402
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,275
In any case, if anyone finds out
that you stepped out of the palace--

403
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,611
It's been two years
since I last stepped out of the palace.

404
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,532
I think I've been patient enough.

405
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,076
Am I wrong?

406
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,371
Don't worry.

407
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,083
No one really knows
what I look like anyway.

408
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,461
No one will ever find out
as long as you stay silent.

409
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,508
Your Highness.

410
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,188
Your Highness, look over there!

411
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,149
-What now?
-There! Over there!

412
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,572
Jin?

413
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,618
No, don't.

414
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,664
That will look even more suspicious.
Just bow!

415
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,020
Be back by sulsi at the latest.

416
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,688
SULSI: FROM 7 TO 9 P.M.

417
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,858
You two.

418
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,581
Jin just gave me permission to go out.

419
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,960
-Right?
-Yes.

420
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,630
I wonder what His Royal Highness
is thinking?

421
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,839
Let's go!

422
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,301
You will be my bodyguard today.

423
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,971
"Bodyguard"?

424
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,138
Your Highness,

425
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,183
I even lack the thing that all men have.
How could I protect you?

426
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,352
Are you making fun of me?

427
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,937
Let's go!

428
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,109
Yes, it's here!

429
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,653
Moonlight Love Affair by Maehwa.

430
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,863
Volume Three, the last of the series!

431
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,199
You can borrow them starting at 9 a.m.

432
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,786
The greatest novelist in Hanyang, Maehwa.

433
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:21,040
Volume Three of Moonlight Love Affair
by Maehwa is finally here.

434
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,583
Hurry, everyone!

435
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,462
All the copies will be gone in a flash!

436
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,423
-Maehwa's new novel!
-Excuse me.

437
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,384
-What's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

438
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,261
-Line up, will you?
-Stop pushing.

439
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:38,057
Maehwa's Moonlight Love Affair.
Starting at 9 a.m., his new novel--

440
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,269
Kim, I have to talk to you.

441
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,187
Who are you?

442
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,898
I'm not sure who you are,

443
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,153
but if you wish to borrow a book,
you need to get in line.

444
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,740
Come on, Kim.

445
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,702
Kim, don't be like this.

446
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,580
Brush off all the dust over there!

447
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,375
Don't be like that.
If you have any work...

448
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,046
These books haven't been stacked properly!

449
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,259
Can you find me some work?

450
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,721
Work? "Some work," did you say?

451
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,934
My lady, do you know what I had to
go through after I introduced you

452
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,730
to the wife of the Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of Taxation?

453
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,484
She cursed me out
with every single insult you can imagine

454
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,112
for bringing her
a ridiculous book reader like you,

455
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,158
that I almost wet my pants at this age!

456
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:41,162
Goodness, I did not know
something like that happened.

457
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,874
Anyway, if I recommend you
to read books for one more person,

458
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,168
I doubt I'll be able to live much longer.

459
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,048
If you refuse to read
proper novels like this one,

460
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,093
then we are done working together,
Lady Hae-ryung.

461
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,260
Done, I tell you!

462
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,764
I told you to be careful with that!

463
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,057
Kim, wait.

464
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,184
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

465
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,785
Over there.

466
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,164
Are all those people really here
to read my novel?

467
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,000
Maehwa is well-known for a reason.

468
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:33,172
People will continue to come and go
for at least half a month more.

469
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,926
I'll go and get your account settled.

470
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,512
Stay put right here, okay?

471
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,866
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

472
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,743
Maehwa's new novel is amazing.

473
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,995
It'll definitely become
the most rented book.

474
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,997
Maehwa, I knew you were amazing.

475
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,750
Maehwa, please work hard and write
your next novel as soon as you can!

476
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,461
I've been saving up
to buy at least ten copies.

477
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,839
Maehwa is a much more eloquent writer
than Su Dongpo.

478
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,801
I'll love you for life. I hope
only good things happen to you, Maehwa.

479
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,117
MAEHWA

480
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,835
The book was just too boring.

481
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,920
I almost fell asleep on my feet.

482
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,506
Why don't you...

483
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,218
Why don't you like Maehwa's novel?

484
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,140
Do I have to like it?

485
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,977
I want to know what the reason is.
The sentences are beautiful,

486
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,854
there are so many twists in the plot,

487
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,772
and the characters are full of life.

488
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,817
Why don't you like a novel
that was written with so much effort?

489
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,902
What does it lack?

490
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,114
What's lacking is
some manners in your speech.

491
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,618
They say there are distinctions
between men and women,

492
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,621
but which scholar taught you
that it's okay to speak so casually

493
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,582
to a noble lady whom you have never met?

494
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,544
It's because

495
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,214
I am not used to using honorifics.

496
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,510
-My lady.
-Good.

497
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,638
And how should you address
a woman like me?

498
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,811
My lady?

499
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,271
Precisely.

500
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,900
Now, you may ask me the same question,
with some manners.

501
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
My lady.

502
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:31,535
Why don't you like Maehwa's...

503
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,872
novels?

504
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,375
Great job.

505
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,962
Why don't I like Maehwa's novels, you ask?

506
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,674
There are so many reasons,
I can't just pick one.

507
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,095
-Nothing is right about this novel.
-"Nothing is right"?

508
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:55,059
While I was reading this book,
I did cry three times with my heart.

509
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,690
I couldn't believe such precious paper
was used to make a book like this.

510
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,736
The second time, I felt so bad
for the Korean alphabet

511
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,198
that was used to write this novel.
And last but not least,

512
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,451
I was afraid that the delusion
of this writer, Maehwa,

513
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,830
might spread all around the capital
like an epidemic.

514
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,251
I can't believe this writer published
a book like this just to earn some money.

515
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,128
Don't you find this person shameless?

516
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,588
If the writer has any shame,
they should quit writing.

517
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,553
Anyway, that's my take on it.

518
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,014
Goodbye.

519
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,189
Wait. Wait!

520
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,326
It looks like Maehwa
didn't show up today either.

521
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,955
I've told you many times already
that you cannot meet the writer.

522
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,665
Just give me the money.

523
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,462
There is someone
who is dying to meet Maehwa.

524
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,965
It's a chance to earn a huge sum of money.

525
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,593
Goodness, what's wrong with you?

526
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,512
I told you to forget it.

527
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,988
BOOKS AVAILABLE TO LEND
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

528
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,791
Who are you people?

529
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,001
Where's Maehwa?

530
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,756
How would I know?
I don't even know who that is.

531
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,591
Stop lying to me.

532
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,344
We already know that you work for Maehwa.

533
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,720
Come on, sir.

534
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,390
Let's not waste each other's time.

535
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,560
Do you think I'll give in
if you threaten me like this?

536
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,145
How dare you?

537
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,415
I see that you're not just impolite,
but also a man of no principle.

538
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,378
You should learn
to act more like a gentleman.

539
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,215
There's a saying that goes,
"You only see what you know."

540
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,926
A pig sees the world
from a pig's point of view.

541
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,679
The reason you don't enjoy
reading Maehwa's novels

542
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,806
is because you know nothing about beauty.

543
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,183
There's also,
"Perfection can be found in sentences."

544
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,978
True beauty is not something you can see.

545
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,398
Beauty is something
that should exude naturally.

546
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,068
It's not something that can be forced out
by using techniques.

547
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,038
"Forced out by using techniques"?

548
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:08,544
I see. A sparrow can never understand
the views of a wild goose, so I'll just--

549
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,464
And a wild goose will never
be able to understand a phoenix.

550
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,926
So I'll just be generous and forgive you.

551
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,761
"Forgive"? Forgive whom?

552
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,513
You're going to forgive me?

553
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,391
You're being impolite by wasting my time.

554
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,853
I also wasted my precious time
listening to your absurd remarks.

555
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,438
You came to a book rental store

556
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,149
in broad daylight when
you're a scholar who should be studying.

557
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,276
It seems you have plenty of time
on your hands.

558
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,988
That proves that Maehwa's novel
is worth my precious time.

559
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,032
You should rather spend that time

560
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,576
reading another classic book
and accumulating more knowledge.

561
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,995
You are so interested in romance novels.

562
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,081
I am very worried about the education

563
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,708
-of this country's scholars.
-Why, you...

564
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,126
And

565
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,213
if you keep acting so suspicious,

566
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,008
-it gives me no choice but to doubt you.
-Doubt me?

567
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,012
I'm starting to doubt
that you might actually be Maehwa.

568
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,601
Please move aside.

569
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,779
I'm not Maehwa!

570
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,281
I'm...

571
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,035
Run!

572
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,371
Hurry up! Run!

573
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,581
Come on! We need to run!

574
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,292
Run! Hurry!

575
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,044
-Sam-bo, what's wrong?
-It's Maehwa!

576
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,214
-Stop!
-Your Highness!

577
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,966
-Hurry! Run!
-Catch them!

578
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,808
-That's cool and refreshing.
-It's "cool"?

579
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,851
This is lukewarm water.

580
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,271
Today, I taught this naive man a lesson.

581
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,981
What?

582
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,529
My goodness, look at this.

583
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,115
That hurts.

584
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,788
-My gosh.
-Unforgivable.

585
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,792
It is utterly unforgivable.

586
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,669
Yes, of course.

587
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,839
We've been doing business
with Kim for so long.

588
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,758
-But he totally betrayed us--
-No, not him.

589
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,804
That lady.

590
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,264
The sparrow.

591
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,349
I see.

592
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,605
How could she call my novel
a useless romance novel?

593
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,400
She said I needed to
accumulate my knowledge.

594
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,825
Your Highness,

595
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,954
why are you so bothered by the words of
a mere woman when there are already

596
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,415
so many people who love your novels?

597
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,626
I'm sure she ate something bad

598
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,588
and lost her mind.

599
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,423
So don't worry too much.

600
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,552
-And send an assassin to kill her.
-I'll do a background check on her.

601
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,016
Forget it. I'll deal with her myself--

602
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,019
My gosh, Your Highness. Please!

603
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,605
Didn't you learn anything today?

604
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,440
You almost broke your knee

605
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,526
while trying to escape
from a bunch of roughnecks.

606
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,778
But I'm okay now--

607
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,489
I am not okay, Your Highness.

608
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,908
How many times have I told you

609
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,828
that I'll be killed if His Majesty
finds out that you got injured?

610
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,374
If you really want me killed,
you should just kill me yourself.

611
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,835
Here. Go ahead and kill me!

612
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,677
THE OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES:
THE OFFICE WHERE HISTORIANS WORKED

613
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,479
My gosh.

614
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,576
-The Royal Secretariat.
-Yes, sir.

615
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,954
-The Office of Special Advisors.
-Yes, sir.

616
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,289
-The Ministry of Personnel. Get going.
-Let's go.

617
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,718
What? The royal lecture is over already?

618
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,554
You guys are lucky.

619
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,181
His Majesty talked for two hours
when I attended yesterday.

620
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,683
We were kicked out.

621
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,440
What are you talking about?

622
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,152
Who dares to kick out historians?

623
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,071
Who do you think is capable of

624
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,366
kicking us out so he could
talk one-on-one with His Majesty?

625
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,227
Did you not hear?

626
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,606
His Majesty ordered me
not to let anyone inside. Please leave.

627
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,399
A historian is not just "anyone."

628
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,943
Please announce that I'm here
so that I may enter.

629
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,654
Must you get a scolding from His Majesty
to give up and go back?

630
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,364
Please announce that I'm here.

631
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,921
You want to establish
an Office of Banned Books?

632
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,339
Yes, Your Majesty.

633
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,593
Why couldn't you ask the Crown Prince,
who is currently acting as regent?

634
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,137
Why are you bothering me with this?

635
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,816
THE STORY OF HO DAM

636
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,279
That book was found in a bookstore
in the Pyongan Province.

637
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,286
Are you saying that this is being read
by people all over this country?

638
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,996
I have no words, Your Majesty.

639
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:24,002
Who would dare to do something like this
in the country that I rule?

640
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,507
Your Majesty,
a historian is here to see you.

641
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,425
Didn't I tell you not to let anyone in?

642
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,886
Tell him to leave immediately!

643
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,597
Your Majesty, the law of Joseon states

644
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,684
that no one is allowed to meet
with you one-on-one

645
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,311
without the presence of a historian.

646
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,565
I am merely trying to abide by the rules
and fulfill my duty,

647
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,401
so please let me enter.

648
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,987
How dare you?

649
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,739
Are you trying to lecture your King
about the law?

650
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,741
Your Majesty.

651
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,210
Officer Min.

652
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,758
Was it you, Second State Councillor?

653
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,595
His Majesty isn't in a good mood.
You should go back.

654
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,932
A historian is not someone
who can be sent away.

655
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,185
It's nice to abide by the principles,
but a true loyal subject

656
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,646
should also know
how to be considerate of the King's mood.

657
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,481
A true loyal subject

658
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,401
should not be hesitant

659
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,070
to keep a record of everything
he reports to the King.

660
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,494
Then go ahead and write this.

661
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,707
"The Second State Councillor,
Min Ik-pyeong, ignored the laws of Joseon

662
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,542
and prevented a historian from entering."

663
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,670
That's what you should write.

664
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,385
I'm not here as a royal subject.

665
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,513
I'm here as His Majesty's friend
of 20 years.

666
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,060
We did not talk about political affairs.
Stop being so stubborn and go back.

667
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,700
U-won.

668
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,944
Where's Kim?

669
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,028
Over here!

670
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,906
I'm here, sir.

671
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,204
I absolutely hate people
who don't keep their promises.

672
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,998
Why would you do something
to upset me like that?

673
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,418
Pardon? What did I exactly promise?

674
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,004
Didn't you tell me that I'd be able to buy

675
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,717
at least two big houses in Hanyang
if I held a book reading with Maehwa?

676
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,471
Didn't you tell me
that I'd be able to earn

677
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,724
a government official's yearly pay

678
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,643
if I sold a book
that was signed by Maehwa?

679
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,355
Well, I was merely stating
that it might be possible.

680
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,234
But I never promised
that I would bring him to you.

681
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,154
Do you know how much money I spent
because of your promise?

682
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,325
I'm so angry that
I want to cut off your hands and feet.

683
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,454
Please give me another chance, sir.

684
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,208
I'll try to convince him
to come here again.

685
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,129
He's not going to come here
after getting chased by those roughnecks.

686
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,922
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

687
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,340
-Bring me the axe.
-Yes, sir.

688
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,011
No, don't! Please have mercy, sir.

689
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,931
I have a wife and children
I need to take care of.

690
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,892
Should I slice off
their hands and feet as well?

691
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,103
No, sir! That's not what I'm saying!

692
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,690
Sir! Sir.

693
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,027
I have a brilliant idea.

694
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,945
What?

695
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,823
Think about it.

696
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,242
Maehwa never...

697
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,037
Maehwa never reveals their face.

698
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,624
And?

699
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,798
Lady Hae-ryung!

700
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,092
-Lady Hae-ryung, wait.
-Kim?

701
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,560
Who in the world wants a book reader
to read to them in broad daylight?

702
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,479
Why would they ask specifically for me?

703
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,649
You're the one who asked me
to give you work.

704
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,193
You'll be paid very generously.

705
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,033
Come on.

706
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,953
Kim! This place is...

707
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,873
You want me to act like I'm Maehwa?

708
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,042
Kim already told me everything.

709
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,920
I heard you're the most famous
book reader in Hanyang.

710
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,798
It's no big deal.

711
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,884
You just need to do a book reading
for one night

712
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,886
and pretend to be Maehwa.

713
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,056
I'll decline your offer.
You should ask someone else.

714
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,268
I know what you're thinking.

715
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,478
You're a noble lady,

716
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:38,149
so you must want to refuse a couple
of times before accepting the offer.

717
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,487
I prepared enough money
to meet your reputation.

718
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,491
This is a deposit.

719
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,413
Do you think money is what I'm after?

720
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,457
Are you still upset about
what happened that day?

721
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,335
I've already apologized.

722
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,505
I was rude to you because I didn't know
you were from a noble family.

723
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,133
Is it okay to mistreat people
who aren't nobles?

724
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,928
Do you even know the basic duties
of a human being?

725
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,682
My goodness. Of course, he knows.

726
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,893
Lady Hae-ryung, please don't be like that.

727
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,479
Use that clever brain of yours
to calculate the profits.

728
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,190
Imagine how much money you'll make

729
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,692
if you charge five nyang per person.

730
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,362
You won't be able to find a better deal
anywhere else.

731
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,325
I asked you to find me work,

732
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,785
not someone with whom I can scam people.

733
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,039
-"Scam"?
-I won't even do it for millions,

734
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,082
so stop bothering me.

735
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:40,670
I'm not silly enough to sit down and read
those useless romance novels to people.

736
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,632
And I'm definitely not rotten enough
to work with people like him.

737
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,679
-But Lady Hae-ryung.
-Wait.

738
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,900
Let me show you
what it's like to be humane.

739
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:08,698
This is the certificate
that says the little boy is my slave.

740
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,079
If you help me out for just one night,

741
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,540
I promise that I'll destroy this.

742
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,385
Lady Hae-ryung, do you know
how many people you saved today?

743
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,513
Me, my wife, my seven kids,
and this boy...

744
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,891
My goodness. Hey, get over here!

745
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,936
Let's go before I change my mind.

746
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,486
Kim.

747
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,782
Can you take care of him
for a couple of days?

748
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:56,830
-I'll look into where he can stay.
-This isn't necessary. Please don't worry.

749
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,875
I'll feed him meat,
and I'll even buy him new clothes.

750
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,211
Don't go around causing trouble.

751
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,630
Just stay with him at his house, okay?

752
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,015
Thank you.

753
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,909
An Office of Banned Books?

754
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,411
What is this nonsense?

755
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:40,039
How would I know
what the high officials are thinking?

756
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,002
Those old men
at the Office of Special Advisors

757
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,337
should take care of things on their own.

758
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,799
Why would they gather everyone
and get all of us involved?

759
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,926
I guess that's how urgent
the situation is.

760
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,805
Even so, how could they involve
us historians in this?

761
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:01,144
I agree. This hand is no ordinary hand.
This is the hand that records history.

762
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,312
Hey!

763
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,355
Hurry up and get over here!

764
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,358
Yes, sir! We'll be right there!
We're coming.

765
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,776
We're on our way. Goodness.

766
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,000
I must've surprised you all,

767
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,670
seeing that you're not even standing up
after seeing the Crown Prince.

768
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,552
Your Royal Highness.

769
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,138
What brings you
to such an insignificant place?

770
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,017
"An insignificant place"?

771
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,064
You're right.

772
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,150
It's in this insignificant place

773
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,112
that you have been handling
our country's affairs.

774
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,324
That is absurd, Your Royal Highness.

775
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,702
We are just trying to be of help
in any kind of way--

776
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,662
Be quiet.

777
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,666
Do you think I don't know that you're in
league with the Second State Councillor?

778
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,544
You're right, Your Royal Highness.

779
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,380
We have a duty to take care
of this country,

780
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,423
and we are all loyal to our King,

781
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,345
so you could say
that we're all in this together.

782
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,264
Is that why you decided

783
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,517
to establish an Office of Banned Books
behind my back?

784
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,228
Is that the kind of loyalty you mean?

785
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,112
You must keep forgetting things
now that you're growing old.

786
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,115
I'm the foundation of this country
and the Crown Prince.

787
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:42,203
You may have power over the officials,
but you are obligated to be loyal to me.

788
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,416
His Majesty himself asked me to do this.

789
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,919
I visited His Majesty a couple of days ago

790
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,130
and was given the right
to handle banned books.

791
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,592
I may have grown old,

792
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,554
but I haven't forgotten
that I'm serving the King,

793
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,097
Your Royal Highness.

794
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,349
What are you trying to hide

795
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,144
that you even made His Majesty
get involved in this?

796
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:10,231
His Majesty is worried
that the novels written by civilians

797
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,985
might destroy our custom
and taint our country's education.

798
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,864
Therefore, I made a quick judgement,
thinking that this was an urgent matter.

799
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,492
But I didn't think far enough
to consider that this could offend you.

800
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,703
So I apologize for my carelessness.

801
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,925
Goodbye, Your Royal Highness.

802
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,655

MAEHWA

810
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,549
My gosh.

811
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,510
That's not good enough.

812
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,096
Add some more of your artistic spirit.

813
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:27,392
Write in a way that looks indifferent
but very classy at the same time.

814
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:31,187
My gosh, why are you being so fussy
about signing a book?

815
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,107
It's best to just write "Maehwa"
in bold letters.

816
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:39,112
You're a great lady,
but you know nothing about business.

817
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,532
This book reading
isn't going to make us that much money.

818
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,577
The important part is to sell
these signed books at an expensive price.

819
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,621
Let's try again.

820
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,915
Write it in cursive.

821
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:55,169
Make it look like you put in a lot
of work, but be natural at the same time.

822
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,214
My gosh.

823
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,891
"'Get up.'

824
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,104
Ja-gyeong looked up
at the Crown Prince's orders.

825
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,734
The person in front of her
looked somewhat familiar.

826
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:22,113
It was Master Kim wearing a royal robe."

827
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,533
-My gosh.
-Incredible.

828
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:32,165
"Ja-gyeong was extremely startled.

829
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,376
'Master Kim

830
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,212
is the Crown Prince?'"

831
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,716
-The Crown Prince?
-Gosh.

832
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,178
"Master Kim said this to Ja-gyeong

833
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,680
as she stood there, startled.

834
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,809
'Welcome to the royal palace of Joseon,

835
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,187
my lady.'"

836
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,029
Out of the way!

837
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,416
What's your name?

838
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,667
Jin-hyang.

839
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,469
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
because I was so excited to see you.

840
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,930
I love you so much.

841
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,641
Why can't I remember what I wanted to say?

842
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,021
Here you go.
Yes, here's your book. Thank you.

843
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,107
I hope you'll continue
to like my books. Next.

844
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,443
Already? Wait.

845
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,238
Can I hold your hand before I go?

846
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,906
No, you can't. Next.

847
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,991
No, wait.

848
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,425
What's your name?

849
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,136
I have a question.

850
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,724
How did you come up with
such a beautiful scene

851
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,895
where Master Kim confesses his love
beneath the cherry blossom tree?

852
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,900
Well, that's...

853
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,779
I visited Yudalsan last year,

854
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,991
and I was deeply moved there.
That's where I got my idea.

855
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,244
Yudalsan?

856
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:38,916
You're wrong.

857
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:44,714
If you don't tell me your name, I'll just
go ahead and give this back to you.

858
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,509
Maehwa.

859
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,559
Please write my name

860
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,771
as Maehwa.

861
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,784
You?

862
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,892
You're Maehwa?
No wonder you were so defensive.

863
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,560
You're very confident for a fraud.

864
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,354
Do not forgive me, sir!

865
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,564
I will crush you!

866
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,899
From this day onward,

867
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:48,152
Prince Dowon shall be forbidden
from reading or writing any books!

868
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,655
Without them, I have nothing.

869
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,657
Only three people in this country
know Ho-dam.

870
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:57,119
Why are you trying to enter
the Second State Councillor's territory?

871
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,454
And I give him my consent.

872
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,414
And I, the Crown Prince,
will decide the topic.

873
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:04,001
-We just need one person to pass the exam.
-I found you a husband.

874
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,629
You cannot live under my roof
and my protection forever.

875
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:11,300
-An exam for a female historian?
-I cannot go ahead with this marriage.

876
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,012
