00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,462
EPISODE 6

2
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,273
I should get going, Your Highness.

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,234
It's almost 3 p.m. now.

4
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,868
Well, about today...

5
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,788
Thank you.

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,749
For what?

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,880
You came here to record
my daily activities, and I read my book.

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,467
I do not think I did anything
that deserves to be thanked.

9
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,599
Get going, then.

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,066
If you ever want to cry again,

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,943
just come back here.

12
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,153
You can have the room anytime.

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:58,076
I'm only saying this because you looked
so ugly when you were trying not to cry.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,912
You'll be embarrassed
if anyone else sees that face.

15
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,748
Pardon?

16
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,585
Get back safely. Don't fall and cry again.

17
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,839
Your Highness.

18
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,836
How embarrassing. I'm a nobleman.

19
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,255
-What if I run into an acquaintance?
-Shut it.

20
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,090
Hong-ik,
go to the City Administration Office.

21
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,051
-Chi-guk, go to the Royal Secretariat.
-Yes, sir.

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,429
What are you staring at?

23
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,681
Hurry up and go inside, you troublemaker!

24
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,350
-You troublemaker!
-You troublemaker!

25
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,976
Move. Out of the way!

26
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,365
Oh, my. There she is.
The pride of the Office of Royal Decrees.

27
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,202
Our precious rookie historian,
Goo Hae-ryung!

28
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,665
What on earth is happening?

29
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,793
What do you think? It's punishment
for irking the clerks.

30
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,586
What do you mean, punishment?

31
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,339
People must have heard
that one of us petitioned

32
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,049
against the hiring of assistant clerks.

33
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,009
All the clerks
at the Office of Royal Decrees

34
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,220
asked for time off and went home.

35
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,766
We have mountains of work to do.
I don't think we can go home today.

36
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,817
My petition was regarding
the clerks at the Ministry of Personnel.

37
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,902
The Office of Royal Decrees
had nothing to do--

38
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,155
You might think it's completely unrelated,

39
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,784
but don't you know the profession
is passed down for generations?

40
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,869
One of the assistant clerks

41
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,580
whom you tried to get fired

42
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,874
might be an uncle, a cousin, or an in-law

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,960
of the clerks here
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

44
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,506
This is why you should never give anything
to ignorant fools, not even a twig.

45
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,927
She didn't even realize
that she was poking the beehive.

46
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,971
Jeez, I'm so frustrated.

47
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,852
Sir, you can hand over
all the clerks' tasks to me.

48
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,354
-I'll take care of them.
-By yourself?

49
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,273
Then you'll never go home.

50
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,233
It's way too much work
for her alone. I'll help.

51
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,526
No, don't.

52
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,199
All of this happened because of you,
so you must take responsibility for it.

53
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,119
Officer Min.

54
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,831
Even so, it is way too much work
for her to handle on her own.

55
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,167
Please allow us apprentices
to help her out.

56
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,961
We will finish everything
by the end of the day.

57
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,131
Apprentice Goo was the one
who submitted the petition, not you girls.

58
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,427
None of you can help her.

59
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,314
A petition?

60
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,109
Yes, Your Highness. I knew
she was quite something when I saw her

61
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,527
criticizing your novel.

62
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,531
She must've really lost her mind
or something.

63
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,700
How dare an apprentice without a rank

64
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,243
submit a petition?

65
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,704
Targeting assistant clerks of all people.

66
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,750
What's so wrong with that?
They didn't have to make her cry.

67
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,293
Pardon?

68
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,922
So what's going on?
Is the situation very bad now?

69
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,423
Yes, very bad indeed.

70
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,052
Just as the Inner Palace
cannot function without court ladies,

71
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,679
the Outer Palace
cannot function without clerks.

72
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,767
She got on the wrong side of all
the clerks at the Office of Royal Decrees.

73
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,020
I give her 15 days at the most.

74
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,065
Her seniors will take their anger
out on her during the day,

75
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,027
and she'll have to work late every night.
She'll submit her letter of resignation

76
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,196
in 15 days at the most.

77
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,657
Still, knowing her personality--

78
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,784
She won't resign that easily.

79
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,411
-Right?
-She'll probably get fired.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,247
I give her ten days.

81
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,832
No, trust me.

82
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
She'll quit
before she gets screwed like that.

83
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,586
-Do you want to bet?
-Sure, five pun?

84
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,797
-Let's each bet one nyang.
-How about two nyang?

85
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,020
When did I finish all of this?

86
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,401
Apprentice Goo!

87
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,486
Are you all right?

88
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,530
Yes.

89
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,448
We ran here,
thinking you must be exhausted.

90
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,158
What did you do all night?

91
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,245
Why do you look at me like that?

92
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,332
You have a Chinese character
written on your face.

93
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,542
What?

94
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,472
What's this?

95
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,395
Was a ghost here or what?
Who on earth wrote this?

96
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
"Sparrow"?

97
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,029
What could this mean?

98
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,782
Gosh, I'm so scared.

99
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,087
What is this? Jeez.

100
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,898
Did something happen last night, sir?

101
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,155
Oh, well...

102
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,034
You do not need to know.

103
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,996
His Highness spent a passionate night.

104
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,840
Two hours have passed already.

105
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,051
What is the problem today?
Why is she late again?

106
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,554
No one here knows the reason,
Your Highness.

107
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,056
She's probably just running late.

108
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,267
Why do you have to wait outside?

109
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,644
It is too hot today.

110
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,189
I don't think she's just running late,
knowing what's going on at her office.

111
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,024
Didn't you see last night?

112
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,153
They made her work all night
with a huge pile of work to finish.

113
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,115
Who cares whether she had
a little or huge pile of work to do?

114
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,451
Why do you even care, Your Highness?

115
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
How can I not care? Goo Hae-ryung is...

116
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,919
I mean, she is Maehwa's sworn enemy.

117
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,464
I have to be the first one
to laugh at her.

118
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,801
You helped her with everything though.

119
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,598
I can go for a walk.

120
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,559
I wish to go for a walk.

121
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,853
Great. Taking a walk will help you...

122
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,900
How far do you wish to go, Your Highness?

123
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,422
All right, look.

124
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,382
It is peaceful and quiet.

125
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,845
We should go back now that
you've made sure everything is fine.

126
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,100
"Sweet words can hide dark intentions."

127
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,523
It does seem peaceful, but horrible things
might be happening inside.

128
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,442
What kinds of horrible things could happen

129
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,445
in the middle of the palace
in broad daylight?

130
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,989
Things like
coercion, assault, attempted murder,

131
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,908
and firing Goo Hae-ryung, for instance.

132
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,494
My goodness.

133
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,996
I must do something.

134
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,999
Let's sneak in and see

135
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,293
what Goo Hae-ryung is up to
and if she's okay.

136
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254
But... Wait.

137
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,215
This could get you in deep trouble,
Your Highness.

138
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,593
All the historical records are stored here
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

139
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,471
Even just loitering around like this
could raise suspicions...

140
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,931
Please listen...

141
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,324
Your Highness.

142
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,327
Could you please explain
that look on your face now?

143
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,499
-Your Highness, do you--
-You two over there!

144
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,885
What are you doing here?
I've never seen you before.

145
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,095
Well...

146
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,222
He is...

147
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,851
-He's what?
-I mean, this punk is...

148
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,229
I guess he doesn't know
his way around the palace yet.

149
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,440
I found him wandering here,
looking all lost.

150
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,610
Hence, I was just helping him
find his way.

151
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,823
Gosh, you dimwit.

152
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,830
The administrative area is tiny.
You got lost here?

153
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,041
Where do you work?

154
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,210
-Pardon me?
-Which office do you belong to?

155
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,925
I work over there...

156
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,468
The Royal Secretariat.

157
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,598
The Royal Secretariat.
I work at the Royal Secretariat.

158
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,849
The Royal Secretariat?

159
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,603
By any chance, did Scribe Jegal...

160
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,356
Correct.

161
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,691
Jegal...

162
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,403
I knew it.

163
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,115
That jerk, Jegal Tak, can be obnoxious,
but he is a loyal man.

164
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,994
Let's go.
There is a mountain of work to do.

165
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,704
Tell me. Are you strong?

166
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,623
-Yes.
-Wait, where are you taking him?

167
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,707
-Wait.
-I'll do anything.

168
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,876
-Nice, that's the spirit!
-What is Jegal Tak up to now?

169
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,003
-He's sitting at his desk.
-Gosh!

170
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,421
I see. He's sitting at his desk.

171
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,883
Gosh, Your Highness! We must return to...

172
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,519
I wish to get some rest.
Do not let anyone in for an hour.

173
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,479
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

174
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,573
I said I do not need

175
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,409
a historian here
as the lecture took too long.

176
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,576
You may leave.

177
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,873
I have my duties to fulfill, just like
you have your own, Your Royal Highness.

178
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,461
So? Are you saying
you wish to disobey my words?

179
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,047
You always treated me
as if I was practically invisible.

180
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,175
You can do the same thing today.

181
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,405
Why did you

182
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,574
decide to be a historian?

183
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,244
I've always been curious

184
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,914
as to why a woman like you
chose such a tough profession.

185
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,004
-What do you mean by that?
-You have everything.

186
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,257
Your father isn't a high-ranking official,
but his authority over personnel matters

187
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,009
makes him as powerful as ministers.

188
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,720
Your family owns five mansions
in Hanyang alone

189
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,765
and harvests over 10,000 seok of rice
all over the country every year.

190
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,642
I heard dozens of families
wanted to marry their sons off to you.

191
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,852
So why?

192
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,189
Why did you abandon the comfortable life
and decide to be a historian?

193
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,150
What more do you want in life?

194
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,990
It's nine, not five.

195
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,327
My father owns four more houses in Hanyang

196
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,995
under his concubine's name.

197
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,956
Also, he owns almost 8,000 majigi of land
under our relatives' names,

198
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,834
which means we harvest
over 15,000 seok of rice every year.

199
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,211
However,

200
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
none of that is mine.

201
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,050
They're not yours?

202
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,135
Yes, he is a section chief.

203
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,639
But those who want to curry favor with him
are only the ones

204
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,766
who cannot achieve anything on their own.

205
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,602
Thus,
all the glory is fleeting and futile.

206
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,396
The same goes for all the houses and land.

207
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,359
His adopted son, whom I've never even met,
will end up inheriting all of them

208
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,861
instead of me since I am a woman.

209
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,785
Therefore, I have nothing.

210
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,038
And that is why I became a historian.

211
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,591
OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES

212
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,596
I picked up the petitions, sir.

213
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,235
What on earth are you doing here now?

214
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,446
I'm grinding ink, as you can see.

215
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,908
I mean, why are you here--

216
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,119
Have you never seen a clerk
from the Royal Secretariat?

217
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,954
What's with all the fuss?

218
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,706
Did you say, "a clerk"?

219
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,833
Yes, Clerk Yi from the Royal Secretariat.

220
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,044
Scribe Jegal sent him over.
He can work as our servant today.

221
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,256
"Our servant"?

222
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,466
Hey, are you going to grind ink all day?

223
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,761
-Take this to the Office of Censors.
-Yes, sir.

224
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,557
My gosh.

225
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,772
By the way,
where is the Office of Censors, sir?

226
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,776
Are you a lunatic?

227
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,738
Clerk Yi.

228
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,032
I'll show you where it is.

229
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,291
What is going on?

230
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,376
"Clerk Yi from the Royal Secretariat"?

231
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,588
Anyhow,
you should get out of here at once.

232
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,757
I don't know
what misunderstanding caused this,

233
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,051
but please forget what happened today.
Go back and...

234
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,303
I don't want to.

235
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,931
I heard your office needs help.

236
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,558
If I leave, you'll have to do
all the clerks' work too.

237
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,394
They've always treated me like one anyway.

238
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,397
Why would you volunteer
to put up with this ordeal, Your Highness?

239
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,732
It is not an ordeal.

240
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,527
It's quite refreshing to experience
something like this. It's interesting.

241
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,742
-You think it's interesting?
-Artists should always be open-minded.

242
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,160
Who knows?

243
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,287
Today's predicament

244
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,414
might be transformed
into a beautiful love story

245
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,333
between a clerk and a female historian
later on.

246
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,713
So, I'd like you to keep your lips sealed
about my true identity today.

247
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,548
Then,

248
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,928
are you saying
I should treat you like a clerk today?

249
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,596
Yes.

250
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,349
Why? Do you not want to?

251
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,232
Clerk Yi, wait up.

252
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,402
Gosh, come on.

253
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,626
Clerk Yi.

254
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,388
I asked you to pick up the reports,

255
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,393
but these are all torn and ripped.
Are you blind or what?

256
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,479
Are your eyes like decorations
that serve no purpose?

257
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,232
You're being too harsh.
Everyone makes mistakes...

258
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,112
I apologize, sir.

259
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,372
I can't stop thinking
that he looks exactly like Prince Dowon.

260
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,668
Why would the Prince put up with this
unless he's completely out of his mind?

261
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
I'm sure he's just someone
who looks like him.

262
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,608
Have some water.

263
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,487
You're the only one who looks out for me.

264
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,408
Hold on. Where did it go?

265
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
What are you looking for?

266
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,704
The administration record
I was working on is gone.

267
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,165
It was right here until a moment ago.
Gosh!

268
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,626
How could you misplace that?

269
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,211
Everyone, look for it!

270
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,337
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,923
For heaven's sake.

272
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,191
What did he lose?
What's all this fuss about?

273
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,654
Do you really know nothing
about the royal court?

274
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,532
It is a document that combines
some historical records,

275
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,410
the Royal Secretariat's daily records,
and so on.

276
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,580
Everyone is worried as it contains
strictly confidential information.

277
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,166
A document that consists
of a number of pages?

278
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,375
Yes, that's right.

279
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,297
How do you know?

280
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,593
Hey!

281
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,345
How could you confuse these two?

282
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,390
I can't believe you failed
to distinguish this from this.

283
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,727
The administration record
looks nothing like this report.

284
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,520
I asked you to drop this report off,

285
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,772
not this administration record!

286
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,109
This is the administration record,
and this is the report!

287
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,111
Scold them more, please.

288
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,322
Thank goodness Officer Kim found it first.

289
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,616
Had the record ended up
in someone else's hands,

290
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,743
all of us would've had to resign.

291
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,999
-This is no good. Officer An.
-Yes, sir.

292
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,877
Go and discover
some moving stories with these two.

293
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,256
You two have proven that your brains
are useless. Do some legwork instead!

294
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,384
Where are we supposed to go, sir?
You mean, outside the palace?

295
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,553
Do you think you can discover
moving stories here?

296
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,558
Please don't try to use your brain
outside the palace, okay?

297
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,143
Ask the questions you're given

298
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,312
and only write down what you hear.
Do you understand?

299
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,647
Yes, sir.

300
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,566
What an innocent young man.

301
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,215
Please don't be distracted. Let's go.

302
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,052
Both of his parents died
from a terrible disease,

303
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,972
and everyone in the village
felt so bad for him.

304
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,182
We gave him rice and firewood.

305
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,771
Excuse me! Mister!
What do you think you're doing?

306
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,565
-I wanted to know the taste.
-Clerk Yi!

307
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,024
What the heck?

308
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,318
I can't sell it now
because you drank from the bottle!

309
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,779
Wait, ma'am! Please! I'll buy it.

310
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,573
How much is it? How much is the wine?

311
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,200
-How much do I have to pay you?
-Give me that.

312
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,452
My goodness.

313
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,870
Ta-da.

314
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,668
The mountain god must've been moved
by his filial piety.

315
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,297
Lightning streaked across the sky
all of a sudden,

316
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,757
and the rock split in half.

317
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,843
Then underneath the rock,
this 100-year-old--

318
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
-Bellflower root?
-What...

319
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,180
It is a bellflower root.

320
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,058
This isn't wild ginseng.

321
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,185
-Hey.
-Get him.

322
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,563
Have you ever seen wild ginseng?
What do you even know?

323
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,440
-Get him!
-Jeez, you punk.

324
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,026
-Catch that punk!
-Damn it.

325
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,739
The moment I spotted the tiger's eyes
sparkling in the dark forest,

326
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,826
I thought to myself,
"I will die if I don't kill him."

327
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,078
So, I firmly clenched my fist and--

328
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,123
Isn't this sold in Qing--

329
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,499
Clerk Yi!

330
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,799
Have this.

331
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,218
You must be hungry
from constantly blabbing about things

332
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,181
-that no one even asked about.
-But I'm pretty sure this is...

333
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,852
I'm going to leave you here
if you say one more word.

334
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,492
Yes! She looked exactly like this.

335
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,869
My gosh, it's just as I remember it.

336
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,631
Sir! Please make sure you find her!

337
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,426
Excuse me.

338
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,098
We are here to verify your story.

339
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,141
Are you the blacksmith...

340
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,773
who was revived from the brink of death
thanks to a female physician?

341
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,277
Oh, that. I already shared all the details
with the officer who was just here.

342
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,570
Someone was here?

343
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,699
Yes, sir. He said he was looking for her
to reward her for saving my life,

344
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,410
so I showed him this

345
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,912
and also told him what she looks like.

346
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,996
Who could it be?

347
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,463
I'm impressed
that you managed to stay put.

348
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,300
You said,

349
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,263
"Clerk Yi, wait here."
So I couldn't go anywhere.

350
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,390
How nice of you to listen to me.

351
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,311
Well, did we waste our time again
with this one?

352
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,274
Yes, I don't think
I can go home early today.

353
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,025
You should return to the palace.

354
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,027
The sun will go down soon.

355
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,239
-You can't finish all this by yourself--
-Gosh, it's okay.

356
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,658
At the moment,
everyone at the Office of Royal Decrees

357
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,286
thinks that I'm the biggest troublemaker
and resents me,

358
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,288
so I must discover
at least one moving story.

359
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,832
-You know your way back, don't you?
-No, I don't.

360
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,878
I've lived in the palace my entire life.
I don't know my way around here.

361
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,422
Hence, I'd like you to walk me back.

362
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,591
On your way home,
after you finish everything.

363
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,635
Then, why don't I walk you back now--

364
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,095
Where are we going next?

365
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,976
Your Highness!
Gosh, please give me that. I'll carry it.

366
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,438
What is the matter with you?

367
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,107
Goodness.

368
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,028
He had the same wound as

369
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,572
the man who died in the Royal
Investigation Bureau. That's her.

370
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,617
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

371
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,046
Who is it?

372
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,731
Who is here?

373
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,364
Third Inspector.

374
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,284
We're looking for someone
on the Second State Councillor's order.

375
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,454
This is my close friend's residence.

376
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,166
I do not know who you're looking for,
but that person isn't here.

377
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,584
Are you here alone, sir?

378
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,586
I am waiting alone at the moment

379
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,129
as my friend is held up at work.

380
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,008
I apologize for the trouble.

381
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,986
Please don't worry.

382
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,697
You are safe now.

383
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,832
How did you find me?

384
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,751
Answer me.
Have you been tailing me all along?

385
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,130
Have you been monitoring
what I've been up to all these years?

386
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,548
Mo-hwa.

387
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,926
Mo-hwa.

388
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,156
I decided not to kill you today

389
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,409
only because I used to adore you
like my own brother.

390
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,746
Stay out of my sight
for the rest of your life,

391
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,581
or I will kill you...

392
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,835
without a second's hesitation.

393
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,429
It should be somewhere around here.

394
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,892
A house with 33 rooms

395
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,686
and a pear tree in the front yard.

396
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,733
-Isn't it odd?
-Pardon me?

397
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,777
I haven't seen a single soul
for quite some time.

398
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,029
That's because it's getting late.

399
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,698
Everyone goes home before the curfew...

400
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,248
The curfew!

401
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,918
Your Highness,
you must return to the palace immediately.

402
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,921
You're a historian,
so we should be able to stay out--

403
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,632
Female historians don't receive
curfew-free passes.

404
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,551
Follow me quickly.

405
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,273
The curfew has commenced!

406
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,903
The curfew has commenced!

407
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,615
The curfew has commenced!

408
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,208
The curfew has commenced!

409
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,464
-The curfew has commenced!
-Your Highness.

410
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,718
Did you bring any royal guards

411
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,554
from the Crown Prince Protection Office
who can help us?

412
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,223
The curfew has commenced!

413
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,810
Then do you know anyone
in the Police Bureau

414
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
or in the City Administration Office?

415
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,484
The curfew has commenced!

416
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,448
What is the punishment
for disobeying the curfew?

417
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,868
The curfew has commenced!

418
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,745
Usually, they flog you ten times.

419
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,957
But you don't have an identification tag,
so you'll be flogged a lot more.

420
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,795
-Curfew has begun!
-I'll distract them.

421
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,422
You should run back to the palace.

422
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,428
-There is a way.
-The curfew has commenced!

423
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,638
There is...

424
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,769
something I heard
while writing Moonlight Love Affair.

425
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,733
The curfew has commenced!

426
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,860
You mean, this?

427
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,740
The curfew has commenced!

428
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,622
Please forgive my rudeness, Your Highness.

429
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,499
Look at those lovebirds.

430
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,794
We can see that you two young lovebirds
are so in love,

431
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,462
but pay attention to what you hear.

432
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,589
The curfew began a while ago.

433
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,174
We apologize.

434
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,761
Youngsters these days
are bold and fearless.

435
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,304
They are, indeed.

436
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,267
-The curfew has...
-The curfew has...

437
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,394
The curfew...

438
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,646
Thank goodness.

439
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,947
You can let go of me now.

440
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,962
I shall return to the palace now.

441
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,591
The constables must be patrolling
the entire city now.

442
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,718
The palace is

443
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:20,928
too far from here.

444
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,216
SEORAEWON, 20 YEARS AGO

445
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,999
Mo-hwa!

446
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,961
-I totally knew it.
-I knew she'd pull it off.

447
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,380
-Oh, my.
-I didn't think she'd succeed.

448
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,674
My gosh, this is truly impressive.

449
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,697
Lady Hae-ryung, do you know
what time it is now... My gosh.

450
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,325
Who is...

451
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,120
What in the world...

452
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,330
Be quiet. Jae-gyeong will hear you.

453
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,667
I can't be quiet about this!

454
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,128
What is this man doing here with you?

455
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,504
Don't tell me...

456
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,216
Have you been with him all this time?

457
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,385
Then last night...

458
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,305
Is that why
you didn't come home last night?

459
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:28,973
Did the two of you...

460
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,601
He is just my colleague.

461
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,354
We were working outside the palace,
but it's getting late,

462
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,898
and he lives far from here.

463
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,571
Let's go.
I'll have to sleep in your room today.

464
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,865
Hold on a moment, my lady.

465
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,663
Let's see.

466
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,639
My lady, take a good look at this man.

467
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,849
He is...

468
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,310
very handsome.

469
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,729
What?

470
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,358
It's a miracle to find such a face among
the seven million people on this land.

471
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,319
If there was an exam
that evaluates examinees' looks,

472
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,487
he'd get the top marks.

473
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,656
The same goes for his rank.
He'll become a senior first-rank official!

474
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,535
When it comes to such a fine man like him,
I suggest you snatch him

475
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,245
before any other ladies spot him.

476
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,540
Stop spewing complete nonsense, will you?

477
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,585
Could we please leave quietly?

478
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,629
Oh, my goodness.

479
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,005
What should we do?

480
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,717
I'm drying pumpkins
in my room at the moment,

481
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,803
so there's no space for you to lie down.

482
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,641
-What about the other--
-The same goes for her room.

483
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,311
-What about other rooms?
-It's the same everywhere, my lady.

484
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,065
All the rooms are filled with pumpkins.

485
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,900
There's no space for anyone.

486
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,240
So what do you say?
Will it be okay for you two

487
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,827
to share one blanket?

488
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,749
Are you cold?

489
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,044
No.

490
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,380
I'm okay.

491
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,299
Okay.

492
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,650
I'm thirsty.

493
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,194
Okay.

494
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,083
Your Highness.

495
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:31,090
I think it would be better for me
to sleep outside.

496
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,551
You can sleep here comfortably.

497
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,386
It's cold outside.

498
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,097
And there aren't any empty rooms.

499
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,475
Well, I...

500
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,521
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I just need a place to lie down.

501
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,526
And I have really bad sleeping habits.

502
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,028
I snore really loudly.

503
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,907
I even curse and throw things in my sleep.

504
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,244
It'll be hard for you to fall asleep.

505
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,918
Why do you smile?

506
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,298
I'm just relieved to see
that you also find me uncomfortable.

507
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,010
I'll sleep outside.

508
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,221
No one will be able to sleep at this rate.

509
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,057
No, you can't do that.

510
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,311
-I can't let you--
-It's what the wild goose wants.

511
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,063
Don't let it bother you.

512
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,697
I see. A sparrow can never understand
the views of a wild goose.

513
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,576
"Sparrow"?

514
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,121
SPARROW

515
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,584
I must be crazy.

516
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,726
Lady Hae-ryung.

517
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,188
Future groom.

518
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,786
What? Why is the room so clean?

519
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:33,957
They're so unnecessarily modest.

520
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,212
I can't believe they even folded
all the blankets.

521
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,024
My apologies, Your Highness.

522
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,150
Here you go.

523
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,279
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night

524
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,532
because I waited all night
for you to come home.

525
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,743
I'm so exhausted now
that my hands are shaking.

526
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,246
You have a pillow mark on your face.

527
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,462
You're unbelievable.

528
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,964
I heard you disappeared

529
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,299
with the female historian
after you left the palace.

530
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,011
Are you not thinking straight
because you've fallen for her?

531
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,681
Or were you always this irresponsible?

532
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,058
I get that you're young and hot-blooded,

533
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,936
but you need to keep your dignity
as a prince.

534
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,481
How could you let yourself loose like that
in just one day?

535
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,483
What are you thinking?

536
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,068
Nothing happened.

537
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,196
And nothing's going on between us
in the first place.

538
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,365
Do you take me for a fool?

539
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,118
You're both young,
and you spent the night together.

540
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,203
How do you expect me to believe
that nothing--

541
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,206
It's possible because I'm a prince,
and she's a historian.

542
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,591
Is she really
nothing but a historian to you,

543
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,093
Your Highness?

544
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,987
Why are you all so demotivated?
Let's hurry up.

545
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,032
This is due by 3 p.m.
This is due by 5 p.m.

546
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,160
And this is due within two hours.
There's so much work to do.

547
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,373
My gosh, do they think we're animals
who know how to write?

548
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,422
Officer Yang.

549
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,886
I can't do this anymore.

550
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,305
Please take care of this issue
with the clerks.

551
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,974
If you don't, I'm just going
to give myself a vacation.

552
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,476
What?

553
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,577
Please don't make things worse.
Things are already hectic as it is.

554
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,538
What's the use of working so hard?

555
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,166
They keep giving us so much work,

556
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,210
and everyone's criticizing us

557
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,920
saying we need to do a better job.

558
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,340
No wonder that clerk
from the Royal Secretariat ran away.

559
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,384
What do you expect me to do about that?

560
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,886
Should I barge into his house
and bring him here?

561
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,807
All they need is an apology from you.

562
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,226
Aren't I right?

563
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,727
They're just using the petition

564
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,105
as an excuse to salvage their pride.

565
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,190
So in order to make them happy,

566
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,068
you need to step up
as the head of all the historians.

567
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,619
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

568
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,746
He's right.

569
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,290
You should apologize
and ask them to come back.

570
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,793
I've gotten on my knees a lot,
so I know very well.

571
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,295
It's honestly not that hard.

572
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,930
What's going on?

573
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,141
Why are you doing this to me?

574
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,517
I'll go.

575
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,937
If they want to salvage their pride,

576
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,523
I should be the one to go.

577
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,652
Yes.

578
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,321
An apology from people like us
won't make them budge.

579
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,284
But if the Second State Councillor's son
apologizes on his knees,

580
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,495
it'll give them something
to gossip about over some drinks.

581
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,622
It'll be an honor to their families.

582
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,291
Then...

583
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,461
I'll go with you.

584
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,422
You told me to take responsibility

585
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,716
since I started all this.

586
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,385
I'll deal with this.

587
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,721
Please let me go.

588
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:01,975
Okay.

589
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,776
Hello.

590
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,202
Here.

591
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,039
I know it's not much,

592
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,791
but please enjoy.

593
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,380
You're right. It really isn't much.

594
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,217
There's not much to eat.

595
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,056
What kind of meals do you normally eat?

596
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,934
You make it sound like you eat gold.

597
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,275
-I'll ask them to bring something else.
-No, it's okay.

598
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,653
We'll just eat for your sake.

599
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,321
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

600
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,490
The japchae is nice.

601
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,243
When are you going to come back to work?

602
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,496
I'm not sure. We're very tired
from all the hard work we've been doing.

603
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,873
We know we should be going back,

604
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,875
but it's hard to bring ourselves to do so.

605
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,919
It's quite hard to make up our minds.

606
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,838
It sounds like...

607
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,967
you want something.

608
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,803
Officer Min,
that's quite upsetting to hear.

609
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,180
Why would we want anything from you?

610
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:28,311
We just want you to show us that you care.

611
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,314
Clerk Park!

612
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,359
But before that,

613
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,281
I'd like to teach that arrogant woman
some manners.

614
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,950
What are you doing? Hurry up and kneel.

615
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,077
Go on.

616
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,967
Enough.

617
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,637
Sit down.

618
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,682
-Pardon?
-You did nothing wrong.

619
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,268
There's no need for you to apologize.

620
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,607
Officer Min, if that's
how you're going to deal with this...

621
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,198
What's that?

622
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,492
A book of irregularities
committed by the clerks.

623
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,996
What? Irregularities?

624
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,956
What do you mean?

625
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,834
What kind of nonsense is that?

626
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,169
That's absurd.

627
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,964
-What irregularities?
-You're bluffing.

628
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,508
There can't be such a book.

629
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,846
We're just clerks.
Why would you keep a record of us?

630
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,350
I see.

631
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,895
Is that why you asked me
to tail Clerk Park?

632
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,358
Was it to keep a record
of all the bribes he accepted?

633
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:57,901
My goodness.

634
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,571
This is me showing you

635
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,740
that I care.

636
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,495
What do you say? Is this not enough?

637
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,800
You promised not to mention this again.
Please keep your word.

638
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,302
Officer Min is a man of his word.

639
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,722
You may trust him.
Just get ready to come back to work.

640
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,775
Officer Min, I didn't know

641
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,069
you knew how to bluff.

642
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,739
That book.

643
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,993
I opened it,
and there was nothing written inside.

644
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:51,079
How could you lie so well
without even flinching?

645
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,581
I do know about their irregularities.

646
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,794
I just didn't write them down.
I have them all in my head.

647
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,135
By the way,

648
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,139
about what you said to me earlier...

649
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,434
Did you really mean it?

650
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,188
Do you really think I did nothing wrong?

651
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,861
You were merely
trying to correct what's wrong.

652
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,530
That's not wrong.

653
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,116
I don't think it's wrong.

654
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,162
Then why did you say such words to me
that day?

655
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,415
Because you still must take responsibility
for doing what's right.

656
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,541
And...

657
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,798
I wanted you to learn on your own

658
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,470
that you're not just a girl
who only causes trouble.

659
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,166
That's more like it.

660
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:22,337
This is how experienced
a first historian is.

661
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,172
You little punks.

662
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,259
It was my idea to send Officer Min
and look at how well things got settled.

663
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,554
Imagine what would've happened
if I went there instead.

664
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:35,058
I'm so impressed
by how wise you are, Officer Yang.

665
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,439
Okay, then. Let's leave all this work

666
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,067
to the clerks.

667
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,777
Meanwhile,

668
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,737
let's go have some drinks.

669
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,365
Are you going to buy us drinks?

670
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:54,494
Yes, I'll use all my money
to buy you drinks.

671
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,463
-Officer Yang.
-Where do you think you're going?

672
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,967
We're going to drink on our own.

673
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,262
What? We also worked hard.

674
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,014
Go ahead and keep working.
Make sure you clean up afterward.

675
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,141
Now, let's go

676
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,852
-and have some drinks!
-Have some drinks!

677
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,567
My gosh.

678
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,950
Your Highness, Goo Hae-ryung,
the female historian has arrived.

679
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,035
Goo Hae-ryung?

680
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,706
What does a historian
have to say to a prince?

681
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,459
You don't normally come here at this hour.

682
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,170
I'm here to meet Clerk Yi today,

683
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,921
not Prince Dowon.

684
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,215
I'm here to tell him something.

685
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,092
What's that?

686
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,720
I came to thank him and to say goodbye.

687
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,598
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

688
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,850
And the clerks have come back to work.

689
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,061
So you don't need to come
to the Office of Royal Decrees anymore.

690
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,446
Why do you look so sad?

691
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,115
You went through so much yesterday.

692
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,621
Because I still liked it.

693
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,958
It was the first time someone called me by
my name. I was surrounded by such people.

694
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,919
And I also had work to do.

695
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,090
It made me delighted.
I had never experienced that before.

696
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,848
But you can write novels.

697
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,392
They lifted the bans on the books,

698
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:45,146
and I saw a lot of other romance novels
at the book store.

699
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,857
It's time for Maehwa to make a comeback.

700
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,901
Don't wait.

701
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,112
Maehwa will no longer be
writing any novels.

702
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,323
What? Why?

703
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,367
Because I don't want to.

704
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,745
I'm just kidding.

705
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,124
I also want to know

706
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,169
why I'm no longer able to write.

707
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,880
Why I'm no longer
able to write any novels.

708
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,799
By any chance,

709
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,385
is it the King's orders?

710
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,518
Aren't you happy?
You used to hate my novels.

711
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,981
But don't be too happy.
I'm starting to get upset.

712
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,024
No.

713
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,610
I'm not happy at all.

714
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,281
I finally understand

715
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,992
what writing means to you.

716
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,662
You lost something so precious.

717
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,123
How could I feel happy about that?

718
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,840
I saw your handwriting.

719
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,551
It was upright

720
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,469
and beautiful.

721
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,731
So please write something for me.

722
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,443
I'd like to receive a gift
from the Prince himself.

723
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,582
What did you write?

724
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,628
There's a poem I've been fond of
for a very long time.

725
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,799
And I figured it would be a nice gift.

726
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,471
-What kind of poem is it?
-Wait.

727
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,724
Let me read it one more time.

728
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,657
I HOPE YOU LIVE FOR A LONG TIME
AND BE THE OWNER OF MY HEART

729
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,913
I HOPE YOU LIVE FOR A LONG TIME

730
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,333
AND BE THE OWNER OF MY HEART

731
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,923
Don't get mistaken.

732
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,593
I only wrote this for you
because I like this poem very much.

733
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,430
There's no other meaning, okay?
I just really like this poem.

734
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:09,434
Your Highness, why would I get mistaken
over a poem?

735
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,186
Let me see it.

736
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,859
Your Highness.

737
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,819
You're being very weird.

738
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,530
You're only making me become more curious.

739
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,117
I think I made a mistake.

740
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,162
Let me write something else.
If there's anything you like...

741
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,039
I'll write something else.

742
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,001
I want what you already wrote.
Please hand it over.

743
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,462
Your Highness, stop being like that.

744
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,297
My gosh.

745
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,549
Your Highness, come on.

746
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,303
Your Highness!

747
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,057
His... His Majesty is...

748
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:16,834
Prince Dowon never had smallpox.

749
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,420
I will do as you say, Father.

750
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,880
Withdraw your order.

751
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,257
I may be his father,
but I'm also the King.

752
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,468
You're doing this
because you're not his father!

753
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,845
I've once suffered from smallpox.

754
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,223
She's the only one
who can protect Prince Dowon.

755
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,017
"Mo-hwa"? Did Her Majesty
really say "Mo-hwa"?

756
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,020
You weren't the one
who banished Prince Dowon.

757
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,104
You are out of line.

758
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,483
You're the governor of Pyongan Province,
so that's where you should be.

759
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,735
What are you doing here in Haeju?

760
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,821
The reports made to the government
are all lies.

761
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,240
Please help and save our people.

762
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,992
We're just trying to learn
what we don't know.

763
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,119
I must go to Pyongan Province right now.

764
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,082
