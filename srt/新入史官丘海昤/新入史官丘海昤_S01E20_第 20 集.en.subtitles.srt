1
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,212
20 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,305
Let's go.

3
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,984
What does it say?

4
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,243
I want you to write down what I say.

5
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,707
No! His Majesty will not
forgive you for this!

6
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,046
Yeong-san!

7
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,547
Yeong-san!

8
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,261
You don't have much time left
to save his life.

9
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,324
It's a son! You have a son!

10
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,077
Your Majesty!

11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,458
They committed treason!

12
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,293
Prince Hamyeong and Min Ik-pyeong

13
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,212
invaded the palace
with a group of soldiers!

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,047
You must hurry up and escape!

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,342
I want you to
protect the Queen and my son.

16
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,885
Your Majesty.

17
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,566
We found a letter written by you

18
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,278
that was on its way to Qing.

19
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,783
We, the vassals,

20
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,120
can no longer serve a traitor
who tried to hand over Joseon

21
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,748
to the barbarians of the West as our king.

22
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,709
You threatened our country's foundation
through your social gatherings

23
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,921
and made the people of this country
live in misery.

24
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,256
Admit your faults and kneel before us.

25
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
Let's get this straight.

26
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,482
It's not the letter
that caused you to betray me.

27
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,276
It's because I refused
to listen to the scholar-officials.

28
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,156
I just wanted to give everyone a chance
to learn and do something meaningful.

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,825
Just like how I gave people
from undistinguished families a chance

30
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,410
to become government officials,

31
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,082
I am going to do the same
for the peasants and women.

32
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,167
That is what you're guilty of!

33
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,798
You tried to overturn
the strict moral customs of this country!

34
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,050
What good are those customs

35
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,804
when they only allow the privileged
to study academics

36
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,265
and spread their wings?

37
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,520
That is not what this country should...

38
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,090
Jae-gyeong!

39
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,134
Jae-gyeong!

40
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,264
-Hurry up and lie him down.
-Okay.

41
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,102
What happened? Who did this?

42
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,272
I made changes to His Majesty's letter.

43
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,399
I don't know what to do now.

44
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,904
Please tell me what to do.
I'll do anything to set things right!

45
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,908
It's not your fault.

46
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,662
They probably planned this
for a very long time.

47
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,456
Teacher.

48
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,083
Please protect Hui-yeon.

49
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,711
You must stay alive.

50
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,010
I am a historian. Please let me in.

51
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,264
His Royal Highness has ordered us
to strictly guard Nokseodang.

52
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,266
Even historians aren't allowed to enter?

53
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,061
-How is this considered "guarding"?
-Your Highness.

54
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
FINALE

55
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,621
Lady Hae-ryung.

56
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,666
I was so worried.

57
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,961
A bunch of men dressed in black
barged into our house

58
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,839
and made a mess of your room
and your brother's room.

59
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,715
They work for Min Ik-pyeong.

60
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,011
Are you sure no one got hurt?

61
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,723
Yes. We found a separate place to stay.

62
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,142
Let's go there.

63
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,769
I am scared to even walk outside.

64
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,273
Gak-soe, lead the way
and show me where Jae-gyeong is.

65
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,234
What?

66
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,569
Yi Jin did that?

67
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,987
Yes.

68
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,907
His Royal Highness placed guards
in front of Nokseodang

69
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,036
and forbade Prince Dowon
from leaving the place.

70
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
He must've made up his mind.

71
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,419
The Queen Dowager sent you a letter.

72
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,423
Her Majesty has finally picked a date.

73
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,179
My lord.

74
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,351
Hae-ryung.

75
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,905
The person who found the daily record
was Third Inspector Goo's sister?

76
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,493
Yes, I am Goo Hae-ryung, an apprentice
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

77
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,953
Did you read the daily record?

78
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes.

79
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:18,998
However,

80
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,584
I can't tell you what it said.

81
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,213
I can't reveal it to anyone,

82
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,007
including you.

83
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,220
You must think that's your duty
since you're a historian.

84
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,933
However, that daily record
must be revealed to the world.

85
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,643
If we had that,

86
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,980
it wouldn't have taken so long
to achieve what we had planned to do.

87
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,815
If your plan is to set things right

88
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,528
regarding what happened
in the year of gyeongo,

89
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,155
I'd also like to take part.

90
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,534
-Hae-ryung.
-That day,

91
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,995
you two may have lost your teacher.

92
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,040
But I lost my father.

93
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,961
Why do you keep thinking
that I wasn't a victim?

94
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,672
His Royal Highness
refuses to listen to anyone,

95
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,674
and there are soldiers
guarding Nokseodang.

96
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,594
We can no longer guarantee
the safety of Prince Dowon.

97
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,096
If you have a plan,

98
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,098
please share it with me.

99
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,923
Chief Royal Secretary.

100
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,883
Did you really talk to His Majesty?

101
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,970
Yes, he told me that he'll be here.

102
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,848
He should've been here a long time ago.
Why isn't he coming?

103
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,435
Do you think
he's trying to turn his back on us

104
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,354
because things are getting out of hand?

105
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,150
I am not surprised. People have begun
to find out about the dethroned king.

106
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,986
And on top of that,
even the historians have started

107
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,779
to talk about the year of gyeongo.

108
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,074
Officer Min

109
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,119
is the one who started this.

110
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,080
He shouldn't have
brought that petition to the palace.

111
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey, watch your mouth.

112
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
I will punish

113
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,337
Officer Min myself.

114
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,551
However, the center of all this
is Prince Dowon.

115
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,762
The dethroned king's son is alive.

116
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,556
And that's why the Queen Dowager
and the people of Seoraewon

117
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,642
are continuing to have false hope.

118
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,977
My lord, are you planning to--

119
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,437
There will be a banquet

120
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,898
to celebrate the 20th year of
His Majesty's enthronement.

121
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,400
And before that banquet,

122
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,115
Prince Dowon will vanish soon.

123
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
My gosh.

124
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,180
Your Highness, you should eat.

125
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,059
You can't starve yourself
just because you don't feel well.

126
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,811
No, it's okay.

127
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,355
How are things outside?

128
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,692
Well, things are very quiet.

129
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,196
-It's like the calm before the storm.
-What about Hae-ryung? Is she doing okay?

130
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,700
My gosh, I can't believe you're worried
about her even in this situation.

131
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,535
The situation is what makes me worried.

132
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,746
I got confined
just for talking about the incident.

133
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,374
But Hae-ryung

134
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,293
even wrote a petition to His Majesty.

135
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,340
And there's nothing I can do

136
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,093
to keep her safe.

137
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,031
Who's there?

138
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,848
Someone entered this place.
Have you seen anyone?

139
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,725
No, that's impossible.

140
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,435
I can't believe they're going to hold
a banquet despite the current situation.

141
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,271
They should consider what's going on.

142
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,150
His Majesty cares about his face
more than the scriptures of Confucianism.

143
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,320
He's trying to show
that the royal family is doing fine.

144
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,364
I really don't get it.

145
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,700
He always ignores what's important.

146
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,457
The Office of the Inspector-General?

147
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,259
What?

148
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,052
Hey, what brings you here?

149
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,971
Officer Min, step forward.

150
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,600
The Second State Councillor
gave orders to imprison you

151
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,894
for having caused trouble
and rebuked the vassals

152
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,687
merely with a bunch of rumors.

153
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,231
-Take him.
-Yes, my lord.

154
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,943
What? No, wait.

155
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,240
If the petition is the problem,
you can take me instead.

156
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,035
I am the one who wrote that petition.

157
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,330
Officer Min just did
what I asked and read it out loud.

158
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,208
What do you think you're doing?

159
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,380
How can you accuse him like this?
All he did was read the petition out loud.

160
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,966
You can't punish historians
for what they say.

161
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,344
A historian's job is to record history,
not speak of it.

162
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,179
-Move aside.
-We can't do that.

163
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,181
This is obviously a retaliation.

164
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,725
You're trying to shut us up!

165
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,187
That's enough!

166
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
Don't cause a scene.

167
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
-Stay in your seats.
-Officer Min.

168
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,534
But...

169
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,170
Are you okay?

170
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,216
-Yes.
-How could this happen?

171
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,844
How could they use such an absurd reason

172
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,596
to arrest a historian?

173
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,557
Officer Yang, aren't you
going to do anything?

174
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Didn't you hear who gave that order?

175
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,062
He even arrests his own son.

176
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,024
Anyone who acts out
could literally get killed.

177
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,393
What brings you here?

178
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,644
Chief.

179
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,731
I have a favor to ask.

180
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,406
Your shift's over.

181
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,869
Get to your positions.

182
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,987
Your Highness.

183
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,870
-Hae-ryung.
-Your Highness.

184
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,158
BOOKSTORE

185
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,566
Whose house is this?

186
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,863
You should go inside.

187
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,324
They are waiting for you.

188
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,808
I...

189
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,561
So Baek-seon, the military chief,

190
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,940
am honored to greet the one and only heir

191
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,691
of the royal family.

192
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,514
I served the Queen

193
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,810
ever since she was pregnant with you.

194
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,606
I was there on the day

195
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,776
that you were born.

196
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,486
What kind of person

197
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,406
was my mother?

198
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,202
No one ever told me about her.

199
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,539
She was very wise and benevolent.

200
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,334
She never mistreated anyone
just because they weren't aristocrats.

201
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,547
And she even taught court ladies
how to read and write.

202
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,676
Your Highness.

203
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,845
We have already

204
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,389
passed the point of no return.

205
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,766
We are going to end everything
at the banquet

206
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,602
that's going to be held in a few days.

207
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,191
However, if anything goes wrong,

208
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:03,905
we'll no longer be able to protect you
by your side. So please--

209
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,949
Don't tell me to stay out of this.

210
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,743
I don't want to be a coward.

211
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,785
It doesn't matter.

212
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,620
You must stay out of this.

213
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,499
The Queen Dowager and I have endured
such a long period of time

214
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,128
just so we could protect you.

215
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,756
No matter what happens,
we must make sure...

216
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,759
that you're safe.

217
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,014
If we don't come back by 7:30 p.m.,

218
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,641
you must leave immediately.

219
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,154
The palace is a mess
because of the daily record and whatnot.

220
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,573
Must we hold a banquet?

221
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,242
If we cancel it last minute,

222
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,661
people will only be more suspicious.

223
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,208
And you must show everyone
that you're still standing strong.

224
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,294
Okay, fine.

225
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,421
Do whatever you want.

226
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,549
There's one thing you must keep in mind.

227
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,303
The royal family and government officials
will be there.

228
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,306
The Queen Dowager might use that day
to her advantage.

229
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,476
Therefore, don't get swayed
regardless of what happens.

230
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,979
What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,525
I am saying

232
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,445
you should accept
whatever I might do to Prince Dowon

233
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,322
and the Queen Dowager.

234
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,868
Prince Dowon is locked up.
He's not even allowed to leave his place.

235
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,663
-What more can you do--
-Everything I do

236
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,292
is for His Majesty and you,
the successor of the royal throne.

237
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,878
My judgement is not wrong.

238
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,089
Please do not forget

239
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,509
that you two can be here now
because of my decision 20 years ago.

240
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,851
What exactly is that duty of mine
that you are speaking of?

241
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,312
Just being the powerless,
weak, pathetic prince

242
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,522
who is confined to his residence?

243
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,483
Yes. That is your duty.

244
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,986
You cannot and should not do anything.

245
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,099
Your Royal Highness.

246
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,648
What brings you all the way here?

247
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,817
Did you read the daily record?

248
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,197
I am not asking you to show it to me.

249
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,825
I just need an answer to one question.
I have to check something.

250
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,706
-Will you not do that for me?
-As you already know,

251
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,418
I did many things
I shouldn't have done as a historian.

252
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,965
But for the first time,
I think I am doing the right thing.

253
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,885
Please wait here.

254
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,430
I wrote down a copy
because Officer Min told me to.

255
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,529
My lord.

256
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,052
What happened?

257
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,887
His Royal Highness set him free.

258
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,978
What are you doing outside?

259
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,980
Can't you fall asleep?

260
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,235
How can I sleep when your room

261
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,070
is right next to mine?

262
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,245
I was just thinking.

263
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,333
"What will happen to me after tomorrow?"

264
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,505
If things don't go well,
please don't move.

265
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,216
If I end up leaving,

266
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,427
I'll need an address to write to.

267
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,097
There's no need.

268
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,268
Wherever you are,

269
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,439
I'll be there with you.

270
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,737
You finally left the palace
and met people who wish to follow you.

271
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,948
So,

272
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,161
I can't let you become all alone again
without having anyone to lean on.

273
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,373
I won't allow that.

274
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,541
I will stay

275
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,044
by your side.

276
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,803
No.

277
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,847
You should live the life you want.

278
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,559
-Your Highness.
-The day I left the palace,

279
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,562
I realized something as I saw you

280
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,773
standing in the garden.

281
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,819
I wasn't locked up in Nokseodang.

282
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,571
I was just waiting for you.

283
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,952
My whole life,

284
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,414
I waited for you

285
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,917
to come and find me.

286
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,505
So it's okay...

287
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,676
even if I must change my name

288
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,679
and keep moving around to run away.

289
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,347
"I am waiting for the day

290
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,560
when I can see her again."

291
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,522
If I think like that,

292
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,443
I can get through anything.

293
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,566
Bow four times!

294
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,152
Bow.

295
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,282
All rise.

296
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,038
Bow.

297
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,252
All rise.

298
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,631
Bow.

299
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,593
All rise.

300
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,766
Bow.

301
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,856
All rise.

302
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,248
This is from all the royal relatives
and senior officials of the royal court.

303
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,043
"Because Your Majesty quelled the rebels
in the year of gyeongo

304
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,755
and protected this kingdom,
this reign of peace could begin.

305
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,676
Hence, all living things on this land
are indebted to Your Majesty.

306
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,720
May Your Majesty

307
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,389
live a long, healthy life

308
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,268
so that you can continue to leave
your mark in history for years to come."

309
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,062
-For years to come.
-For years to come.

310
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,036
What are you doing? Get back to your spot.

311
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,247
Your Majesty,

312
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,750
I, Third Inspector Goo Jae-gyeong,

313
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,294
wish to confess to the crime I committed
in the year of gyeongo

314
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,338
and ask you to punish me for what I did.

315
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,091
The dethroned king's secret letter
found at the borders

316
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,469
was fabricated.

317
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,474
Min Ik-pyeong,
who was the Fourth Censor at the time,

318
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,019
ordered me to revise the letter
so that it reads

319
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,814
the dethroned king wishes to sell
Joseon off to foreigners from the West.

320
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,025
The dethroned king
and everyone at Seoraewon

321
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,736
were set up by Min Ik-pyeong.

322
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,577
Here,

323
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,581
I have evidence to prove it.

324
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,796
In this letter, which the French physician
at Seoraewon sent to his brother,

325
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,258
he wrote that the King of Joseon does not
believe in Catholicism and that Seoraewon

326
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,306
is a place where people study
new culture and technology.

327
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,850
Third Inspector Goo,
you must leave at once!

328
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,479
How dare you spew such nonsense
on this happy day?

329
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,647
Your Majesty.

330
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,857
I sincerely beg you.

331
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,193
Second State Councillor Min Ik-pyeong

332
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,278
dared to deceive you,

333
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:14,033
brought disgrace upon the royal court,
and caused such dishonorable tragedy

334
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,077
that cannot be undone.

335
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,162
Please take his life

336
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,665
along with mine.

337
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,389
Your Majesty,

338
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,599
Third Inspector Goo used to work

339
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,727
at Seoraewon, which makes him a criminal.

340
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,397
He should have been executed 20 years ago.

341
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,816
However, he has managed to stay alive

342
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,027
because he betrayed
his teacher and friends.

343
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,114
Who would believe anything
that comes out of his mouth?

344
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,616
I agree, Your Majesty.
He used to be at Seoraewon.

345
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,660
What more do we need to hear?

346
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,787
He is slandering

347
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,874
the Second State Councillor as well as
all other high-ranking officials.

348
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,877
That's right. He is trying to
drive a wedge between Your Majesty and us

349
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,047
for he is holding a deep grudge
against all of us.

350
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,840
-He must be dragged out at once.
-However,

351
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,010
the fact that he used to work
at Seoraewon is not important--

352
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,303
Be quiet!

353
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,016
Anyone who supports him

354
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,311
will be punished for treason.

355
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,277
Second State Councillor.

356
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,615
Then, go ahead and punish me first
for treason.

357
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,078
If believing that man's words
is considered a crime,

358
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,664
go ahead and take
this old woman's life first!

359
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,213
Are you finally revealing
your true colors?

360
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,381
Second State Councillor!

361
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,636
The Queen Dowager has been in league
with the remnants of Seoraewon

362
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,055
to disseminate The Story of Ho Dam,

363
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,682
exhibiting her disrespect
toward Your Majesty.

364
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,310
She is trying to sabotage me
and Your Majesty

365
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,688
so that Prince Dowon
can ascend the throne.

366
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,566
Until when must I pretend
I know nothing about her plan?

367
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,361
Even at this very moment,

368
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,491
soldiers from the Military Training Corps
are on standby waiting for her orders.

369
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,667
Your Majesty!

370
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,363
Dowon, you should not be here now.

371
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,781
Leave.

372
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,701
I am no longer

373
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,162
Prince Dowon.

374
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,252
I am the son of Yi Gyeom, Prince Huiyeong.

375
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,547
I am Yi Rim.

376
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,716
Dowon!

377
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,763
Shut your mouth!

378
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,267
You have had many chances to kill me

379
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,021
in the past 20 years.

380
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,023
So why is it

381
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,650
that you have kept me alive?

382
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,695
Is it not

383
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,115
because you also know

384
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,202
that the dethronement cannot be justified?

385
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,914
-I told you to shut your mouth!
-Because of your guilt

386
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,959
of killing your innocent brother

387
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,048
and stealing the throne from him,

388
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,220
you have kept me alive until this day.

389
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,642
Such insolence.

390
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,144
How dare you.

391
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,244
All historians must stop writing!

392
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,005
Did you not hear my royal order?

393
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,926
If you do not leave at once,
you will be beheaded right here!

394
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,033
How dare she...

395
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,286
A female historian is disobeying my order?

396
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,375
What are you all waiting for?
Drag that wench out of here!

397
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,586
Your Majesty!

398
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,385
Your Majesty.

399
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,346
Even if you slash my throat,

400
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,850
we historians will continue writing.

401
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,484
If I die, one of my fellow historians
will take my place.

402
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,945
If you kill that historian also,

403
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,781
another historian will take his place.

404
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,828
Even if you kill all the historians
on this land

405
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,332
and take all the writing brushes
and paper from us,

406
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,669
you will not be able to stop us.

407
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,342
From mouth to mouth,

408
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,472
from teachers to their pupils,
and from elders to children,

409
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,642
history will be told.

410
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,773
That is...

411
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,527
the power of the truth.

412
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,235
Your Majesty!

413
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,320
We historians

414
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,739
cannot back down.

415
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,203
Your Majesty, they are all traitors.

416
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,247
Please do not hesitate.

417
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,166
Take their lives at once.

418
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,299
-Your Majesty!
-Drop your sword.

419
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,615
Your Majesty.

420
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,826
A truly loyal subject

421
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,371
never tries to blind and deafen the king.

422
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,040
Do you still not see it?

423
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,127
The Second State Councillor
is the one who is trying

424
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,088
to sabotage Your Majesty,
your kingdom, and your people.

425
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,257
He is the one

426
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,926
who is trying to harm you.

427
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,443
Please accept the request

428
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,070
from Prince Dowon and the historians.

429
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,824
If anyone was falsely accused,
please reinstate them.

430
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,618
And if anyone committed a crime,

431
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,369
please punish them.

432
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,706
Find out the truth

433
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,125
behind everything that happened
in the year of gyeongo

434
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,836
through a special investigation committee.

435
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,137
Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

436
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,516
Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

437
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,227
Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

438
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,898
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

439
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,901
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Right the wrongs!

440
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:13,405
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

441
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,367
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Right the wrongs!

442
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,495
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

443
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,664
-Please, Your Majesty!
-Right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

444
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,000
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

445
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:29,338
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

446
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,131
-Please right the wrongs!
-Your Majesty!

447
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,010
Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

448
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,181
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

449
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:44,353
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

450
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:49,191
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

451
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,404
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

452
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:58,200
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

453
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,160
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please!

454
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,289
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

455
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:08,085
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

456
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,297
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please, Your Majesty!

457
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,924
Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty.

458
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:18,095
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please, Your Majesty!

459
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,390
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!
-Please right the wrongs, Your Majesty!

460
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,018
-Please right the wrongs...
-Please, Your Majesty!

461
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,326
You'll have to pour me a drink
at my memorial ceremony every year,

462
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,579
so I suppose
I shouldn't ask you to do it yet.

463
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,956
Did you have to do such a thing?

464
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,172
In my childhood memories,

465
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,134
you were always like a big mountain.

466
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,764
You were never stingy
when it came to books

467
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,185
even though that meant
you had to wear shabby clothes.

468
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,191
You fought against the scholar-officials

469
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,570
with nothing but courage and knowledge.

470
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,450
So why...

471
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,036
What made you...

472
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,874
What made you become like this, Father?

473
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,215
Do you remember?

474
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,221
"U-won.

475
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,521
We scholars must have a clear conscience.

476
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,817
That is our duty as scholars."

477
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,363
You once said that to me.

478
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,824
That is how you taught me.

479
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,160
Right.

480
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,454
When I was young,

481
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,623
I used to hate the scholar-officials.

482
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,003
They monopolized authority
with the highborn nobles

483
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:00,174
and completely shut the weak
out of opportunities.

484
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,760
However,

485
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,054
once I came into possession
of power myself,

486
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,683
I did not want anyone
to take it away from me.

487
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,690
Power...

488
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,610
is like the Spring of Greed.

489
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,947
You get blinded by your greed
the moment you taste a drop of it.

490
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,035
After all,

491
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,787
I was just one of those

492
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,748
ordinary men.

493
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,794
Nevertheless,

494
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,923
I do not regret the decision I made
in the year of gyeongo.

495
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,636
The dethroned king led the people astray
with the foreigners' teachings

496
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,430
and violated the moral standards.

497
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,474
He was wreaking havoc on this kingdom,

498
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,602
which the former kings and the
wise scholars had worked so hard to build.

499
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,687
Someone had to stop him.

500
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,565
Even if you cannot understand me now,

501
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,902
history will prove
that I made the right decision.

502
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,121
No.

503
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,126
You're wrong.

504
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,213
A new world will come.

505
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,006
Not the world of scholar-officials,

506
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,386
which the former kings
and the scholars built together.

507
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,181
It'll be a world created by the people,

508
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,267
for the people.

509
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,728
Joseon will become such a nation.

510
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,691
That is...

511
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,320
what I will write.

512
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,258
How did it go?

513
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,219
The special investigation
committee's hearings will begin tomorrow.

514
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,890
They are summoning Min Ik-pyeong
as well as everyone else

515
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,059
who partook in the dethronement process.

516
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,561
I've submitted
Officer Kim Il-mok's records

517
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,939
to the special investigation committee.

518
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,746
-Hae-ryung.
-I know

519
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,831
that you must be

520
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,960
so relieved now.

521
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,381
But please don't expect me

522
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,676
to act like I am okay.

523
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,388
I am barely managing to hold it all in.

524
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,936
I did not

525
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,773
choose to take care of you
because of guilt.

526
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,154
To me,

527
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,490
you have always been...

528
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,244
my sister.

529
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,546
I will

530
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,507
always be your sister.

531
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,136
Goo Jae-gyeong's sister,

532
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:16,888
Goo Hae-ryung.

533
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,106
You silly goose.

534
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,446
His Majesty said he will

535
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,073
leave everything in your hands.

536
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,742
I see.

537
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,747
Everyone who was involved in it,
including Min Ik-pyeong,

538
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,332
will receive the punishment they deserve.

539
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,918
As soon as the investigation is completed,

540
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:48,879
I will

541
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,256
step down as the Crown Prince.

542
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,218
I hope you won't resent me too much.

543
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,055
I won't, Your Majesty.

544
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,520
Your Majesty.

545
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,405
I will leave.

546
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,948
No,

547
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,742
you need to hear this too.

548
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,085
Your Majesty,
please dethrone me as a prince.

549
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,129
-Dowon.
-I am aware that you have wished

550
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,174
for me to ascend the throne
for a long time.

551
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,969
However, that is not where I belong.

552
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,805
What do you mean?

553
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,100
You are the only son of the former king.

554
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,519
That is where you should be.

555
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:50,273
Even the times that I've lived as a prince
was too much for me to handle.

556
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:54,945
Instead of living the life expected of me
as someone's son, I now wish to live...

557
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,531
as an ordinary man,

558
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,825
as myself.

559
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,119
That is not what your fate
has in store for you.

560
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:06,665
You were born to be
the King of this country.

561
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,624
I do not

562
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,127
wish to live such a life.

563
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,254
You ought to do it
even if you do not want to.

564
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,507
The beginning

565
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,468
is always the hardest for everyone.

566
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,972
However, if you just
get through that stage,

567
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,559
you will become a sage king
whom everyone greatly admires.

568
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:30,355
I will assist you
to the best of my ability.

569
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,610
NOKSEODANG

570
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,285
-How did it go?
-Not well.

571
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,911
I think the Queen Dowager

572
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,289
needs more time to accept it.

573
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,669
What about you?

574
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,546
Are you ready

575
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,550
to leave Nokseodang?

576
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:09,311
NOKSEODANG

577
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,850
Yes.

578
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,312
It's not like

579
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,440
I'll forget all the memories of this place

580
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,318
once I leave.

581
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,073
Let's think of it as turning a page.

582
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,452
This isn't the end.

583
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,081
A new chapter will begin.

584
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,584
All right.

585
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,605
3 YEARS LATER

586
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,026
Oh, dear.

587
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,916
Hey, Yang!

588
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,504
Hey, Yang. Bang, bang!

589
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,007
Keep that up,
and I'll punch you real hard.

590
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,966
Hey, come on.

591
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,136
We are all seventh-rank officers.
Ease up, please.

592
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,345
Don't worry. It's okay.

593
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,978
Hey, clerks.

594
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,315
Finish it by three o'clock.

595
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,151
We are no longer clerks.
We are administrators now.

596
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,278
The junior ninth rank!

597
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,698
His Majesty gave us the rank long ago.
Why are you still calling us "clerks"?

598
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
Hey, it's not even that much better
than being a clerk.

599
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,288
It's very different.
There's a huge difference, okay?

600
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,205
Don't ever forget.

601
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,418
We were the ones who pulled all-nighters
and got all the work done

602
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,088
when you senior officers were swamped
because the Annals Compilation Committee

603
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,884
for both the former king
and the king before him was formed.

604
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,845
I am just speechless.

605
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,514
That little...

606
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,100
Until when will they go on about that?

607
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,186
For the next 500 years, probably.

608
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,063
-Officer Yang.
-Yes?

609
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,483
Do you have complaints?

610
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,110
Want some?

611
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,946
That rice cake won't do.

612
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,908
I found acorns.

613
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,577
-Well done. Put them down here.
-The footsteps...

614
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,167
Sa-hui.

615
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,878
Something else came for you
from the palace.

616
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,463
Oh, boy.

617
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,300
Who keeps sending you these things?

618
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,428
ELEMENTARY LEARNING

619
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,554
MYUNGSHIMBOGAM

620
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,686
I can finally take off
this mourning dress.

621
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,065
Who knew three years would feel this long?

622
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,566
U-hui.

623
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,193
What?

624
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,904
I am no longer married
to the Crown Prince.

625
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,322
I don't have to watch what I say.

626
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,578
Just a moment.

627
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,590
First Historian Min U-won.

628
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,717
OFFICE OF ROYAL DECREES

629
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,928
His Majesty has ordered you to return.

630
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,389
Let's go!

631
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,158
I suppose we still have a long way to go.

632
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,911
Petitions pour in like this
every time Seoraewon is brought up.

633
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,957
It is a lot less compared
to what we received last month.

634
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:46,004
Well, I should be able to respond to
all of them in about three to four days.

635
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,964
Please do not overwork yourself.

636
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,301
It is not something
we can achieve quickly.

637
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,596
That is why I am doing my best
to persuade everyone, one by one.

638
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,016
Seoraewon should be more
than just our dream.

639
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,319
Another letter came for you
from the royal villa.

640
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,657
I told him that I will never forgive him.
He is truly persistent.

641
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,287
Any word from Eunuch Heo?

642
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,332
He will return to Hanyang today.

643
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,631
All we do is pack and unpack,
travel on ships and horses.

644
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,717
-What an ordeal.
-That's what I am saying.

645
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,929
Had I known this,
I would've just stayed at the palace.

646
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,518
I won't come back tonight,
so don't wait for me.

647
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,439
My lord! You're going to that house again?

648
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,649
Don't wait for me.

649
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,114
Goo Hae-ryung.

650
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,244
Goo Hae-ryung!

651
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,474
When did you get here?

652
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,437
Sir.

653
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,067
I had a lot of work to do,
and I even had dinner with my colleagues,

654
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,528
so I am exhausted right now.

655
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,988
So can't you

656
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,865
just come back tomorrow?

657
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,203
I missed you like crazy
during the whole month

658
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,747
that I was away from Hanyang.
What? Tomorrow?

659
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,875
Well, it's not like I didn't miss you.

660
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,129
Do you know how many times
I saw you in my dream...

661
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,552
You had dreams about me? Tell me.

662
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,262
In your dreams,

663
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,473
-what were we doing?
-Well, you know.

664
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,437
I dreamed about how we saw those flowers
on our trip to Jeju Island.

665
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,948
Tell me about your trip.

666
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,117
What did you see on this trip?

667
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,204
I saw dolphins in the Yangtze River.

668
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,790
-Dolphins?
-Yes.

669
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,252
They were swimming in big pods
right in front of my boat.

670
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,046
It was such a beautiful sight.

671
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,884
They are as big as calves,
but their skin looks very shiny.

672
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,802
And they have pointy beaks.

673
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,975
Tell me more.
Any other interesting stories?

674
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,769
What else...

675
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,315
Actually, no. If you're curious,
buy my book and read all about it.

676
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,653
Don't be so petty.

677
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,237
At least you should buy my book.

678
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,408
I heard that only 12 copies
of the other travelogue I wrote

679
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,870
were sold in the entire Hanyang so far.

680
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,792
Anyway, you should get some rest, then.

681
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,960
I won't...

682
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,505
bother you.

683
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,008
I'll get going, then.

684
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,519
I am leaving.

685
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,981
Sir.

686
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,025
Lock the door, please.

687
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,197
Hurry.

688
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,087
Oh, dear.

689
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,257
They practically live together.

690
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,134
Why won't they get married?

691
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,344
I just don't get it.

692
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,180
They'll get married when they want to.

693
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:10,017
Right, how could such an old man like you

694
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,354
understand our generation?

695
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,442
"Our generation"?

696
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,820
You and I are around the same age.

697
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,781
Don't talk as if you're around their age.

698
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,616
We are around the same age?

699
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,915
Had you been born a few years earlier,

700
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,251
I would've had to call you
my ancestor. And what?

701
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,714
You're so funny.

702
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,093
It's the funniest joke
I've heard all year, seriously.

703
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,471
-Goodness.
-It's so hilarious.

704
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,349
That wench.

705
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,644
Why is it that
I just can't grow fond of her?

706
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,273
I am sure Seol-geum
isn't exactly fond of you either.

707
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,358
You little...

708
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,633
Hae-ryung, it's six o'clock.

709
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,884
You have to go to work.

710
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,303
You have to go to work.

711
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,639
It's six o'clock.

712
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,619
What? Did you forget something?

713
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,496
No.

714
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,046
This way, I can start my day off right.

715
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,093
See you later.

716
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,929
All right, have a good day.

717
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,410
-I am a historian.
-Stop.

718
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,830
Seriously.

719
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:39,584
It's been three years.
Shouldn't you remember my face by now?

720
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,962
I work at the Office of Royal Decrees.

721
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,591
Historian Goo Hae-ryung.

722
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,872
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
ROOKIE HISTORIAN GOO HAE-RYUNG

723
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,403
