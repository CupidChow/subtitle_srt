00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,713
EPISODE 2

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,055
What's your name?

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,433
I have a question.

4
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,646
How did you come up with
such a beautiful scene

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,650
where Master Kim confesses his love
beneath the cherry blossom tree?

6
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,697
Well, that's...

7
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,743
I visited Yudalsan last year,

8
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,954
and I was deeply moved there.
That's where I got my idea.

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,917
Yudalsan?

10
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,881
You're wrong.

11
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,053
If you don't tell me your name, I'll just
go ahead and give this back to you.

12
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,140
Maehwa.

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,727
Please write my name

14
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,273
as Maehwa.

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,113
The reason you don't enjoy
reading Maehwa's novels

16
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,782
is because you know nothing about beauty.

17
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,751
You?

18
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,548
Well, could you let go...

19
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,385
Gosh, let go of my hand.

20
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,262
Men and women mustn't hold hands.

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,689
You said Maehwa's book
is such a waste of paper.

22
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,482
You also said you're afraid

23
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,819
the delusion of Maehwa may spread
all around the city like an epidemic.

24
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,449
I have to say,
you have no principle yourself.

25
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,202
Are you a young noble lady
who is hoping Maehwa will quit writing

26
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,746
or just an imposter
who is using Maehwa's name?

27
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,500
Just stick to one thing.

28
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,259
No wonder you were so defensive.

29
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,469
You're Maehwa?

30
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,558
What a novel idea.

31
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,185
You visit every bookstore
and praise yourself.

32
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,271
How many copies
have you sold by doing that?

33
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,397
When did I do such a...

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,070
You're very confident for a fraud.

35
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,575
Don't jump to conclusions, please.

36
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,452
There's a reason I must do this.

37
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,204
So what? Are you asking me
to be understanding?

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,416
Well, that's not what I meant.
I was just...

39
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,924
Could you wait in that room over there?

40
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,593
I'll apologize to you properly in a bit.

41
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,765
Do you think I am the only person
you owe an apology to?

42
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,204
What's going on?

43
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,502
Regardless of how unworthy
you think my novel is,

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,796
all those people's love for Maehwa
is genuine.

45
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,550
You have no right to fool them
just to earn a little bit of money.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,430
-Hence, if you wish to apologize--
-I should apologize to them.

47
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,729
-Maehwa!
-Maehwa!

48
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,147
-So that lady is Maehwa.
-My gosh.

49
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,732
Oh, my goodness!

50
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,114
-Oh, my goodness.
-Maehwa is really here!

51
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,619
There is something I must tell you all.

52
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,339
I'm...

53
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,301
not Maehwa.

54
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,678
-What?
-What?

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,645
Even though I'm not Maehwa,
I pretended that I was

56
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,564
and deceived all of you.

57
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,233
I apologize.

58
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,236
Has she lost her mind?

59
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,032
What? You're not Maehwa?

60
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,242
Then what is this signature here?

61
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,785
Did you con us?

62
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
-My gosh.
-I can't believe this.

63
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,166
-How dare she?
-How could she do such a thing?

64
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,797
However, the real Maehwa is here now.

65
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,510
-What's she saying?
-What?

66
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,306
-Does that mean...
-Is it that man?

67
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,933
-That man is Maehwa?
-Oh, my goodness.

68
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,061
-My gosh.
-Maehwa was a guy?

69
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,521
-Is he the one?
-Really?

70
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,732
-Gosh.
-Seriously?

71
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,858
-Maehwa is a man.
-Oh, my.

72
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,193
-My gosh.
-I can't believe this.

73
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,444
-My goodness.
-It's a man?

74
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,113
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

75
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,907
So it's not a woman?

76
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,285
The King's order!

77
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,043
Arrest Maehwa
and confiscate all the books!

78
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:21,964
Stop right there!

79
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,010
-Get her!
-Come here.

80
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,513
-What's happening?
-My gosh!

81
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,850
-Get them.
-Where's your book?

82
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
Get him!

83
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,397
-Get him!
-Catch him.

84
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,067
Let go! Let go of me, you jerks.

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,777
Hey! You!

86
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,239
Let go. I said, let go!

87
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,990
-Arrest him.
-Don't lose him!

88
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,368
-Let go!
-Get them.

89
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
-Get them!
-Seize the books!

90
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,413
-Don't you dare run away.
-Get them!

91
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,873
Where do you think you're going?

92
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,751
-Darn it.
-Get them!

93
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,212
-You!
-Get the books.

94
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,549
-What the heck?
-Stop right there!

95
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,969
What are you doing?

96
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,139
-Get them!
-Get all the books!

97
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,682
Get them!

98
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,189
-Get them!
-Seize all the books!

99
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,154
-Let us go!
-Come with us!

100
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,238
Let go!

101
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,033
-Come here.
-Let us go, please.

102
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,119
-Hey!
-Wait over there!

103
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,204
You little...

104
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,210
You rats.

105
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,602
Get them!

106
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,480
You, come here!

107
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,735
My gosh!

108
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,698
Do not forgive me, sir!

109
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,200
Hey. Hey, you!

110
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,660
Hey! Gosh, let go of me.

111
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,661
Hey!

112
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
-Eunuch Heo!
-Eunuch Heo!

113
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,549
-He's not at the library.
-Not in the garden either.

114
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,885
Did you search every nook and cranny?

115
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,969
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,888
Where could he be at this hour?

117
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,023
I have to do something.
I'll go find out what's going on.

118
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,734
Wait, where are you going?

119
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,404
It's the King's order, so he could be at
the Royal Investigation Bureau, right?

120
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,198
Please watch what you say.

121
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,242
You're a woman, you can't go in there.

122
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,035
-Then how about you go?
-My goodness.

123
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,663
Am I not even considered a woman
just because I'm a servant?

124
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,794
I told you it's not your fault
that the scholar got arrested.

125
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,964
I heard so many noble ladies

126
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,091
ran away to find the love of their life

127
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,634
after reading Maehwa's books.

128
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,679
That's why he's hated so much.

129
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,307
Still, how can they arrest him
just for that reason?

130
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,144
I can't stop thinking that it's odd.

131
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,786
Hey, excuse me.

132
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,488
Don't you find this person shameless?

133
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,616
If he has any shame,
he should quit writing.

134
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,160
However, the real Maehwa is here now.

135
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,288
Do not forgive me, sir!

136
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,873
Hey. Hey, you!

137
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,088
I'll get my revenge.

138
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,050
I will crush you!

139
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,719
Keep it down, will you?

140
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,263
Can't you see that I'm trying to sleep?

141
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,184
Are you blind or what?

142
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,269
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,108
I'll get my revenge.

144
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,278
I'll get back at you for this!

145
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,421
What's the matter, my lady?

146
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,256
Let's go.

147
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,561
MAEHWA

148
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,231
-Gosh, you scoundrels. How dare you!
-Move!

149
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,110
How could they be banned?

150
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,279
There were no problems with those books
even until yesterday.

151
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,658
How could they be banned overnight?

152
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,410
You thieves!

153
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,498
Park Dal-pae, you are guilty
of writing banned books. Show yourself

154
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,791
so that you can be arrested!

155
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,001
-Honey!
-Let go of me!

156
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,255
My husband hasn't even mastered
Chinese characters yet.

157
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,258
So how can you accuse him
of writing books?

158
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,717
What is this about?

159
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,594
What do you think you're doing?

160
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,304
-Stop right there!
-Darn it.

161
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,807
-Shit.
-You prick!

162
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,066
You scoundrels! What are you doing?

163
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,776
-My goodness!
-Gosh, madam!

164
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,319
You wenches!

165
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,450
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

166
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,952
THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER

167
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,494
My gosh...

168
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,135
Why go through my books?

169
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,352
What?

170
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,646
You cannot tell me your name?

171
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,233
Well, it's not that I can't tell you.

172
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,986
You don't have to know my name.
That's what I'm trying to say.

173
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,241
Was he fed something spoiled
while in prison?

174
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,787
Look, Maehwa.

175
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,290
I need to know your name for my report
so I can hand it over to the higher-ups.

176
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,959
Do you need a beating first thing?

177
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,379
-Your name.
-I'm not Maehwa.

178
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,922
You little...

179
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,133
Show me your tag, then.

180
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,887
What? Are you going to say
you don't even have an identification tag?

181
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,808
Do you think I'm an idiot?

182
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,060
Everyone in the land of Joseon
must have...

183
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,818
You don't have an identification tag?

184
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,614
Must I have one?

185
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,455
What does your father do?

186
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,087
I mean... What does your father do, sir?

187
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,259
If you can't disclose any details,
just tell me his rank.

188
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,666
Sir, he's here to turn himself in.

189
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
What? Who?

190
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,464
The real Maehwa.

191
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,577
I'm Maehwa, you punks.

192
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,884
ROYAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU

193
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,028
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

194
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
"Your Highness"?

195
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,544
From the way he talks to how he looks,

196
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,504
he's got to be from a reputable family.

197
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,882
Tail him and find out where he lives.

198
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,134
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,600
Write it down.

200
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,356
I can't do this anymore.

201
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,196
Gosh, my back is killing me.
This is pissing me off.

202
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,492
"The heat inside the mill.

203
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,120
Where does Court Lady Kim go every night?"

204
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,583
They summoned officers
from the Royal Investigation Bureau

205
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,084
and the City Administration Office

206
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,462
as well as historians
just to confiscate these stupid books?

207
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,047
That's what I'm saying.

208
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,632
I didn't take the civil service exam
for this. I'm mortified.

209
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,675
THE HEAT INSIDE THE MILL

210
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,639
-Hey, what is this?
-Pardon me? Oh, that's...

211
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,560
How did it get in there? Goodness.

212
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,228
Are you lonely these days?

213
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,814
Officer Min!

214
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,275
Officer Min!

215
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,028
Jeez, move.

216
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,030
Officer Min!

217
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,201
You should've given me a heads-up
that you were coming by.

218
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,454
I dozed off in there for a few minutes,
not knowing you were here.

219
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,416
You punks, can't you see that Officer Min
is working? Go bring him a chair!

220
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,335
-What are you waiting for?
-It's okay.

221
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,878
It's not okay.

222
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,714
Officer Min, just have your subordinates
take care of this grunt work.

223
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,592
Let's go to my office and have some tea.

224
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,885
It's really okay.

225
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,887
Then let me just do the work for you.

226
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,764
I'd rather do it myself.

227
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,100
Did you just touch...

228
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,726
SACHAEK: BOOK OF HISTORICAL RECORDS

229
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,269
...this sachaek?

230
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,776
Jeez, this is bringing tears to my eyes.

231
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,529
When did the deputy magistrate
of the junior fourth rank

232
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
become a servant
of a senior seventh rank official?

233
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,158
He'll even offer to wipe his butt.
He'll be good at that.

234
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,954
He's the Second State Councillor's son.
Who cares what his rank is?

235
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,706
Everyone calls him
the Crown Prince of the Min family.

236
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,377
He was born so lucky.
Can't he give up on at least one thing?

237
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,171
He's handsome, wealthy, and smart.

238
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,507
He has everything. Life is so unfair.

239
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,800
Life is unfair indeed.

240
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,970
Thank goodness
I got my good looks and wits.

241
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,139
Who?

242
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,141
-Oh, gosh.
-No...

243
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,018
-Oh, dear.
-My books!

244
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,020
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

245
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,105
No...

246
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,399
What a waste!

247
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,360
-How can they do this?
-What should we do?

248
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,281
-My goodness.
-What a waste.

249
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,784
-No...
-Gosh, my books...

250
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,287
DON QUIXOTE

251
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,004
I'd like to take a look
at the daily brief.

252
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,756
Today's brief from the palace.

253
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,301
I heard the people can read them too
if they pay.

254
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,262
Please allow me to have a look
at today's brief.

255
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,514
What is this woman uttering?

256
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,725
Only government employees like us
can read them

257
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,435
because we need them to do our jobs.

258
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,145
They're not meant for small fry like you!

259
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,066
Is that what you government officers
think of the people of this country?

260
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,820
What is the matter?

261
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,782
We can't show it to you,
but I can tell you what was on it.

262
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,826
What would you like to know?

263
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,828
-Officer Min.
-Then answer this question.

264
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,789
What was written about the banned books?

265
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,628
They didn't even put up a single notice.

266
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,673
They took my lifetime collection of books
without telling me anything.

267
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,301
Hence, I must know

268
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,221
why those books were banned

269
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,847
as well as why they arrested people

270
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,140
and ransacked their houses.

271
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,476
I at least need to know
what's written on the brief

272
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,645
to understand what's going on.

273
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,772
It was His Majesty's order

274
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,608
for he believes that
lowly literature and books

275
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,860
smuggled from Qing
are disturbing moral principles.

276
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,405
Yes, it was His Majesty's order.
Isn't that all you need to know?

277
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,115
Who cares whether or not you understand--

278
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,202
Even the King can't always make
the right decisions.

279
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,245
What did you say?

280
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,038
He believes that books are causing chaos?

281
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,916
Last spring,
a nobleman demolished ten houses

282
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,127
that belonged to commoners
to build a new house for his newlywed son.

283
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,588
Such things are what's really corrupting

284
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,591
moral principles and causing chaos.
Don't blame it on books.

285
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,468
So what?

286
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,972
Are you saying that His Majesty

287
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,349
made a bad decision?

288
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,938
According to The Great Learning,

289
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,192
a king's likes and dislikes
must be in line

290
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,111
with those of his people.

291
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,947
However, our King

292
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,201
dislikes what his people like
and likes what his people dislike.

293
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,788
Thus, how could I be content
as one of his people?

294
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,999
Hae-ryung!

295
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,710
Lady Hae-ryung! My lady, gosh.

296
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:40,215
My gosh. She's not well.
She loses it from time to time.

297
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,010
I'm sorry, sir.
I sincerely apologize on her behalf.

298
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,847
My apologies, Officer Min.

299
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,473
That's okay.

300
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,070
My gosh!

301
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,073
Are you begging to get killed?

302
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,160
In front of government officials,
how could you...

303
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,996
How could you criticize the King?

304
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,375
Did Prince Yeonsan return to reign?
Why can't I make such a remark?

305
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,879
There are some things
that you must never say.

306
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,511
What would you have done if your remark
had reached the King's court?

307
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,638
I actually wish that happened.

308
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,767
The King's ministers need to know

309
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,394
what the people of this country
are seeing, feeling, and thinking.

310
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,189
Do you think they will listen to you

311
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,024
and change overnight?

312
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,151
Do you think a pebble can fill up a river?

313
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,695
No, it can't.
However, it can generate a ripple.

314
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,489
Why must it be you?

315
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,783
Why can't it be me?

316
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,368
-Why are you being--
-Don't you know why I'm being like this?

317
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,331
As for the books, I can get them again.

318
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,666
It'll take time and money,

319
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,335
but it can be done.

320
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,006
However, those who believe
that they can hold anybody accountable

321
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,258
and can take anything from anyone
if they can justify it.

322
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,221
I cannot tolerate such people.

323
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,433
Losing what is dear to us...

324
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,688
Haven't we experienced it plenty of times?

325
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,075
Don't follow me.
I'll go someplace else and inquire.

326
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,870
I found you a husband.

327
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,670
You'll receive his proposal letter soon.

328
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,506
I am trying to tell you
that you cannot live

329
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,425
under my roof and my protection forever.

330
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,429
I hope you understand my intentions.

331
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,123
Your Highness!

332
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,251
-Eunuch Heo is back!
-Sam-bo!

333
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,714
Sam-bo.

334
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,968
Your Highness, it's all sorted out now.

335
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,761
Don't worry...

336
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,764
Put your worries to rest.

337
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,892
Let's go inside. Be careful, okay?

338
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
Be careful.

339
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,189
Come on in.

340
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,232
Be careful.

341
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,912
Slowly.

342
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,832
-Good.
-A little closer.

343
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,549
Was it very painful?

344
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,259
Yes.

345
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,887
-You probably hate me now.
-Yes, I do.

346
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,097
If only I had never left the palace...

347
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,895
-Strip your pants off.
-Okay.

348
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,356
Come again? My gosh!

349
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,483
I got this from the Medical Office.

350
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,401
There's nothing like this
for flogging wounds.

351
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,155
It's okay, Your Highness.
I'll apply it myself when I'm alone.

352
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,824
The sooner it's applied,
the quicker the bleeding will stop. Hurry.

353
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,326
But... Your Highness.

354
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,495
Wait, hold on. I'll do it later...

355
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,121
-Hey, how dare you...
-Hurry.

356
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,206
-Sam-bo.
-Gosh! This is...

357
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,378
His buttocks look totally fine,
Your Highness.

358
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,588
Did you get flogged on the other side?

359
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,966
What? God, what are you doing?

360
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,094
Hey! Jeez, these wenches.

361
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,604
What happened was...

362
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,692
They said I could either write
a letter of apology and pay bail

363
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,444
or get flogged,

364
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,656
so I made a wise decision.

365
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,574
Then you should've just told me the truth.

366
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,576
Why did you have to worry me like that?

367
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,415
Well, I took the fall for you,

368
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,001
so I wanted you
to worry about me a little.

369
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,169
I was also hoping to take it easy
for a few days.

370
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,090
By the way, Your Highness,

371
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,343
you're in no position to be angry with me.

372
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,556
I clearly told you
not to go to the busy strip ever again.

373
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,392
How many times did I tell you...

374
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,855
Don't even talk to me
for the next three days.

375
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,653
Don't come near me.

376
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,211
At Dongungjeong at 4 p.m.,

377
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,466
the Crown Prince had a one-on-one
with Vice-Chancellor Jo Seung-gwang.

378
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,512
Regarding the damages caused by
the banned books, Jo Seung-gwang reported

379
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,808
that 6,829 books have been confiscated,

380
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,687
and 255 commoners are currently detained
at the local office.

381
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,776
He also said the total amount of bail
collected so far is 4,820 nyang.

382
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,988
Then the Crown Prince asked if
all of that happened in just three days,

383
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,532
and the Vice-Chancellor said
it doesn't include

384
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,910
other provinces
as he has yet to receive their reports.

385
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,247
After sitting silently for some time,

386
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,338
the Crown Prince dismissed
Jo Seung-gwang and the historian.

387
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,480
Even the King can't always make
the right decisions.

388
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,660
I will share my personal opinion.

389
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,789
The corruption in the royal court
is worsening by the day,

390
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,250
and the political tension is rising.

391
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,960
-No! My lord!
-This is unjust!

392
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,754
Meanwhile, the people are accused
of committing offences

393
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,133
even when they just reach out their hands
or take a step forward.

394
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,467
This is unjust!

395
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,139
Since the ancient times,
it has always been said that the skies

396
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,267
identify with the heart of the people
for it does not have its own.

397
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,312
Hence, what saddens the people
saddens the skies as well,

398
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,897
and what delights the people

399
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,483
delights the skies too.

400
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,902
-Please have mercy.
-Please have mercy.

401
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,320
Nevertheless, the ministers...

402
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,822
Please revoke your royal command!

403
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,074
...are not afraid of either
the skies or the people.

404
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,618
-Please revoke your command.
-Please revoke your command.

405
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,163
From my observation,

406
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,541
this crisis should be blamed

407
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,419
solely on them.

408
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,828
Identify yourself.

409
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,373
My lord. I'm Kim Cheok-jeom,

410
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,292
an officer from
the Royal Investigation Bureau.

411
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,548
There is something you should know.

412
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,015
Your Highness,
try your best to look chipper.

413
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,059
You haven't seen His Majesty
in a long time.

414
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,852
He'd never summon me for no reason.

415
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,771
You are his son.

416
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,190
I'm sure he misses you,
and his heart must ache

417
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,566
whenever he thinks about you.

418
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,443
You know that is not true.

419
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,529
How do I look? Should I fix anything?

420
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,323
No.

421
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,802
Father, how have you been?

422
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,142
I cannot be fond of you
no matter how hard I try.

423
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,606
You tell me. Have you lost your mind?

424
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,526
Or are you deliberately trying
to disgrace me?

425
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,403
I am not quite following

426
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,240
for my wisdom hasn't matured yet.

427
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,452
You even have the audacity
to lie to my face now.

428
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,664
MOONLIGHT LOVE AFFAIR

429
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,501
Must I read aloud each line
of this vulgar piece of writing?

430
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,379
So? You've been acting like a clown
behind my back,

431
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,673
and the foolish people praise you for it.

432
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,049
How does that feel?

433
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,260
Do you feel like you're the King?

434
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,723
I'd much rather see you
fool around with kisaengs or gamble!

435
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,017
How could a man write something
so preposterous?

436
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:41,441
I wrote those books
to relieve my feelings of boredom.

437
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,776
-I didn't mean to--
-Shut it!

438
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,655
You cannot hide your malicious mind
with such excuses.

439
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,366
Because I have a son like you,

440
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,745
I am too ashamed
to face the former kings after I die.

441
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,497
You are more wicked and malicious
than anyone

442
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,626
who has ever lived in this palace!

443
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,753
-Father.
-Listen!

444
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,962
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,174
Seize all the books at Nokseodang
immediately and burn them all!

446
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,261
Not just books.
Paper, brushes, and ink sticks too!

447
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,097
Seize anything related to writing
and burn them all to ashes.

448
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,308
From this day onward,

449
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,895
Prince Dowon shall be forbidden
from reading or writing any books!

450
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,523
Father, I sincerely apologize.

451
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,694
I'll... From now on,
I will never show anyone what I write.

452
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,571
Please revoke your order.

453
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,202
Writing and reading
are the only things I can do.

454
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,372
Without them...

455
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,415
Without them...

456
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,423
I have nothing.

457
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,927
Father.

458
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
Please...

459
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,599
Please...

460
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,769
Please.

461
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,426
Father.

462
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,134
Sam-bo...

463
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,056
Your Highness.

464
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:06,813
Your Highness.

465
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,068
Here.

466
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,031
Drink it.

467
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,494
Okay.

468
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,622
You'll be all right.

469
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,882
You should go.

470
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,977
You know that I cannot go back to sleep
after that happens.

471
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,481
I'll just sit here and look at the stars.

472
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,608
It's been a while
since you last had your nightmare.

473
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,490
Did it leave you in so much distress?

474
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,661
This place sits at the corner
of the huge palace.

475
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,539
Nokseodang, where no one visits.

476
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,835
I could read or write 10,000 books
as I please...

477
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,630
without His Majesty knowing.

478
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,091
Then please do that.

479
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,596
I, too, will keep my mouth shut.

480
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,643
No. I don't plan on doing that.

481
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,561
Why not?

482
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,357
My father does not listen
to anything I say.

483
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,987
If I also refuse to listen to him,

484
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,991
we could hardly be a parent and a child.

485
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,784
Your Highness.

486
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,205
Maybe I should have asked him
to have me exiled.

487
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,750
If I'm sent to a river, I'll fish.

488
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,044
If I'm sent to a mountain,
I'll grow ginseng.

489
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,004
That way,

490
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,716
I'd have something to keep me occupied.

491
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,370
I found you a husband.

492
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,767
I hope this old man isn't bothering you
by calling you out so often.

493
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,644
Don't say that, my lord.

494
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,483
Please go ahead.

495
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,319
Am I only allowed to see you
when I have something to say?

496
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,364
But you aren't the type
who'd call me out to enjoy a chat.

497
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,658
Right.

498
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,328
There is no other partner better than you

499
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,580
when I wish to take some time
to discuss something.

500
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,420
The writer of The Story of Ho Dam.

501
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,756
Don't you think
there's something odd about him?

502
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,932
I have connections everywhere
in this land of Joseon,

503
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,143
and my influence reaches
every corner of this country.

504
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,229
But I cannot find a trace of that writer.

505
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,398
It's as if that person is behind my back.

506
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,526
The northwest is desolate and barren

507
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,153
with many places to hide.

508
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,031
-If you look a little longer--
-That's just a red herring.

509
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,867
The closer you are,
the harder it is to notice.

510
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,997
There is only one place that is close by,
yet out of my reach.

511
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,791
The palace.

512
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,090
Are you saying the writer
of The Story of Ho Dam is in the palace?

513
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,258
That is why

514
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,304
I plan on turning in a petition tomorrow.

515
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,064
My lord.

516
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:23,027
-The Crown Prince--
-He will have to accept this by tomorrow.

517
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,531
So do answer my question.

518
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,452
Do you think that is enough to catch
the writer of The Story of Ho Dam?

519
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,300
You rogues! How dare you...

520
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,889
20 YEARS AGO

521
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,028
Where is His Majesty?

522
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,624
I asked you where His Majesty is.

523
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,587
Prince Hamyeong!

524
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,558
I've brought you the jeonwigyoseo,
Your Majesty.

525
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,726
JEONWIGYOSEO:
ANNOUNCES THE SUCCESSION OF THE THRONE

526
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,542
THE STORY OF HO DAM

527
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,515
Second State Councillor.
You seem to have finally gone senile.

528
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,270
Your Royal Highness,
please watch the way you speak.

529
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,189
Historians are in your presence.

530
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,443
Yes, there are historians
in the assembly and the royal lectures.

531
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,820
They follow His Majesty and me
wherever we go

532
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,697
and write down everything we say and do.

533
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,865
I cannot speak or look

534
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,035
at anything as I please
in fear of what will be recorded.

535
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,953
Now you want to hire

536
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,247
female historians
to spy on me in my chambers?

537
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,834
Your Royal Highness.

538
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,712
I only suggested that
we keep female historians

539
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,173
to follow the ancient system.

540
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,051
Which book from which country mentions

541
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,345
of such absurd system
of having female historians?

542
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,055
It's in the law of Zhou Dynasty.

543
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,975
According to the law of Zhou Dynasty,
the Zhou Dynasty kept female historians

544
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,645
to record even the events
within the women's quarters.

545
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,190
Many future kings and sage men
gained wisdom from those records.

546
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,692
That country is gone.

547
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,778
It went into ruins over 1,000 years ago!

548
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,155
But they set an example
even after 1,000 years.

549
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,243
Joseon's judicial system is
built on the law of Zhou Dynasty.

550
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,329
I clearly remember
how Your Royal Highness last month

551
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,542
discussed the matters of rituals by using
ancient examples of the Zhou Dynasty.

552
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,585
Second State Councillor.

553
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,672
Unlike the women of Zhou,
the women of Joseon are illiterate.

554
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,925
Korean alphabets cannot be used
to keep record of events.

555
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,011
Vice-Chancellor is right.

556
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,765
A historian must have skills,
knowledge, as well as discernment.

557
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:40,766
Even the best scholars

558
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,435
who pass the state exam

559
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,688
fail to pass the historian exam.

560
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,400
Female historians are different.

561
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,235
A historian's duty is to write down

562
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,112
state affairs for the future generation.

563
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,407
But female historians can just write down
the everyday life in the palace.

564
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,909
We can pick out court ladies
who know the Korean alphabet.

565
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,160
That's what I'm trying to say.

566
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,081
All they can write down is
the everyday life of the palace.

567
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,458
There is no reason to pass that on
to the future generation.

568
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,335
The discipline of the Royal Family

569
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,879
will improve
in a female historian's presence.

570
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,757
Are you implying that

571
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,926
the current Royal Family
has no discipline?

572
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,303
Regarding that...

573
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,185
I cannot dare to speak of
what happens at Nokseodang.

574
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,938
Second State Councillor!

575
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,998
I already told you

576
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,876
it'll be hard to convince
the Crown Prince.

577
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,796
You can use this chance
to break his spirits

578
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,424
to teach him how to be a king.

579
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,510
So, do you think
it's going to take a long time?

580
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,971
The Crown Prince is a very clever man.

581
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,307
So I'm sure he'll come
to understand me soon.

582
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,188
You may leave.

583
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,494
I trusted you and gave you permission
to do something

584
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,622
that has never been done
in the history of Joseon.

585
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,124
If this ends up causing a problem,

586
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,460
you'll be dismissed from your position.

587
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,881
Your Majesty. Only three people
in this country know Ho Dam.

588
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,884
You, me, and...

589
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,804
I can't help but wonder
who gave you such a difficult task.

590
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,514
Your Majesty.

591
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,228
The hours are late.

592
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,397
Why are you not asleep yet?

593
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,360
I heard the lights in your palace
were still turned on.

594
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,488
This old lady couldn't fall asleep
because I was so worried

595
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,699
about my grandson.

596
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,618
I'm sorry.

597
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:51,123
I still have so much to learn.
I apologize for worrying you.

598
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,876
I'm not here to scold you.

599
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,545
I know it's not your fault.

600
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,964
I guess you heard
about what happened this morning.

601
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,883
So tell me.

602
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,093
Have you made up your mind?

603
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,929
It's not easy.

604
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,681
Of course not.

605
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,143
If you grant
the Second State Councillor's request,

606
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,813
the female historians will obviously
become his eyes and ears.

607
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,565
But if you refuse his request,

608
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,944
you'd feel uneasy thinking about
what he might do to your brother.

609
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,155
Your Majesty.

610
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,534
I do not want to be a Crown Prince
that gets swayed by the officials.

611
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,370
Nor do I want to be someone
who failed to protect his brother.

612
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,331
I really don't know

613
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,750
what I should do.

614
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,043
Your Royal Highness.

615
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,631
Why are you trying to enter
the Second State Councillor's territory?

616
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,843
Even an unwise decision
can lead to a wise one.

617
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,514
You should think about it a little harder.

618
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,736
Why does it sound so weird?

619
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,533
You are clearly
torturing our ears, Your Highness.

620
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,369
Please stop it.

621
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,162
-Please stop it.
-Please stop it.

622
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,456
Bear with it a little.
It'll get better soon.

623
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,291
You know I'm a quick learner.

624
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,463
You're definitely not a quick learner.

625
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,509
Where are you...

626
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,553
Hey, where are you going? Where...

627
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,429
You guys! Where are you going?

628
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,681
Hey.

629
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,768
Jin, did you see that?

630
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,895
This is how they treat me.

631
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,106
I heard you play just now,

632
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,441
and it was bad enough
to make me want to punch you.

633
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,485
Be grateful that no one hit you.

634
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,904
You're the Crown Prince.
How can you say that?

635
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,864
That's exactly why I can say that.

636
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,868
Hey, there's someplace
I want you to go with me.

637
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,246
-Where?
-You'll see.

638
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,010
I didn't know the sky looked so pretty
when it's close to sunset.

639
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,887
It's a very mysterious color.

640
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,807
Jin.

641
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,977
You've done more than enough
to console me.

642
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,062
You can scold me now.

643
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,360
You're the Crown Prince who barely
even has time to look at the sky.

644
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,698
I'm sure you're here
spending time with me for a reason.

645
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:31,950
I'm sure...

646
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,537
you heard about what I did.

647
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,414
That's upsetting to hear.

648
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,916
Did you think I'd scold you
for something like that?

649
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,336
It turns out

650
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,922
the renowned writer, Maehwa,
was actually a narrow-minded fool.

651
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,635
-Jin.
-I read your novel.

652
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,054
I was only going to read a little bit,

653
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,265
but I constantly found myself
flipping to the next page.

654
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,518
I started to regret not having read it

655
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,978
before it became a banned book.

656
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,398
-Stop making fun of me.
-I'm saying this because I'm proud.

657
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,569
If we were born
into a middle-class family,

658
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,573
I would've gone around the neighborhood
telling everyone

659
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,076
that my younger brother is Maehwa
and that he wrote this book.

660
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,913
But you and I have a lot to carry

661
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,333
on our shoulders.

662
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,394
Can you give me
an honest answer to this question?

663
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,021
I was your inspiration

664
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,066
for Master Kim, right?

665
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,277
-What?
-His handsome looks,

666
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,030
profound intelligence,
and gentle character.

667
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,532
That's obviously me.

668
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,033
Especially his looks.

669
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,328
His fair skin and deep eyes.

670
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,123
Don't get mistaken.

671
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,168
I only looked at myself in the mirror.

672
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,504
What?

673
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,468
If you say so.

674
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,694
Lady Hae-ryung!

675
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,411
Your brother chose a date.

676
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,663
It's the first day of next month!

677
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,041
-I see.
-According to the fortune-teller,

678
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,252
you guys will get along very well.

679
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,920
Once you marry him,

680
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,131
you'll apparently live a very happy life.

681
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,136
Your brother is very pleased.

682
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,930
-That's good to hear.
-Lady Hae-ryung.

683
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,436
Gosh, don't worry too much.

684
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,691
I actually went and took a peek
at your future husband.

685
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:14,362
And I was really startled.
He is very good-looking,

686
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,823
and he walks with a great posture.

687
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,660
I think he'll be a very kind husband.

688
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,373
I'm sure you both will get along.

689
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,087
I need to go somewhere for a bit.

690
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,770
Jang-su, don't forget to take this.

691
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,694
My goodness, be careful.
You might fall down again!

692
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,239
You finally gave him a name?

693
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,240
Yes.

694
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,577
At first I contemplated
between San-sam and In-sam.

695
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,580
But I realized that the best name for him

696
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,958
would be Jang-su

697
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,960
since he works at a medicine shop.

698
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,088
Jang-su is a great name.

699
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,133
You'll be greatly blessed
for your generosity.

700
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,719
You took in a boy who had nowhere to go.

701
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,973
My gosh, it wasn't just for him.

702
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:27,185
I'm always lonely and alone,
so I figured if I took in that little boy,

703
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,313
I could make him run errands
and have someone to talk to.

704
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,898
I did it for myself.

705
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,319
But what brings you here?
Did that break again?

706
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,405
No, it's not that.

707
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,241
I was thinking about selling it.

708
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,618
You want to sell the alarm clock?

709
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,998
Yes, I don't think I'll need it anymore.

710
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,878
So, how much
are you willing to pay for it?

711
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,433
His Royal Highness has arrived.

712
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,070
-Hand me the scroll.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

713
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,664
"The Second State Councillor

714
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,208
asked to hire female historians
15 days ago.

715
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,338
And I give him my consent."

716
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,301
Your Royal Highness, that is absurd.
Please withdraw your consent!

717
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,886
"However, female historians

718
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,347
cannot be recommended.
They must take the civil service exam.

719
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,183
There will only be one exam
throughout the day to determine

720
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,268
whether or not they've passed.

721
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,063
And I, the Crown Prince,
will decide the topic.

722
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,274
Anyone who passes the exam

723
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,944
will enter The Office of Royal Decrees
as an apprentice."

724
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,656
Your Royal Highness, how can you
let a woman take the civil service exam?

725
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,575
Men and women are different,
and we have strict cultural rules.

726
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,912
How can you let a woman
take the exam just like a man?

727
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,123
This is an outrageous decision,
Your Royal Highness.

728
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,417
This has never happened
in the history of Joseon.

729
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,587
Please withdraw your royal order,
Your Royal Highness.

730
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,548
-Please, Your Royal Highness.
-Please, Your Royal Highness.

731
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,135
Please allow me to say
a word of advice out of loyalty.

732
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,724
Please think about the Code of Law
of the royal palace.

733
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,353
The Code of Law of the royal palace?

734
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,021
The civil service exam

735
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,816
is a national exam that is connected
to our country's education.

736
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,487
Women lack education and knowledge,
and if you let them take the exam,

737
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,155
it'll be the same thing as going against

738
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,992
the basis of what the previous kings
have worked so hard to keep.

739
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,411
Second State Councillor.

740
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,415
Which previous king stated

741
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,876
that only men are allowed
to take the civil service exam?

742
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,047
Please answer me.

743
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,966
Where exactly in the Code of Law

744
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,094
does it say civil service exams
can only be taken by men?

745
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,685
As King Taejo built Joseon,
he announced that there should only be

746
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,563
one criteria when it comes to
hiring civil servants.

747
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,398
Education and moral conduct.

748
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,859
Being well-educated
and morally well-behaved.

749
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,445
If there's anyone who has those features,

750
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,781
I'm more than willing to hire them
even if they're women.

751
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,534
-However--
-Have you forgotten?

752
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,370
You're the ones who suggested
to hire female historians

753
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,747
and insisted on letting them

754
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,291
enter the royal palace
regardless of our strict cultural rules.

755
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,729
All I did was accept

756
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,982
your request.

757
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,205
Seriously?

758
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,916
Women will get to take exams?

759
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,334
What kind of nonsense is that?

760
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,461
This is more than just
writing things down.

761
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,880
It's not something
they can learn that quickly.

762
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,507
This is an insult not only to us

763
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,842
but to all the historians
from thousands of years back.

764
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,219
We should not stay still.

765
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,639
Gil-seung, didn't you say your cousin
is the head of Sungkyunkwan?

766
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,808
Tell them they should start
a mass demonstration.

767
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,559
I'll bring an axe.

768
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,478
We must put up a petition.

769
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,604
Yes, that's a good idea.

770
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,856
Who'd behead a historian
unless they've really lost it?

771
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,275
But

772
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,154
why aren't you saying anything,
Officer Min?

773
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,615
What can he say?

774
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,993
If the Second State Councillor
hadn't provoked His Royal Highness,

775
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,411
none of this would've happened.

776
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,497
Why must historians

777
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,251
be against the recruitment
of female historians?

778
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,587
What kind of absurd nonsense is that?

779
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,007
Why shouldn't we be against it?

780
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,093
Since our childhood we learned that

781
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,804
women should never
be interested in national affairs.

782
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,640
Even if we were taught that
through many books,

783
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,767
the Code of Law should always come first.

784
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:21,062
The... The Code of Law?

785
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,314
-In the Code of Law--
-There is no such article

786
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,819
that says women aren't allowed to take
civil service exams.

787
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,956
They're going to hire female historians?

788
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:44,210
My goodness, I've never heard of
anything more outrageous.

789
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,255
I guess the world is starting to change.

790
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,717
-My gosh.
-This is absurd.

791
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,179
You should take the exam.
You're a great writer.

792
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,516
That's utterly absurd.

793
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,310
The second child of Lord Jo

794
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:03,146
insisted on taking the civil service exam
and caused a huge fuss.

795
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,565
Really? Why would any woman
do something like that?

796
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,733
Exactly.

797
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,862

00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,324
The study books that will prepare you
to become a female historian

799
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,367
are currently for sale!

800
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,497
The difficult terminologies
are explained in Korean alphabets

801
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,124
in the simplest way possible
to aid your understanding!

802
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:27,629
It highlights the key points to note from
what can be a boring study experience!

803
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:45,480
Are these the only women in Hanyang
who know how to read and write?

804
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,733
We got less than ten applicants.

805
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,028
I'm sure it's not because
they don't know how to read and write.

806
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,490
They're probably worried about
what the Crown Prince

807
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,617
might do to their daughters.

808
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,118
If they take the civil service exam,

809
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,912
they might not even be able to
get married.

810
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,414
They're most likely preventing them
from applying.

811
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,417
It doesn't matter how many people
take the state exam.

812
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,754
We just need one person to pass the exam.

813
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,632
Yes, of course.

814
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,928
My lord, should we gather these women?

815
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,930
My lord.

816
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,646
Second State Councillor.
I have come to greet you.

817
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,692
I'm the eldest daughter
of Jeongrang Song Jae-cheon.

818
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,193
JEONGRANG: A SENIOR FIFTH RANK TITLE

819
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,281
-My name is Sa-hui.
-Sa-hui.

820
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,366
What are you doing here?

821
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,661
I'd like to take the civil service exam.

822
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,037
What?

823
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,667
But in order to do that, I need your help.

824
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,712
Please help me convince my father.

825
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,299
What... What in the world are you saying?

826
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,633
Why would you do that?

827
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,511
Sa-hui?

828
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,186
You have a very clever daughter,
Lord Song.

829
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,701
I packed everything I could find,

830
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,954
from blankets to garments,
just as you requested.

831
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,248
I think

832
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,376
this should be plenty for her to use

833
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,712
until she marries off her grandson.

834
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,130
You did a good job.

835
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,383
You'll be busy tomorrow,
so you should go and get some rest.

836
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,302
Yes, my lord.

837
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:56,653
Jae-gyeong.

838
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,323
I didn't know you'd be here.

839
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,583
What's this?

840
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,671
Open it. It's a gift.

841
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,228
This is...

842
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,854
Back when I was young,

843
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,066
I really liked seeing you wear
this deep green garment.

844
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,612
I figured I should remind myself
of back then

845
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,781
in order to stop myself
from hating you so much.

846
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,545
Hae-ryung.

847
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,509
I will...

848
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,304
I will always be here for you.

849
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,246
Really? This is great.

850
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,623
My goodness.

851
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,168
-Get back to work.
-This way.

852
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,588
My gosh.

853
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,215
-It's a great day.
-Yes.

854
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,551
Thank you for coming.

855
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,136
Please take a seat.

856
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,607
My gosh, doesn't she look gorgeous?

857
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,277
Look at how beautiful you are.

858
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,867
My gosh, you look like a fairy.

859
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,622
Just have no more than ten kids.

860
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,958
They'll all look so pretty and handsome.

861
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,127
Don't you agree?

862
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,254
Where's Seol-geum?

863
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:22,965
Don't even get me started.

864
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,676
She's in her room, still crying.

865
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,643
The groom is coming!

866
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,438
-Look at him!
-My gosh.

867
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,441
-My goodness.
-He's so good-looking.

868
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,237
-How incredible.
-My goodness.

869
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,308
I'm sorry. I cannot...

870
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,187
I cannot go ahead with this marriage!

871
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,615
Your garment!

872
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,118
-Hurry up and untie this for me.
-Wait.

873
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,287
My gosh, this is crazy.

874
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:42,879
Let's go.

875
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,341
Lady Hae-ryung, your cheeks.

876
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,434
Seung-hun, have you lost your mind?

877
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,312
I'm sorry.

878
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,481
-My goodness.
-What in the world?

879
01:05:58,829 --> 01:05:59,789
Over here.

880
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,507
You're so mean.

881
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:11,717
You know what will happen to me

882
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,469
if anyone finds out
that I'm at the library.

883
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,472
That's why I made everyone
in this area leave.

884
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,641
Will you please help me?

885
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,229
There's something I need to find,

886
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,773
but I can't seem to find it.

887
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,526
And there's not a decent precedent either.

888
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,406
Haven't you come up
with the exam question yet?

889
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,658
Isn't the state exam today?

890
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,160
Which is why I'm grasping at straws.

891
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,037
Do you have an idea?

892
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,248
I don't.

893
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,254
But what I do know is that you shouldn't
be looking at books for your answer.

894
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,174
There are already tons of officials

895
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,636
who can answer what's in these books
by heart, just as they've learned.

896
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,556
It is the duty of female historians

897
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,558
to record the faults
of the royalty, is it not?

898
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,060
Therefore, most importantly...

899
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,356
they must be impertinent.

900
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,984
They should be impertinent?

901
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,361
Find someone who does not fear the king,

902
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,697
the Crown Prince, or the officials.

903
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,286
I'm talking about a strange woman

904
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,496
who is as stubborn as an ox

905
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,582
and is as courageous as a general.

906
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,338
Can we find such a woman in Joseon?

907
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,966
I am sure we can

908
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:35,885
find her somewhere.

909
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,513
I'm here to take

910
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,183
the female historian exam.

911
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,085
I'm on my way to check out the exam.

912
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,796
If you think about it, I'm the one
who came up with the question.

913
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:14,632
Wouldn't it be a waste not to make use
of a smart woman like me?

914
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:16,717
The name of that woman
is Hae-ryung, is it?

915
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,552
Where can I find that woman?

916
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,597
Why are they always picking on us
all the time?

917
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,183
They're doing what? A hazing ritual?

918
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,227
This is where the path was made?

919
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,605
Did anyone come here?
Was there anyone other than us?

920
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:32,191
I've never seen
such an arrogant answer before.

921
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,611
You have the audacity to write something
like this. Do you think I'm wrong?

922
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,990
I asked you if you think I'm wrong.

923
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,452
Yes, you're wrong.

924
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,039
