1
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,909
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,119
I'll see you another time.

3
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,394
Well...

4
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,565
What did you two talk about in the room?

5
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,035
Do you know each other by any chance?

6
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,372
Go and get some rest.

7
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,614
He had no medical knowledge.
He just assisted a merchants' guild

8
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,950
and never held any public office.

9
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,870
He passed away when I was little.

10
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,250
No...

11
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,878
Did you say your name is Mo-hwa?

12
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,965
I apologize, sir.

13
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,552
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,928
It's okay.

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,348
Those punks are the ones
that need to apologize, not you.

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,850
20 YEARS AGO, SUNGKYUNKWAN

17
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,185
Why do we need to apologize?

18
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,188
She grabbed
Kim's leg with her filthy hands

19
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,772
and poured some weird stuff on it.

20
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,694
I don't know what she poured on it,
but it stings so badly now.

21
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,948
You're too foolish for students learning
the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.

22
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,077
Look. The hands of this servant
who works in the kitchen all day long

23
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,163
and the feet of you boys
who played soccer all day.

24
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,416
What would be filthier?

25
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,297
Go and wash up.

26
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,133
You boys reek of sweat. Go on.

27
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
How did you know

28
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,244
to apply salt water on wounds?

29
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,502
My lord.

30
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,838
I am a lowly servant.

31
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,633
I can't really read or write,

32
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,345
so how could I learn anything?

33
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,765
Are you still that narrow-minded?

34
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,607
This is what I believe.

35
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
Those of noble birth

36
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,322
are not born with more talents

37
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,492
than lowborn people.

38
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,745
Mo-hwa.

39
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,834
Regardless of your origin,
you were born with many talents.

40
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,088
Hence, assist me and become someone
who is valuable.

41
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,972
Today, let's talk about the wind.

42
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,855
SEORAEWON

43
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,116
Does anyone want to share their opinion?

44
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,492
-Me.
-Yes.

45
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,745
We can feel the wind.

46
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,372
Right, we can feel the wind.

47
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,623
-Me.
-Yes.

48
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm so sorry, sir.

49
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm sorry. This happened
because he kept talking to me.

50
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,137
Hey, when? You were just distracted.

51
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,930
You're being like this again.

52
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,224
Since this spoiled boy
has been coddled all his life,

53
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,018
he can't even admit his fault.

54
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,936
Hey, you promised me
you'd never bring that up.

55
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,899
Aren't you the girl who will study
under Dr. Dominique?

56
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,152
It's nice to meet you. I'm Goo Jae-gyeong.

57
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,296
"In addition, the groups of bones

58
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,592
in the chest strengthen the shoulder bones

59
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,803
and provide sturdy support.

60
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,347
They also support the arms.

61
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,935
Furthermore, the shoulder bones
are only attached to the ribs..."

62
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,647
Hold on.

63
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,357
What was this again?

64
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,360
CLAVICULAS

65
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,986
You forgot it again?

66
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,863
The collarbone.

67
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,826
You said you know every word,
but you don't know so many words.

68
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
Latin is a hard language to learn.

69
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,623
Plus, this is a medical book.

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
Forget it. I'm done.

71
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,795
Read, write,
and do whatever you want to do.

72
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,843
That's why I offered to write it for you.

73
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
Jae-gyeong!

74
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,339
Mo-hwa!

75
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,968
-I totally knew it.
-I knew she'd pull it off.

76
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,803
-Oh, my.
-I didn't think she'd succeed.

77
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,722
My gosh, this is truly impressive.

78
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,433
-Wow, Mo-hwa is really amazing.
-Great job.

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,601
Mo-hwa, you rock!

80
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,741
Teacher.

81
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,075
Teacher.

82
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,927
Sam-bo.

83
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,723
Be quiet.

84
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,729
You're being so loud!

85
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,899
Eunuch Heo.

86
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,958
What on earth is going on?

87
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,341
Did you sleep well?

88
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,051
What are you

89
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,762
-doing now?
-Paying for my food.

90
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,180
-For your food?
-Yes.

91
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,015
People here told me

92
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,268
that only eating and doing no work

93
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,811
makes you a useless parasite.

94
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,439
I've been told that I must earn my keep
no matter what.

95
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,358
That's what they said.

96
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,408
Thank you.

97
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,842
This one, too.

98
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,717
You little...

99
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,680
Why you little... Hey!

100
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,391
Hey, get back here.

101
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,549
What's wrong?

102
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,261
The palace guards. They're here.

103
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:47,201
But there was no way he could meet
Rapunzel, who was locked up in a tower.

104
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,413
The tower had no doors or stairs.

105
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,084
One day, the prince came up
with a great idea.

106
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,460
-What was it?
-What did he do?

107
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,173
"Rapunzel!

108
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,509
Let down your hair

109
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,096
so that I may climb the golden stair."

110
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,807
Like this.

111
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,401
So the prince

112
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,529
held her tresses like this

113
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,366
and climbed the tower step by step.

114
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,412
Solely in the hope of seeing her

115
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,749
and with his burning passion
of professing his love to her.

116
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,218
Do you

117
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,137
already know this story?

118
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,556
No, I don't.

119
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,935
To tell you the truth,
I can't quite relate to the story.

120
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,108
I know it's fiction, but don't you think
the storyline itself is too far-fetched?

121
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,068
Your hair isn't likely to outgrow
your height

122
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,070
even if you let it grow out all your life.

123
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,658
So how could her hair reach the ground
from the top of the tall tower?

124
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,453
Is she a 500-year-old goddess
or something?

125
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,498
Can't you just think of it
as a beautiful story...

126
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,002
Beautiful, my foot.
In fact, it's such a cruel story.

127
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,297
Even when you pull a strand of hair
while combing your tresses,

128
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,424
your whole scalp hurts so much.

129
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,509
And what? A full-grown man
will climb up her hair?

130
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,137
By the time the prince reaches
the top of the tower,

131
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,389
he'd either find her unconscious
due to the pain

132
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,766
or dead from a broken neck

133
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,935
due to the heavy weight.

134
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,710
Well, I mean...

135
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,546
So what happened after that?

136
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,923
Forget it.

137
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,133
I was a fool to expect
some romance from you.

138
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,137
Come on. Please go on.

139
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,057
I'll keep my mouth shut
and just listen quietly.

140
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,022
Your Highness.

141
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,568
So what happened
after he climbed the tower?

142
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,953
-Any news?
-No, it was another unfruitful day.

143
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,330
No one in the city has seen him.

144
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,001
It doesn't seem like he has managed
to escape the palace yet.

145
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,755
By the way, what happened that day?

146
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,675
You left saying you'd try asking
your acquaintance for help.

147
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,094
Were you not able
to figure out a solution?

148
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,101
He might come to that spot,
so keep your eyes peeled.

149
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,353
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,782
You're leaving already?

151
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,911
The Ministry of Personnel summoned us.
We're so excited.

152
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,083
Girls, don't rashly accept an offer
for a high-ranking position.

153
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,004
Being a leader is truly stressful.
It's like being a dragon or something.

154
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,090
Every department tells me
that nothing gets done without me.

155
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,429
Isn't it embarrassing to call the senior
seventh-rank a high-ranking position?

156
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,347
There are many ranks above it.

157
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,558
Forget the dragon.

158
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,310
We'll call you a salamander.

159
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,103
You're right.

160
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,982
I've said in the past
that Officer Yang looks like something.

161
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,735
I was referring to a salamander.

162
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,445
A salamander!

163
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,865
-A salamander.
-He does look like one.

164
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,952
Mark my words.

165
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,664
All of you will go to hell when you die.

166
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,293
We'll go to the Ministry of Personnel
and leave for the day,

167
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,628
so as for all the books here...

168
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,549
You two chortlers over there,
you guys can organize them all.

169
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,218
-Wait.
-Officer Yang!

170
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,427
-No.
-No.

171
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,031
Why not?

172
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,284
We, senior historians, will kindly

173
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,995
organize your sachaeks.

174
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,831
Hold on.

175
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,125
Come to think of it, it is strange.

176
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,462
Officer Seong has been organizing
Clerk Goo's sachaek for her.

177
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,256
She wouldn't even let us touch it.

178
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,843
What's going on? Did you record something
you're not allowed to?

179
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,597
What is it, then?

180
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:06,520
Don't tell me the Crown Prince
and Prince Dowon fought. Is that it?

181
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,357
You'd better show us.

182
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,276
I mean, we're all historians.

183
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,444
You can't be selective
about who you show it to.

184
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,904
It's so petty.

185
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,281
Come on. Let's see it.

186
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,795
I will get to work now.

187
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,259
Let's go. We'll be late.

188
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,933
Those two are definitely hiding something.

189
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,145
Are they dating?

190
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
What if Officer Seong divorces his wife?

191
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,821
You fools, stop reading
such third-rate novels.

192
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,656
Let's go.

193
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,503
That could've gotten me in big trouble.

194
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,717
I think about you every day.

195
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,347
I think...

196
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,520
I think about you every day.

197
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,483
I think about...

198
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,072
Why is it so hard?

199
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,950
"I think about you every day."
It's such a simple sentence.

200
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,868
Learning a foreign language isn't easy.

201
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,413
I had to work my butt off
to learn your language.

202
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
Can you think of an easier sentence?

203
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,464
"I like you."

204
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,342
"I miss you every moment."
Something like that.

205
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,433
I'm dumb.

206
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,810
I'm dumb.

207
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,355
"I like you." That's what it means.

208
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,065
I'm dumb.

209
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,109
I'm dumb.

210
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,654
Sam-bo, I'm dumb.

211
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,197
Me too. I'm dumb.

212
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm dumb.

213
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,912
Hae-ryung, I'm dumb.

214
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,624
Your Highness,
you don't have time for this.

215
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,376
You need to come out.

216
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,813
Those lads...

217
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,316
-What are they doing here?
-Oh, right.

218
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,277
They said they'll stand guard
at the royal residences starting today

219
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,988
because they haven't caught
the foreign intruder.

220
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,240
I didn't think the guards
would come here though.

221
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,077
They'll stand guard?

222
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:55,582
Are you saying those punks
will camp out there all day long?

223
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,044
What is it? Did something happen?

224
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,713
Go in, you silly goose. Go back inside.

225
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,142
Your Highness.

226
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,063
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

227
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,524
I didn't even realize
I was risking my life

228
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,945
as I was completely bewitched
by that sly weasel.

229
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,574
We'll get caught if we keep hiding him.
It's just a matter of time.

230
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,078
Who cares about his situation?
We must make him leave at once.

231
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,706
What are you talking about?
We're completely surrounded by the guards.

232
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,918
Kicking him out now
is basically like telling him to die.

233
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,923
Yes, calm down first.

234
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,508
In a few days, the guards will...

235
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:53,223
But what if they hear that punk's voice
during those "few days"?

236
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,725
You'll have to pray that our souls

237
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,145
may rest in peace on your way
to your place of exile.

238
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,857
And Apprentice Goo is obviously
our accomplice.

239
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,902
Eunuch Heo has a point.

240
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,405
Now that the palace guards
have entered here,

241
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,407
this is too dangerous for you,
Your Highness.

242
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,117
Apprentice Goo.

243
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,996
I'm not saying
we should kick him out at once.

244
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,082
We just need to make the palace guards
leave the premises.

245
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,462
Stop spewing such nonsense.

246
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,838
Who doesn't know that?

247
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,968
The problem is that
we can't find a way to do it.

248
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
There is no way.

249
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,015
What if I told you that there is a way?

250
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,897
This tactic enabled Han Xin

251
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,150
to win the Battle of Anyi
during the Chu–Han Contention.

252
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,654
"Show off your bravado,
create something out of nothing, and...

253
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,826
blindside your enemy."

254
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,453
SEONGDONGGYEOKSEO:
BLINDSIDE YOUR ENEMY

255
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,678
-It's over there.
-That way.

256
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,600
The intruder. We saw the foreign intruder.

257
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,645
-He went that way!
-Let's hurry.

258
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,104
-The intruder!
-We must catch him!

259
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,981
-The intruder!
-The intruder!

260
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,360
He came like this

261
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,281
and punched me. After that,
he practically flew all the way over there

262
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
and climbed over the wall.

263
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,995
You see, had I been dressed
in comfortable clothes,

264
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,415
I wouldn't have let him
get away like that.

265
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,296
I'm dead serious!

266
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,840
Hey, wait.

267
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,178
-The foreigner. I saw the foreigner.
-"The foreigner"?

268
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,139
You mean, the foreign intruder
who escaped the palace?

269
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,517
I saw him down the street.

270
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,603
I don't know what he did,
but his hands were covered in blood.

271
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,854
Blood?

272
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,817
Hey, don't tell anyone though.
It'll just generate gossip.

273
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
Of course, my lady. I won't tell anyone.

274
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,407
Go in and get some rest.

275
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,455
Gosh, my goodness.

276
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,041
Ms. Gwangju!

277
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,801
Ms. Gwangju! Hey, Ms. Gwangju.

278
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,930
We have a big problem!

279
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,727
The foreign intruder, who is this tall
and shoots blue beams from his eyes,

280
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,522
unsheathed a royal soldier's sword
and started brandishing it like this.

281
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,399
Then blood splashed everywhere,

282
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,193
and he got blood all over his hands.

283
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,322
Then he suddenly soared high in the sky
and touched the cloud.

284
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,950
After that, he started hopping like this
and vanished.

285
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,620
-Seriously?
-He could be somewhere around here.

286
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,248
Gosh, my heart is pounding.
I'm so terrified now.

287
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,172
At the intersection over there,
the foreign intruder hurt a baby.

288
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,966
-A baby?
-The foreign intruder did that?

289
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,179
Gosh, Mr. Kim.
What should we do? My goodness.

290
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,059
You know Minister Choe's daughter-in-law
who gave birth recently, right?

291
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,186
-The foreign intruder--
-What?

292
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,736
-Search thoroughly.
-Yes, sir!

293
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,863
Make way!

294
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,525
Identify yourself.

295
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,194
Open the door.
It is His Highness Prince Dowon.

296
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,696
Prince Dowon?

297
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,827
How dare you try to peek
at His Highness' face?

298
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,706
Must I tell His Highness your full name
to make you open the gates?

299
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,624
I apologize.

300
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,085
Open the gates.

301
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,212
Step aside.

302
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,526
Your Highness.

303
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,196
How did it go?
Did he leave the palace safely?

304
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,366
Yes, Your Highness. I took him
to Apprentice Goo safe and sound.

305
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,952
He will board a ship
as soon as he gets changed.

306
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,662
Good work.

307
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,790
I should've just followed him.

308
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,251
Goodness, why would you follow him?

309
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,627
To marry the foreigner?

310
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,217
Please don't upset her.
He is her first love.

311
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
So-hyang!

312
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,183
She has only known him for a few days,
and he's just a foreigner.

313
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,604
She should just forget about him
and move on.

314
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,193
Gosh. I wonder if he left safely.

315
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,614
Jean.

316
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,950
Are you still getting changed?

317
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,292
Jean, try to hurry up.

318
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,045
The sun will rise soon at this rate.

319
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,514
Jean!

320
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,031
I'm sorry I'm leaving like this.

321
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,826
I'm actually not a merchant.

322
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,287
I don't even know who Kim is.

323
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,997
I lied to you.

324
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,791
The real reason is something else.

325
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,046
To tell you the truth,
my brother is in Joseon.

326
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,801
He left home a long time ago
when I was little

327
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,553
and didn't return.

328
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,056
Hence, I came here to find him.

329
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,601
Although I don't know where he's buried.

330
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,938
I hope you understand
why I had to lie about my situation.

331
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,734
The place where dawn comes to greet you
is where my brother used to be.

332
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,446
I heard knowing the name of the place
can put you in serious danger,

333
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,197
so I couldn't tell you.

334
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,121
I put my life on the line
when I decided to come here,

335
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,415
but you guys don't need
to risk your lives.

336
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,791
Let's go.

337
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,503
You gave me food and a place to sleep.

338
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,672
You hid and helped me.

339
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:12,513
Thank you for letting me understand
why my brother loved Joseon so much.

340
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,851
Thank you for everything.

341
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,440
I wish you the best at all times.

342
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,945
"From Jean, the Western intruder."

343
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,491
He came suddenly and left suddenly.

344
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,077
There's no stopping him.

345
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,247
Anyway, it's finally over.

346
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,500
I can finally sleep in peace

347
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,126
without worrying.

348
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,213
Aren't you worried about how I caught you?

349
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,924
I already wrote it all down
in this sachaek.

350
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,425
What does it say?

351
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,512
"Prince Dowon broke the royal command
for the millionth time"?

352
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,476
Anyway,

353
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,355
about the place
where Jean's brother stayed.

354
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,898
Don't you think it's odd?

355
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:10,321
Where could this be that merely knowing
its name could get you in danger?

356
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,117
I want to know, too.

357
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,579
I'm sure it's not literally
where the dawn breaks.

358
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,026
Mo-hwa?

359
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,704
I thought you might not make it.

360
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,956
Have you been all right?

361
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,002
Yes, I was helped out by good people.

362
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm sorry I made you worried.

363
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,216
No, I'm thankful that you came...

364
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,726
What's wrong?

365
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,689
You look

366
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,859
very much like your brother.

367
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,823
Do you still remember what he looked like?

368
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,367
How could I forget?

369
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,121
I learned medicine from him for years.

370
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,169
It must have been annoying.
Dominique nags so much.

371
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,594
You told me that you know
where he's buried, right?

372
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:03,601
Can you take me there?

373
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,253
Where in this place...

374
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,221
I see. He wasn't buried

375
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,473
because he was a criminal.

376
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,734
Do you think it hurt a lot?

377
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,290
Do you think he was scared?

378
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,631
I'm sorry.

379
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,220
But there was no way
he could meet Rapunzel,

380
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,431
who was locked up in a tower.

381
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,851
The tower had no doors or stairs.

382
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,312
One day, the prince came up
with a great idea.

383
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,932
My Lord.

384
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,851
Dominique has now left to be with you.

385
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,896
Forgive his sins with your mercy

386
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,648
and shine your light on him.

387
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,277
Give him your eternal freedom and rest.

388
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,393
They're going to kill everyone.

389
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,479
-Why did he come here?
-He's a Western barbarian.

390
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,564
-He'll grab anyone he sees.
-Really?

391
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,736
-He hasn't been caught yet.
-Goodness me.

392
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,322
UNLESS HE AND HIS HELPER SHOW UP,
THE CATHOLICS WILL BE EXECUTED

393
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,574
This is the guy who abducts little kids.

394
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,119
-I heard he takes everyone.
-My goodness.

395
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,331
Good morning!

396
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,292
-Good morning.
-Hey.

397
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,252
Why does he look so tired?

398
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,421
-He got no sleep.
-What?

399
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,131
He was scared of the barbarian.

400
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,550
The barbarian?

401
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,969
Wait, are you scared of that rumor?

402
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,015
It's not just a rumor.

403
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,727
My wife's friend saw him herself.

404
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,355
He was in Bukchon with bloodshot eyes,

405
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,483
walking around with blood
all over his body.

406
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,485
It wasn't Bukchon. It's Namsangol.

407
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,946
People said he was eating a raw snake.

408
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,283
I heard he was around Boksagol.

409
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,579
Don't let your imagination go wild.

410
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,039
Be quiet and get to work.

411
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,207
Clerks, go to the Royal Secretariat.

412
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,917
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

413
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,753
Officer Yang!

414
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,880
Officer Yang.

415
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,590
Why are you bringing that yourself?

416
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,925
Why do you ask?

417
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,512
I brought it on my way
to watch all of you fight.

418
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,891
So who'll be going
to the execution ground?

419
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,808
Begin your fight.

420
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,605
What do you mean?

421
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,982
Going to the execution ground?

422
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,109
Haven't you seen the announcement?

423
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,990
Let me have that.

424
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,326
What is this?

425
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,164
"The person who helped or hid
the barbarian from the West

426
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,166
must bring him to the government office.

427
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,460
If the person doesn't show up,

428
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,962
the 73 Catholic criminals

429
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,547
will be executed."

430
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,983
He never discussed this with me.

431
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,820
Why did he decide to give such an order?

432
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,323
I'm not fully aware of what happened,

433
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,367
but I heard

434
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,869
a letter was sent to his bedroom at dawn.

435
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,706
The Second State Councillor.

436
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,052
Your Highness!

437
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,305
You can't do this, Your Highness! Please!

438
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,519
Please don't do this.

439
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,148
You just need to pretend
like you don't know anything.

440
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,151
Please act like you had
nothing to do with him.

441
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,821
-Where's my royal robe?
-Your Highness!

442
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,577
Apprentice Goo, will you please stop him?

443
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,704
If he confesses to His Majesty,

444
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,540
we'll all be doomed.

445
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,752
Don't worry too much.

446
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,006
You just wrote what you saw.

447
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,676
And Eunuch Heo and the court ladies
just followed my orders.

448
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,307
I did this all by myself.

449
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,517
So I'll take responsibility.

450
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,562
It's not that simple!

451
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,231
Not only did you hide a criminal,

452
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,358
but you even helped him run away.

453
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,988
You really could get severely punished
this time around!

454
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,785
You can't go.

455
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,581
You can beat me to death if you must.

456
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,417
But I can't let you go.

457
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,046
I won't let you
take another step from here.

458
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,051
Your Highness!

459
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,721
We're talking about 73 people.

460
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,684
If I don't do anything,

461
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,062
73 people will die.

462
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,898
Do you still think

463
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,109
I'm making the wrong choice?

464
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,821
Are you saying my safety

465
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,324
is more important

466
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,077
than the lives of all those people?

467
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,460
I've been hiding here

468
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,713
my entire life.

469
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,259
I will no longer

470
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,637
live that way.

471
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,224
Please let me go with you.

472
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,691
I will

473
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,110
enter the chamber.

474
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,996
Apprentice Song.

475
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,965
Your Royal Highness,
a historian has arrived.

476
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,383
Let him in.

477
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,695
Officer Seong.

478
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,024
DAEJOJEON

479
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,612
Your Highness.

480
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,448
-Tell him I'm here.
-Yes, Your Highness.

481
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:23,077
Your Majesty, Prince Dowon is here.

482
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,037
Prince Dowon?

483
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:26,789
Let him in.

484
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,142
What brings you here?

485
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,114
What are you doing?

486
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,824
Your Majesty.

487
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,744
Please don't punish the Catholics.

488
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,666
I'm the one
that the Royal Investigation Bureau

489
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,294
should be looking for.

490
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,132
I helped the Westerner.

491
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,010
What

492
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,263
are you saying?

493
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,349
I'm the one who helped him hide.

494
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,894
And I'm the one who helped him
leave the palace.

495
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,022
So I'm the one

496
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,943
whom you should punish.

497
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,037
Were you aware of what he had done

498
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,123
before he ran away?

499
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,501
Yes.

500
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,755
And were you aware that I had given orders

501
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,048
to catch him?

502
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,051
Yes.

503
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,721
Then are you saying you defied me

504
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,891
when you were already aware of everything?

505
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,895
Yes.

506
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,734
How dare you!

507
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,653
I thought you finally came to your senses.

508
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,072
But you dared to defy me?

509
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,326
How could a prince think of helping
a barbarian from the West?

510
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,496
I didn't think of him as a barbarian.

511
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,165
I thought of him as a fellow human being

512
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,001
who is no different from myself.

513
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,588
They're no human beings.

514
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,341
They're animals who know nothing
about morals and Confucianism.

515
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,927
All they ever think about

516
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,887
is how they can invade our country.

517
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,097
They're barbarians
who deserve to be slaughtered.

518
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,523
This is why you never deserved
to be a prince.

519
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,609
You may be a prince on the outside,

520
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,445
but you just can't hide your filthy roots.

521
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,580
Eunuch!

522
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,378
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,214
Tell the Royal Investigation Bureau

524
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,717
to behead all the Catholics
and discard the bodies outside the palace.

525
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,177
-Father!
-Shut your mouth!

526
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,432
If you bring this up one more time,

527
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,436
I'll behead every single person
who knows about this

528
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,982
starting from that female historian.

529
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,656
Why are you still standing there?

530
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,284
Your Majesty, the thing is...

531
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,580
I received an urgent message

532
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:59,084
saying His Royal Highness
acquitted all the Catholics.

533
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,296
What?

534
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,132
They got arrested
based on my royal orders.

535
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,759
How could he...

536
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,513
Where is he right now?

537
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,298
-Your Royal Highness--
-Get out of my way.

538
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,142
I'll give you a chance to persuade me.

539
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,063
Go ahead and give me an excuse
if you have one.

540
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,109
Do you think I'll forgive you

541
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,278
if you stay silent?

542
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,113
I thought it was wrong.

543
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,411
A king is a father to all his subjects.

544
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,663
And what kind of father

545
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,832
would use his children's lives
to achieve something?

546
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,834
Are you trying to tell me

547
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,254
that I'm not qualified to be a king?

548
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,926
Answer me!

549
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,515
Are you denying

550
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,768
that I'm the king of this country?

551
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,530
What do you think you're doing?

552
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,539
He's going to be the king of this country.

553
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,125
How could you humiliate him like this

554
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,876
in front of all the historians
and court ladies?

555
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,088
Are you so angry

556
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,632
that you've even forgotten
the royal family's dignity?

557
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,564
I am letting this slide just this once

558
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,025
because of your darn title.

559
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,475
You may leave now.

560
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,643
No.

561
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,818
I'll stay.

562
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,339
Gosh, don't be a crybaby.

563
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,467
Can you be more gentle?

564
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,594
It stings.

565
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,306
This is what you get
for not listening to me.

566
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,474
Just bear with it.

567
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,106
Stop making a fuss.

568
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,404
You're very fortunate
that nothing more happened.

569
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,323
I thought

570
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,576
you might get exiled to the mountains

571
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,704
or get kicked out of the palace
with absolutely nothing.

572
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,707
You have no idea how worried I was.

573
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,084
I'm sorry

574
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,586
for getting angry at you

575
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,339
-earlier.
-My gosh.

576
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,926
Your handsome face is making it hard
for me to get angry at you.

577
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,011
Wait here.

578
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,222
I'll go and get you some medicine

579
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,224
to help you calm down.

580
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,693
Are you okay?

581
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,571
If I tell you

582
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,490
that I'm not okay,

583
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,701
will you console me?

584
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,248
I'll be fine.

585
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,001
I'll just read books for a couple of days

586
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,879
and spend time thinking of other things.

587
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,885
Can you

588
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,054
tell me I did well?

589
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,558
That is

590
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,311
all I need right now.

591
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,801
You did a good thing.

592
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,694
His Majesty got extremely furious

593
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,197
and tried to break
His Royal Highness' leg.

594
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,782
The eunuchs tried to stop him,

595
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,076
and the Queen Dowager kept crying.

596
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,537
They barely managed to calm him down.

597
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,165
That sounds a little far-stretched.

598
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,293
-I don't think His Majesty would--
-I'm serious.

599
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,337
I came running right after I heard
about it.

600
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:22,550
Why do you always get so excited
over false rumors?

601
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,470
You're a historian.
You should act like one.

602
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,014
-But...
-Just ask Clerk Song

603
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,101
to show us her sachaek when she returns.

604
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,815
By the way, don't you find it
a little strange?

605
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,068
They took down all the announcements

606
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,112
in less than half a day,

607
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,031
and His Royal Highness suddenly
released all the Catholics.

608
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,284
Maybe they caught the barbarian.

609
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,412
Then they would've hung him
out in the street.

610
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,164
Everyone in the country is
shivering in fear because of him.

611
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,292
Then why do you think

612
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,211
His Royal Highness freed the Catholics?

613
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,382
They may not have helped the barbarian,
but they're still criminals.

614
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,009
So why?

615
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,180
I got a hunch. I think I know.

616
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:10,932
I can sense

617
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,602
that there's an interesting conspiracy
behind all this.

618
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,855
Where's Officer Seong?

619
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,316
Officer Seong?

620
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,361
I haven't seen him for a while.

621
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,864
I met him out front earlier.

622
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,868
He told Apprentice Song
that he needs to enter the chamber first

623
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,411
and asked her to come an hour later.

624
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,996
Then he went to the Dongungjeon.

625
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,666
The Dongungjeon? Why would he go there?

626
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,835
I don't know.

627
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,796
It sounded really urgent.

628
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,841
Urgent?

629
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,628
Is it true that you went

630
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,172
to the Dongungjeon?

631
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,306
Officer Seong.

632
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,850
Answer me.

633
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,229
Did you have anything to do

634
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,315
with what His Royal Highness did today?

635
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,278
Yes.

636
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,157
I went to see His Royal Highness.

637
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,369
And?

638
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,624
I asked him to release the Catholics.

639
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,545
And I threatened him

640
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,339
saying I'll tell everyone

641
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:10,093
that Prince Dowon helped the Westerner

642
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,762
if he didn't release them.

643
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,575
Do you know

644
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,870
what you just did?

645
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:40,957
Do you know?

646
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,502
You...

647
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,300
A historian used the sachaek

648
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,386
to interfere with the country's affairs.

649
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,848
You did something

650
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,310
that a historian should never do.

651
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,979
How can you

652
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,025
call yourself a historian
after what you've done?

653
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,070
I also do not think of myself
as a historian.

654
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,406
-Officer Seong.
-After I became determined

655
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,034
to protect my fellow Catholics,

656
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,871
I gave up on being a historian.

657
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,299
So what?

658
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,429
Now that you've achieved your goal,

659
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,682
you're just going to resign?

660
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,732
Did being a historian

661
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,945
mean so little to you?
How can you think of quitting so easily?

662
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,491
Did it mean nothing?

663
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,495
I know that I cannot

664
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,414
be forgiven.

665
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,293
And I know that I have no right
to resign on my own will.

666
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,713
Please punish me

667
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,342
for dishonoring
the Office of Royal Decrees

668
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,303
and for betraying my colleagues' trust.

669
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,643
I'll endure whatever punishment I'm given.

670
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,978
Officer Seong...

671
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,815
How could you...

672
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,004
Lady Sa-hui.

673
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,391
My lord.

674
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,394
Bring her inside.

675
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,828
I'm sorry if I startled you
for bringing you here without a warning.

676
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,707
There's no need for you
to be worried about that.

677
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,085
What do you need?

678
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,464
I heard you were at the Dongungjeon

679
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,965
when His Majesty came by today.

680
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,844
Everyone in the palace knows about that.

681
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,181
I'm sure you're already aware
of what happened.

682
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:47,769
No, what I'm trying to find out
is what happened before that.

683
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,190
I heard Prince Dowon visited His Majesty
with a female historian

684
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,817
right before His Majesty
went to the Dongungjeon.

685
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,447
I want you to bring me her sachaek.

686
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,999
Your Highness!

687
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,793
Your Highness!

688
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,754
Your Highness!

689
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,506
Your Highness!

690
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,595
Will you please stop
yelling my name like that

691
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,472
every time you need to talk to me?

692
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,641
I get so startled every time you yell.

693
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,267
This time,

694
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,104
it really is a big deal.

695
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,440
I heard they're going to install
the Garyecheong.

696
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,817
For a royal wedding?

697
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,404
-Who's getting married?
-Who do you think?

698
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:44,325
There's only one person who's old enough
to get married in the royal family.

699
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,749
Me? Prince Dowon?

700
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,419
Yes! It's for you, Your Highness!

701
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,589
His Majesty gave orders
to arrange your marriage.

702
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,023
A royal family's marriage
isn't a joyous event.

703
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,483
It's just politics.

704
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,027
It's time for you
to let go of Prince Dowon.

705
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,447
His magnanimity and intelligence
cannot be seen as ordinary.

706
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,616
I'd like to discuss
Prince Dowon's marriage.

707
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,743
Do you think I can't see through you?

708
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,287
You really have a bad attitude today.

709
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,164
You seem very determined.

710
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,541
What if I am determined?

711
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,918
A sachaek shouldn't be a weapon.

712
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:20,129
Dismiss Officer Seong Seo-gwon
and have him banished.

713
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,840
How can you put principles above people?

714
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,343
Is that faith of yours
so important to you?

715
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,762
I don't intend on marrying anyone else.

716
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,972
If you feel the same way...

717
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,308
You don't need to obey
the Second State Councillor

718
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,644
just because he helped you become
a female historian.

719
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,231
-What if I feel the same way?
-I already have the right person in mind.
