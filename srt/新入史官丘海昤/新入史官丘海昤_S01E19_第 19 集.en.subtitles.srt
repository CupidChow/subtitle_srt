EPISODE 19

2
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,850
NOKSEODANG

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,227
Is it not in the back either?

4
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,979
No, there isn't even a trace.

5
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,860
By any chance, is there a possibility
that someone else has taken it already?

6
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,529
I lived here my whole life.

7
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,698
If something like that was found here,
I would have known for sure.

8
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,286
And before you began to live here,
this place was deserted for a long time,

9
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,747
so no one would have searched here.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,927
I'll take another look over here.
You should get some rest.

11
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,929
I'm fine.

12
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,223
Your shoulder isn't even well yet.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,476
If it gets infected,
it will give you a hard time.

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,609
-Why?
-Do you not care?

15
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,737
I might not be

16
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,782
the person you always thought I was.

17
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,163
Then what do you believe

18
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,415
I think of you?

19
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,340
To me, you are a weird person

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,802
who can write amazing romance novels

21
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,138
when you don't know a thing about women.

22
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,849
Also, you're someone
who's scared of tigers,

23
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,436
but who can do anything
when it comes to love.

24
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,027
And you never even
pick a flower recklessly.

25
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,115
You always leave rice grains
on the windowsill for birds.

26
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
That is

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,203
the Prince Dowon that I know.

28
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,330
You'll always be the person I know.

29
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,808
Eunuch Hong Il-seop
of the Office of Eunuchs. Get him!

30
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,021
Darn it.

31
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,828
Come in.

32
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,460
He made a confession.
It was the Queen Dowager's doing.

33
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,421
-Tell them to report it as it is.
-Yes, my lord.

34
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,437
Are you saying the Queen Dowager was
the one who spread The Story of Ho Dam?

35
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,190
Yes, we received a report
from the Royal Investigation Bureau.

36
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,110
They questioned the court ladies
involved in this incident,

37
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,946
and they all confessed that
they followed her order.

38
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,908
Your Majesty, forgive me for saying this.

39
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,452
But The Story of Ho Dam is
a completely made-up story

40
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,162
written by the remnants of Seoraewon

41
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,039
to praise the dethroned King's
odd behaviors.

42
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,293
What do you reckon it means
if such a book was found

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,961
within the Queen Dowager's place?

44
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,298
On top of that, she was
the mother of the dethroned King--

45
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,301
So what? Are you suggesting that
the Queen Dowager of this country was

46
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,095
secretly in league with the traitors?

47
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,851
Your Royal Highness.

48
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:14,147
I do not believe that the Queen Dowager is
involved in this incident.

49
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,943
However, what we do know clearly is
that the remnants of Seoraewon have

50
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,404
deeply infiltrated the palace
to cause division.

51
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,281
How can we just sit around and watch this?

52
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,494
Your Majesty, the safety
of the royal family is at stake.

53
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,707
Please close the Queen Dowager's place
and interrogate the court ladies

54
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,083
to find out who's behind this.

55
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,634
Don't let them, Your Majesty.

56
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,179
If you let them interrogate
the court ladies of her place,

57
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,932
it's as good as announcing that
the Queen Dowager is behind this.

58
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,309
That's just speculation.

59
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,396
I just wish to root out
the remnants of Seoraewon.

60
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,899
I am not claiming that
the Queen Dowager is guilty.

61
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,277
The things of the Inner Palace
can't be dealt with in the royal court.

62
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,906
This is the royal family's trouble.
Let me take care of this.

63
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,407
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

64
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,658
Silence!

65
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,498
Give me some time to think.

66
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,759
Your Majesty.

67
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,262
You cannot let the Second State Councillor
have his way with this.

68
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,931
You must give me permission.

69
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,891
Like I said, I'll think about it.

70
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,851
You should go for now.

71
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,978
You must turn it down at once.

72
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,525
How can you ignore his plan to cut off
the Queen Dowager's hands and feet

73
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,236
-and confine her within her place?
-I told you to leave.

74
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,823
I can't back down.

75
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,283
The Second State Councillor is

76
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,828
the treacherous one
who blames the innocent Queen Dowager

77
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,913
and who wants to divide up
the royal family.

78
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,958
Your Majesty!

79
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,293
What do you know to meddle with this?

80
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,214
It's all for your sake.

81
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,425
It's all to protect you

82
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,635
from Prince Dowon.

83
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,847
What do you mean?

84
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,099
Did you honestly

85
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,892
have no idea?

86
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,979
That he's the dethroned King's son?

87
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,486
-Father.
-Yes.

88
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,531
He was born
as the crown prince of this country.

89
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,494
He's the eldest son
of that legitimate King, Yi Gyeom.

90
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,747
The Queen Dowager is

91
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,459
trying to enthrone Prince Dowon
instead of you.

92
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,086
She's dragging in
the remnants of Seoraewon

93
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,339
and spreading Yi Gyeom's stories
all over the palace

94
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,176
for Prince Dowon,

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,845
Yi Rim's sake.

96
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,062
Two decades have passed
ever since I took the throne.

97
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,441
But there are scholars
all over the land of Joseon

98
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,526
speaking of the legitimacy
of my enthronement.

99
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,490
That's how important your birth is.

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,035
From the moment you are born
until the day you die,

101
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,413
you cannot get rid of it

102
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,415
no matter how much you try.

103
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,253
So if the Queen Dowager
uses the most legitimate Prince Dowon

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,630
to create influence of her own

105
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,424
and bring up the rebellion
from 20 years ago,

106
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,468
what do you think will happen?

107
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,679
Even if you become the king,

108
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,224
you'll forever be the king
that stole the throne

109
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,726
from the direct descendant.

110
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,233
I know for a fact that you'll be
a better king than me.

111
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,611
That's why I must come to a decision.

112
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,281
So please do not get in my way.

113
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,201
Just stay quiet...

114
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,454
and wait.

115
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,242
-Take them!
-Yes, master!

116
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,577
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,334
Your Royal Highness,
please order them to stop at once.

118
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,305
Your Majesty.

119
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,350
Don't get flustered.

120
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,020
The king felt cornered
and made the wrong choice.

121
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,148
He may be the king,

122
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,234
but he chose to attack his own mother.

123
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,822
So that will enrage the Confucian scholars
throughout the country.

124
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,043
I see that you come here very often.

125
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,129
Why do you need the records on Nokseodang?

126
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,050
I don't really know.
I'm just following orders.

127
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,469
Thank you.

128
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,721
Hey, wait. Is that all?

129
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,100
Did he mention that he's going to help me
get promoted or anything like that?

130
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,520
-He did ask me to tell you something.
-What's that?

131
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,940
He told me that he'll rip your tongue out
if you ever go around telling people

132
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,025
that Prince Dowon asked
to see a few records

133
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,862
from the Royal Secretariat.

134
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,783
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

135
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,297
Let's think from the very beginning.

136
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,551
If I were Officer Kim Il-mok...

137
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,690
Nokseodang would've been
the best place to hide something

138
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,068
since it was practically abandoned
and was very remote from the main palace.

139
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,536
The daily record needs to be safe
from sunlight and rain,

140
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,829
so it can't be the garden.

141
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
This spot is damp and filled with bugs,

142
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,468
so it's definitely not here.

143
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,489
It can't be somewhere that's easy to find.

144
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,039
But it can't be somewhere
that's impossible to find either.

145
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,979
That gate got repaired 19 years ago.

146
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,487
They laid new roof tiles 15 years ago.

147
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,366
The mud walls went through repair work
eight years ago.

148
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,788
So it can't be any of them.

149
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,177
NOKSEODANG

150
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,433
Apprentice Goo.

151
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,520
It's not time for you to be here yet.

152
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,607
Your Highness, this signboard...

153
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,693
When did you replace it?

154
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,405
-The signboard?
-It looks new.

155
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,949
But it doesn't say
the Board of Public Works replaced it.

156
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,118
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS:
IN CHARGE OF BUILDINGS

157
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh, well...

158
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,121
I'm not sure.

159
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,791
That was probably there
before His Highness moved here.

160
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,837
It's strange that it never rots.
Also, the color never fades.

161
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,011
NOKSEODANG

162
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,099
Be careful. Be gentle, Your Highness.

163
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,977
My goodness. Your Highness, please.

164
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,367
My gosh, what is this?

165
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,955
It's chuanxiong and calamus.

166
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,125
They're used to store history records.

167
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,133
SEORAEWON

168
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,647
Is this the daily record

169
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,650
we've been looking for?

170
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,694
Yes, I saw the word "Seoraewon"
written on the record.

171
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,199
It's from the year of gyeongo.

172
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,710
Your Highness.

173
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,713
No, Your Highness. It's a daily record.

174
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,174
You're not allowed to read it.

175
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,258
What do you mean?

176
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,053
I know it's been hidden for a long time,

177
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,264
but it's still a daily record
written by a historian.

178
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,685
Only historians are allowed to read it.

179
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,978
Then

180
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,857
are you telling me not to do anything
even after I found it?

181
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,319
Regardless of what's written
on this daily record,

182
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,446
it's up to the historians to read it

183
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,491
and decide what to do.

184
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,369
Your Highness.

185
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,040
Please wait a little bit.

186
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,291
No.

187
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,293
I can't wait anymore.

188
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
I don't care about that right now.

189
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,383
-Your Highness.
-I've been wondering my whole life.

190
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,973
All my life, I had to wonder

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,600
why His Majesty hated me so much,

192
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,312
and why I always had to be locked up here.

193
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,316
How do you expect me to wait

194
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,404
when the answer is right in front of me?

195
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,957
I'm going to read this
no matter what you say.

196
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,085
So you can tell His Majesty
or His Royal Highness

197
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,797
that Prince Dowon
broke the law of this country.

198
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,509
-Then you would've done your part.
-Your Highness.

199
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,888
-How can I--
-If you can't do that,

200
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,849
I'll do it myself.

201
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,937
Your Highness, you can't do this! Please!

202
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,065
-Please don't do this.
-Get out of my way.

203
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:50,444
You cannot keep that daily record!

204
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,737
If you do this,

205
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,241
you don't know what might happen to you.

206
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,202
Your Highness!

207
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,871
I'll... I'll tell you everything.

208
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,707
I'll...

209
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,168
I'll tell you everything.

210
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,046
Please don't go.

211
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,144
Your Highness.

212
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,155
His Majesty ordered
not to let anyone inside.

213
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,657
Please return.

214
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,543
Do you think
it will be difficult for me to kill you?

215
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
Your Highness!

216
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,350
Your Highness!

217
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,604
-Your Highness.
-Tell her I'm here.

218
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,440
-Your Majesty--
-Tell him to come inside.

219
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,956
Prince Dowon, what brings you here?

220
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,544
Please sit down.

221
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,179
Did something happen?

222
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,725
Prince Dowon.

223
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,852
Why did you make me become a prince?

224
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,901
Why did you...

225
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,738
make me live this kind of life?

226
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,868
I thought

227
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,288
everything was my fault.

228
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,918
I thought His Majesty hated
and neglected me

229
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,921
and made me lead

230
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,965
a solitary life in Nokseodang
like I didn't exist

231
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,803
because I wasn't good enough for him,
and I blamed myself for that.

232
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,932
But...

233
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,560
it was merely because

234
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,398
of the promise you had made
with His Majesty?

235
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,656
He spared my life
in exchange for the throne?

236
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,783
That's why

237
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,494
I had to live...

238
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,748
such a lonely

239
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,834
and miserable life?

240
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,421
You should have just

241
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,424
let me die as the dethroned king's son.

242
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,636
That

243
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
would have been better for me.

244
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,558
I would have rather died

245
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,602
than to have...

246
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,189
blamed and hated myself

247
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,025
my entire life.

248
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,715
Prince Dowon.

249
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,512
Please forgive me.

250
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,349
I had already lost my son
to those traitors.

251
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,104
And I couldn't afford to lose
my grandson as well.

252
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,275
I had to save you.

253
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,986
I had to protect you.

254
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,782
Did you really think

255
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,619
that would be the best for me?

256
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,708
I was guilty of having lived
when I should have died.

257
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,879
And you saw me
having to pay for that every single day.

258
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,215
But did you think that was okay

259
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,093
since I was able to stay alive?

260
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,271
Grandmother.

261
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,440
All my life,

262
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,111
I felt like I was being punished
for no reason.

263
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,199
I'm sick of that now.

264
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm so sick and tired
of living in this palace

265
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,705
and living as Prince Dowon.

266
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,333
I just want...

267
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,419
to let go of everything.

268
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,380
No.

269
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,632
Don't get swayed.

270
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,302
Everything will soon go back
to where it belongs.

271
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,640
You're the only true royal heir
of this country.

272
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,350
I will help you

273
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,187
take back the royal throne.

274
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,522
And when I do that,

275
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,443
no one will be able to hurt you anymore.

276
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,247
Prince Dowon.

277
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,208
I also

278
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,336
had to live...

279
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,968
in utter agony for the past 20 years.

280
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,264
Prince Hamyeong killed my son,

281
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,310
and every time I had to hear him
call me "mother,"

282
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,857
I felt like someone was
ripping my limbs apart,

283
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,820
and I burned with fury deep down inside.

284
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,655
But...

285
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,701
I still continued to live for your sake.

286
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,078
So please do the same

287
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,457
and continue to live for me.

288
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,417
Please endure this.

289
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,877
No.

290
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,379
No.

291
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,051
Think of your father who had to die

292
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,972
even when he did nothing wrong.

293
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,810
Please endure it for him.

294
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,025
Stay strong for a bit longer,

295
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,693
Prince Dowon.

296
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,988
You must do that.

297
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,109
My goodness.

298
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,148
Clerk Song is finally back.

299
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,692
Clerk Song.

300
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,362
Are you going to start working again?

301
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,656
Do you feel better now?

302
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,368
Your beautiful face became so scrawny.

303
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,454
I'm sorry.

304
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,915
I heard you got in trouble because of me.

305
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,875
Gosh, no.

306
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,294
It's all in the past now. It's okay.

307
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,504
Let's go eat something delicious tonight.

308
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,680
You finally came back,

309
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,641
but the palace is a complete mess.

310
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,018
We can't enter the Inner Palace
for a while.

311
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,312
-What happened?
-Don't even get me started.

312
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,149
The forbidden book called
The Story of Ho Dam caused a big mess.

313
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,526
The Second State Councillor
accused the Queen Dowager,

314
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,695
and His Royal Highness
refused to accept it.

315
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,073
And now, everyone's banned
to visit the Queen Dowager.

316
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,532
The palace guards are everywhere.

317
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,534
That's practically the same thing

318
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,204
as confining the Queen Dowager.

319
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,248
It's like we're living
in a barbaric country.

320
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,209
How could they do that to an elder?

321
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,962
Hey, don't even bother
talking about something so sensitive.

322
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,881
You'd better watch your mouths.

323
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,841
During times like this,

324
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,928
people always come
to hear stories from us.

325
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,391
Go home as soon as you get off work.
And don't even think of drinking, okay?

326
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,101
-Okay.
-Okay.

327
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,306
What is it that you wish to tell me?

328
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,559
There's something I need to ask.

329
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,978
What is it?

330
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,524
I heard there have been a few times
where historians revised the annals.

331
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,528
What kind of situation
calls for a revision?

332
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,158
Historians may write down the facts,

333
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,702
but vassals that control
the government office

334
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,912
can get swayed by the trend
and their parties.

335
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,417
So when the annals of history
seem incorrect

336
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,377
and unjust,

337
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,255
we follow the royal order
and create a revised version.

338
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,425
We leave the original copy and leave it

339
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,178
to the future generation
to judge what happened.

340
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,516
But why are you asking me that?

341
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,853
I found Officer Kim Il-mok's

342
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,106
-daily record.
-What do you mean?

343
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,485
I got help from an officer
who participated

344
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,237
in recording the dethronement
of the previous king 20 years ago.

345
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,115
And I heard those records

346
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,075
were based on lies.

347
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,368
Are you telling me...

348
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,955
that a historian edited the daily records?

349
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,999
Yes.

350
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,045
The late Officer Kim died
because he refused to follow such orders.

351
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,925
Who in the world...

352
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,761
Who...

353
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,856
Officer Min.

354
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,693
Shouldn't we...

355
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,613
reveal the truth?

356
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,198
No, don't do that.

357
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,951
That's not up to a historian.

358
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,286
I can't let you do that.

359
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,124
Have you forgotten?

360
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,213
What you're about to do
could end up killing the innocent.

361
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,965
-"The innocent?"
-Yes.

362
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,468
Are you sure it's not because
your father was involved?

363
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,891
They got credit and are living comfortably
for having taken part in the restoration,

364
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,435
but they can’t be considered innocent.

365
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,187
The innocent are the dethroned king

366
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,232
and the people of Seoraewon
who were condemned

367
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,026
for having disobeyed the noblemen

368
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,737
and dreamed of creating a new world.

369
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,039
They're the ones who are innocent.

370
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,923
Twenty years ago,

371
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,220
historians were ordered
to edit the daily records,

372
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,974
and the historian who refused to do that
got executed.

373
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,935
That's a fact.

374
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,230
If you disregard this
and say it's up to the royal court,

375
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,358
I will no longer be able

376
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,903
to respect you as my senior.

377
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,273
Father.

378
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,279
OFFICIAL APPOINTMENT CERTIFICATE

379
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,742
I am proud of you.

380
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,579
-I am truly proud of you.
-Well done.

381
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,603
My lady.

382
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,648
What are you up to these days
behind my back?

383
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,109
-What?
-Well...

384
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,862
Some scholar is here to see you,

385
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,074
and his face is also...

386
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,326
It's quite sublime.

387
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,472
Many years ago,

388
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,392
when I was going through a hard time,

389
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,687
I came across this passage.

390
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,151
"Even the most powerful minister's
authority

391
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,070
cannot last for decades,

392
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,280
and yet historians' words

393
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,783
silently live for thousands of years."

394
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,952
That one sentence inspired me

395
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,497
to become a historian.

396
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,959
I hoped that my words would become a pilju

397
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,212
that shows people

398
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,964
what is right and wrong
even though I can't

399
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,883
change anything right at this moment.

400
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,928
PILJU: ACT OF REWARDING
OR PUNISHING SOMEONE THROUGH WRITING

401
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,429
In other words, I didn't start out

402
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,767
as someone who just records
what he sees or hears.

403
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,980
-Officer Min.
-Do not worry about me.

404
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,400
We are simply doing our jobs

405
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,444
as historians.

406
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,668
Wait, why does it say this?

407
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,879
This is completely different
from the facts that we know.

408
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,006
Are you sure Officer Kim Il-mok
wrote this?

409
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,843
Or is this just some random document
that you found?

410
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,636
It is Officer Kim Il-mok's handwriting.

411
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,138
I've seen his writing.

412
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,142
Does that mean what's written
in this daily record is true?

413
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,185
The dethroned king wasn't Catholic,

414
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,480
and Seoraewon was
just an educational institution?

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,445
That cannot be true.
It means His Majesty tortured and punished

416
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,158
all those innocent people
just to ascend the throne.

417
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,498
The two of you should tell us
what you know.

418
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,876
You were at Sungkyunkwan 20 years ago,

419
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,961
so I'm sure you saw or heard some things.

420
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,589
Well, things were quite chaotic back then.

421
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,632
I don't know
what those at Seoraewon were up to,

422
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,260
but people covered in blood
were being carried out every day.

423
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,431
And we used to see foreigners
walking freely in the heart of the city.

424
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,559
That's why scholars at Sungkyunkwan
even began a gonggwan.

425
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,977
GONGGWAN: GOING HOME AS A PROTEST

426
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,270
It didn't end there.

427
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,314
Everyone said we should submit a petition,

428
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,441
so I signed one too.

429
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:38,112
So did the rebellion take place

430
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,780
because of Seoraewon?

431
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,575
The dethroned king's secret letter
was the final straw.

432
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,830
It was a letter to a French Catholic
priest who was in Qing at the time.

433
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,500
It was about wanting
to turn Joseon into a Catholic nation

434
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,421
and how he should send priests to Joseon
to propagate Catholic beliefs.

435
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,257
But it got caught
before it could cross the borders.

436
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,928
But this reads...

437
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,723
"His Majesty summoned
a student at Seoraewon.

438
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,767
'Thank you for sending me the book.

439
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,938
Let us go to Kumgangsan together
next time you are in Joseon.'"

440
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,484
That was what the student was told
to write in the letter.

441
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,112
Someone changed

442
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,491
the content of the letter.

443
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,870
To justify the dethronement.

444
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,707
That means...

445
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,877
It wasn't to set things right.
It was treason.

446
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,421
Clerk Song, watch your mouth.

447
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,216
-Do you even realize what that means?
-Regardless of what it was,

448
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,761
-I absolutely cannot let this slide.
-Officer Yang!

449
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,806
This isn't about whether
the dethroned king was falsely accused.

450
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,808
It is not about the royal court.

451
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,143
It boils down to whether or not

452
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,479
someone threatened historians
to manipulate the records.

453
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,233
How dare someone alter historical facts?
Do we have to sit in on every meeting,

454
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,111
write down
every single thing that we hear,

455
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,154
and work even after we go home
to put up with this?

456
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,282
We'll find out if it was manipulated

457
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,826
and what kind of lunatic did it.

458
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,454
We must find out the truth to protect
the honor of the Office of Royal Decrees.

459
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,165
Go and get me

460
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,419
a full list of the historians
that were at Ilgicheong at the time.

461
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,254
Here, sir.

462
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,883
The Chancellor was in charge

463
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,553
of all the historians at the time.

464
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,069
What brings you here?

465
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,075
There is something
we must discuss with you.

466
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,418
Is that true? You found Officer
Kim Il-mok's original daily records?

467
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,753
Yes, my lord.

468
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,504
Where did you...

469
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,631
Never mind.

470
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,343
So? Where is it?

471
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,928
-Let me see it first.
-We are not here to show it to you.

472
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,557
We are here to ask you about
the unjust things that happened

473
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,476
at Ilgicheong back then.

474
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,524
What are you talking about?
What do you mean by "unjust things"?

475
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,777
What happened at Ilgicheong?

476
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,364
We have a statement by a historian
who partook in manipulating the records,

477
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,699
and Officer Kim Il-mok's records

478
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,535
tell us a story that is different
from the facts we know.

479
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,498
My lord, do you truly not know
anything about it?

480
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,586
-You are out of line.
-My lord.

481
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,838
I cannot tolerate
your impudence any longer.

482
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,926
How dare you historians act as if
you are judges with a few pieces of paper?

483
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,763
How much longer must we, ministers,
put up with your insolence?

484
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,891
You went on a strike and even made
His Majesty apologize to you,

485
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,936
so it is now time for you
to cooperate with us for a change!

486
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,022
Please leave.

487
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,859
I do not need to hear
anything else from you.

488
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,782
Shall I order someone
to drag you all out of here?

489
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,159
My lord, were you not

490
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,495
a historian once yourself?

491
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,084
I am aware that you are now one of
the core officials of the royal court,

492
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,753
but you worked at the
Office of Royal Decrees for over a decade.

493
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,006
I've heard that you decided to become

494
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,384
a historian
with the determination that you'd never

495
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,138
fear anyone with power even if it is
the king, inspired by the historians,

496
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,264
Dong Hu and Min In-saeng.

497
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,808
Is that spirit...

498
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,812
completely gone now?

499
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,947
The day before his execution,
Officer Kim Il-mok said

500
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:56,036
that he'd like to record the final truth
through his death.

501
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,497
As historians, we do not want

502
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,917
to feel ashamed before his faith.

503
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,258
Please help us.

504
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,761
I implore you.

505
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,973
-Please help us.
-Please help us.

506
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,703
HO DAM AND YEONGAN

507
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,371
"Ho Dam and Yeongan.

508
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,790
This is where the path was made"?

509
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,961
It is Prince Huiyeong, Yi Gyeom.

510
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,049
I did hear about him in passing
when I was little.

511
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,637
I was told that I should never
speak about him.

512
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,388
Rim.

513
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,877
But this reads...

514
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,547
"His Majesty summoned
a student at Seoraewon.

515
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,091
'Thank you for sending me the book.

516
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,095
Let us go to Kumgangsan together
next time you are in Joseon.'"

517
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,431
That was what the student was told
to write in the letter.

518
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,562
Someone changed the content of the letter.

519
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,673
Jae-gyeong.

520
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,097
Can you really read this?

521
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,016
Of course.

522
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,854
"A king must support people with talent

523
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,316
and respect all forms of art."

524
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,195
What do you think? Impressive, right?

525
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,990
Which country speaks this language?

526
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,744
A faraway country called France.

527
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,371
I'll teach you when you're older.

528
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,497
Okay.

529
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,712
"What will you choose?
Dog poop or cow poop?"

530
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,843
Hae-ryung. I will...

531
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,471
I will always be here for you.

532
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,557
However, what I'm afraid of
is neither the epidemic nor the people.

533
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,477
I'm afraid of being so far away from you.

534
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,978
Gosh, you silly goose.

535
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,092
Next is a petition from
Im Sang-hyeon from the Office of Censors.

536
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,303
"I have gathered

537
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,598
opinions of scholars at academies
and local schools across the country

538
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,184
and found out that most scholars insist
what was done

539
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,727
to the Queen Dowager is immoral.

540
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,854
This is worsening
public sentiment toward--"

541
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,523
Come again? "Immoral"?

542
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,110
What do those scholars in the countryside
even know? How dare they lecture us?

543
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,987
Your Royal Highness,
please do not be concerned.

544
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,532
We are sending an official letter

545
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,034
to each county to inform the people

546
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,787
that it was all caused by the schemes
of the remnants of Seoraewon.

547
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,873
-Things will quiet down soon.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

548
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,793
Public sentiment changes all the time.

549
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,878
The people are fickle-minded.

550
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,090
They are easily swayed
like reeds in the wind.

551
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,302
Today...

552
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,722
Let us finish here.

553
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,724
Your Royal Highness.

554
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,271
We still have a petition
from the Office of Royal Decrees.

555
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,862
Officer Min, that is...

556
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,990
How dare you do this without going through
the Royal Secretariat?

557
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,577
It's a petition written
by Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung.

558
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,245
An apprentice?

559
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,789
How dare a female historian
without any official rank--

560
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,375
The female historians
are government officials as well.

561
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,133
"I, Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung, submit this

562
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,470
to ask you to look into
a suspicious incident from the past."

563
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,307
A witness says the daily record,

564
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,934
submitted to Ilgicheong 20 years ago,

565
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,853
was fabricated,

566
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,272
and we have the daily record
to prove that.

567
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,233
The historian, who tried his best
to protect the truth,

568
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,943
sacrificed his life to do his duty,

569
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,323
so his fellow historians who are alive
wish to right the wrongs

570
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,074
to pass down only true facts.

571
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,035
I implore you

572
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,746
to find out who threatened and persuaded

573
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,707
the historians at Ilgicheong
to distort the historical facts

574
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,084
and which of the historians

575
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,087
betrayed their principles and ingratiated
themselves with those in power.

576
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,299
Please find out the truth.

577
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,442
"Find out the truth"?
What exactly do you mean by that?

578
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,778
We request a comprehensive
and fair investigation

579
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,074
of all the 42 officials that were involved
in the dethronement process.

580
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,828
What do you mean "investigation"?
Leave at once!

581
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,706
How dare you relay a female historian's
words to us, calling it a petition?

582
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,124
This is not just from her.

583
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,962
It is from the entire
Office of Royal Decrees.

584
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,803
This is a request by all the historians.

585
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,515
Your Royal Highness,
this is a groundless accusation.

586
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,184
I was one of the historians
at Ilgicheong back then.

587
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,438
What? The records were manipulated?
That is simply impossible!

588
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,652
Your Royal Highness.

589
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,866
I was in charge of managing
all the historians 20 years ago,

590
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,328
but I know nothing about the records
being manipulated.

591
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,329
However...

592
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,258
However, the historians do have a point.

593
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,135
It is their duty

594
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,221
to record history as truthfully
as possible for our future generations,

595
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,265
so if there are such suspicions,

596
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,145
we should look into it and find out
whether they are true or not.

597
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,563
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.

598
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,275
The Chancellor is absolutely right.

599
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,611
Anyone who tries to distort
historical records

600
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,279
deserves capital punishment.

601
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,782
Please form a special investigation
committee and find out the truth.

602
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,165
I will...

603
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,797
-not allow that.
-Your Royal Highness.

604
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,389
I will not accept

605
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,808
any more petitions regarding this.

606
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,666
Gosh, why are they taking so long?

607
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,379
I cannot wait any longer.
I shall go and try to eavesdrop on them.

608
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,630
-Okay, hurry.
-Go.

609
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,081
Officer Yang, how did it go?

610
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,376
His Royal Highness said
we should never even bring it up again.

611
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,432
I heard it's regarding an urgent matter.

612
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,934
Did something happen to the Queen Dowager?

613
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,312
Those at the Office of Royal Decrees
found Kim Il-mok's daily records.

614
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,566
A female historian named Goo Hae-ryung

615
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,318
submitted a petition,
requesting an investigation

616
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,737
of what happened at Ilgicheong.

617
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,367
So what happened?
Did they accept the request?

618
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,829
No, His Royal Highness did not approve it.

619
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,498
He knows that digging into that incident

620
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,876
from 20 years ago
will only threaten his position.

621
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,628
If His Royal Highness has decided
not to support the historians,

622
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,382
we don't know what Min Ik-pyeong
will do now.

623
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,468
Actually, I think we can wait a little

624
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,555
and see what happens next.

625
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,849
They are historians.

626
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,143
As long as they have
all the daily records,

627
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,064
even the Second State Councillor
won't have any excuses to harm them.

628
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,691
That won't matter to Min Ik-pyeong.

629
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,570
If needed, he will even use the military
to threaten the Office of Royal Decrees.

630
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,491
If he goes that route,

631
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,203
it will give us the most perfect reason
to raise an army.

632
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,164
Don't worry.

633
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,875
If he harms the historians in any way,

634
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,045
I will mobilize my soldiers
at the Military Training Corps immediately

635
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,215
and punish Min Ik-pyeong for treason.

636
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,235
I really don't want to work anymore.

637
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,279
I mean, why work so hard?

638
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,157
They'll change it however they wish
later on anyway.

639
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,701
That's what I'm saying.

640
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,037
I'm wondering why historians
are even needed

641
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,997
and why
the Office of Royal Decrees exists.

642
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,792
It is too early to be let down.

643
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,086
If Apprentice Goo's petition
gets rejected,

644
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,338
we'll submit another one in my name.

645
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,591
If that also gets rejected, we'll file
another one in Apprentice Oh's name.

646
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,511
We will keep going
until it gets approved. We can do this!

647
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,847
-That's right!
-Hey.

648
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,474
Didn't you see His Royal Highness earlier?

649
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,394
If we bring it up again,
a bloodbath may sweep across the palace.

650
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,647
It is very odd though.

651
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,442
His Royal Highness
would never ignore our opinion like this.

652
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,574
Enough, all of you.
Let's get our work done first.

653
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,035
Only then can we have time
to come up with a solution together.

654
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,806
Hae-ryung.

655
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,281
I'll keep it short.
You still have some time.

656
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,575
Leave the city for the time being.

657
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,368
Jae-gyeong.

658
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,539
This is about all the historians now.

659
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,751
It is not something
that mere historians can handle.

660
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,463
Investigating what happened at Ilgicheong?
Do you realize what that means?

661
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,506
It means the historians wish to judge

662
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,550
whether the dethronement
was a just decision.

663
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,720
Since your name has been brought up,

664
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,847
the Second State Councillor
won't let it slide.

665
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,768
Even the Office of Royal Decrees
is no longer safe.

666
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,102
So please...

667
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,980
Stop here and leave.

668
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,401
Hae-ryung!

669
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,403
Is it because of guilt?

670
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,949
Is that why

671
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,619
you are so protective of me?

672
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,546
I always thought
something didn't quite add up.

673
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,556
I wondered how the two of us could survive

674
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,311
when everyone else at Seoraewon
died on the same day

675
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,275
and how you managed to land

676
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,862
a position in the government
when you used to work at Seoraewon.

677
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,617
Was all of that possible...

678
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,874
because you swapped the dethroned king's
letter with a fake one?

679
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,849
But I still...

680
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,854
don't resent you.

681
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,985
I'm sure

682
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,655
you had a reason.

683
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,744
And you've already

684
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,872
punished yourself...

685
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,462
by protecting me
and looking after me for all those years

686
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,175
while suffering all by yourself.

687
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,306
So,

688
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,392
you no longer need to carry

689
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,481
all the burden by yourself,

690
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,193
Jae-gyeong.

691
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,655
I thought we had finally managed
to silence the Queen Dowager.

692
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,950
Where did Kim Il-mok's daily records
even come from out of the blue?

693
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,579
Not a day goes by without trouble
here in the royal court.

694
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:00,583
Chancellor,
why did you take the historians' side?

695
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,506
What if they find out
that it was, in fact, altered?

696
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,426
You and I will be the first ones
to lose our lives

697
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,428
as we were historians back then.

698
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,597
Look, do you think I sided with them
because I actually wanted to?

699
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,434
The special investigation committee
will not be formed anyway.

700
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,937
At least one of us
had to act like we support them,

701
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,690
or they'll raid our office again
with an ax.

702
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,902
We were lucky because
His Royal Highness didn't approve it,

703
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,405
but who knows
what those historians will do next?

704
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,408
We should get the military involved

705
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,868
to silence the historians.

706
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,581
The petition was submitted
by Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung.

707
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,625
Third Inspector Goo's sister.

708
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,336
Where is he now?

709
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,339
He is in Chungcheong Province on duty.

710
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,259
Actually, he should've been back
a few days ago.

711
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,595
We have no way of reaching him though.

712
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,805
Lord Min, are you thinking...

713
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,737
My gosh!

714
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,781
What's going on? Who are you guys?

715
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
Excuse me. Lord Goo is...

716
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,912
What is happening?

717
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,310
Let's go.

718
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,691
What is this about?

719
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,705
Your Highness, His Royal Highness
has asked us not to let anyone in.

720
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,831
You may let him in.

721
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,795
Your Highness.

722
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,064
I have to go over this petition.

723
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,983
Is it something urgent?

724
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,783
I heard you rejected
the historians' petition.

725
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,371
So?

726
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,832
Form a special investigation committee

727
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,002
to find out who did it
and what they wanted to hide--

728
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,420
Why are you curious about that?

729
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,174
Perhaps what you truly want is

730
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,596
proving that the dethronement was wrong,
not finding out what was buried.

731
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,228
Did you

732
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,439
know about it too?

733
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,776
The fact that
I am the dethroned king's son.

734
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,614
No. You are His Majesty's son,
and a prince of this kingdom.

735
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,326
Hence, you should never forget your duty.

736
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,037
What exactly is that duty of mine
that you are speaking of?

737
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,165
Just being the powerless,
weak, pathetic prince

738
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,417
who is confined to his residence?

739
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,339
Yes. That is your duty.

740
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,674
You cannot and should not do anything.

741
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,344
That is you, Prince Dowon.

742
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,857
I don't know since when you were so
interested in the royal court's affairs,

743
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,402
but such political matters
should not concern you. Now, leave.

744
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,989
I have made up my mind
not to live like that any longer.

745
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,200
I will right the wrongs

746
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,161
and punish those who did bad deeds.

747
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,996
-Rim.
-Even you...

748
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,335
won't be able to stop me.

749
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,346
Send palace guards to Nokseodang at once!

750
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,308
Prince Dowon

751
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,062
must not even step out of his residence.

752
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,927
Apprentice Goo, have you heard the news?

753
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,722
His Highness can't leave Nokseodang.

754
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,100
Let me through.

755
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,358
I am a historian. Please let me in.

756
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,528
His Royal Highness has ordered us
to strictly guard Nokseodang.

757
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,411
Even historians aren't allowed to enter?

758
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,288
How is this considered "guarding"?

759
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,499
Your Highness.

760
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,119
Please do not forget

761
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,498
that you two can be here now
because of my decision 20 years ago.

762
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,417
The dethroned king's son is alive.

763
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,712
And that's why the people of Seoraewon
are continuing to have false hope.

764
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,841
Prince Dowon will vanish soon.

765
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,345
I am no longer Prince Dowon.

766
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,223
I am the son of Yi Gyeom, Prince Huiyeong.

767
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,101
-I am Yi Rim.
-Even if you slash my throat,

768
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,022
we historians will continue writing.
