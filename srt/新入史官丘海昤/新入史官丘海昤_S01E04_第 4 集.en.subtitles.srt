1
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,683
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,883
Are you lost?

3
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,934
Maehwa?

4
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,436
Sparrow?

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,147
You... What are you doing here?

6
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,152
A female historian?

7
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,199
Are you a historian now?

8
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,660
Then what about you?

9
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,996
What do you do? Why are you--

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,582
You are in no position to ask me
such a question.

11
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,544
A mere government official
wandering around the inner palace?

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,216
Nokseodang of all places,
where no one is allowed to enter

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,093
as per His Majesty's order?

14
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,179
You got some nerve.

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,974
What are you talking about?
I wasn't "wandering".

16
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,894
I was just passing by.

17
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,229
Is that a crime too?

18
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,608
That is up to the Royal Investigation
Bureau to decide.

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,235
Over here!

20
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,530
Over here!

21
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,995
What do you want from me?

22
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,297
What can I do to make you just let me go?

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,264
Stop staring at me like that
and say something...

24
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,853
I mean, say something.

25
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,315
How dare you touch me?

26
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,031
I...

27
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,410
I don't plan to let you go.

28
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,748
-What?
-You wronged me on a number of occasions.

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,502
You impersonated me
at the book reading event,

30
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
and I got arrested because of you.

31
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,382
Also, you stood me up last night

32
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,842
and made me wait for hours.

33
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,595
About that day, I really didn't know...

34
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,433
I stood you up last night?

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,271
Are you going to list excuses again,
saying something came up?

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,275
No, it's not an excuse. I really have
no idea what you're talking about.

37
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,153
What do you mean,
we were supposed to meet last night?

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,322
I never even saw you after that day.

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,282
I sent you a letter.

40
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,202
"At Gwangtong Bridge
at 5 p.m. on the first day of the month."

41
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,745
I never received such a letter.

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,169
You never received my letter?

43
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,672
Don't tell me...

44
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,343
Don't tell me that you're all mad at me
because you waited

45
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,262
and thought you got stood up by me.
Is that it?

46
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,265
Well, I...

47
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,936
I sent the letter, so I assumed...

48
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,355
Sir.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
Don't you know what an appointment is?

50
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,028
When I suggest a date and time,
the other party has to agree.

51
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,655
An appointment can't be made

52
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,323
without mutual agreement.

53
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,284
What kind of life have you led so far?

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,411
You don't even have such basic knowledge.

55
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,247
Who's there?

56
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,919
How dare you enter this place?

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,130
-You'd better identify yourself--
-Her name is Goo Hae-ryung.

58
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,009
From the Office of Royal Decrees.

59
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,512
Female Historian Goo Hae-ryung.

60
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,764
Goo Hae-ryung?

61
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,058
The fake Maehwa.

62
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,773
Your Highness!

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,697
-His Royal Highness is looking for--
-Prince Dowon is taking a nap

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,823
over there.

65
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,492
Pardon me?
Eunuch Heo, are you going senile?

66
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,828
-He's right here--
-He was out here for a stroll,

67
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,915
but he went back inside just now
for a nap.

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,836
-But--
-Anyhow,

69
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,963
you, beautiful young lady,
should be on your way.

70
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,882
Please allow me to escort you. Step aside.

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,094
You three, wait here.

72
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,180
Why--

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,225
You! Especially you! Keep your mouth shut.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,442
Sam-bo just talked down to me, didn't he?

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,741
Over there. You see that, right?
You can go that way.

76
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,783
Thank you.

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,827
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

78
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,625
Wait, hang on. So who is Maehwa?

79
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,213
-It's that way.
-Thank you.

80
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,728
There he is. Heo Sam-bo.

81
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,067
You throw your loyalty out the window
in front of a woman.

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,443
You weak-willed wimp.

83
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,698
Your Highness, I just saved you
from a dangerous situation.

84
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,742
-Can't you tell?
-You saved me?

85
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,578
Yes! Have you forgotten
what that woman did to you?

86
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,373
As soon as she met you
at the book reading event,

87
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,042
she told everyone that you are Maehwa.

88
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,337
She's the most indiscreet person
in the whole wide world.

89
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,549
If that woman finds out
that you are a prince,

90
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,718
overnight,

91
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,389
everyone in Joseon will find out
that Maehwa is, in fact, Prince Dowon.

92
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,643
No, the word will travel all the way
across the ocean and even reach Qing.

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,647
But Father already knows that I'm Maehwa--

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,650
There is a huge difference
between just His Majesty knowing about it

95
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,320
and the whole world finding out.

96
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,407
Dignity and reputation
matter a great deal to His Majesty.

97
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,661
If he finds out one more time
that people are talking about you...

98
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,248
I cannot bring myself to say it,

99
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,667
but that is probably
what will happen to you.

100
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,176
Then,

101
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,138
are you saying I should just stand here
and do nothing

102
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,265
even though I know my enemy is here?

103
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,934
She hasn't even apologized to me yet.

104
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,186
You, as Prince Dowon,

105
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
cannot do anything.

106
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,275
However, Maehwa...

107
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,989
Maehwa can do many things.

108
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,927
-Gosh.
-Oh, dear.

109
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,555
I feel like death.

110
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,890
Drink this, sir.

111
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,352
Don't tell me to drink anything.
Get that out of my face!

112
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,026
Where's the girl who got me this hungover?

113
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,403
Is she not here yet?

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,448
Even you're this hungover
despite years of heavy drinking.

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,824
She must be dying now.

116
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,161
I bet she's lying on the floor
like a dead person.

117
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,288
You never know.

118
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,833
Didn't you see
her spiteful eyes last night?

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,586
If she can't walk,
she'll crawl with her arms like this

120
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,338
and come to work.

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,466
Well... No matter how tough she is,

122
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,593
she won't be able to enter the palace.

123
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,512
What do you mean?

124
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,805
I asked the chief gatekeeper earlier

125
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,975
not to let Apprentice Goo Hae-ryung
of the Office of Royal Decrees

126
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,685
into the palace today.

127
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,439
I bet she's bawling outside the gate now
while begging him to--

128
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,107
Hello!

129
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,861
Clerk Goo, how did you get in?

130
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,531
Well, I walked in through the gate.

131
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,491
Is there a problem, sir?

132
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,160
What? "Is there a problem?"

133
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,664
You're a newbie. How dare you
walk in leisurely way past 7 a.m.

134
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,040
and ask such a question?

135
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,917
-I apologize, sir.
-Whatever!

136
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,213
-Just go and clean the library.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,675
How did she get in?

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,387
I told him not to let her in even if
he has to hold a knife to her throat.

139
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,514
Hey, you're a man.

140
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,058
How could you cook up
such an underhanded ruse against a girl?

141
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,687
That is why we still call you a dimwit.
You dimwit!

142
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,021
What? "Dimwit"?

143
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,232
-What?
-Don't call me like that!

144
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,364
-My gosh, Apprentice Goo!
-I'm sorry. I'm a little late.

145
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,950
I thought you weren't coming today.

146
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,285
Are you feeling all right?

147
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,829
I have a little bit of a headache,

148
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,372
but it won't kill me.

149
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,083
We'll take those books.

150
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,169
You sacrificed yourself to help us out.

151
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,588
This is the least we can do.

152
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,383
She's right. You saved us.

153
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
You should take it easy today.

154
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,637
I'm flattered.

155
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,765
Then I'll sit over there
and take a quick nap.

156
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,392
-Sure.
-Go on.

157
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,476
Apprentice Goo.

158
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,330
About you helping me last night...

159
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,292
You don't need to thank me.

160
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,253
We work together,
so we should help each other out.

161
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,756
It was unpleasant.

162
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,551
-Pardon me?
-I don't need your help.

163
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,928
I can take care of myself.

164
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,139
I neither want to receive

165
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,266
nor give unwanted help.

166
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,146
Please put yourself in the other person's
shoes before you act.

167
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,107
That is my advice for you.

168
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,236
Okay, I understand
what you're trying to say.

169
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,926
Are you the female historians?

170
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,845
Yes. And...

171
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,766
-Who are you?
-This is Court Lady Choe.

172
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,101
Show your respect.

173
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,732
Follow me.

174
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,360
You need to tell us
where you're taking us--

175
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,403
I said, follow me!

176
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,747
It's bamboo dew tea,
which I only serve to special guests.

177
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,208
Drink slowly and savor the tea.

178
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,354
So? How do you like
working in the palace so far?

179
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,698
We are just...

180
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,746
honored and grateful that we can

181
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,081
assist His Majesty and...

182
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,087
I apologize.

183
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,591
I put you on the spot
by asking such a question.

184
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,053
I have lived in the palace
for almost 50 years.

185
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,140
I certainly understand
how you must be feeling now.

186
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,225
I'm sure nothing is easy,

187
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,187
and you're probably intimidated
by everyone.

188
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,315
I heard

189
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,777
that the officers
at the Office of Royal Decrees

190
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,404
tend to pick on novices.

191
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

192
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,033
Yes.

193
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,329
I mean, no!

194
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,831
It's okay. You can be honest with me.

195
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,794
Joseon is an extremely cruel place

196
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,962
to those who go off the beaten path.

197
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,382
I am certain that it's much worse
for you ladies,

198
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,135
who have managed to land
government posts as women.

199
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,393
However, you ladies are historians
of this country,

200
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,938
no matter what anybody says.

201
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,192
You are not here to assist the King.

202
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,655
Please think that you are here
to look after the people and do your best.

203
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,866
If I can be of help in any way,

204
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,577
I will gladly lend a helping hand.

205
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,080
We are much obliged, Your Majesty.

206
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,459
-We're much obliged.
-We're much obliged.

207
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,175
I suppose this is why they say
kindness is the greatest virtue of all.

208
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,761
The Queen Dowager
looks so kind and friendly.

209
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,596
And she speaks very elegantly too.

210
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,016
My gosh, she is absolutely beautiful.

211
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,436
On the contrary, the officers
at the Office of Royal Decrees

212
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,065
look so ugly because they're awfully mean.

213
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,234
Ladies!

214
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,513
What is the matter, ma'am?

215
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,977
Why are you doing this?

216
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,355
-Let go! Let go of me!
-What is this about?

217
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,408
I will teach you all a lesson!

218
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,744
You shall learn the code of conduct
for Inner Court ladies.

219
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,542
-Not the Office of Special Advisors?
-That's right. I got scolded for asking.

220
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,920
They said girls are of no use to them.

221
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,172
I told you.

222
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,799
I bet they're slacking off somewhere.

223
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,551
The hazing ritual is done,

224
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,345
so they're not afraid of anything now.

225
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,846
Jeez, these wenches...

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,223
-Sir!
-Sir, we have a problem!

227
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,433
We have a big problem.

228
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,902
Mark my words.

229
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,237
If you run your mouth thoughtlessly,
I shall sear it.

230
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,406
If you steal anything,
I shall cut your hands off.

231
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
And if you lose your chastity,

232
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,160
you will be beheaded.

233
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,081
You mustn't remember anything
that you see and hear.

234
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,916
Here, you are blind, deaf, and mindless.

235
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,501
Don't ever forget that.

236
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
Just lie low and be a lady.

237
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,380
All you have to do is obey orders.

238
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,215
Do you understand?

239
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,554
Why are none of you answering?

240
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,598
I asked if you understand!

241
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,142
Why must we be like that?

242
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,106
We're historians.

243
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,151
Why must we follow
Inner Court's code of conduct?

244
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,200
You are one insolent wench.

245
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,996
Passing the examination doesn't mean
you'll be treated like a man.

246
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,580
Do you think

247
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,874
wearing that uniform
makes you a government official?

248
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,461
All girls are considered
His Majesty's women

249
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,838
the moment they enter the palace.

250
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,466
They must follow the code of conduct
until the moment they die.

251
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,510
If you still do not know your place,

252
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,638
I shall make sure
it's engraved in your mind forever.

253
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,195
What are you doing?

254
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,706
They belong
to the Office of Royal Decrees.

255
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,043
They have no reason
to be here with you now.

256
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,503
This concerns the Inner Court.
Stay out of it!

257
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,630
You are threatening government officials!

258
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,139
Since when was that the Inner Court's job?

259
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,348
What did you just say?

260
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,350
-Take them.
-Officer Min!

261
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,144
-Hurry!
-Take them!

262
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,917
Is that Inner Court's hazing ritual,

263
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,752
which I've only heard about?

264
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,379
This is why I told you to watch out
for court ladies.

265
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,757
Once you get on the wrong side of them,
you're screwed.

266
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,718
So avoid eye contact with them.
Don't even talk to them, okay?

267
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,518
Sir, is it okay to leave
Officer Min alone there?

268
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,736
Hey.

269
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,823
Why are you worried
about the Second State Councillor's son

270
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,742
when you can't even take care of yourself?

271
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,870
Why did you follow her in the first place?

272
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,872
Even my dog doesn't follow strangers.

273
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,582
We had no idea, sir.

274
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,501
We were told
the Queen Dowager asked for us--

275
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,253
It's your fault that you had no idea!

276
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,506
Even the Queen Dowager
must follow the proper protocols

277
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,425
when she wishes to summon us,
government officials.

278
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,887
Especially us, historians,
ought to finish what we were working on,

279
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,974
check what else needs to be done,

280
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,559
and report everything to the office

281
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,769
before going anywhere
even if the Grim Reaper

282
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,982
wants to take us.
Before that, we can't even die, you fools.

283
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,694
How could we have known that?

284
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,405
We had no idea
because you taught us nothing.

285
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,199
-You didn't tell us anything!
-Apprentice Heo.

286
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,367
It's true.

287
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,246
Sir, what have you taught us?

288
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,375
And other officers,
what have you taught us?

289
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,377
We couldn't even learn from you

290
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,796
because you taught us nothing!

291
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,799
How could you expect us
to just figure everything out

292
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,010
on our own
and know how to tackle such situations?

293
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,180
You are all partially responsible

294
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,390
for what we went through today.

295
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,517
If you hadn't belittled us

296
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,353
by calling us "clerks"
at the Office of Royal Decrees,

297
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,689
the court ladies wouldn't have dared

298
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,941
to take us and treat us like maids.

299
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,485
Hey, they just tried
to intimidate you a little.

300
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,570
Don't exaggerate.

301
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,405
They said we're His Majesty's women.

302
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,991
And they told us that we must follow

303
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,702
their code of conduct and lie low
for that reason.

304
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,538
We must forget everything we see and hear.

305
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,832
They said we ought to obey
all orders until we die!

306
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,168
They clearly treated us like maids!

307
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,838
Could you still tell us that we deserve

308
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,840
to talk about rules and protocols?

309
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,011
Apprentice Heo.

310
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,138
How dare she raise her voice at us?

311
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,641
Hey, get back here this instant!

312
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,560
Sir, please do not be concerned.
She just took it out--

313
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,647
But she's not wrong, sir.

314
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,424
Had I known I'd be treated like this,

315
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,678
I would've never taken the exam.

316
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,180
What did we do so wrong?

317
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,392
Why is everyone so mean to us?

318
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,395
What did we do wrong?

319
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,023
I'm glad you said those things.

320
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,567
I'm truly proud of you.

321
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,087
Even if they're completely clueless,
they should at least know their place.

322
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,464
How dare mere apprentices
speak out like that?

323
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,675
Unbelievable!

324
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,440
What now?

325
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,985
I'll teach them starting from tomorrow.

326
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,194
Officer Min!

327
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,113
-Officer Min!
-Officer Min!

328
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,531
Sure, give it a shot.

329
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,369
We need to teach them something
to give them work to do.

330
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,288
I will leave it to you, Officer Min.

331
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,622
Yes, sir.

332
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,587
Sir. When I first started my job here,

333
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,797
you didn't even let me
hold a brush for three months.

334
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,632
Why are you giving them special treatment?

335
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,885
That's right. You told me
I must overcome 1,000 hurdles

336
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
to be a true historian.

337
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,638
You said I should be prepared
for 1,000 days of harsh scolding.

338
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,517
-I still have 500 more days to go--
-Jeez, you guys talk too much.

339
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,978
Don't you have work to do?

340
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,981
Do you lads have too much time
on your hands?

341
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,685
THE STORY OF HO DAM

342
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,793
THE STORY OF HO DAM

343
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,479
Second State Councilor.

344
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,782
So this is where you live.

345
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,955
It has been days since I offered
the position of Third Inspector to you.

346
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,292
What is the reason
you haven't accepted it yet?

347
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,836
It is a position responsible
for inspecting all the officials.

348
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,839
I just didn't think
I'm the right person for the role.

349
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,968
"I'm not comfortable
with digging up dirt on others

350
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,846
and using that information
to threaten their livelihood."

351
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,098
That's how it sounds to me.

352
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,851
Do you know why I am fond of you?

353
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,064
It is because I've seen you
at your lowest point.

354
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,527
I saw what you are capable of

355
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,779
with my own eyes.

356
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,370
Hence, do not tell me that you're not
the right person for the job.

357
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,665
I know that you are the perfect person
for the role.

358
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,923
Why are you rushing
to have me work in the palace?

359
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,636
I found the shop
where The Story of Ho Dam was printed.

360
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,515
The last worker there took his own life
before we could capture him.

361
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,808
The Queen Dowager
must have sternly threatened them.

362
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,438
Isn't it a bit too meticulous
to be done by a group of ladies

363
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,232
who are working in the palace?

364
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,736
-Then--
-It means the Queen Dowager

365
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,863
has someone outside the palace
that is helping her.

366
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,534
Thus, I need someone to work for me

367
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,744
behind the Queen Dowager's back.
Someone like you.

368
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,958
Accept the position and find that person.

369
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,796
I am not asking you for a favor.
This is an order.

370
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,975
Go home, eat something good,
and get some rest.

371
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,810
Cheer up, Apprentice Heo.

372
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,902
Aren't they from Nokseodang?

373
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:21,371
NOKSEODANG

374
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,252
Sorry?

375
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,672
Do I have to go in? By myself?

376
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,402
Your Highness.

377
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,781
I heard you asked for me.

378
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,081
Your Highness?

379
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,346
Your Highness.

380
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,099
This is Goo Hae-ryung, an apprentice
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

381
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,568
Why did you ask for me?

382
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,945
"You know what you are guilty of."

383
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,619
His Highness says so in his heart.

384
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,253
Your Highness.

385
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,382
I entered Nokseodang in the morning
because--

386
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
"You disobeyed the royal command."

387
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,182
His Highness says so,
once again, in his heart.

388
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,068
Your Highness.

389
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,363
-Please forgive--
-If you wish to be forgiven...

390
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,990
What now?

391
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,538
He said you must do as I say
if you wish to be forgiven.

392
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,708
His Highness, Prince Dowon,

393
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,002
said so in his heart.

394
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,490
Don't forget the inside. Clean thoroughly.

395
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,409
Yes, sir. I am doing my best.

396
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,835
Hey, this spot too.

397
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,053
Clean the edge, not here.

398
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,637
Hurry.

399
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,188
Oh, no. They're very valuable.

400
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,321
You should've been careful.

401
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,619
Hey, over there.

402
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,663
That spot over there.

403
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,487
Gosh, my bad.

404
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,990
My hands feel weak
from doing all the work.

405
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,160
I don't buy that.
It fell right on my face.

406
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,247
I finished sweeping this whole area.
What should I do next?

407
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,170
You are dismissed for the day.

408
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,463
"For the day"?

409
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,174
What? Did you think
you'd be forgiven in just a day

410
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,552
when you disobeyed a royal command?

411
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,263
You must come back tomorrow,
the day after tomorrow,

412
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,472
and even the next day.

413
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,434
You must keep coming back every single day

414
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,144
until Prince Dowon forgives you.

415
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,774
Sir, let's be honest with each other.

416
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,944
The royal command
and His Highness are just excuses.

417
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,281
You're taking advantage of this situation
to get back at me.

418
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,866
If you don't believe me,

419
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,452
I'll go back in there
and bring Prince Dowon.

420
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,876
How could a woman be...

421
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,503
-Is this another mistake?
-No, that was intentional.

422
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,422
I'm trying to tell you
that enough is enough.

423
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,258
What did you just say?

424
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,762
Please tell His Highness
that I sincerely apologized and repented.

425
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,640
See you tomorrow, then.

426
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,526
One more thing!

427
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,697
I sincerely apologize
for criticizing your novels.

428
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,826
I had no idea about your deep anguish.

429
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,122
-My deep anguish?
-Yes.

430
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,084
Back then, I wondered
why a decent-looking man like you

431
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,253
would waste paper
by writing foolish romance novels.

432
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,589
But now, I know

433
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,676
that you wanted to experience love
secondhand through your novels.

434
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,636
I can understand it now.

435
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,681
You may look like a decent man,
but you are missing

436
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,641
an essential part that a man should have.

437
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,851
How dare you!

438
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,354
Anyway, cheer up. I'm rooting for you.

439
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,607
Hey, Goo Hae-ryung. I...

440
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,069
Goo Hae-ryung! You got the wrong idea.

441
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,780
Hey! Anyway, you got it all wrong! Hey!

442
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,555
What are you doing?

443
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,890
Have you finally gone crazy?

444
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,475
No, I'm just happy.

445
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,728
I met someone interesting in the palace.

446
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,358
A man or a woman?

447
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,486
-What?
-A man or a woman?

448
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,032
Well, he is a man, I guess.

449
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,079
So... Is he handsome?

450
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,248
What... What's his style?

451
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,835
Is he white and fair, like a pretty boy?

452
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,546
Or is he well-built,
like one of our male servants?

453
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,131
What?

454
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,216
Okay, whatever.

455
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,927
Let's say that his looks are
above average at the least.

456
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,263
How tall is he? Which family is he from?

457
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,723
What are his rank and birth hour?

458
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,268
Let's find out
your relationship compatibility!

459
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,604
What in the world are you talking about?

460
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,314
Why would I be with him?

461
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,858
And this guy...

462
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,403
He's a man who's incapable
of loving a woman.

463
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,616
Goodness.

464
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,621
He was just being coy.
That's what men are like nowadays.

465
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,582
Do you really believe that?

466
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,627
I don't have to believe anything.
It's true.

467
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,465
So you know, his body itself is

468
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,177
anatomically impossible
to be with a woman, you know...

469
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,763
I'm telling you. He's just pretending...

470
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,729
My lady, by any chance...

471
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,943
So, not at all?

472
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,155
Not even this much? Really?

473
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,749
Where are you going? I'm not done talking.

474
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,211
How can we call it a sea
if the sea is without any water?

475
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,421
I do not care about a man

476
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,258
who can barely be called a man.

477
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,178
Hey, I wasn't talking about him
as a man either.

478
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,099
You know, we might bicker,
and he might be a bit annoying,

479
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,017
but I think I can be friends with--

480
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,604
Yes, exactly. I don't care
if you become friends with him

481
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,314
or get undressed to bathe with him.

482
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,775
I am not interested.

483
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,989
Goodness.

484
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,743
What's with her?

485
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,947
THE STORY OF HO DAM

486
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,985
Mo-hwa!

487
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,576
You didn't even tell me you were coming!

488
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,250
How have you been?

489
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,336
Every single day is the same for me.

490
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,047
What about you? Are you hurt?

491
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,926
Oh, right.

492
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,971
You must be tired.
I shouldn't ask so much.

493
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,100
You should get some sleep first

494
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,310
to recover from your journey. Go inside.

495
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,104
Yes, excuse me.

496
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,467
HO DAM AND YEONGAN
THIS IS WHERE THE PATH WAS MADE

497
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,264
HO DAM

498
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,155
What's this?

499
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,116
This is a special order from Officer Yang.

500
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,119
The organizational chart of our office.

501
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,496
So why are you giving this to us?

502
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,873
What do you think?

503
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,083
You four don't know your place
and got too impudent,

504
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,127
so he wants you to learn
the hierarchy first.

505
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,297
Okay, look.

506
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,133
The eight designated historians
of the Office of Royal Decrees are

507
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,676
called Hanrim. You know that, right?

508
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,677
Yes.

509
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,015
First Historian Yang Si-haeng holds
the highest office among them.

510
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,059
Why? What about the crazy idiot?

511
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,603
After him, it's First Historian Min U-won.

512
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,981
Do you even know
what a hazing ritual consists of?

513
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,317
Among the Second Historians,
Officer Son Gil-seung

514
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,110
has seniority over Hyeon Gyeong-muk.

515
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,404
SECOND HISTORIAN SON GIL-SEUNG,
35 YEARS OLD

516
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,865
Hey, they just tried
to intimidate you a little.

517
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,244
Is there a hierarchy
even among the same office ranks?

518
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,872
Of course. We all began to work
at different times.

519
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,460
For example, the four of us
may all be senior ninth-rank officers.

520
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,838
I can swear at these three.

521
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,217
But they can't do that to me.

522
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,095
And Officer Seong Seo-gwon

523
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,014
can swear at Officer An Hong-ik
and Officer Kim Chi-guk.

524
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,851
Officer An Hong-ik
can swear at Officer Kim Chi-guk.

525
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,853
Officer Kim Chi-guk...

526
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,650
has no one. He just has to take it.

527
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,864
Officer Hwang,
but I'm a senior officer to them.

528
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,325
Hey, even if that's true, Clerk Goo is 26

529
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,536
and you're 19. How can you swear at her?

530
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,331
Don't you know that elders come first?
Elders first.

531
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,460
Hey!

532
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,088
You're all dead.

533
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,049
How can the senior ninth-rank officers
and clerks all sit around in here?

534
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,511
Should I be running around
doing errands as a second historian?

535
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,054
Do you need us to do something?

536
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,931
You're fine.

537
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,975
You four.

538
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,978
What are you doing? Follow me.

539
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,871
What in the world...

540
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,625
How dare a bunch of women come in here?

541
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,168
Get out of here right now!

542
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,589
This is...

543
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,674
the historian's seat.

544
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,136
Officer Min, are you letting us attend
the royal meeting?

545
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,723
Go to your positions.

546
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,069
Officer Min.

547
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,404
What do you think you're doing?

548
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,448
Women should not be allowed in here.

549
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,742
How dare you taint the royal court?

550
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,204
You are being unbelievably rude.

551
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,414
How dare you ignore me
when I'm talking to you?

552
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,999
That's enough.

553
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,929
-My goodness.
-This is outrageous.

554
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,433
My goodness.

555
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,356
-Gosh.
-Unbelievable.

556
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,692
-What is going on?
-This is absurd.

557
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,736
His Royal Highness is here.

558
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,100
Why is it just you guys?

559
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,062
-Where's the person I asked for?
-She's attending the royal meeting.

560
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,397
"The royal meeting"?

561
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,401
The female historians are
attending the royal meeting?

562
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,153
-Yes.
-Yes.

563
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:38,282
My goodness, Officer Min U-won must've
caused trouble again.

564
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,661
"Min U-won"? Wasn't he my brother's
childhood study partner?

565
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,331
That's not what's important.

566
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,044
He's the Second State Councilor's son.
He's handsome and has a great character.

567
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,629
And he's very intelligent.

568
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,547
He entered Sungkyunkwan
when he was 15 years old

569
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,132
and entered the palace when he was 18.

570
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,259
People work so hard to succeed,

571
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,136
but he got it all so easy.

572
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,512
So people envy him, slander him,

573
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,890
and spread dubious rumors about him.

574
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,725
But he has

575
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,102
one fatal drawback.

576
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,897
He is

577
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,982
like a rock.

578
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,903
He lacks flexibility
and is very cold-hearted.

579
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,782
And he has a talent
of making people go crazy.

580
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,994
Then since Goo Hae-ryung will be
working for a guy like him--

581
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,872
She'll have to say goodbye
to the good old days.

582
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,875
It'll be a whole new world of suffering.

583
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,461
She'll live a life full of hardships.

584
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,632
Really?

585
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,427
You can stop the fanning now.

586
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:46,350
I'm starting to feel very refreshed
even without it.

587
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,200
Your Royal Highness,
you have an urgent letter.

588
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,201
Come inside.

589
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,256
It is from an official in Hadong,
Gyeongsang Province.

590
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,300
The endless rain has caused
the river to overflow

591
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,885
and flooded dozens of villages.

592
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,012
And there are apparently

593
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,640
hundreds of villagers
who ended up drowning

594
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,559
or getting buried in the landslide.

595
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,772
What was the official doing
during the endless rain?

596
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,274
Why didn't he evacuate the villagers?

597
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,236
Most of the people who died
were actually hiding in Jirisan

598
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,822
so they could avoid paying military taxes.

599
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,868
Tell him to console the villagers
by distributing food

600
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,578
from the Relief Office.

601
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,663
It'll take days to restore the damage.

602
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,291
They won't need to pay taxes
for the time being.

603
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,959
-And--
-You cannot do that.

604
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,044
They may have suffered from the flood,

605
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,756
but they're criminals
who avoided military duties.

606
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,841
You should be punishing them.

607
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,219
How can you think of sparing them
from paying taxes?

608
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,014
Then are you saying I should collect taxes
from those people

609
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,640
who lost their families

610
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,642
and have nowhere to go?

611
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,188
You cannot get swayed
by your personal emotions.

612
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,941
Think about why they ended up
in that situation in the first place.

613
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,860
They brought that upon themselves

614
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,029
by living in the mountains

615
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,864
just so they could avoid paying taxes.

616
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,616
Your Royal Highness.

617
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,576
Many people these days

618
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,536
are running away
to avoid paying military taxes.

619
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,247
And that's causing trouble
to each district's tax office.

620
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,960
Military taxes are the most important duty
of the people of this country.

621
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,631
Those who do not follow
show no loyalty to their country.

622
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,674
So you should arrest all of them

623
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,636
and tighten the country's discipline,
Your Royal Highness.

624
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,097
-Please do so, Your Royal Highness.
-Please do so, Your Royal Highness.

625
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,518
Please withdraw your order,
Your Royal Highness.

626
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,021
-Please withdraw your order.
-Please withdraw your order.

627
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,191
Please withdraw your order,
Your Royal Highness.

628
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,028
-Please withdraw your order.
-Please withdraw your order.

629
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,407
Did you say that military taxes are
the duty of this country's people?

630
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,202
Then what about you?

631
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,163
Have you ever paid taxes?

632
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,795
What about your fathers or your sons?

633
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,464
Have they ever paid taxes?

634
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,889
Your Royal Highness, military taxes
are meant to be paid by peasants...

635
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,559
Since when?

636
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,269
Since when did paying taxes

637
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,272
become a duty
for those who are weak and poor?

638
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,235
Before the wars broke out in Joseon,

639
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,571
everyone in this country
was obligated to pay taxes.

640
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,657
But as time passed by,
powerful officials stopped paying taxes

641
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,909
along with the wealthy noblemen.

642
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,537
And now, even the middle-class people
are doing the same.

643
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,206
That is why the poor ended up
with all the responsibility.

644
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,590
Asking a wealthy man
to pay a portion of his wealth...

645
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,634
and asking a poor man
to pay a portion of his wealth

646
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,428
are different to the core.

647
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,347
The people standing here
own most of the wealth in this country.

648
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,100
But you are busy trying to shift
the responsibility to the poor

649
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,686
and asking them to give more
than what they own.

650
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,022
That is exactly why our people
leave their homes

651
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,065
and choose to live in the mountains.

652
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,488
You think they show no loyalty
to this country?

653
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,783
Even if they choose
to turn their backs on our country,

654
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,329
I will not turn my back on them.
That is what a country should do.

655
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,497
That is what a king should do.

656
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,469
You arrogant fool.

657
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,480
I let you act as a regent
due to your enthusiasm.

658
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,025
But how dare you talk about the King's
duty while I am still alive?

659
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,028
-Father, I was just--
-I order the Crown Prince to leave.

660
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,322
Father...

661
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,039
I reduced the tax by half the amount,

662
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,791
but they still cannot pay it.

663
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,212
Dismiss the official in Hadong.

664
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,507
The governor of Gyeongsang Province
shall put down his position.

665
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,305
I felt so suffocated inside.

666
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,517
Aren't those men some of the most
competent government officials

667
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,435
that work in the royal court?

668
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,188
But they keep rejecting
every single comment

669
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,315
made by His Royal Highness.

670
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,818
They're like a group of gamecocks.

671
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,903
"Gamecocks"?

672
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,699
That's a very nice way of explaining
the very purpose of royal advisors.

673
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,742
"Royal advisors"?

674
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,160
That's what you call the officials

675
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,621
at the Office of Inspector-Generals
and the Office of Censors.

676
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,289
They each have slightly different roles.

677
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,126
But they both have a duty
of correcting the King's mistakes

678
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,461
and stopping him
from doing things arbitrarily like today.

679
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,797
It wasn't arbitrary.

680
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,594
Do you not think so?

681
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,223
His Royal Highness wasn't being arbitrary
by wanting to help the people.

682
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,351
He was just doing his job.

683
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,603
That's what I think.

684
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,188
Your opinions are not important.

685
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,986
Historians are people who record

686
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,487
what they see and hear.

687
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,198
Your opinions will
only make you become biased.

688
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,325
And if you record what you think,

689
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,496
that will only end up being a journal,
not a record of history.

690
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,928
The more I think about it,
the angrier I become.

691
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,388
His Royal Highness

692
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,683
always treats us like we're barbarians.

693
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,852
He thinks he's the King

694
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,105
just because he's the heir to the throne.

695
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,318
He'll soon learn
who the real leader of this country is.

696
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,945
And when exactly is that?

697
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,239
Every time I attend the royal meeting,

698
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,243
I start to wonder if I'm serving
the Crown Prince or the dethroned king...

699
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,267
Gosh, I'm shocked
at how bad these writings are.

700
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,563
You were asked to write letters,
not draw plants.

701
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,482
You should just become an artist.

702
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,359
This was our first time
at a royal meeting.

703
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,819
You don't have to be so mean.

704
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,529
You really need to practice a lot more.

705
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,283
Officer Min, come and see their writings.

706
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,646
Can you read what they wrote?

707
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,022
No.

708
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,441
This is not easy.

709
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,153
I thought I'd at least
be able to recognize one letter.

710
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,571
But it's really not easy.

711
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,243
What did you learn at the royal meeting?

712
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,578
It was hard.

713
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,496
It already takes time

714
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,832
to write down what people say.

715
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,710
But they all talk so fast.

716
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,921
I had a hard time
because I couldn't tell who was whom.

717
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,467
The official with thick eyebrows.

718
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,846
The official with a big head.
The official with a short neck.

719
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,639
That's what I wrote.

720
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,934
How do you all manage to tell them apart?

721
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,187
There is a way.

722
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,565
What's this?

723
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,859
"Record of Appearance"?

724
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,074
This person is...

725
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,411
Yes, he's the Second State Councilor,
Min Ik-pyeong.

726
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,710
He's the official with the big head.

727
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,755
Jegal Tak, a seventh-rank official
of the Royal Secretariat.

728
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,298
Yes, that's right.

729
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,676
Not only the three state councilors,
but also officials

730
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,595
from the Office of the Inspector-Generals,

731
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,388
the Office of Censors,
the Royal Secretariat,

732
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,015
the Office of State Records,

733
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,644
the Office of Special Advisors,
and the Office of Royal Lectures...

734
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,896
It is a recording
of all the officials' appearances

735
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,814
and their positions for us historians.

736
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,692
It's our tradition to keep it updated

737
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,986
and hand it over to the new historians.

738
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,366
So it belongs to you now.

739
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,036
Does that mean
you're acknowledging us as historians?

740
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,705
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself.

741
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,583
You have never even had a blistered hand.

742
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,210
How can you call yourselves historians?

743
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,303
Read it whenever you can
and memorize everything.

744
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,097
It will be of help.

745
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,269
Officer Min.

746
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,401
Thank you.

747
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,039
My goodness.

748
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,587
You really need to fix
that habit of yours.

749
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,840
What habit?

750
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,509
The habit of coming here
every time you're free.

751
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:09,472
That's why people in the palace are always
whispering that the Crown Prince

752
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,183
doesn't like the Crown Princess.

753
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,227
But it's true.

754
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,272
The Crown Princess is merely a spy

755
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,899
who reports everything I do and say

756
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,526
to the Second State Councilor.

757
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,405
Is there something on your mind?

758
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,616
Nothing's on my mind.

759
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,078
And don't even be curious.

760
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,872
You don't need to be disturbed as well.

761
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,335
You really don't know much about me.

762
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,504
I've been living my entire life

763
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,592
feeling disturbed and uneasy.

764
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,264
Stop acting silly.
I'm going to take a short nap.

765
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,640
Wake me up in a little while.

766
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,269
Okay.

767
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,650
Your Royal Highness.

768
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,862
Vice-Chancellor
of Royal College of Literature is here.

769
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,031
A THIRD-RANK OFFICIAL
OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL ADVISORS

770
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,533
I see.

771
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,910
Let him inside.

772
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,591
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

773
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,094
I had to see you discreetly.

774
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,845
I understand. What brings you here?

775
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,769
Someone was murdered

776
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,521
in a deserted house in Imalsan.

777
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,735
Six men died

778
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,279
and one survived
due to an odd medical practice?

779
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,991
What is this odd medical practice?

780
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,494
And what were these men doing
in a deserted house?

781
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,080
I do not know the details.

782
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,082
But an official questioned him

783
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,583
when he woke up.

784
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,378
And apparently, he spoke of a book.

785
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,133
-It must've been a banned book.
-Yes.

786
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,427
What's the name of that book?

787
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,096
It's called The Story of Ho Dam.

788
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,561
"The Story of Ho Dam"?

789
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,942
Did you just say "Ho Dam"?

790
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,867
Why couldn't you do your job properly?

791
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,869
Why did you leave behind a trace

792
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,580
like a snake shedding its skin?

793
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,457
Gwi-jae.

794
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,293
Did you say he survived
due to a medical practice

795
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,544
that doesn't exist in Joseon?

796
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,920
Yes, my lord.

797
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,553
How he managed to survive
is not important right now.

798
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,514
We don't know what he might say
now that he's alive.

799
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,766
So we must quickly take measures.

800
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,812
I agree. We can't let him stay alive.

801
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,614
My goodness.

802
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,290
My gosh, look at your faces.

803
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,001
Are you scared to look at dead bodies
because you're women?

804
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,171
I'm more scared of working overtime
than those scared bodies.

805
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,547
We should be going home.

806
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,716
Why do we suddenly need
to go outside for work?

807
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,802
I agree. I'm already exhausted

808
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,305
after having attended the royal meeting.

809
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,183
Gosh, I can't believe
we even have to attend an autopsy.

810
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,228
Why are you taking it out on me?
I didn't kill them.

811
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,812
Should I go around

812
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,940
asking all the murderers in this country

813
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,526
not to kill anyone since you're exhausted?

814
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,696
It's a historian's job
to attend autopsies.

815
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,989
Stop complaining and follow me.

816
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,245
It'll be less scary while the sun's out.

817
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,258
The wound on his stomach
is about two chon wide.

818
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,885
And its depth...

819
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,265
is about five chon deep.

820
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,937
Isn't it over yet?

821
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,190
-How's he doing?
-Whom?

822
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,943
The man who survived
due to the odd medical practice.

823
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,987
Did you see his wound?

824
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,614
What's the odd medical practice?

825
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,534
Why do you want to know that?

826
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,375
His body was sewn with a thread
as if it was a blanket. Are you happy?

827
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,878
His body was sewn with a thread?

828
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,383
May I take a look at him?

829
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,263
My gosh, why can't I see him?

830
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,765
I really won't take long.
It'll take less than ten minutes.

831
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,727
Why do you want to see that hideous wound?

832
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,312
Do you have a mental illness?

833
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,147
It's not because it's hideous.

834
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,276
It's because I think he got stitches.

835
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,569
What?

836
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,779
I heard about it back when I was in Qing.

837
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,573
It's a Western medical practice.

838
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,284
Apparently, the wound heals
if you stitch it with a thread.

839
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,869
Isn't it amazing?

840
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,204
That's why I really want to see it.

841
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:29,375
Can I please go inside
and take a quick look at it?

842
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,378
No, you can't. Not only did
the Royal Investigation Bureau say no,

843
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,088
but I also want to hurry up and go home.

844
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,923
-Then let me just go--
-One more word,

845
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,055
and I'll make you spend the entire night
with the dead bodies.

846
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,767
But sir...

847
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,451
My gosh, look at this.

848
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,329
-It's so pretty.
-I know, right?

849
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,958
I need to go back
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

850
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,251
I left my sachaek there.

851
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,628
-What?
-Bye, then.

852
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,591
But what's that in your hand?

853
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,469
She was holding her sachaek.

854
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,401
Who are you?

855
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,474
Maehwa?

856
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:24,986
I'm...

857
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,365
Prince Dowon,

858
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,035
the prince of Joseon.

859
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,956
What?

860
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,207
Do you really think...

861
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,795
you can kill me?

862
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,790
Are you saying she's alive?

863
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:23,294
How dare a traitor live
in the country that I rule?

864
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,922
I must know what that book is about.

865
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,633
-Do not dig into it.
-But you also know.

866
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,801
If he's a prince,
why is he still living in the palace

867
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,470
without even getting married?

868
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:35,139
His skin is as white as snow,
and he's very handsome.

869
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:38,434
A historian should not build
personal relationships with others.

870
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,978
It could end up backfiring on you
in the future.

871
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,230
I thought we could be friends.

872
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,732
I have something to say to you.

873
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,026
Are you going to write it down too?

874
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,031
