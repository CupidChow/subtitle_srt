EPISODE 17

2
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,833
It's because I am not used to

3
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,168
using honorifics.

4
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,506
-My lady.
-Good.

5
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,759
And how should you
address a woman like me?

6
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,972
My lady?

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
Apprentice Goo!

8
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,185
We wanted to do something for you
because you've been looking

9
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,271
so disheartened these days.

10
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,150
I took a bottle of wine
that my mother treasures.

11
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,318
Drink up.

12
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,279
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
Where is Apprentice Song?

14
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,915
We stopped by her place earlier,
but she wasn't home.

15
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,212
By any chance, do you know
anything about what happened

16
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,464
between Apprentice Song
and His Royal Highness?

17
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,342
She said nothing happened.

18
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,262
Still, it's so strange.

19
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,350
I can't wrap my head around
why she did such a thing.

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,271
Things are terrible.
Everyone is speaking ill of her,

21
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,107
and she may lose her job as a historian.

22
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,281
I think

23
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,409
I can understand
how she must be feeling now.

24
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,289
You know, there are times

25
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,835
when you just want to do
whatever you want without caring

26
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,631
about the consequences
or what others might say.

27
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,011
Perhaps she didn't want to let it go.

28
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
She wanted to be honest with herself.

29
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
My gosh.

30
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,357
You came all the way here
to lift my spirits, but I keep...

31
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,441
Now,

32
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,778
let's just eat and drink.

33
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,949
-Yes!
-You should forget all about the prince.

34
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,538
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

35
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,548
What? "The prince"?

36
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,972
What do you mean by that?

37
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,225
You mean, a son of
one of the noble families?

38
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,726
Or...

39
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,815
are you actually referring
to one of His Majesty's sons?

40
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,402
-Seol-geum.
-Wait, hang on.

41
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,530
Could it be the scholar from that time,

42
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,450
who had the glowing aura above his head?

43
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,371
Just seeing him gave me this pure joy,
which lasted for four days.

44
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,831
He's a prince?

45
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,419
The sea without water?

46
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,463
Clerk Yi, who used to hit on you?

47
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,464
So that was...

48
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
All of that was...

49
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,972
-Seol-geum, calm down.
-Yes, my lady.

50
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,770
Ms. Gwangju!

51
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,064
Hey!

52
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,442
Oh, no.

53
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,194
-What do we do now?
-My gosh.

54
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,488
-I deserve a smack.
-You and that mouth of yours!

55
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,698
-Gosh.
-What do we do?

56
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,002
Your Royal Highness.

57
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,504
Could you

58
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,884
just treat me as your sister today, U-won?

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,606
You're so cold-hearted.

60
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,193
-What?
-Can't you at least ask me if I'm okay?

61
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,867
I already know that you're not okay,
so why ask such a question?

62
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,327
Right,

63
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm not okay.

64
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,417
I snuck out of the palace
because I felt like I might end up

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
smashing something if I stayed there.

66
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,090
U-hui.

67
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,718
Both Apprentice Song
and His Royal Highness would never do

68
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,554
-what you're suspecting--
-I know.

69
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,184
Knowing his personality,
I'm sure nothing happened between them.

70
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,855
But that upsets me even more.

71
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,275
His Royal Highness
avoids conversing with me

72
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,403
because it makes him uncomfortable.

73
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,073
But he let that girl

74
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,784
stay by his side all night.

75
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,915
You know what, though?

76
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
The person I resent the most

77
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,337
is neither him nor the female historian.

78
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,590
-Then who is it?
-It's Father.

79
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,679
He made her partake
in the third evaluation,

80
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,723
forced His Royal Highness to get married,

81
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,103
and even dragged his young daughter
to the palace

82
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,730
when she did not want to
marry the Crown Prince.

83
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,607
It was all done by our father,

84
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,569
Second State Councillor Min Ik-pyeong.

85
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
U-hui.

86
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,073
Back then,

87
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,201
I did not know

88
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,371
what marrying the Crown Prince meant.

89
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,126
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,544
I mean it.

91
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,631
So what if you knew?

92
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,052
Would you have run away with me?

93
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,222
An exemplary scholar like you?

94
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,402
That girl, Song Sa-hui...

95
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,238
Please just make sure

96
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,075
Father doesn't penalize her in any way.

97
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,662
I will.

98
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
Do you guys have nothing to do?

99
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,795
Go away! Stop being so nosy.

100
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,423
-Hello.
-Hello.

101
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,469
I should cover my face
when I come to work.

102
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,764
Everyone is like, "What's going on between
His Royal Highness and Clerk Song?"

103
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,559
Everyone's going on about it,
and it's annoying the crap out of me.

104
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,936
Don't even get me started.

105
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,356
Scholar Kim from Sungkyunkwan
came all the way to my house yesterday,

106
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,149
saying he's dying to know what happened.

107
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,610
Is she taking another sick day?

108
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,030
Do you think she's actually sick?
She's too embarrassed to come to work.

109
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,741
Everyone is saying the female historians
should be kicked out.

110
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,077
I bet she's too ashamed to be here now.

111
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,459
But what if she's actually sick?
You girls should visit her later today.

112
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,962
Pick up some good food on the way.

113
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,134
This petition was submitted

114
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,011
by Park Song-hyeon,
a lecturer at Sungkyunkwan.

115
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,266
"Those at the Office of Royal Decrees
seem to be lacking discipline these days,

116
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,477
and various rumors about female historians
are wreaking havoc in the palace."

117
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,687
Next.

118
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,568
This is by Jo Seung-yeol
from the Office of the Inspector-General.

119
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,028
"The negative effects
of employing female historians--"

120
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,238
Next.

121
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,412
This was submitted by Kim Myeong-seon
from the Office of Censors.

122
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,664
"The inappropriate conduct

123
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,292
of the female historian,
Song Sa-hui, dishonored--"

124
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,459
Next.

125
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,131
Your Royal Highness, these were submitted
by your faithful subjects.

126
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,341
Why would you not even listen to them?

127
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,676
Many people,

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,554
in and outside the palace,
are strongly voicing their concerns.

129
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,266
It is about time we discussed
abolishing the female historian system.

130
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,475
We cannot do that.

131
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,646
His Majesty approved it
in order to improve our customs--

132
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,898
Female historians
haven't helped us improve anything!

133
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,483
Silence, all of you!

134
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,700
Three days ago,

135
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,078
a violent storm hit the ships
returning to Ganghwa Island,

136
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,540
and we lost 2,500 seok of rice
as well as 30 workers.

137
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,043
And yesterday, 23 houses burned down

138
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,713
and five people lost their lives
due to a fire.

139
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,381
But all of you

140
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,760
are only interested in such rumors?

141
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,476
Fine.

142
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,938
If you need someone to blame,
go ahead and blame me.

143
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,068
It happened because of
my one-sided feelings for her.

144
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,404
"I will do anything for you
if you decide to become mine."

145
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,991
I threatened her and tried to persuade her
all night to keep her by my side.

146
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,704
That is what happened that night.

147
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,166
Your Royal Highness.

148
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,753
Why bring such disgrace on yourself
just to protect a woman?

149
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,380
You were the ones

150
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,675
who wanted to put a black mark on her
because of unverified rumors.

151
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,595
So, tell me.

152
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,138
Do not just put the blame on her.

153
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,266
You should criticize me equally
for my conduct.

154
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,616
The Crown Prince

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,703
fancied one of the candidates
for his brother's bride-to-be?

156
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,997
That is one scandalous rumor!

157
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,544
I am too ashamed to even face anyone.

158
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,714
Your Majesty, that is not true--

159
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,798
It does not matter!

160
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,883
Just the fact that such rumors
are going around

161
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,177
is an utter disgrace to the royal family!

162
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,683
How dare you endorse such a wicked girl?

163
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,563
I sincerely apologize, Your Majesty.

164
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,277
Forget it. I am canceling the plan
to marry Prince Dowon off.

165
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,154
Cancel everything.

166
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,740
-Call it off.
-Your Majesty,

167
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,159
the third evaluation
is just around the corner. We can't--

168
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,495
Then what? Are you suggesting
we push ahead with the wedding?

169
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:31,208
Do you wish to see the whole world
mocking the royal family?

170
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,087
Sort out the situation
as quietly as possible

171
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,965
so that it is not brought up again.

172
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,927
Now leave!

173
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,273
I can't believe this.
You always acted like you were so clever.

174
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,652
You fell ill because you got yourself
into a situation you can't handle.

175
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,989
Goodness.
You're just book smart, that's all.

176
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,663
My lord, a guest is here for Lady Sa-hui.

177
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,417
She's in no shape to greet a guest.
Tell the guest to come back another time.

178
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,170
The thing is,
it's the Second State Councillor.

179
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,934
You stay here.

180
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,423
I heard you have a high fever.

181
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,636
I got this for you
from the Medical Office.

182
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,554
Take it.

183
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,020
I was too inconsiderate.

184
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,606
Had I known you had feelings
for His Royal Highness,

185
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
I wouldn't have made you
one of the candidates.

186
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,320
Are you

187
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,657
apologizing to me now?

188
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,536
I am admitting my mistake.

189
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
Look after your health.

190
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,710
I'd rather be punished.

191
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,633
Kick me out of the Office of Royal Decrees
or craft an excuse to exile me.

192
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,136
Do whatever you wish.

193
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
You work for me.

194
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:00,983
That is why

195
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,278
I am sparing your life just this once.

196
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,563
What happened?

197
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,857
The Second State Councillor
went to see her,

198
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,610
but he left quietly
after giving her some medicine.

199
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,279
I see.

200
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,657
Keep a close watch for the time being.

201
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,742
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,587
When I was 11,

203
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,298
I received a love letter
for the very first time.

204
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,802
He was the son of a high-ranking official,

205
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,054
and he asked me to marry him
out of the blue.

206
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,141
"I fell in love with you at first sight.
Please be mine.

207
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,520
I will make sure you can enjoy
a comfortable, luxurious life."

208
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,941
And do you know what I did?

209
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,697
I corrected all of his spelling mistakes
and returned the letter to him.

210
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,994
I told him he should seek knowledge
before chasing after women.

211
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,709
And that night,

212
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,588
my father whipped me
on the back of my legs until I bled.

213
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,591
That was when I realized

214
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,137
what kind of life I am expected to live.

215
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:58,142
So you probably wished
you had been born to a man of no rank.

216
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,644
Then you could live freely

217
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,063
despite being poor.

218
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,734
Right, then I could live freely

219
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,236
despite being poor.

220
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,530
I'm sure

221
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,199
your life has not been
that different from mine.

222
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,828
Your Royal Highness.

223
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,664
I will

224
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,291
not be chosen.

225
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,505
I'm fully aware of the fact
that I'm not qualified

226
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,216
to marry the prince.

227
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,346
I will make sure the Second State
Councillor won't get his way

228
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,850
even if I must cause a scene
during the evaluation.

229
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,019
So don't worry.

230
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,688
He will not just sit back.

231
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,149
You never know what he might do to you.

232
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,860
I'll think of it as a chance

233
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,945
to pay for my sins.

234
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,256
Don't be so rough with it.

235
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,383
Be gentle, will you?

236
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, that's...

237
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,055
They're all falling.

238
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
I'm trying my best.

239
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,767
Hey, seriously!

240
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,814
What are you doing?
You can't do anything right. Both of you.

241
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,856
Oh, it's done.

242
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,609
-This one too.
-My goodness.

243
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,029
Do it properly.
Take your time with it, okay?

244
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,324
One step at a time.
I told you not to touch that.

245
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,077
-You girls are driving me nuts.
-I see. This is how you do it.

246
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,663
-Try it yourself. Do this.
-We're doing our best.

247
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,582
You girls, seriously.
Why can't you do this?

248
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,959
What are you working on?

249
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,003
Be quiet. We have to do this
before His Highness wakes up...

250
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,556
Your Highness!

251
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,269
Happy birthday, Your Highness!

252
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,229
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

253
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,150
Happy birthday, Your Highness!

254
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,322
Happy birthday, Your Highness!

255
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,908
Your Highness!

256
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,831
Let's celebrate!

257
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,352
Birthdays come around every year.
You didn't have to make all this confetti.

258
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,441
But this year's birthday
is a very special one.

259
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,402
It's your 20th birthday, Your Highness.

260
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,117
Here, you should eat light for breakfast.

261
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,620
The Queen Dowager

262
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,290
will send a feast at lunch
for your birthday meal,

263
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,834
so you can eat as much as you'd like
at lunch.

264
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,588
Here you go.

265
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,256
Thank you.

266
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
You girls too.

267
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,725
It's good.

268
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:28,894
Please have some soup.

269
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,651
Your Highness.

270
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,335
Your Majesty.

271
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,338
Happy birthday, Prince Dowon.

272
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,717
Thank you.

273
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,846
Would you make some time for me today?

274
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,823
You should bow.

275
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,618
It is Prince Huiyeong,

276
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,203
Yi Gyeom.

277
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,289
Prince Huiyeong?

278
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,750
The king who was ousted by Father?

279
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,128
The dethroned king?

280
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,707
-Her Majesty even took Prince Dowon?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,837
I bet she went to see him again.

282
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,757
Make sure the Second State Councillor

283
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,010
doesn't find out.

284
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,387
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,953
PRINCE DOWON AND THE QUEEN DOWAGER
LEFT THE PALACE THIS MORNING

286
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,754
I put a lot of work
into preparing this meal,

287
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,342
-but it actually looks very humble.
-No, please don't say that.

288
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
I am delighted
to spend my birthday with you.

289
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,474
It would have been nice

290
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,936
if we had your bride-to-be with us here
on this happy day.

291
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,986
Don't worry too much
about your wedding being called off.

292
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,947
I promise you that I will find

293
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,285
the most perfect lady for you
in the near future.

294
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,453
It's okay, Your Majesty.

295
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,664
I do not wish to

296
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,333
get married.

297
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,127
What do you mean?

298
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,088
I learned that marrying someone

299
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,759
means you must embrace everything
about that person.

300
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,928
However,

301
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,639
I am not ready to do that yet.

302
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,683
Don't say that.

303
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:23,480
No man can be more mature
and thoughtful than you are.

304
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,733
Aren't I right, Apprentice Goo?

305
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,777
Pardon me?

306
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,656
You have seen enough at Nokseodang,
so I'm sure you know

307
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,368
that Prince Dowon would be
a wonderful husband.

308
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

309
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,126
He will be a great husband.

310
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,712
Any woman would be glad

311
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,549
to have you as her husband.

312
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,175
See?

313
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,928
Even a historian says so.

314
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,723
That being said,

315
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,977
why don't you join us for a glass of wine?

316
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,478
Your Majesty.

317
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,730
No, Your Majesty.
How could I dare to join your meal?

318
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,234
I am giving you my permission
as the elder in the royal family.

319
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,988
You can't even do that for a prince
as his faithful subject?

320
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,266
Happy birthday, Your Highness.

321
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,062
You should have some wine too.

322
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,468
Thank you, Apprentice Goo.

323
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,115
Then,

324
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,993
enjoy the rest of your day.

325
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,542
Don't be uncomfortable around me.

326
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,505
You are a historian, and I live here,

327
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,007
so we'll keep running into each other.

328
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,804
I do not want you to get all awkward

329
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,972
every time that happens.

330
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,642
I am just trying to be careful.

331
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,147
I'm worried I might treat you
like I used to without realizing it.

332
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,358
You call that being careful?

333
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,070
Getting me all riled up by saying
that any woman would be

334
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,698
delighted to be with me?

335
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,744
Then how was I supposed
to answer that question?

336
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,124
Should I have said
I cannot let you marry anyone else

337
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,043
because I am the one you fancy?

338
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,260
Like you said, I am a historian.

339
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,846
And I will continue
to frequent the Inner Palace,

340
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,889
which means I will have to see you.

341
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,599
That is why...

342
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,477
I'm trying.

343
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,273
I'm trying hard

344
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,316
not to think about how you and I...

345
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,695
feel about each other.

346
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,302
I have done my best.

347
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,804
Thus, I have no regrets.

348
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,682
So please,

349
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,560
treat me like nothing happened.

350
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,480
I am...

351
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,815
trying too.

352
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,891
I am Third Inspector Goo Jae-gyeong
from the Office of the Inspector-General.

353
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,226
I heard

354
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,273
you were the one
who delivered the King's last letter.

355
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Do you know

356
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,448
how many people lost their lives
because of your betrayal?

357
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,704
Do you realize

358
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,502
that what you did provided reasons
for the revolt?

359
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,257
-Your Majesty.
-How dare you

360
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,301
come before me so shamelessly
after what you did?

361
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,349
You practically killed all of them,
from the King to the people of Seoraewon.

362
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,811
Every single one of them
had a bright future ahead,

363
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,190
but they were all killed overnight.

364
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,658
Your Majesty,

365
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,036
you can interrogate him about it

366
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,705
after you accomplish your goal.

367
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,672
I, too,

368
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,051
still cannot forgive
what Goo Jae-gyeong did.

369
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,512
However,

370
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:34,017
he came to see me,
saying he'd like to pay for what he did.

371
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
Please trust him.

372
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,479
"Pay for what he did"?

373
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,941
Why now?
What was he doing all those years?

374
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,485
He said he was hiding in Qing.

375
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,574
And since returning to Joseon, he has been
searching for Kim Il-mok's daily records.

376
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,242
So that man

377
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,413
also knows about the daily records?

378
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,123
Yes, Your Majesty.

379
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,001
But he hasn't found them yet.

380
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,134
I will allow him to assist me
for the time being,

381
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,430
but only until Prince Dowon
becomes the king.

382
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,351
Yes, Your Majesty.

383
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,506
Father?

384
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,221
Father?

385
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,897
Rim.

386
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,677
Why...

387
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,554
are you out here?

388
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,975
There are

389
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,686
court ladies asleep inside.

390
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,948
Did you have a nightmare again?

391
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,869
Should I ask Eunuch Heo
to bring you some medicine?

392
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,203
No.

393
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,872
It's not like that.

394
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,129
Isn't it strange

395
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,301
that Her Majesty brought me
to the dethroned king's grave?

396
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,433
Only an impertinent woman would
answer such a question.

397
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,355
Yes.

398
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,150
I found it

399
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,693
rather strange too.

400
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,404
It's not usual

401
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,115
for a prince to hold
a memorial ritual for a dethroned king.

402
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,035
And there is no reason for you to do that.

403
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,290
Does it bother you?

404
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,793
Yes.

405
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,382
If today is the 20th year
of the dethroned king's death,

406
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,218
that means he died

407
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,471
on the day I was born.

408
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,435
Do you know anything
about the dethroned king?

409
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,521
I was too young back then as well.

410
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,191
I heard he tormented the people

411
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,193
and was a heretic.

412
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,528
HERETIC: SOMEONE INVOLVED
IN PSEUDO-RELIGION

413
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,280
That's all I know.

414
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,576
Have you never heard anything
regarding the dethroned king?

415
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,704
I mean, you grew up in the palace.

416
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,581
I've overheard things

417
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,750
a couple of times.

418
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,628
That he is someone

419
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,216
no one should ever talk about.

420
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,177
What in the world is his crime?

421
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,771
Thank you for having a chat with me.
You should get some rest.

422
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,067
Yes, Your Highness.

423
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,030
I'm all right.

424
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,867
Ever since you came to Nokseodang,

425
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,496
I never once had a bad dream.

426
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,084
So you don't have to

427
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,670
worry about me anymore.

428
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,380
Jae-gyeong?

429
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,245
Do you know each other by any chance?

430
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,789
Go and get some rest.

431
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,567
It's an ambush!

432
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,569
-It's an attack!
-Your Highness!

433
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,991
Your Highness!

434
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,369
Your Highness!

435
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,425
Get back here! Hurry!

436
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,640
Your Highness!

437
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,144
Your Highness!

438
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,316
Your Highness!

439
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,323
Your Highness! Over here!

440
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,631
Your Highness! Come this way!

441
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,760
Your Highness! Over here, Your Highness!

442
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,510
I think it's over, Your Highness.

443
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,138
Are you okay?

444
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,806
Yes.

445
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm okay.

446
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,649
Your Highness!

447
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,234
Eunuch Heo.

448
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,152
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

449
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,656
Come over here! His Highness got injured!

450
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,282
Please get over here!

451
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,743
Your Highness, you must stay awake!

452
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,161
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness!

453
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,704
Your Highness!

454
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,876
What did you just say?

455
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,088
They got attacked on their way back,
and His Highness got injured...

456
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,091
Call the military commander.

457
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm going to bring
Prince Dowon back myself.

458
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,262
No, Your Royal Highness.

459
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,805
Your Royal Highness!

460
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,848
Your Royal Highness!

461
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,939
You must have completely lost your mind.

462
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,442
How dare you...

463
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,780
How dare you attack a prince?

464
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,578
Even when you made a mess
of the Royal Court

465
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,497
and tried to control
this country's affairs,

466
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,750
I forgave you
thinking that you did everything

467
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,669
out of pure loyalty.

468
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,963
But...

469
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,008
this is how you choose to repay me?

470
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,636
Did you really think

471
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,222
I'd forgive you for what you did?

472
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,563
I just asked you a question!
Why aren't you answering me?

473
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,316
Your Majesty.

474
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,569
Prince Dowon

475
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,989
is the first son of the dethroned king.

476
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,704
I don't know why you hid that from me
and kept him alive all these years.

477
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,999
But in my opinion,

478
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,920
there's absolutely no reason or need
for him to stay alive!

479
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,089
-Second State Councillor!
-The Queen Dowager

480
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,426
took Prince Dowon
to the dethroned king's grave.

481
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,512
Do you not know what that means?

482
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,350
This is mutiny!

483
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,062
The Queen Dowager, who's leading
the remnants of Seoraewon,

484
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,606
has finally shown her true colors!

485
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,461
-What?
-The royal family got attacked?

486
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,716
Yes, His Royal Highness just left
with the Military Training Corps.

487
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,886
What about Apprentice Goo?
What happened to her?

488
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,307
Prince Dowon and a few officers
are the only ones who got injured.

489
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,146
But those bandits must've been
out of their minds.

490
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,400
How could they attack the royal family?
Are they crazy?

491
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,943
Apparently,

492
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,405
-they didn't seem like bandits.
-What?

493
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,031
They didn't steal anything.

494
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,575
They just kept shooting arrows
at His Highness.

495
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,453
Does that mean they were

496
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,164
-aiming for His Highness from the start?
-Yes.

497
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,042
My goodness.

498
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,589
My goodness, Your Highness.
Please hang in there.

499
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,884
My goodness gracious. Are you okay?

500
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,594
Are you okay, Your Highness?

501
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,139
I'll take that.
You should go inside and help.

502
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,732
The arrowhead...

503
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,360
is blunt.

504
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,304
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

505
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,930
Is His Highness okay?

506
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,516
Yes, he's taking some rest
in his chamber...

507
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,331
-Rim.
-Jin.

508
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,957
No, don't get up.

509
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,755
You should be busy ruling the country.
What brings you all the way here?

510
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,090
How could I not come here

511
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,675
after what happened to...

512
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,347
What did the doctor say?

513
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,682
Apparently, the arrow wound
isn't that deep.

514
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,936
But he injured himself
as he fell off his horse.

515
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,397
I'm okay.

516
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,525
I'm sure Her Majesty
was a lot more startled.

517
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,361
You should take her back.

518
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,362
No,

519
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,781
I'm going to stay here for a while.

520
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,075
After you fully recover,

521
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,371
I'll find those people who did this to you
and punish them severely.

522
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,957
Then we'll go back to the palace together.

523
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,501
-Jin.
-I'm not okay with what happened!

524
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,297
Your Highness, this is Goo Hae-ryung.

525
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,383
May I enter?

526
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,927
He's recovering right now.
I want you to leave.

527
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,762
There's something I must tell him.

528
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,041
What's this?

529
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,168
Their goal

530
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,879
wasn't to kill you, Your Highness.

531
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:09,965
What?

532
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,185
These are the arrows that hit you
and the other officers.

533
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,940
The arrowheads are short and blunt
as if they were purposely made that way.

534
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,860
Some arrows made by civilians

535
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,320
tend to be shoddy like this.

536
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,323
It isn't just the arrows.

537
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,785
I also found
something peculiar with the bow.

538
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,376
The bowstring is much too thin,

539
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,628
and it's also very loose.

540
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,213
They did this on purpose

541
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,674
to decrease the speed

542
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,676
and strength of penetration.

543
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,928
Yes, that's right. On top of that,

544
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,183
all the military officers
only injured their arms and legs.

545
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,435
Isn't it weird?

546
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,438
They were brave enough
to attack the royal family,

547
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,691
but they failed to kill a single person
when we weren't even moving,

548
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,612
and they also used blunt arrows
and loose bows.

549
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,129
I guess they never intended

550
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,424
to kill anyone.

551
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,718
I agree with you.

552
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,220
This wasn't a raid.

553
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,680
They just made it seem like it.

554
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,394
He's a naive boy who was
never interested in political affairs.

555
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,731
Who would do something like this and why?

556
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,483
I can only find one reason.

557
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,362
It's because...

558
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,659
I visited the dethroned king's grave.

559
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,306
My gosh, His Majesty is unbelievable.

560
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,643
I can't believe he accused you
of doing something like that.

561
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,773
How could he be suspicious of you
when you've been loyal for 20 years?

562
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,569
But I really can't get a grasp
of who the mastermind

563
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,237
behind this raid could be.

564
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,158
Prince Dowon is weak
and has no political connections.

565
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,118
What could anyone gain from attacking him?

566
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,244
Well...

567
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,206
I think His Majesty could've been the one
who schemed this.

568
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,295
I mean, think about it.
His Majesty always hated Prince Dowon.

569
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,797
He got angry every time he heard his name.

570
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,842
And he publicly badmouthed him
saying he shouldn't have been born

571
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,218
as a member of the royal family.

572
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:04,055
You do have a point.
I guess that's also a possibility

573
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,893
-considering His Majesty's temper.
-No.

574
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:14,566
His Majesty doesn't have the guts
or the wisdom to plan something like that.

575
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,571
I guess you're right.

576
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,953
I really don't know what to say.

577
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,790
I made Prince Dowon go through this
by bringing him with me.

578
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,293
No.

579
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,171
I should've checked more thoroughly
before you left.

580
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,131
I'm sorry.

581
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,092
But...

582
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,680
you should stop visiting the grave
of the dethroned king, Grandmother.

583
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,391
You knew?

584
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,145
You come here every year on the same date.

585
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,357
I guessed that it'd be
the anniversary of his death.

586
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,778
If you know that,
why are you asking me to stop?

587
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:04,950
Prince Huiyeong is my son.

588
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,618
What's so wrong

589
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:13,041
about a mother wanting to visit
her son's grave once a year?

590
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,712
I remember the dethroned king
as a great uncle.

591
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,966
But you can't let your personal feelings
get in the way.

592
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,052
More importantly,
he was sentenced to death by my father...

593
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,598
for committing high treason.

594
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,143
Your Royal Highness,

595
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,649
do not fool yourself into
thinking that you know everything.

596
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,861
Not everything you hear is the truth.

597
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,703
You may leave now.

598
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,748
Yes, Your Majesty.

599
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,335
Your Highness.

600
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,463
Are you sleeping?

601
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,611
I was waiting for you.

602
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,489
I thought you might come.

603
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,460
Is it okay for you to walk like this?

604
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,463
You're not in your best condition.

605
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,341
I'm okay.

606
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,094
I'm healthy enough to carry you

607
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,471
and run all the way to Hanyang.

608
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,312
I guess...

609
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,483
you couldn't sleep either
because of what happened today.

610
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,444
Yes.

611
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,947
I just can't seem to understand.

612
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,034
You've never been interested
in political affairs,

613
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,329
and you wouldn't have done anything
to be hated by anyone.

614
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,333
So I don't get why this happened to you.

615
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,505
Have you ever been threatened by anyone
like today?

616
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,924
Or were you ever

617
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,051
in a dangerous situation?

618
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,263
Yes, once.

619
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,058
It happened when I visited
the Royal Investigation Bureau.

620
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,482
That day when I took you
to the apothecary?

621
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,734
Yes, it was that night.

622
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,573
Why did you go
to the Royal Investigation Bureau?

623
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,784
I was looking for a book
called The Story of Ho Dam.

624
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,745
It's become a banned book now,
so I can't get it.

625
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,580
But I once saw

626
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,374
the name "Ho Dam" at this royal villa.

627
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,169
"Ho Dam and Yeongan.

628
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,838
This is where the path was made."

629
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,467
It was written on a gravestone.

630
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,637
"Ho Dam and Yeongan."

631
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,650
Did the Chinese characters
for the name Yeongan

632
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,987
have the meaning
of "jade-green" and "eye"?

633
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,573
How did you know that?

634
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,409
It's the writer of Variolation for Cowpox.

635
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,416
What is this?

636
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,419
This book will tell us
how we can save everyone.

637
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,422
VARIOLATION FOR COWPOX BY YEONGAN

638
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,133
They're all connected.

639
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:18,054
Ho Dam, Yeongan, and that physician
who gave me that book.

640
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,682
But I thought she disappeared.

641
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,308
She didn't disappear.

642
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,144
I saw her here last night.

643
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,441
Your Highness, where do I need to go

644
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,194
to see that tombstone?

645
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,654
It's gone.

646
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,031
I went back there,

647
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,367
and it was gone.

648
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,037
Eunuch Heo told me that it was a dream.

649
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,251
A dream?

650
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,587
Rim.

651
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,527
Your Highness.

652
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,125
It wasn't a dream.

653
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,095
Who are you, my lord?

654
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,471
Me?

655
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,392
You can call me Ho Dam.

656
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,353
Here.

657
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,984
The dethroned king.

658
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,529
Prince Huiyeong, Yi Gyeom.

659
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,198
He was Ho Dam?

660
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,610
I was shot by an arrow.

661
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,904
Don't you want to know if I'm okay or not?

662
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,698
Rumor says the Second State Councillor
schemed the raid.

663
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,534
Their relationship
will soon come to an end.

664
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,786
Who did this?

665
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,914
Your Majesty, you already know
who the culprit is.

666
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:16,584
You're probably upset that Prince Dowon

667
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,294
was not killed by the arrow.

668
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,839
You'd better not forget
the promise you made me.

669
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,133
A historian who didn't hand in
his daily records?

670
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,803
Have you heard of a historian
named Kim Il-mok?

671
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,264
We couldn't find a single trace.
How do you think they found this?

672
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,683
I'll help you get on a boat to Qing
tomorrow morning.

673
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,103
The daily records from 20 years ago
still exist?

674
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,524
The only thing you can do
is to make sure you stay alive.
