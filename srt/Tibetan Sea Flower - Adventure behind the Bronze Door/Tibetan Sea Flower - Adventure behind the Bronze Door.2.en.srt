00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,870
(The kid who appeared out of nowhere)

5
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,950
(took Ma Pingchuan
to the backside of the mountain.)

6
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:53,230
(Ma Pingchuan looked in
the direction the child was looking)

7
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,150
(and was shocked.)

8
00:01:58,629 --> 00:01:59,629
A scorpion?

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,909
What's this?

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,469
Under this area

11
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,509
lies the ruins of a town

12
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,590
that was buried
by a mudslide many years ago.

13
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,150
The extent of what you see

14
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,669
is the extent of the ruins.

15
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,469
The town was built
into the weird shape of a scorpion.

16
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,789
The grass here dies

17
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,430
because of the defense mechanism

18
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,590
that was put in place

19
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,349
when the town was built.

20
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:26,909
If someone gets inside,

21
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,110
the switch will be triggered,

22
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,110
causing the gas in the machinery

23
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,749
to evaporate greatly.

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,390
All plants on the ground

25
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,870
will be poisoned to death

26
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:36,990
overnight.

27
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,430
Punk.

28
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,430
Although I don't quite understand,

29
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,909
don't trick me.

30
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,229
Do you have X-ray vision?

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,110
Because I'm the one who went down.

32
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,550
The ruin beneath us

33
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,710
has eaten up all the coffins

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,469
in your ancestral tombs.

35
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,789
What do you mean?

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,390
Is the ruins alive?

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,150
If you dig the deeper areas,

38
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,509
you'll find

39
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,430
that all the coffins

40
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,390
has sunk
into the outer wall of the ruins.

41
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:16,110
It's like
they're attracted by something.

42
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,669
There's one more thing

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,870
I think I need to tell you.

44
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,069
There will be no grass
growing within dozens of miles of here

45
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,349
in a few months.

46
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,110
Everyone in this area

47
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,550
will die miserably.

48
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,550
Punk, don't play tricks on me.

49
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:40,909
Sir.

50
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,030
Put the guns down.

51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,590
Put down the guns.

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,310
I saw your coffins

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,870
in the ruins.

54
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,629
That's why I told you about it.

55
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,669
I want you to do two things for me

56
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,030
within two hours.

57
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,189
First,

58
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,669
prepare a short knife
weighing three kilograms,

59
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:03,590
lamp oil wicks
and a bag of charcoal powder.

60
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,310
And think of a way to seal up

61
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,789
several holes in the ruins.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,990
Second,

63
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,229
at the edge of this area,

64
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,909
take a five-zhang-long bamboo pole,

65
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,069
fill it with lime,
and hammer it into the mud,

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,990
leaving only a finger-length.

67
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,349
The denser the better.

68
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,390
Why are we doing that?

69
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:20,750
If I don't come out

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,989
after seven days,

71
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:23,789
please send this letter

72
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,789
back to my hometown for me.

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,620
(To The Zhang Family)

74
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,750
Sir.

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,909
Sir.

76
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:40,669
Everything's ready.

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,750
Young man.

78
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:53,989
The kid left and never came back.

79
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:55,630
Later, Ma Pingchuan sent someone

80
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,750
to the address
on the letter the kid gave him

81
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,390
and found it to be a huge mansion.

82
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,309
But it's already empty.

83
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:04,669
No one knows where the kid went.

84
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:05,950
And no one knows

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,869
if there's
a scorpion-shaped ruin underneath.

86
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,789
Is the kid
that Ma Pingchuan talked about

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,109
Qiling?

88
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,190
It must be.

89
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:19,390
Ma'an Village.

90
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,190
Does this place still exist?

91
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,190
Of course.

92
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:24,390
They had already

93
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,070
dug the withered area

94
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,270
and didn't find
the so-called scorpion-shaped ruins.

95
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,909
All they found are these agate beads.

96
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,549
Later, Ma Pingchuan suddenly decided

97
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,610
to move his family from Ma'an Village

98
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,510
and go to Nilaisi.

99
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,070
Nilaisi?

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,070
Yes, a small country
outside the borders.

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,349
Specifically,

102
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,549
they went to Dejia,
the capital of Nilaisi.

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,109
Near Mosang's snow mountain.

104
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,270
My informant just came back
from there two days ago

105
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,070
and saw many of their ancestral items

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,190
piled up in front of their house.

107
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,750
They were being sold at a low price.

108
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,309
There were a lot of those beads.

109
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,869
They're good stuff.

110
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,030
Is that so?

111
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,190
Sure.

112
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,469
Give me the address.

113
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,109
I'll take a look when I have time.

114
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,349
Third Master.

115
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,109
Having said that,

116
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,469
we finally got to the point.

117
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,270
If you're going there,

118
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,070
bring me with you.

119
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,150
We're familiar.

120
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,360
I can give you a counteroffer.

121
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,830
With our money

122
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,309
your influence,

123
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,669
and my help,

124
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:26,909
let's make a deal.

125
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,590
Jin Wantang.

126
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,309
You're still trying
to trick me into this, aren't you?

127
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,590
My dear.

128
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,590
Why can't you tell the difference?

129
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,669
We're on the same boat.

130
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,630
Leave.

131
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,469
Leave.

132
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,190
Third Master.

133
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,390
What are you doing?

134
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,789
I just want to make some money.

135
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,390
I swear

136
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:52,549
my shop will burn down

137
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,549
and I can never find anything good
if I trick you.

138
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,510
Are you happy now?

139
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,590
You're daring to say that.

140
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,989
You want to trick me to abroad.

141
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,429
I don't know anyone there.

142
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:03,549
If someone killed me,

143
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,760
who's going to collect my body?

144
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,030
You'd better get going. Leave.

145
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,909
Third Master!

146
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,590
You really won't take action
without a clear target.

147
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,349
My informant

148
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,429
took this photo at their doorstep.

149
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:25,669
Could there be a mistake?

150
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,070
Did I really accuse you
unfairly this time?

151
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,950
All right, stop sighing.

152
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,789
Let's go together.

153
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,309
When are we leaving?

154
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,469
Did you bring your ID card?

155
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
To book tickets.

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,460
We'll fly to a border city first
and find a way to leave the country.

157
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:58,869
It's

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,469
settled then.

159
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:01,549
It's settled.

160
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,070
I'll let you know

161
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,669
as soon as I booked the tickets.

162
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,669
All right.

163
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,309
Boss.

164
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,830
Wang Meng, where are you?

165
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,510
Home.

166
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,370
Your leave is canceled.
Come back to work immediately.

167
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,270
Boss.

168
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,510
I finally saved up enough leaves.

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,470
Just let me play games at home.

170
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:34,870
Jin Wantang stopped by.

171
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,589
That old jerk

172
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:38,709
told you a story,

173
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,589
so you're going to Dejia with him?

174
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,110
Why do I have the feeling
that it's a scam?

175
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,189
Even you could tell,

176
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,870
how could I not tell?

177
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,630
You have more reason not to go.

178
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,870
I'm going. I'm definitely going.

179
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:52,909
So far

180
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,110
it's the only clue related to Qiling.

181
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,789
If I want to understand Qiling's past,
I have to go to Dejia

182
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,270
and find the Ma family's descendants.

183
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,870
I've packed my luggage.

184
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,630
Keep your ID card safe.

185
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,870
Don't let Jin Wantang find it.

186
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,990
Also,

187
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,510
Come back soon.

188
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,630
Bye.

189
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:23,923
(Wuzhou)

190
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,720
(Dejia)

191
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,340
(Dejia)

192
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,510
Sir, excuse me.

193
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,709
May I ask a question?

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,829
Welcome.

195
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,909
Sir.

196
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,270
What would you like?

197
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,829
Boss,

198
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,309
I want to ask you something.

199
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,350
Did the family across the street

200
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:06,829
move somewhere?

201
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,069
The Ma family?

202
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,230
Do you know them?

203
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,510
How are you related to them?

204
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,709
Why are you looking for him?

205
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,990
Here's the thing.

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,510
I'm

207
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,990
also in the antique business in Wuzhou.

208
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,350
I ordered a batch of goods
from the Ma family.

209
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,709
I've made all the payment,

210
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,589
but I couldn't

211
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:27,390
get in touch with them

212
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,750
when I called them some time ago.

213
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,189
I had to come over myself.

214
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,030
Who knew

215
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,429
they're gone?

216
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:33,390
So do you know

217
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,549
where they went?

218
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,829
Could you tell me something?

219
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,189
Did they rip you off too?

220
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,110
Yeah.

221
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,309
Those jerks

222
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,230
had always owed me a lot of money.

223
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,669
They had some conscience

224
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,069
before they left.

225
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,309
They didn't leave secretly.

226
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,870
They gave me all his family antiques.

227
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,350
In that case,

228
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,110
are these things

229
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,030
and that mirror

230
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,350
from the Ma family?

231
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,110
You're quite lucky.

232
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,230
At least you recovered some costs.

233
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,390
Look at me.

234
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,429
Could you

235
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:04,390
please tell me

236
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,549
where they went

237
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,110
so I can collect my debt?

238
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,750
I heard

239
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,350
their whole family moved to

240
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,549
Mosang. Yes.

241
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,390
When the Ma family's business was good,

242
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,510
they often went there to purchase goods.

243
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,669
I heard

244
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,350
the antiques there are very cheap.

245
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,549
It's just that I'm old

246
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:26,909
and weak.

247
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,110
Otherwise, I really want to
go there to pick up some goods.

248
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,909
The antique business

249
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,189
is so difficult now.

250
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,189
All right.

251
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,549
Thank you.

252
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,230
I wish you a booming business.

253
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:47,510
Wang Meng.

254
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,110
Boss.

255
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,030
Sort out the funds in the store

256
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,390
and transfer them all to my account.

257
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,429
I'm going to Mosang.

258
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:53,470
No.

259
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,909
Boss, the store has run out of money.

260
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,110
Besides, aren't you
looking for clues about Qiling?

261
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,429
Why are you going to Mosang?

262
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:59,829
That Jin jerk

263
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,270
really tricked me.

264
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,429
The Ma family has long since left,

265
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:04,669
but fortunately,

266
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,230
I found some new clues.

267
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,750
So I'm going to Mosang

268
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:10,189
and see if there are
any business opportunities.

269
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,909
Boss.

270
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,870
Why don't you hurry back?

271
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,510
You know the situation of the store.

272
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,870
We can't even afford
the water and electricity bills.

273
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,429
We don't have money.

274
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,909
Which one of us is the boss?

275
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,549
Hurry up
and sell the goods in the store.

276
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,589
Stay in the store for the next two days
and don't go out.

277
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:25,429
Wait for me
to mail the goods back to you.

278
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:26,390
Bye.

279
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,611
(Dejia)

280
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:49,239
(Mosang)

281
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,500
(Mosang)

282
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,069
Boss, have you arrived in Mosang?

283
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,390
How's Mosang?

284
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:44,990
I heard it's quite lively over there.

285
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,189
Did you find a lot of things?

286
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,110
I found some antiques here.

287
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,549
What about news
about the Ma family and Qiling?

288
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,390
I didn't find anything.

289
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,470
Give me a second.

290
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,909
There's a post office next to me.

291
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,030
I'll mail the antiques back to you

292
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
after they pack them up.

293
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,350
And book me another flight ticket.

294
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,589
Okay.

295
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,110
Okay, bye.

296
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,750
Boss.

297
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,270
I'll go to the post office next door.

298
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,270
Help me pack them up.

299
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,470
Okay.

300
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,270
Hello.

301
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:32,870
I've filled up everything.

302
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,630
Wuzhou.

303
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,750
Hello.

304
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,910
I would like to ask

305
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,710
who painted this oil painting.

306
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,030
Chen Xuehan!

307
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,109
I'd like to ask

308
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,069
if you painted this painting.

309
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,829
Do you know this person?

310
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,549
Why do you ask?

311
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,589
He's my friend.

312
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,230
I've been looking for him.

313
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,589
You got the wrong person.

314
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,829
The original version of this painting
was painted decades ago.

315
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,069
You probably weren't born yet.

316
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,670
Original?

317
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,470
Did you copy it?

318
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,829
Where's the original painting?

319
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,430
That's where I saw this painting.

320
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,869
If you want to know more,

321
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,069
you can ask the practitioners there.

322
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,149
What place is that?

323
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,750
That's Jila Spiritual Retreat.

324
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,069
That's where I copied the painting.

325
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,270
300.

326
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
I'll take you there.

327
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,510
This spiritual retreat

328
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,030
is inaccessible to non-locals.

329
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,109
Has anything strange happened here?

330
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,510
Or is there anything special

331
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,750
about that spiritual retreat?

332
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,190
Nothing strange happened.

333
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,589
The only strange thing

334
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:30,710
is that those practitioners

335
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,950
insisted that I copy the painting.

336
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,510
Why?

337
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,270
Practitioner can see karma.

338
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,910
He asked me to paint, so I painted it.

339
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,910
There's no reason.

340
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,670
He can see
everything after that painting.

341
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,710
I can't.

342
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,270
All I know is

343
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,270
that person was an honored guest
at the spiritual retreat.

344
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,750
The original painting

345
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,470
was painted by a major practitioner

346
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,270
before the guest left Mosang.

347
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,420
(Jila Spiritual Retreat)

348
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,069
Sir.

349
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,190
We have a guest for Mr. Yu Da.

350
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,950
Okay, come with me.

351
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:33,950
Thank you.

352
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,270
Sir.

353
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,030
Close the door and come in.

354
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:13,750
Hello, Mr. Yu.

355
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:15,789
Sir.

356
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,860
(Yu Da)

357
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,750
Where are you from?

358
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,950
What can I do for you?

359
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:24,069
I'm from Wuzhou.

360
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,910
I want to ask

361
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,629
about an oil painting.

362
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:31,990
The person in the painting

363
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,589
is my friend.

364
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,389
I'd like to know

365
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:36,109
why he's here.

366
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:37,990
Sir.

367
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:40,549
You'll like this.

368
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,950
Thank you.

369
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,430
This tea is from Wuzhou.

370
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,349
Did you know I would come?

371
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,589
No.

372
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,230
This tea

373
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,270
is a gift from someone else.

374
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,149
It's fate
that you got to drink this tea.

375
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,589
Where are you from?

376
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,149
What can I do for you?

377
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,069
Wuzhou.

378
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,430
I'm from Wuzhou.

379
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,349
The person in the painting

380
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,629
is my friend.

381
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,950
I'd like to know

382
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,510
why he's here.

383
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:48,910
It's fate
that you got to drink this tea.

384
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,549
Just like how you saw

385
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,230
this oil painting.

386
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,190
So

387
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,230
do you know him or not?

388
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:09,990
Mr. Yu.

389
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,309
Mr. Yu.

390
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,629
Zhang Qiling.

391
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,069
Is your friend Zhang Qiling?

392
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,710
Yes.

393
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,789
Zhang Qiling's my friend.

394
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,710
Do you know anything about him?

395
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:05,990
Can you tell me about him?

396
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,149
The first time I saw him

397
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,510
was a long time ago.

398
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,060
(Many Years Ago)

399
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,860
(Yu Da in Childhood)

400
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,950
Where are you from?

401
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:01,230
I'm from the mountains.

402
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:02,629
Are you

403
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,549
from the village across the mountain?

404
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:05,910
No.

405
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,230
Deep down there.

406
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,629
You must be joking.

407
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,230
How did someone come from the cliff...

408
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:57,910
Why did you stop at our door?

409
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,270
It's warm here.

410
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,030
Let me warm myself up.

411
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:05,109
I'll leave soon.

412
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,470
It's getting dark.

413
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:29,829
It's warmer inside.

414
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:32,349
Why don't you go in and take a rest?

415
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,750
Have a cup of tea.

416
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:37,149
All right.

417
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,270
This way, Sir.

418
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,230
Are there 127 rooms

419
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,589
in your spiritual retreat?

420
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,470
Do you mind

421
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,309
if I take a look at each of them?

422
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:35,069
Please come with me.

423
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:03,750
I remember this place.

424
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,069
I probably came here

425
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,190
a long time ago.

426
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,270
I seem to have left something for myself

427
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,829
in a room here.

428
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:38,230
(We searched room after room.)

429
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:43,149
(I was a little skeptical
about him at first.)

430
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,309
(It was not
until we arrived at that room)

431
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,430
(that I believed)

432
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,750
(he had been here before.)

433
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,109
(And he knows this place
better than we do.)

434
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:58,149
Who is this?

435
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,589
So who is that dead body?

436
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,389
Mr. Yu.

437
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,069
Where was I?

438
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,670
You just mentioned

439
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,069
a dead body. That person...

440
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,470
I remember it now.

441
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:36,589
He said that person

442
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,589
was a friend of his.

443
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,789
This is Deren.

444
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,270
He was my friend.

445
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:43,990
I didn't expect him

446
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,950
to die here.

447
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,829
Deren?

448
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,430
We don't have this person
in our spiritual retreat.

449
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,589
Please clean up this place

450
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,910
and have someone bury Deren properly.

451
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:12,389
I'm going to stay here.

452
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,389
(The sudden appearance
of the practitioner Deren)

453
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,349
(made me believe)

454
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:20,389
(that Zhang Qiling)

455
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,629
(must have some special connection
with this place.)

456
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,030
(I did some research)

457
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,910
(and found something even weirder.)

458
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,470
(Since the completion
of the spiritual retreat,)

459
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,190
(there will be
a practitioner named Deren)

460
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,869
(in each generation of practitioner.)

461
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,389
(It was not until this generation)

462
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,389
(that the name Deren)

463
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,430
(disappeared from the name list.)

464
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,190
(Every Deren)

465
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,109
(will have a disciple named Deren.)

466
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,549
(The name Deren seems to)

467
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,869
(have a special meaning
to the spiritual retreat.)

468
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,710
(There will be someone named Deren)

469
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,710
(in every generation of practitioners.)

470
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,710
(The Deren who became a mummy)

471
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,990
(is probably the last Deren.)

472
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:19,389
(But why did he die in that room)

473
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:21,309
(without anyone noticing)

474
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,670
(and without any disciples?)

475
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,549
(What happened?)

476
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,950
(Is this really)

477
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:31,990
(an ordinary spiritual retreat?)

478
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,430
(I started doubting.)

479
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,349
(At that time,)

480
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:39,629
(Zhang Qiling had already settled down)

481
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,109
(in the spiritual retreat.)

482
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,149
(To clear up my doubts,)

483
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:44,629
(I found Zhang Qiling.)

484
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,109
(Unexpectedly, he didn't know either.)

485
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:50,510
(He told me)

486
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,430
(he has a disease.)

487
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,190
(Every once in a while)

488
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:58,789
(he forgets everything
that happened before.)

489
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,430
(He only remembers some fragments.)

490
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,470
(He has been looking
for answers to these fragments,)

491
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,030
(wanting to find his past.)

492
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,950
(After much effort,)

493
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:13,723
(Deren records Zhang Qiling's memory)

494
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:16,069
(we finally pieced together)

495
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:20,910
(some of his memories here long ago.)

496
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:23,350
(Many years ago,)

497
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,510
(he was preparing to
enter the snow mountain.)

498
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,669
(He made a promise)

499
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,910
(with the last Deren)

500
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:32,549
(before going to the snow mountain.)

501
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:34,149
(Soon)

502
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,669
(he will come out of the snow mountain)

503
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,790
(with a huge secret.)

504
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:39,189
(But he may
have forgotten these secrets)

505
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:42,790
(by the time he returned.)

506
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,589
(He'll become extremely confused.)

507
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:46,709
I'll be back.

508
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,510
I'll wait for your return.

509
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,709
(So ​​Deren had to wait for him
in the spiritual retreat.)

510
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,030
(When he comes back,)

511
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,870
(he'll describe everything
that happened at the snow mountain)

512
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:00,069
(before he forgets it.)

513
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,629
(But they could all be fragments.)

514
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,310
(They need to be recorded
and sorted out by Deren.)

515
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:09,749
When Zhang Qiling
left the snow mountain,

516
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:12,549
Deren has already passed away.

517
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,629
He didn't even have time

518
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,790
to find a successor.

519
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,030
Zhang Qiling might be worried

520
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:23,589
that he would forget
the few remaining memory fragments.

521
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,830
That's why

522
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,390
he asked me to take over
Deren's job temporarily

523
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,669
after meeting me.

524
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,669
He told me the reason

525
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:35,629
for coming to the snow mountain.

526
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,269
What's the reason?

527
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,709
Mr. Yu.

528
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,709
Where was I?

529
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,269
It's too hard after being in the sun.
I can't even chew it.

530
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,910
He told me a lot,

531
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:15,109
but I don't remember

532
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,990
after all this time.

533
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,189
Please

534
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,310
recall your memory.

535
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,269
Please.

536
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:28,589
Well...

537
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,470
I took over for Deren

538
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,629
after he died.

539
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,030
I've put away his memory scrolls

540
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,430
that I've recorded

541
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,510
and organized.

542
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,310
It's in his room.

543
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,709
Go to his room

544
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,910
if you want to know.

545
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,109
This is Zhang Qiling's room.

546
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,830
The scrolls are in the room.

547
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:07,790
