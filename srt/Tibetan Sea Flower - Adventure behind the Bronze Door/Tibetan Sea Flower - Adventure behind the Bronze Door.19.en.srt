00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 19=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,350
Stop what you're doing right now.

5
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,440
Otherwise...

6
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,470
I'll kill you.

7
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,470
Stop what you're doing right now.

8
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,440
Otherwise,

9
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,880
I'll kill you.

10
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,680
Stop!

11
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,400
Zhang Haike is right there.

12
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,910
The gas inside is corrosive.

13
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,950
Take one more step,

14
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,230
and he'll die.

15
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,190
Let Zhang Haike go.

16
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,350
Or else you will die.

17
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,099
Zhang Qiling.

18
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,750
Don't make me do it.

19
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,400
Back then,

20
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,499
you got my wife killed,

21
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,190
you ruined my research.

22
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,950
Even if I have to die today,

23
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,390
I'm going to take your friend
with me to the grave.

24
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,590
You're still the same old you.

25
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,000
You haven't changed at all.

26
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,630
You still care about...

27
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,000
those useless friends of yours.

28
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm really curious though.

29
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,440
How did you come out
from the Bronze Door?

30
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,390
Don't you care about
the ultimate secret anymore?

31
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,320
Wasn't that the thing
you cared about the most?

32
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,710
Don't come near!

33
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll say this one last time.

34
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,920
Let Zhang Haike and the rest go.

35
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,560
Also, where is Fatty?

36
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,120
Why?

37
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,710
Wu Xie.

38
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,000
Why?

39
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,360
Be decisive.

40
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,920
The people of Zhang Family
are out there.

41
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,360
It's the same.

42
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,000
Both you and Zhang Qiling are the same.

43
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,880
But no matter what,

44
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,710
the final victor...

45
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,120
will be me.

46
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,830
Get out here, quick! We have to run!

47
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,689
Zhang Haixing and Fatty are in there.

48
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,160
Go and save them, quickly.

49
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,800
I'll take you out first.
Then I'll go get them.

50
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,099
I was able to save you just now.
I can manage on my own.

51
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,830
You hurry up and go save them.

52
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,640
You take care.

53
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,110
I let Qiling down again.

54
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,320
You should worry about yourself first.

55
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,190
I really don't get it, Wu Xie.

56
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,230
Why must you save everyone?

57
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,830
I don't know.

58
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,640
Guess it's my instinct.

59
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,459
You could've gotten
everything you wanted

60
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,920
if you had given up on Zhang Haike.

61
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,760
My friends are coming.

62
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,830
Pass them a message for me.

63
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,800
That I'm sorry.

64
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,400
Tell them to play rock-paper-scissors

65
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,440
and choose the next Night King killer.

66
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,110
I can't do it anymore.

67
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm exhausted.

68
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,350
I can't take another step.

69
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,190
Me neither.

70
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,680
Would you believe it?

71
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,070
If the two of us die,

72
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,870
Zhang Qiling is not going to remember

73
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,070
why we did all these for.

74
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,040
That's not for sure.

75
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,920
He'll remember me.

76
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,440
Nonsense.

77
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,920
He remembered one time.

78
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,920
I won.

79
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,070
Idiot.

80
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,830
Jiuri.

81
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,470
Can I have these materials?

82
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,990
(March 8th, 1930, Mosang.)
He went there three days ago.

83
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,400
He probably hasn't gone far.

84
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,760
(You can wait for the patriarch,)

85
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,040
(but I can't.)

86
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,240
Naive.

87
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,630
Naive.

88
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,520
He's awake.

89
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,910
I'm glad you're fine.

90
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,520
I was so worried.

91
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,870
You pretending to be Qiling was genius.

92
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,040
You must have
been worried about me, huh?

93
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,899
They've left.

94
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,070
Rest assured.

95
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,870
Nobody noticed you were Wu Xie.

96
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,720
What happened to Zhang Jiuri?

97
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,760
He's dead.

98
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,670
And Zhang Nian?

99
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,480
He left.

100
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,019
Knowing him,

101
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,430
once he goes into hiding,

102
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,760
I doubt anyone can find him.

103
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,110
Thank you.

104
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,739
The ones you should thank

105
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,320
are the people of Zhang Family.

106
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,070
However,

107
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,110
this is the last time
they're helping Zhang Qiling.

108
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,049
Next time...

109
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,070
Don't worry.

110
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,720
There won't be a next time.

111
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,089
Cut to the chase.

112
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,720
Let's settle this matter.

113
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,049
Okay,

114
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,430
we lost.

115
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,040
What is it you want?

116
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,590
Name a price.

117
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,520
You're cocky for a loser.

118
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,129
We won't hold back then.

119
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,590
One million per head.

120
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,800
You're hairier,
so you're more expensive.

121
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,809
Ten million.

122
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,899
Add them all up
and transfer the money to our account.

123
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,040
No problem.

124
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,670
Good to know.

125
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,760
You Denaxis think you're the boss
because you're rich?

126
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,350
Where is the key?

127
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,350
Verification successful.

128
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,430
Is it the real Heavenly Staff?

129
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,499
Where's the guarantee?
Is there a certificate of authenticity?

130
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,760
I'll take a look.

131
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,459
We have conducted

132
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,480
a comprehensive study on it.

133
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,240
The material is akin to bronze.

134
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,590
And it is a few thousand years old.

135
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,960
But aside from that,

136
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,040
there's nothing else special about it.

137
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,590
Neither does it have any lethal power.

138
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,529
If you expect to beat
the Night King with this,

139
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,200
that won't be possible.

140
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,910
Hence we're thinking

141
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,110
that perhaps it's a keepsake

142
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,560
with not much actual value.

143
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,280
It's real.

144
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,089
This belongs to the Zhang Family,

145
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,720
so we should keep it.

146
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,630
The patriarch left
the Heavenly Staff to Wu Xie.

147
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,000
Give it to him.

148
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,670
You're not going
to listen to your brother?

149
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,800
You two should be on the same page.

150
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,979
He told you to give it to him.

151
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,019
Your brother will get you a new one.

152
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,720
Don't push your luck.

153
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,800
Good girl.

154
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,150
Regarding the Heavenly Staff,

155
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,830
we will do our own research.

156
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,590
I'm very curious.

157
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,659
We didn't know

158
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,520
you had the Heavenly Staff.

159
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,800
But you revealed it to me so openly.

160
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,459
And you even handed it over

161
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,350
without a second thought.

162
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,590
Are you perhaps plotting something?

163
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,520
Mr. Wu.

164
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,129
After this whole ordeal,
I have come to understand

165
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,499
why Zhang Qiling insisted that
you had to be the one

166
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,849
to kill the Night King.

167
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,630
You are indeed talented.

168
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,849
Spending 10 million in exchange
for this lesson

169
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,040
is well worth it in our opinion.

170
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,390
Our bet is still on, right?

171
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,430
What bet?

172
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,960
What bet?

173
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,320
It happened as predicted.

174
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,110
I told him

175
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,529
you'd take care
of Zhang Nian, no problem.

176
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,800
He didn't believe me.

177
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,849
I said you just need

178
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,670
to send me back safe and sound,

179
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,200
and we'll bury the hatchet.

180
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,110
Simple as that.

181
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,200
That's it?

182
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,520
That's it.

183
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,289
Is that it?

184
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,520
Of course, there were
some added conditions.

185
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,670
If we win,

186
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,459
the previous contract

187
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,369
will continue to be in effect.

188
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,499
You will not short-change me.

189
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,590
Right?

190
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,609
So, Mr. Wu, we will continue

191
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,329
our expedition into snow mountains.

192
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,320
Plus, I'm willing
to take another step back.

193
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,769
You can use all my resources, funds,
scientific research equipment,

194
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,609
and weapons as you wish.

195
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,830
No.

196
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,289
You caused the deaths
of so many Zhang members.

197
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,280
You should turn yourself in.

198
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,350
No tricks.

199
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,350
What happened that the Zhang Family base
was the result of Zhang Nian's own actions.

200
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,979
I was only informed

201
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,520
after the fact.

202
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,129
The conversation recording
can prove I'm telling the truth.

203
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,569
Also, we've been cooperating

204
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,800
with the local police investigation.

205
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,800
The outcome will be known soon.

206
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,320
Mr. Wu.

207
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,150
Have a good think about it.

208
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,200
Our goals are not aligned.

209
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,939
We should stop wasting our time here.

210
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,769
Let's go.

211
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,040
Mr. Wu,

212
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,609
there's something else
you should think about.

213
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,630
How will you go up snow mountains?

214
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,110
You don't have anymore manpower.

215
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,720
You're likely to die

216
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,529
before you even get close.

217
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,870
Who are you trying to scare?

218
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,939
You're the loser here.

219
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,280
So stop showing off.

220
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,699
We've seen and done all sorts.

221
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,089
Peril is part and parcel of our lives.

222
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,720
I bet you people
with your pathetic firearms

223
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,019
would bolt at the sight of danger.

224
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,560
You guys are mere cannon fodder.

225
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,670
Mr. Wang,

226
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,630
it's true many of our men
became cannon fodder.

227
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,280
Many of our researchers died back then.

228
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,369
But they brought out

229
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,720
very valuable information
with their deaths.

230
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,390
That allowed us to develop a device

231
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,720
that could take on the Night King.

232
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,240
What device?

233
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,179
So long as you agree to work with us,

234
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,670
you'll be privy to the information.

235
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,910
Mr. Wu.

236
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,560
With the device,

237
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,960
the expedition into snow mountains
will be much safer.

238
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,699
With your personality,
I doubt you'd want

239
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,609
to put your friends' lives in danger, no?

240
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,480
That's enough. Stop talking.

241
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,200
He can be useful.

242
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,329
We will use him.

243
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,089
Right now, we have a commander
without an army.

244
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,760
Right? The Zhang Family
is out of the picture.

245
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,019
We can't get the survivors

246
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,329
to strengthen our team, right?

247
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,459
Here's a guy.

248
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,289
He has resources.

249
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,289
So we'll make use of him
to get to snow mountains.

250
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,470
We'll figure out the rest
after we find the Night King. Right?

251
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,289
Take advantage of him.

252
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,899
Wu Xie, let me remind you.

253
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,809
With him around,

254
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,699
it's like having a ticking time bomb.

255
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,609
Besides,

256
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,769
you should know.

257
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,739
He cannot be controlled.

258
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,329
Mr. Wu.

259
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,452
We share the same goal
of reaching the destination.

260
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,313
With that in mind,
neither of us have a better choice.

261
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,870
Cooperation is the best option.

262
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,720
We can talk after the outcome
of the investigation is out.

263
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,480
Let us go, Fatty.

264
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,150
I wonder what was on his mind
at the last moment.

265
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,089
We saw him as a crazy lunatic

266
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,000
who tried to kill us a few times.

267
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,499
In the end though,

268
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,040
I don't know how to judge him.

269
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,800
Jiuri might be crazy.

270
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,320
But he was never out to kill.

271
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,590
If not, we would've died
when we were down there.

272
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,760
A Zhang lives a long life.

273
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,000
Sometimes living too long

274
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,430
isn't necessarily a good thing.

275
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,609
When you've lived so long,

276
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,870
you could forget what it is
you're living for.

277
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,560
I think Jiuri was all the while
looking for a reason to continue living.

278
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,630
At the same time, he was looking
for a chance to die.

279
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,350
Perhaps this

280
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,960
is the best outcome for him.

281
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,430
If that's the case,

282
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,480
then death

283
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,760
should be a relief for him.

284
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,350
Haike,

285
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,070
what do you think?

286
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,630
Every person
has their own ethos and choice.

287
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,390
I'm not in the position to judge.

288
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,430
You've actually made your judgment.

289
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,280
You just don't want to accept it.

290
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,800
Thank you.

291
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,040
You have the Heavenly Staff.

292
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,480
Did you find out anything?

293
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,000
It doesn't look like a weapon.

294
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,800
I didn't find any mechanisms in it.

295
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,219
You said before

296
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,179
that the Zhangs used it
to deal with the Night King.

297
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,670
How did they do it?

298
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,129
I only saw it once before
during the wilding.

299
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,760
I've not seen it again.

300
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,520
That thing is full of mystery.

301
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,350
It had been in the ancient monument
for nearly a hundred years.

302
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,350
The clan did not leave
any records on it.

303
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,699
So I do not know exactly

304
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,870
how it is used.

305
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,960
Then what's the use of us
bringing the Staff into snow mountains?

306
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,590
For Night King to use as a toothpick?

307
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,499
Qiling said it, the Heavenly Staff
can deal with the Night King.

308
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,129
I'm sure it has its uses.

309
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,019
Maybe we'll know what to do with it

310
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,630
when we come to a certain point.

311
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,089
So,

312
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,560
how do you judge this whole matter now?

313
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,240
Which matter do you mean?

314
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,960
What the patriarch entrusted you to do.

315
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,910
Now, I do believe that

316
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,699
he needs help from me.

317
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,110
And he's come to the right guy.

318
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,870
You rarely put your trust in others.

319
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,830
But now you believe him wholeheartedly?

320
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,830
Not wholeheartedly.

321
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,350
But I know,

322
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,520
if the Night King
is not dealt with completely,

323
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,240
there will be people like Zhang Nian,
constantly stirring up trouble.

324
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,419
Even if he hadn't entrusted me,

325
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,179
I have a duty to resolve these matters.

326
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,939
Plus, we'll be able to know more

327
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,219
about Qiling's past memories.

328
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,040
It's killing two birds with one stone.

329
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,760
We've finally cleared the obstacles.

330
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,979
Now,

331
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,800
the real danger is about to start.

332
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,960
I understand.

333
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,459
Moreover,

334
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,390
we have you guys' help, right?

335
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,459
Feng said Qiling had left
important information for me

336
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,280
at the place where
the Heavenly Staff was kept.

337
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,000
Although that place was destroyed,

338
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,870
I'd still like to take a look.

339
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,160
Perhaps I can find new clues.

340
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,030
(Qiling.)

341
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,280
(All your memories are gone.)

342
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,550
(Qiling.)

343
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,510
(What is it exactly
you wish to tell me?)

344
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,510
After becoming the patriarch,

345
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,200
you must stay in
the Zhang Family Ancient Tower

346
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,640
for three full years
before you can leave.

347
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,080
Our Tianshou will be healed,

348
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,350
bur yours will deteriorate.

349
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,280
And it will never heal.

350
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,510
Once you leave,

351
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,030
you will receive the first mission
as the patriarch.

352
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,800
Why is it that I will never be healed?

353
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,470
And what is the first mission?

354
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,430
There are two types of Tianshou.

355
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,910
Ours is considered a poison.

356
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,600
It can be cured with an antidote.

357
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,720
Whereas, on your journey
to becoming the patriarch,

358
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,819
you will be inflicted
with the other kind,

359
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,870
a more serious Tianshou illness.

360
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,859
We call it

361
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,280
Jueshou.

362
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,080
Jueshou.

363
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,910
Jueshou is in fact
a more painful ailment.

364
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,689
The moment you insert
the Heavenly Staff to turn on the mechanism,

365
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,689
you will immediately be smitten
with the illness.

366
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,019
All your senses will be stimulated,

367
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,979
becoming highly sensitive.

368
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,019
But your consciousness
will become extremely confused.

369
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,240
There is the possibility
of sudden death.

370
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,830
Even if you survive,

371
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,640
Jueshou illness has no cure.

372
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,779
It will recur

373
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,379
throughout your life

374
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,510
until the day you die.

375
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,160
At the same time,

376
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,089
the spread-out Zhang Family Noses,

377
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,550
which are the Family's
spies on long-term assignments,

378
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,680
will have no idea what had happened.

379
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,129
They will still send

380
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,950
requests for the Zhang Family's
just intervention to this place.

381
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,550
This is the patriarch's mission.

382
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,720
You will have to complete it
on your own.

383
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,160
Do as you see fit.

384
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,160
Are you going to let the Noses
fend for themselves?

385
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,830
Or will you save everybody?

386
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,760
I'm not important.

387
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,990
You'll likely spend a long time

388
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,760
finding out your background.

389
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,240
You'll need to live for a long time.

390
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,080
So it's up to you.

391
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,939
(Zhang Qiling left the Family Ancient Tower)
In certain matters,

392
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,300
(for the first time in his third year as the patriarch.)
even a Zhang Family patriarch

393
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,870
would die.

394
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,120
(Qiling left the Tower after
staying there for three full years.)

395
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,880
(He went back to the Zhang Family
Ancient Residence.)

396
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,430
(All the Zhang Family members have left.)

397
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,600
(In those three years,)

398
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,870
(Qiling suffered through
Jueshou illness on his own.)

399
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,760
(He managed to survive.)

400
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,350
(He read all the records
and information in it)

401
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,550
(in search of clues on his birth.)

402
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,910
(But Jueshou illness caused
his memory to become jumbled.)

403
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,390
(The assignments
sent by Zhang Family Noses)

404
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,430
(and the clues on Qiling's background)

405
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,979
(became mixed in the depths of his mind,)

406
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,600
(randomly surfacing.)

407
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,640
(Qiling was unable to discern)

408
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,600
(whether they were
Zhang Family assignments)

409
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,640
(or clues related to his background.)

410
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,760
(He could only explore one by one)

411
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,390
(and complete the assignments,)

412
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,680
(waiting for the day when the truth
would finally come to light.)

413
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,129
(This time, the Tianshou assignment)

414
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,870
(was related to the Night King
Devours The Sky.)

415
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,830
(It was a message sent from snow mountains)

416
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,160
(by a man named Dong Can.)

417
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,320
(Dong Can)

418
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,720
(was a spy sent by the Family to investigate
the Night King Devours The Sky.)

419
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,510
(After entering the hinterland
of snow mountains,)

420
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,529
(he discovered many rotting remains)

421
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,680
(of a spherical creature in the snow.)

422
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,200
(Later, this man)

423
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,870
(disappeared without a trace.)

424
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,390
(Thus, Qiling headed for snow mountains)

425
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,470
(in search of Dong Can's whereabouts.)

426
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,720
(On the way,)

427
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,120
(he came across a group
of Denaxi people.)

428
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,080
Wait. Wait here.

429
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,910
Let's stop here.

430
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,800
Friend.

431
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,870
Are you heading to Nilaisi, too?

432
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,910
It's rare to find

433
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,680
a lone person taking this route.

434
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,600
I don't work as a guide nor translator.

435
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,830
No, no.

436
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,990
You misunderstand.

437
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,350
I didn't approach you to talk business.

438
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,430
I'm only looking for people

439
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,800
who are familiar with this route,

440
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,320
to help us with our site survey.

441
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm sure your horse
would appreciate this chunk of salt.

442
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,510
Why don't we have a chat?

443
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,200
Let your horse get something nice.

444
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,760
You seem to love animals

445
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,640
more than humans.

446
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,720
The horse needs to replenish energy.

447
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,390
Is that your pet?

448
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,979
Do you

449
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,910
take this route often?

450
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,120
I don't remember.

451
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,390
Seems like your memory is bad.

452
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,160
You're not that old.

453
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,120
How come you've got such a problem?

454
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,510
Is it because of the environment here?

455
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,640
Because of the clan.

456
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,950
A hereditary condition?

457
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,160
How much farther?

458
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,200
It's beyond that mountain.

459
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,320
Probably seven more days.

460
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,600
But I heard there's a blizzard
in the mountains right now.

461
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,240
It's dangerous for you to go alone.

462
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,510
Why don't you hike with our group?

463
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,200
We're still short of members.

464
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,950
The people who have gone ahead said

465
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,950
that we need at least a dozen people
to go up the mountain.

466
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,510
After reaching Nilaisi,

467
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,280
we're going to go deeper
into snow mountains to do research.

468
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,910
If you know any friends in Mosang,

469
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,979
could you maybe help us contact

470
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,760
the local horsemen there?

471
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,830
We need help transporting the stuff
we find in the mountains to the transfer hub.

472
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,510
We're willing to pay you good money.

473
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,830
You wish to go deep into snow mountains?

474
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,950
