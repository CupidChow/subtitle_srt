=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 15=

4
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,420
Where are we?

5
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,420
Why is there a tomb over there?

6
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,820
Once you enter the place,

7
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,020
you'll find

8
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,820
the monster box and mud hump.

9
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,820
The monster box is on top.

10
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,260
Could this be the mud hump
that Wang Jinyuan

11
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,930
was referring to?

12
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,930
It's made of cloth.

13
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,540
Judging from the design,

14
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,140
it should be a venue in Nilaisi

15
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,860
where traditional magic was performed.

16
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,050
This is the place indeed.

17
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,450
This is the last key.

18
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,580
Wu Xie!

19
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,260
This way!

20
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,180
What's wrong? What happened?

21
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,210
Over here!

22
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,500
Take cover!

23
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,330
Feng's men are here!

24
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,530
Hurry and take the key!

25
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,740
Grenade!

26
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,650
Mister,

27
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,700
don't move.

28
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,140
Mister, you're seriously injured.

29
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,820
Okay?

30
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,330
You have to lie down.

31
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,330
Okay.

32
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,580
I have a question.

33
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,330
Where's my friend?

34
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,180
Fatty,

35
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,970
where is he?

36
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,770
I'm so sorry. I can't understand you.

37
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,090
You have to lie down now.

38
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,020
Okay.

39
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,020
I just want to know

40
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,260
where my friend is.

41
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,180
He's a little bit fat.

42
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,260
Mr. Wang. Where is he?

43
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,290
Okay. I'll figure it out.

44
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,940
But you have to lie down.

45
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,140
I'll try to find him.

46
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,700
No, I don't care!

47
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,450
I just want to look for my friend!

48
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,970
My friend, Mr. Wang!

49
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,770
Fatty!

50
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,500
We'll check it for you.

51
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,140
Fatty!

52
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,770
Let me do it.

53
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,530
Fatty...

54
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,260
Was this what you meant by fine?

55
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,060
Under such circumstances,

56
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,090
we would've been dead meat for sure.

57
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,650
Where are the keys?

58
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,970
I gave them the keys

59
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,180
to save our lives.

60
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,410
Now, Feng has gathered
all the required keys.

61
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,180
He has obtained the Heavenly Staff.

62
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,940
What exactly happened?

63
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,650
Can you explain it to me?

64
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,380
To be honest,

65
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,060
we already lost.

66
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,620
Feng has already entered the Snowy Peak

67
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,770
with the Heavenly Staff.

68
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,700
So, are you going to give up?

69
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,140
What else can we do?

70
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,140
The Denaxi people
are credible and trustworthy.

71
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,090
Feng has already transferred
the money to your account.

72
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,890
You should return to Wuzhou.

73
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,460
Doctor.

74
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,500
When will he wake up?

75
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,290
I'm not sure.

76
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,890
Can I transfer him to Wuzhou's hospital?

77
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,220
Sure.

78
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,170
Hello.

79
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,170
Sir, your car has arrived.

80
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,100
Okay. Wait a minute.

81
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,140
Okay.

82
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,170
Who are we following now?

83
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,770
You'll follow me.

84
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,020
Are you planning to sponge off me
for the rest of your life?

85
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,140
Naive!

86
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,770
Hold tight!

87
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,690
For Qiling's sake.

88
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,460
For Qiling's sake.

89
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,220
Let's get rich!

90
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,050
Wang Meng.

91
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm not leaving.

92
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,140
Find a few more guides for me.

93
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,620
I'm going to enter Snowy Peak.

94
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,140
You've passed the test.

95
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,020
No matter who you are,

96
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,650
thank you for what you did.

97
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,570
(It's another hexagonal bell.)

98
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,290
(Although these bodies)

99
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,020
(have all been decapitated,)

100
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,100
(all the shapes of the wounds
are different.)

101
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,890
(It's as if they were killed
by different traps.)

102
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,220
(If so, why are
all of their bodies here?)

103
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,220
(There's a total of seven bodies.)

104
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
(All of them are decapitated.)

105
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,050
The seven human heads in the boxes

106
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,980
are all impersonators of Wu Xie

107
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,570
that we've seen through.

108
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,690
(All of them,)

109
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,050
(they're actually...)

110
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,650
(What exactly is going on?)

111
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,980
You failed the test.

112
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,690
(Qiling's test is too ruthless.)

113
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,220
(If I wasn't confident enough
to enter Snowy Peak,)

114
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,890
(see through the illusion,
and pass the test,)

115
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,020
(I would've been the eighth victim.)

116
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,220
(But how were these people)

117
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,570
(sent here to accept the test?)

118
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,620
The Night King will be revived soon.

119
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,140
Our patriarch wants you

120
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,650
to help him deal with the Night King.

121
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,890
We're here to assist you

122
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,930
to complete the mission,

123
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,460
test you,

124
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,890
and escort you to Snowy Peak.

125
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,650
What's the next step?

126
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,980
We need to head to Dejia,
Nilaisi's capital,

127
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,220
to retrieve one item.

128
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,020
Our patriarch left that item for you.

129
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,770
Therefore, you're the only person
who can retrieve it.

130
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,690
Congratulations.

131
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,980
You've passed the test.

132
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,380
Few people can wake up
from the illusion without help.

133
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,050
Since you could do so,

134
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,860
that means

135
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,020
you've experienced

136
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,140
an illusion test
that's even stronger than this.

137
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,740
My name is Wu Xie.

138
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,380
I'm here to deal with the Night King.

139
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,220
Let's skip the keys, okay?

140
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,340
Forget it. Let's go through
the procedures.

141
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,410
(Don't tell me)

142
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,220
(I'm the eighth person
who was sent here?)

143
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,850
(This is bad.)

144
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,980
(If that's the case,)

145
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
(Fatty will be in danger
if he's with Zhang Haike.)

146
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,090
(Since Zhang Haike)

147
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,810
(and his men haven't
retrieved the key here,)

148
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,180
(that means they're still
in the dark for now.)

149
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,180
Fatty?

150
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,500
You made me worried.
I was looking for you.

151
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,050
I thought you were

152
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,660
captured by a monster
and was turned into its bride.

153
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,980
Are you okay?

154
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,980
Are you okay?

155
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,020
Are you truly Fatty?

156
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,180
Who else can I be, then?

157
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,220
Did I lose weight?

158
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,020
All the best of luck?

159
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,900
Wealth and prosperity.

160
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,850
This isn't an illusion, huh?

161
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,570
What? Were you caught
in another illusion?

162
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,810
Are you okay?

163
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,570
When I was inside,

164
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,500
I saw a tomb. And...

165
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,770
What's taking them so long?

166
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,900
Where are the keys?

167
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,770
Where's Feng?

168
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,770
Have you guys retrieved the keys?

169
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,770
No.

170
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,740
Zhang Jiuri attacked Haixing.

171
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,090
He destroyed all the traps.

172
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,500
Even the mighty elder sister
loses sometimes, huh?

173
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,660
Feng's men are already here.

174
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,050
Zhang Nian is with them.

175
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,570
Therefore, we have to leave immediately.

176
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,740
They'll catch up to us at any time.

177
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,610
Zhang Nian?

178
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,660
He's the guy we used
to play outdoors together with.

179
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,810
But this isn't the time for this.

180
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
We need to find the keys first.

181
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,980
On our way here,

182
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,370
we saw the markings
left behind by the patriarch.

183
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,900
The keys should be inside.

184
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,940
Have you guys
made any other discoveries?

185
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,220
Seems like you're still hiding

186
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
a lot of things from me.

187
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,700
What?

188
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,740
It's nothing.

189
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,900
You guys saw Qiling's markings as well.

190
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,530
That means there should be
another key inside.

191
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,740
But I haven't found it yet.

192
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,290
It's a maze inside.

193
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,610
It's easier for us to avoid Feng
if we hide inside.

194
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,370
You should be honest.

195
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,180
It's Qiling's marking.

196
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,530
Over here.

197
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,770
I stopped here just now.

198
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,500
It's made of cloth.

199
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,130
I burned it just now.

200
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,220
There are no snakes inside.

201
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,900
Be careful not to wet your bed tonight.

202
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,530
I won't if there's thunder.

203
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,530
Come on. Feng will catch up to us soon.

204
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,980
Who are they?

205
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,460
These are just dead bodies.

206
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,740
One,

207
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,660
two, three,

208
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,020
four,

209
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,330
five,

210
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,900
six,

211
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,740
seven.

212
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,740
Seven bodies?

213
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,370
What a coincidence.

214
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,220
You used seven human heads

215
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,660
for the test you gave me.

216
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,740
Coincidentally, there are

217
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,020
seven headless bodies here.

218
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,220
In order to get the keys,

219
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,330
you've already done it seven times.

220
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,900
Therefore, I'm your eighth victim.

221
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,020
Actually...

222
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,220
Don't move.

223
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,180
Don't move.

224
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,020
Let's talk it over.

225
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,770
If not, I'll blow up the keys.

226
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,290
What's going on?

227
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,980
What exactly is going on?

228
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,740
You guys are trying to use me
to obtain the keys.

229
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,810
What exactly are you guys up to?

230
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,090
Do they have bells on their bodies?

231
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,220
These bodies have nothing to do with me.

232
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,330
You're my trump card,

233
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,020
not a consumable item.

234
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,370
Why did you think

235
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,130
I handed that important item to you?

236
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,700
Don't try to trick me.

237
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,530
You won't be able to dupe me this time.

238
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,500
Even if you do hang
the bells on my body,

239
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,460
with your skills,

240
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,900
you guys can retrieve them at any time.

241
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,660
Your lie isn't thorough enough.

242
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,370
We can talk this over.

243
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,570
Explain yourself slowly

244
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,770
so that I can understand the situation.

245
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,260
If not,

246
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,740
my friend will be upset.

247
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,610
If so, let's enjoy ourselves

248
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,020
and become the eighth,

249
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,770
ninth, and tenth bodies here.

250
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,740
These bodies

251
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,050
are all Zhang Niangan.

252
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,420
Do you still remember the keys
that Feng obtained?

253
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,500
He was able to retrieve
the patriarch's item

254
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,850
as he received the Zhang family's help.

255
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,220
The person who helped him

256
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,770
was Zhang Nian.

257
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,700
I heard from Zhang Jiuri

258
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,020
that Zhang Nian is here as well.

259
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,260
He was the one who supplied
Feng with his men.

260
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,850
Zhang Jiuri attacked us

261
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,530
under his command as well.

262
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,220
Zhang Nian?

263
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,500
He once played outdoors with

264
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,460
Qiling as well.

265
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,290
So, both Zhang Nian and Zhang Jiuri

266
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,570
were members of the original
Scorpion Team.

267
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,610
Since you guys are friends,

268
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,370
why did they attack us?

269
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,290
You're a crook.

270
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,130
Crook Zhang.

271
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,850
You're pushing the blame on them

272
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,330
since they aren't here.

273
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,460
Of course you can say
whatever you like about them.

274
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,980
Mind your words.

275
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,130
Do you guys think

276
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,420
that I lured Zhang Jiuri here, then?

277
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,660
According to your logic,

278
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,220
I could've used you to obtain the keys.

279
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,090
Why do I need to create
additional trouble for myself?

280
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,700
He can be considered

281
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,770
a variable that's not within
your expectations.

282
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,130
But that can't prove

283
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,020
that you were stating facts.

284
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,700
What about the keys that Feng has?

285
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,700
Anjing Company is capable enough
to purchase Qiu Dekao.

286
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,220
He has at least 100 ways
to obtain the keys.

287
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,420
You're more cautious than I thought.

288
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,460
More like he's harder to deceive
than you thought.

289
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,290
I've been used by too many people
during my journey.

290
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,740
Therefore, you can't deceive me.

291
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,020
And now, I've seen through his trick.

292
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,130
I suggest you

293
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,810
tell me everything.

294
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,980
The best scenario is

295
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,940
that I won't hold it against you.

296
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,700
I might pass the keys to you
and return to Wuzhou.

297
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,770
However...

298
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,850
I have to know the truth.

299
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,740
Everything I told you was true.

300
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,900
But now, since
you've judged me in advance,

301
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,220
you won't believe me

302
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,420
no matter how I try to explain myself.

303
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,500
Besides,

304
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,570
I only know

305
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,810
part of the story.

306
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,370
I can tell you

307
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,740
everything I know.

308
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,180
You can be the judge.

309
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,700
Tell us about it, then.

310
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,020
I'll go out and see
if Feng's men are here.

311
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,700
Wait.

312
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,260
Fatty.

313
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,420
Alright. You guys can go ahead.

314
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,770
Just now, you asked me a question.

315
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,050
You asked us why they attacked us

316
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,130
even though we were friends.

317
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,940
It's because

318
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,700
Zhang Nian hates
the patriarch to the core.

319
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,330
Qiling?

320
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,330
What has this got to do with Qiling?

321
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,290
Back then,

322
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,500
Zhang Nian intended
to find the Night King as well.

323
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,220
However, he had a different goal

324
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,900
from our patriarch.

325
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,220
(There was no news of the patriarch after
he was sent to Zhang Family Ancient Tower.)

326
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,610
(But Zhang Jiuri believed)

327
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,290
(that the patriarch would return.)

328
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,700
(It's because he made a promise
to the Scorpion Team.)

329
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,610
Now, we're the Scorpion Team.

330
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,940
We'll share our wealth and woe together.

331
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,740
Alright!

332
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,570
Punk.

333
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,370
No matter what happens in the future,

334
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,610
you must never abandon your buddies.

335
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,900
Alright.

336
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,220
(After that, we went on
our separate ways.)

337
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,980
(But we hoped
that we could see him again.)

338
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,050
(But the Scorpion Team)

339
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,050
(discovered markings
that resembled the patriarch's markings)

340
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,900
(after four years.)

341
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,770
Jiuri.

342
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,610
Long time no see.

343
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,460
Jiuri.

344
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,900
What are you guys doing here?

345
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,850
Did you guys tail me?

346
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,020
I'm not fond of that.

347
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,940
We followed the markings here.

348
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,770
We thought that punk
left these markings behind.

349
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,850
These were actually
left behind by the patriarch.

350
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,260
There's no difference.

351
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,850
Once he sees these markings,

352
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,370
I'm sure he'll come and find me.

353
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,700
We'll definitely encounter
each other again one day.

354
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,660
You're so naive.

355
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,180
Zhang Nian?

356
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,850
Did you say I was naive?

357
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,220
Didn't you come here yourself?

358
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,420
You're still naive.

359
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,420
You guys were chatting happily just now.

360
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,330
You guys didn't discover me
even though I was in the vicinity.

361
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,700
All of you guys would've been dead

362
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,500
if I were a ruthless killer, you know?

363
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Bragging is the only thing you know.

364
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,460
You think you can deal with us?

365
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,700
You didn't change at all.

366
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,700
Jiuri,

367
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,610
have you been

368
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,130
traveling around

369
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,290
and leaving behind these markings

370
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,260
that point to this particular location?

371
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:07,900
That's right.

372
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,850
Where are we?

373
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,940
Dejia.

374
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,130
Why did you choose this place?

375
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,420
The climate here is warm and gentle.

376
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,570
The views are excellent.

377
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,850
Our patriarch

378
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,050
can start anew here.

379
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
It does sound like

380
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,740
an excellent place.

381
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,460
Are you guys going to stay here as well?

382
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,290
Sure. I want to expand my horizons.

383
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,180
If we can detect these markings,

384
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm sure our patriarch can do the same.

385
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,740
I told you guys
that this was a great idea.

386
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,850
You're just waiting for him
to come here.

387
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,020
You can choose not to wait here.

388
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,570
I didn't say that.

389
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,500
I just think that the climate here
is pretty good.

390
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,570
Is there anywhere we can stay?

391
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,460
Inside the city.

392
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,220
Haike,

393
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,090
let's enter the city, then.

394
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,130
(After the Scorpion Team was reunited,)

395
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,900
(they once spent their days peacefully.)

396
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,050
(All of them were looking forward
to seeing the patriarch again)

397
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,020
(until a certain incident.)

398
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,090
(It caused Zhang Nian's inner desires)

399
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,740
(to take root and grow within him.)

400
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,220
(Three Months Later)

401
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,810
Seems like the markings are untouched.

402
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,530
That means the patriarch wasn't here.

403
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,810
Where are you taking me?

404
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,290
We're already out of money!

405
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,900
You don't have any money!

406
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,260
This isn't enough at all!

407
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,290
Beat him up!

408
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,940
Where's your money?

409
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,090
Judging from their accent,

410
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,810
I think they came from
the same neighborhood as us.

411
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,980
That's just how it is here.

412
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,220
The refugees

413
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,460
are unarmed

414
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,810
and unfamiliar with the place.

415
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,570
They're often robbed and bullied.

416
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,420
Zhang Nian.

417
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,460
We shouldn't interfere
with outsiders' business

418
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,220
as per the Zhang Family's rules.

419
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,660
The Zhang Family is already gone.

420
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,900
There are no rules now.

421
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,090
My body has been tense lately.

422
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,420
I can use a good stretch.

423
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
Dear!

424
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,570
Are you guys okay?

425
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,290
Hurry. Get up.

426
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,220
Are you okay?

427
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:25,740
Be careful.

428
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,530
Thank you!

429
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,290
The heavens have heard our cries!

430
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,810
Thank you!

431
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,810
Thank you, savior!

432
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,500
(At that moment,)

433
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,810
(Zhang Nian experienced)

434
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,090
(a sensation where he was mighty)

435
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,610
(and above all beings.)

436
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,570
(He thought Qiling
felt the same sensation)

437
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,900
(when he saved people.)

438
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,290
(At that moment,)

439
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,330
(he found the goal)

440
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,290
(of his life.)

441
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,290
(Due to the
Zhang Family's special ability)

442
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,130
(and his deep, calculated schemes,)

443
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,180
(he became)

444
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,290
(the director
of Daola Research Center very soon.)

445
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,530
(He also married the daughter
of a local elite.)

446
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,980
Do you need to resort to this?

447
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,370
Being romantic is an elegant attitude.

448
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,180
Zhang Nian,

449
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,220
you've changed.

450
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,700
Of course I have.

451
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,770
You guys didn't change much at all.

452
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,090
So, what was the reason

453
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,370
you told us to come here?

454
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,050
I have a piece
of joyous news for you all.

455
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,740
You guys shouldn't be too excited.

456
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,050
With this,

457
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,530
you guys are officially
the advisors of the research center.

458
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,980
From now on, you guys
will be part of the upper-class society.

459
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,420
We're the Scorpion Team after all.

460
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,220
How could I forget about you guys?

461
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,050
You guys should
work under me in the future.

462
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,500
No thanks.

463
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm enjoying my life.

464
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,700
Zhang Nian did everything he could

465
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,090
to obtain power and fame.

466
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,460
But he wasn't satisfied.

467
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,020
(He intended to establish
the Zhang Family in another form.)

468
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,810
(He wanted to become
the other patriarch.)

469
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,260
(He discovered the secrets
of the Night King.)

470
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,500
(He wanted to obtain benefits from it.)

471
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,810
(Thus,)

472
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,330
(he gathered all the information)

473
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,810
(he could.)

474
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,610
(But at the same time,
he was worried about one thing.)

475
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,090
(What should he do if the patriarch)

476
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,810
(does come back one day?)

477
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,700
(He expended most of his energy)

478
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,050
(to get to where he was.)

479
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,570
(He wouldn't allow anyone)

480
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,810
(or any variables)

481
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,020
(to sabotage his current life.)

482
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,940
It really worked.

483
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,330
The Zhang Family,

484
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,940
they have such a treasure.

485
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,260
But they don't have the ability
to activate it!

486
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,530
Stupid!

487
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,020
Stupid!

488
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,260
They deserve to die!

489
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,770
Leave now.

490
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,090
I know I can find you here.

491
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,940
Come on.

492
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,180
You did it!

493
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,740
I'm very close!

494
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,180
When the time comes,

495
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,050
not only will
you keep your father alive,

496
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,220
but I can also provide you
with eternal youth!

497
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,740
Just like you!

498
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,170
Just like me!

499
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,780
Our love will last forever.

500
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Who are you?

501
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,570
Punk?

502
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,170
You're still alive? This is great!

503
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,130
Let's achieve great feats together.

504
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,940
Stop what you're doing right now.

505
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,610
If not,

506
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,210
I'll kill you.

507
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,940
You're so old-fashioned.

508
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,690
The Zhang Family no longer exists.

509
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,650
It's a waste

510
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,570
to leave them untouched.

511
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,130
Let's join hands.

512
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,900
Let's get rid of those old fools.

513
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,420
We'll rule the family.

514
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,050
We'll use the Night King's power

515
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,820
to restore the Zhang Family.

516
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,300
You can be the patriarch.

517
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,050
I can be the vice patriarch.

518
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,690
You've gotten stronger, huh?

519
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,130
But what's the point?

520
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,730
Those old fools still send you
to the ancient tower

521
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,780
to be their scapegoat.

522
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,780
Don't you hate them?

523
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,170
I can help you seek revenge.

524
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,940
You can use

525
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,090
all of my powers.

526
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,380
Punk, what do you think?

527
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,500
Stop!

528
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,690
Be careful!

529
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,820
Help me!

530
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Forget about it! Let's go!

531
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,900
Put out the fire!

532
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,300
Let's go!

533
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,210
My study! My work!

534
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,380
They're all here!

535
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,940
I cannot leave them behind!

536
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
My work!

537
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,650
It's too dangerous!

538
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,530
Go!

539
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,900
My work!

540
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,610
Leave them!

541
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,500
No!

542
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,780
Help me!

543
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,820
Let's go!

544
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,020
No!

545
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,130
No!

546
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,900
Help!

547
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,820
Pulisa!

548
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,170
Pulisa!

549
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,730
I don't have a daughter anymore.

550
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,340
I don't need you here.

551
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,380
Don't you want to avenge her?

552
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,130
That Zhang Qiling,

553
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,170
can you kill him?

554
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,130
I can train some people

555
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,300
to deal with him.

556
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,940
It's too late.

557
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,210
I won't live much longer.

558
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,250
I studied the Night King

559
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,530
because you wanted to be immortal.

560
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,500
That's the reason why Zhang Qiling came

561
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,730
and killed your daughter.

562
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,250
This is all your fault!

563
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,940
Now, you have a second chance.

564
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,610
If you support me in the study,

565
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,460
we can seek revenge.

566
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,420
I can continue to do my research

567
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,500
and keep you alive.

568
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,900
And,

569
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,940
I can kill all the people
who are against us.

570
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,820
That's it.

571
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,730
I can't support you anymore.

572
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,500
Good luck.

573
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,940
