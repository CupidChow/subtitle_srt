=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 17=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,609
I didn't expect Wu Xie
to really complete the mission.

5
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,659
It seems we underestimated him before.

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,729
Of course you did.

7
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,499
My master is very capable.

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,139
I want to learn from him.

9
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,230
I want to beat the Night King.

10
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,720
Good.

11
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,329
He was the first

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,299
to pass Wang Jinyuan's test.

13
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,950
Our patriarch did choose the right man.

14
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,539
Enjoy your drink. I'm going home.

15
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,680
Where are you going?

16
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,379
No, you can't leave.

17
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,190
I can't drink anymore.

18
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't drink anymore.

19
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,169
I am

20
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,790
friends with Qiling,

21
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,000
and you're childhood friends with him.

22
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,750
This time, we've gone to hell and back

23
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,030
for his sake.

24
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,320
So

25
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,160
I guess we're friends now.

26
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,630
Here's to you.

27
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,019
If I get drunk, Haixing will be mad.

28
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,630
- I have something important to tell you.
- She's not here right now.

29
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,320
Speak of the devil.

30
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,720
Who's here?

31
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,449
This little guy wants
to make a toast to you.

32
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,819
He's too embarrassed to do it himself,
so he dragged me along.

33
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,910
Zhang Xiaoguo, you're embarrassed?

34
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,419
When you met me before,

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,950
you looked like you weren't afraid
of anything.

36
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,440
Master.

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,840
Master.

38
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,190
Master.

39
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,449
Master.

40
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,160
He's heard of you before.

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,600
But at that time, you were just

42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,049
a symbol,

43
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,510
a name to him.

44
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,070
But when you appeared in front of him

45
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,720
and accomplished something

46
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,449
that others thought

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,489
was impossible,

48
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,840
he realised

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,099
that the hero was right next to him,

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,030
visible, tangible and real.

51
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,950
At this point,

52
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,609
he's too embarrassed

53
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,729
to approach you.

54
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,880
When did you become so understanding?

55
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,880
Back then,

56
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,840
after Zhang Qiling got the Heavenly Staff

57
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,560
and sacrificed himself

58
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,350
to succeed the patriarch,

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,400
we realised

60
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,350
how great this person

61
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,560
who had adventures with us was.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,059
Master, here's to you.

63
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,750
You're amazing.

64
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,830
Xiaoguo,

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,590
it's not that I'm amazing.

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,499
I'm sure your patriarch

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,830
doesn't think he's that great of a man.

68
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,529
It's only because we dare to do

69
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,000
what others think we can't do.

70
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,579
You're so little now,

71
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,939
but you're so brave.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,579
When you grow up,

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,830
you'll be better than all of us.

74
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,190
Come on.

75
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,590
Wait.

76
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,560
I've never seen you smile before.

77
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,000
If you're happy today,

78
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,710
can you show me your smile?

79
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,190
Come on.

80
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,390
Cheers.

81
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,059
Mr. Haike,

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,680
here's to you, too.

83
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,440
Haike.

84
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,920
The last one.

85
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,440
Cheers.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,289
Goodbye, Master.

87
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,320
Bye.

88
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,880
Isn't Fatty usually quite energetic?

89
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,059
Why is he so abnormal today?

90
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,440
He's hurt. Just let him rest.

91
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,849
Haixing,

92
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,150
give him the key you got.

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,800
Why?

94
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,480
Give it to me.

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,150
Give it to me.

96
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,320
Give it to whoever you want.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,590
You never listen to me anyway.

98
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,880
She's used to such a way
of doing things.

99
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,680
You have the key now.

100
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,139
I've given you

101
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,830
everything I can.

102
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,590
I hope we won't be suspicious
of each other

103
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,480
in the days to come.

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,950
Otherwise,

105
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,710
we can't accomplish it.

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,320
You don't have to stress about it

107
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,270
because it's from the patriarch.

108
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,750
It's up to you

109
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,179
how you use it.

110
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,510
I have no right to ask.

111
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,390
If you decide

112
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,510
to fulfill the duties of patriarch,

113
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,880
I will do everything
in my power to help you.

114
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,510
Have a seat.

115
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,270
There's something

116
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,920
I've always wondered about.

117
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,819
Well, what happened

118
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,019
after your family

119
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,769
came to Dejia

120
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,800
that made Zhang Nian and Zhang Jiuri

121
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,630
so powerful?

122
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,750
When the patriarch entered
the Zhang Family Ancient Tower,

123
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,499
all the Zhangs

124
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
were given their long-awaited freedom

125
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,680
and scattered all over the world.

126
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,179
You know how powerful

127
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,510
the Zhangs are,

128
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,939
but we used them with restraint

129
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,270
and didn't expose them to the world.

130
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,390
But at that moment,

131
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,680
we're going into the world
of ordinary people,

132
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,830
and you know what that means?

133
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,390
I know.

134
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,320
The Zhangs' powers

135
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,190
are like a double-edged sword.

136
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,440
Once unrestrained

137
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,800
and coupled with the desires of some,

138
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,710
they may be used without restraint.

139
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,139
That would be an indelible disaster

140
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,360
for the mundane world.

141
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,400
Back then, the Zhang family
was divided into two kinds.

142
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
One kind is the ones you see here,

143
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,590
we chose to live in seclusion

144
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,240
and stay out of the world's affairs.

145
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,120
And another kind, like Zhang Nian,

146
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,560
who couldn't control his own desires

147
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,520
and abused the Zhang family's power

148
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,560
to plunge the world into more crises

149
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,859
until the patriarch
solved the Night King's case

150
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,190
and came to Dejia.

151
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,499
Those Zhangs were scared when they heard

152
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,870
the patriarch was coming,

153
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,590
so they've restrained themselves.

154
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,320
But there were others

155
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,019
who wanted to fight back,

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,289
so they joined forces

157
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,830
to assassinate the patriarch.

158
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,139
But they vanished

159
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,680
and never showed up again.

160
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,400
No one knows what happened.

161
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,440
The patriarch stopped Zhang Nian

162
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,569
and

163
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,409
went to the old underground city of Dejia

164
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,499
to hide the Heavenly Staff and the key

165
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,950
before leaving.

166
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,590
And he hasn't come back since.

167
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,870
I heard that he entered the Bronze Door
of Yunding Heavenly Palace

168
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,979
to guard the ultimate secret

169
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,440
of the world.

170
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,350
After that,

171
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,230
Zhang Nian got someone
to pretend to be you,

172
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,040
and I realised

173
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,080
that the patriarch

174
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,689
had entrusted such an important matter
as the Night King Devours The Sky

175
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,350
to an ordinary person.

176
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,560
I was curious about you at the time

177
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,529
because the patriarch never

178
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,470
left his duties to others.

179
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,680
It's the first time.

180
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,689
I always wondered

181
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,520
how capable you were

182
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,920
of making the patriarch
give you the job.

183
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,040
So

184
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,160
you tried to test me many times before.

185
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,569
I looked into you earlier,

186
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,950
and the results showed

187
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,950
that you're very ordinary

188
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,160
indeed.

189
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,280
But I didn't believe it then.

190
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,280
I thought you'd been pretending,

191
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,769
or else

192
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,950
the patriarch's choice
would have been too hasty.

193
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,569
But I can now understand

194
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,889
why the patriarch

195
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,110
gave you such an important task.

196
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,040
In his mind,

197
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,680
he's experienced too much betrayal
and abandonment.

198
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,800
He's lost all trust

199
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
in the Zhangs.

200
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,160
And you

201
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,400
made him feel

202
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,950
that there was someone else in the world

203
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,640
who would fight to the death

204
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,070
to walk alongside him.

205
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,320
♪We've lost ourselves♪

206
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,800
♪In the unknown destiny they expected♪

207
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,720
♪No one had the chance
to tell us all the stories♪

208
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,520
♪And you never found yourself

209
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,139
♪How can I break the maze?♪

210
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,560
♪How can I read the trail you left us?♪

211
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,800
Come on.

212
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,320
Drink up.

213
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,590
Are you my buddy?

214
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,920
Fatty.

215
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,640
Come on,

216
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,470
I'm looking for you.

217
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,379
Naive,

218
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,440
come on.

219
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,809
You...

220
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,870
You're ignoring me. I'm coming for you.
Come on, let's drink.

221
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,529
Are you my buddy?
Are you going to drink?

222
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,139
Drink up.

223
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,280
I won't drink,
and you'll have to stop drinking, too.

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,529
You dislike me!

225
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,070
I don't.

226
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,800
Why are you upset?

227
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,680
I was just talking to Zhang Haike,

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,569
he told me

229
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,560
a lot of things about Qiling's past.

230
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,280
Things about Qiling?

231
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,339
That's a good thing.

232
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,689
Listen here, Naive,

233
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,649
you've got the key.

234
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,409
You're one step closer to Qiling.

235
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,259
You should be happy.
Have some chicken wings.

236
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,139
Come on, have some chicken wings.

237
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,739
Fatty, stop it.

238
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,190
Be good. Good boy.

239
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,640
Take those keys out, put them together

240
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,379
and see if they fit.

241
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,800
Don't let Zhang Haike fool you

242
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,350
with a fake key.

243
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,320
Look, I'm still looking out for you.

244
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,280
It's a real key.

245
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,219
That's great.

246
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,990
I've finally got it.

247
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,400
All right, leave it with me.

248
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,350
Give it to me.
You're drunk. Don't lose it.

249
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,619
You don't feel at ease, do you?

250
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,289
I trust you.

251
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,040
You don't trust your buddy.

252
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,339
You don't trust me with it.

253
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,649
You don't care about my feelings.

254
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,120
- It's because you're drunk.
- Have you ever cared about me?

255
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,760
You just left me there.
You let me sleep.

256
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,120
Weren't you afraid I'd freeze?

257
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,070
- Seriously. Give me the key.
- I've been so nice to you.

258
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,440
Fatty.

259
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,809
Thank you.

260
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,870
Thanks for getting me the key.

261
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,950
Wu Xie,

262
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,710
you need to think about

263
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,680
when you

264
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,870
started losing.

265
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,070
Wu Xie,

266
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,760
we've finally met.

267
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,040
I've waited a long time for this moment.

268
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,470
From the first step you took,

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,040
I knew all your tricks.

270
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,560
I just watched you play.

271
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,280
It was long and dull.

272
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,230
You're too careless.

273
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,470
The Zhangs are familiar
with all kinds of poisons,

274
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,859
so I used

275
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,560
a very special kind of psychedelic,

276
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,560
colorless and tasteless,

277
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,230
enough to make most
of the Zhangs pass out.

278
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,710
Before they wake up,

279
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,640
I'll finish it off.

280
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,280
Stop looking.

281
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,019
Zhang Haike,

282
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,230
Zhang Haixing,

283
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,190
all Zhangs,

284
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,520
Fatty,

285
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,350
everyone must die,

286
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,470
but you don't have to.

287
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,889
As long as you take me

288
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,870
to the place where Zhang Qiling went

289
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,470
and find him,

290
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,560
I won't kill you.

291
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,099
Someone's spiked the wine.

292
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,920
We've got to wake everyone up.

293
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,569
What's going on? Where are
Zhang Haike and the others?

294
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,870
Wake them up.

295
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,760
I feel terrible.

296
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,870
Hang in there a little longer.

297
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,870
Who are you?

298
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,480
You go in first.

299
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,699
What about them?

300
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,809
You're the most important.

301
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,240
We need to protect you.

302
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,350
We need to protect you.

303
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,200
I've never been the most important.

304
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,200
We've got to get up there and save them.

305
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,659
Zhang Haike has been captured,

306
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,019
Zhang Haixing is nowhere to be found,

307
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,350
and Wu Xie has disappeared.

308
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,000
Find Wu Xie.

309
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,910
I want him alive.

310
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,070
Yes.

311
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,000
Mr. Zhang,

312
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,200
why did you kill those people?

313
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,670
You're making putting an end
to this very difficult.

314
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,939
Our purpose is to get the Night King.

315
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,939
Killing those people

316
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,870
won't do us any good.

317
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,110
Mr. Feng,

318
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,320
it seems you don't approve
of my actions.

319
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,110
You're doing things too rough.

320
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,049
And you impersonated Wang Fatty

321
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,129
and acted on your own

322
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,910
without informing me in advance.

323
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,390
I have to thank you

324
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
for providing me with the information

325
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,459
so that I could disguise myself
as Wang Fatty seamlessly

326
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,830
and fool everyone.

327
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,240
Even though Wu Xie is brainless,

328
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,049
he's not stupid.

329
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,000
If I leak the plan ahead of time,

330
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,630
there's no guarantee

331
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,590
it won't get out.

332
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,960
I must put on a good show.

333
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,830
I need to be sure that it works.

334
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,590
Besides,

335
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,280
as long as we get the key,

336
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,459
it doesn't matter

337
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,219
if some insignificant people die.

338
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,560
Mr. Feng, I'm sure you understand

339
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,830
that what I'm doing

340
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,200
is for the sake of our cooperation.

341
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,419
Since Wu Xie's body can't be found,

342
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,240
don't worry, he won't die.

343
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,760
Let's go.

344
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,800
I know where the Heavenly Staff is.

345
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,089
Zhang Qiling's key is really ingenious.

346
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,849
I didn't expect it to be engraved

347
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,219
with a map

348
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,320
of the underground drainage system
of Dejia City.

349
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,670
Mr. Zhang,

350
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,040
Is this where the Heavenly Staff
is kept?

351
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,800
(How much time has passed
since I was stabbed?)

352
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,960
(I'm not dead yet.)

353
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,320
(I don't think any organs were hurt.)

354
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,520
(Luck is still on my side.)

355
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,760
(Where's Fatty?)

356
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,910
(I wonder how the others)

357
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,670
(are doing.)

358
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,459
Yes, my name is Zhang Xiaoguo. Master.

359
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank you, Master.

360
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,910
Zhang Haike.

361
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,070
Zhang Haike.

362
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,720
Zhang Haike.

363
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,240
Zhang Haike.

364
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,070
(I have to make a call.)

365
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,830
(I have to make a call)

366
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,110
(to...)

367
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,200
(to Hua and the others for help.)

368
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,179
In case you get credit for finding
the Heavenly Staff, you have to make it clear

369
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,520
that the five of us
worked together to get it.

370
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,720
So we're Scorpion Team now.

371
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,979
For better

372
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,049
or for worse.

373
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

374
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,809
Mr. Zhang,

375
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,150
it's a messy record.

376
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:39,876
It's not clear at all.

377
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,659
Zhang Qiling had almost lost his memory

378
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,329
when he hid the Heavenly Staff.

379
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,960
What's recorded here

380
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,219
are some fragmented information

381
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,800
he told Wang Jinyuan.

382
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,800
Wang Jinyuan recorded it

383
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,419
and kept it here.

384
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,110
Is there anything related
to the Night King?

385
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,000
It's all just tattered memories.

386
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,129
These are all

387
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,800
Zhang Qiling's memories.

388
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,800
Don't let Wu Xie get them.

389
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,070
Burn them all.

390
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,640
(1. Call the police 2. Negotiate
with Zhang Nian 3. Save them myself)

391
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,640
(1. Call the police 2. Negotiate
with Zhang Nian 3. Save them myself)

392
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,760
Qiling,

393
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,280
I screwed up. I screwed it all up.

394
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,760
(Our patriarch
did choose the right man.)

395
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,110
(Wu Xie,)

396
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,830
(you need to think about)

397
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,800
(when you)

398
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,659
(started losing.)

399
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,000
I can't.

400
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,590
I can't.

401
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,280
If only I could have...

402
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,240
If only I could have reacted earlier.

403
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,150
No.

404
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,499
(Even if I gave you
another chance right now,)

405
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,560
(you'd still make the same choice.)

406
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,670
(Even if you knew you'd die here,)

407
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,430
(you'd still come.)

408
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,520
(I've never seen you smile before.)

409
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,870
(If you're happy today,)

410
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,830
(can you show me your smile?)

411
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,960
How could this happen?

412
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,520
How could this happen?

413
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,830
It shouldn't be.

414
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,630
They shouldn't be the ones to die.

415
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,150
God, I'm begging you

416
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,520
to give me another chance.

417
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,329
Please tell me what to do.

418
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,320
What to do? What to do?

419
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,720
You shouldn't have run away alone first.

420
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,430
You've caused them all to die.

421
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,560
You must remember this day forever.

422
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,800
Zhang Nian is from Zhang's family,

423
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,720
and so is Qiling.

424
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,990
So the only people in Niles

425
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,419
who can deal with Zhang Nian

426
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,870
are the Zhangs.

427
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,830
Who lived in those houses
on the mountain?

428
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,030
The old monsters.

429
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,979
The purest

430
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,416
and longest-lived

431
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:15,939
of the Dejia's Zhangs

432
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,209
live here in seclusion.

433
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,689
Until now,

434
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,899
those in the back of the mountain

435
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,299
can only accept

436
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,049
those who can bring out the token

437
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,729
as orthodox Zhang family members.

438
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,760
They are the only ones qualified
to enter the mountain.

439
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,550
I have to to get them to help.

440
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,600
(It's the only way now.)

441
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,049
What is this place?

442
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,019
How come there are so many

443
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,320
marks that represent danger
to the Zhangs?

444
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,209
This should be the place

445
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,830
where the Zhangs lived

446
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,120
when they were still in Dejia.

447
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,870
(What is this place?)

448
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,609
(Zhang Jinyuan, Zhang Haiping
Zhang Fuyi, Zhang Zide)

449
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,990
(Looks like these)

450
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,390
(are the Zhangs who tried to go in)

451
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,800
(and didn't come out.)

452
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,640
(Fire.)

453
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,870
(People were being punished.)

454
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,350
(They're all burned to death.)

455
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,240
(A god who masters fire.)
