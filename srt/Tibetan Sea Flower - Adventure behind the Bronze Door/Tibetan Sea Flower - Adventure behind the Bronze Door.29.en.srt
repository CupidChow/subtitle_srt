=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 29=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,880
My children,

5
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,440
this storm

6
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,804
might be terrifying,

7
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,160
but it's also a foe
that deserves our respect.

8
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,950
What we can do now

9
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,510
is to grasp our weapons tightly

10
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,270
and face it head-on.

11
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,440
Just like our ancestors.

12
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,600
Just like the valiant hawks in the sky.

13
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,200
Tomorrow,

14
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,920
our brave warriors

15
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,270
shall embark on their journey.

16
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,950
They might

17
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,760
not return from it.

18
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,760
However,

19
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,480
their spirits are always here with us.

20
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,920
Let us see these heroes off together!

21
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,790
Zazi Nimo!

22
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,480
Warriors!

23
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,550
Come.

24
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,750
Have a seat.

25
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,280
Wu Xie.

26
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,600
Is there anyone
you wish to bid farewell to?

27
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,310
Yeah.

28
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,520
There's Granny.

29
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,400
Dad, Mom.

30
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,230
Second Uncle, Third Uncle.

31
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,059
Hua, Xiuxiu,

32
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,750
Blind Guy, Wang Meng, and...

33
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,160
And that fatty.

34
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,360
Seems like you're a blissful person.

35
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,400
You're also someone
who makes other people worried.

36
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,550
Thank you.

37
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,889
Regarding tomorrow's operation,

38
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,840
no matter if you succeed or not,

39
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,009
you and Zhang Qiling
will share the same status.

40
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,840
You two will always be our friends.

41
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,110
I'll definitely succeed.

42
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,840
I've always wanted to ask you this.

43
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,299
Why did Zhang Qiling choose you

44
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,670
to destroy the Zanghai Flower field
on his behalf?

45
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,750
Maybe it's because
he didn't have any other choices.

46
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,110
I don't think so.

47
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,040
Both of you share
the same eye expression.

48
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,230
Although you guys may choose

49
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,630
to leave us in the lurch,

50
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,280
you guys

51
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,600
chose to bear the responsibilities.

52
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,520
Actually, I always wanted
to ask you this.

53
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,310
The Yinshaluo Tribe kept guard over

54
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,790
the Zanghai Flowers all your lives.

55
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,960
You guys wait for the Zhang Family

56
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,960
to destroy them before they bloom.

57
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,790
Isn't it meaningless?

58
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,310
Granny.

59
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,520
Granny, I want some meat.

60
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,230
Come, have a seat.

61
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,310
You see,

62
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,310
different people have

63
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,190
different interpretations
of the word "meaning."

64
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,160
So, what exactly is meaningful

65
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,630
in this vast world of ours?

66
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,840
People feel meaningful

67
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,230
when they manage
to reach the peak of a tall mountain.

68
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,160
But to the hawks,

69
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,430
traversing across the peaks

70
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,310
is just an ordinary matter.

71
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,230
Look.

72
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,230
The boulders that erected the pillar,

73
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,779
I'm sure

74
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,430
they existed in the world
when it was first built.

75
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,230
After that, they were discovered.

76
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,400
These boulders could be used

77
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,550
to build houses,

78
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,840
make tools,

79
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,920
even sculpt into a form of human faith.

80
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,840
Many times,

81
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,299
we don't just perform a particular deed

82
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,230
just because it's meaningful.

83
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,190
Instead, we find meaning

84
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,160
through the performance of such a deed.

85
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,840
What's on your mind?

86
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,520
I was wondering if I would lead
a completely different life

87
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,390
and adopt a different interpretation
of the word "meaning"

88
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,750
had I not insisted on

89
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,729
discovering all these secrets.

90
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,080
Time cannot be reversed.

91
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,440
All events in life are predestined.

92
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,800
I hope I can see him again.

93
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,150
Me too.

94
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,910
(Qiling.)

95
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,150
(I'll head out
to stop the storm tomorrow.)

96
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,110
(As for the Bronze Door,)

97
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,270
(I don't know if I'll have the chance
to pick you up.)

98
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,680
(But I'll try my best.)

99
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,139
Come.

100
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,030
Let's drink.

101
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,463
Look at you guys.

102
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,167
None of us need to die now!

103
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,870
None of us need to die now!

104
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,480
There's still a miracle!

105
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,372
Are you drunk?

106
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,299
Back then, I found Qiling's marking

107
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,449
on the wall of
the bronze processing factory.

108
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,779
I was wondering

109
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,560
what it meant.

110
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,729
I finally figured it out

111
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,320
just now.

112
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,609
It's not a marking.

113
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,040
This is a simplified drawing
made by Qiling

114
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,019
based on the structure
of the bronze processing factory.

115
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,030
This is actually easy to understand.

116
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,969
A huge source of power is hidden
underneath the bronze processing factory.

117
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,800
Fatty and I have seen its underground
heat source before.

118
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,609
When Hans blew up
the Zanghai Flower field,

119
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,150
the heat source was leaking power.

120
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,240
It collided fiercely with the cold air
on the ice surface,

121
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,179
generating intense air currents.

122
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,969
In the end,

123
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,320
it formed the storm we saw.

124
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,560
This is my prediction.

125
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,299
The Zhang Family

126
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,019
foresaw

127
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,419
that such an event would happen.

128
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,320
Therefore, they left behind
a contingency plan.

129
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,449
They built a large vent

130
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,080
under the Zanghai Flower field.

131
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,499
This vent

132
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,270
is connected to the valley
outside of the flower field.

133
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,360
It has two openings.

134
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,360
The first opening is an air inlet.

135
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,419
Once we activate the mechanism,
the cold air will be sucked inside.

136
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,659
It'll mix with the hot air underground.

137
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,200
And then, it's expelled
through the second opening.

138
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,419
This mechanism

139
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,779
is actually a huge cooling system.

140
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,659
It neutralizes the heat source

141
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,849
and expel it.

142
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,259
Once the heat source is cut off,

143
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,019
hot air will stop leaking.

144
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,419
Therefore, it won't create
a current with the cold air.

145
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,419
This way,

146
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,080
the storm will cease to exist.

147
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,569
What exactly do you mean by this?

148
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,729
You don't need to understand.

149
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,329
Just tell us what you need us to do.

150
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,089
What we need to do

151
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,569
is to locate this switch

152
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,729
and activate the mechanism.

153
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,139
Once the heat source is expelled,

154
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,960
the storm will dissipate.

155
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,870
Are you sure

156
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,019
that the storm will dissipate

157
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,320
once the mechanism is activated?

158
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,150
I assume this mechanism
has been here for over 100 years.

159
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,270
I'm not sure,

160
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,209
but this is the only solution

161
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,720
that can deal with the storm

162
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,080
while ensuring everyone's survival.

163
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,030
I would think that you were being timid

164
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,320
had I not seen the sparkle in your eye

165
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,240
while you mentioned that plan.

166
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,110
I thought you were trying to run away.

167
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,510
However,

168
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,390
I believe that what you said is true.

169
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,720
We'll execute both plans
at the same time.

170
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,299
It's best if the mechanism can stop

171
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,480
the storm.

172
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,200
But if it fails,

173
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,270
we'll proceed
according to the original plan.

174
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,630
Feng,

175
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,659
you're our scientist.

176
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,659
I'll leave the mechanism to you.

177
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,080
No. I'm just a biologist.

178
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,299
You should do it.

179
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,299
We've already confirmed
the suicide squad's formation.

180
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,840
I have to be there.

181
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,019
Since the patriarch has
left behind hints

182
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,630
to the mechanism's activation,

183
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,969
who else among the candidates

184
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,209
do you think can understand
the patriarch's instructions more than you?

185
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,870
I can replace you in the suicide squad.

186
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,809
And, if you succeed,

187
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,569
we don't even need
this contingency plan.

188
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,899
But I'm the only person

189
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,179
who knows how to lead them
and advance within the storm.

190
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,499
I can do that.

191
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,379
But you have to activate
the mechanism yourself...

192
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,499
Fatty.

193
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,569
Naive, just stop.

194
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,840
I know what you're thinking.

195
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,230
But I think Haixing is right.

196
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,030
When it comes to activating mechanisms,

197
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,059
you're the most suitable candidate

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,600
among us.

199
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,230
The suicide squad received training,
you know?

200
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,179
We can react accordingly.

201
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,600
Besides,

202
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,320
when I'm around,
it means that you're around.

203
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,899
We still have Feng too, am I right?

204
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,019
You shouldn't belittle scientists.

205
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,059
He devoured four flatbread

206
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,200
in one go, am I right?

207
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,299
Chieftain,

208
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,910
how did you guys make the flatbread?

209
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm not full yet.

210
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,270
Wu Xie, we're running out of time.

211
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,960
You're the only one
who can accomplish that task.

212
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,360
Just leave the rest to us.

213
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,680
Okay.

214
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,360
We'll proceed with our original plan.

215
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,150
We'll depart at 10 A.M.

216
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,609
I'll activate the mechanism.

217
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,019
If I fail,

218
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,560
I'll rush back immediately.

219
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,960
You and Fatty can take
the lead for me first.

220
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm the only person who can
accomplish the task.

221
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,379
The rest of you,

222
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,110
be prepared to enter the storm.

223
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,440
If the time has arrived,

224
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,320
you guys should depart on time

225
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,270
no matter if I'm here or not.

226
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,899
Alright.

227
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Don't be nervous. You have two hours.

228
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,680
You have plenty of time
to activate the mechanism.

229
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,200
Don't forget, you're an elite student
of the architecture department.

230
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,569
I'm not trying to stress you out here,

231
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,110
but all of our lives

232
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,910
depend on you now.

233
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,630
You can do this.

234
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,390
Qiling is waiting for us
to pick him up, you know?

235
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,030
Zazi Nimo.

236
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,270
Zazi Nimo.

237
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,990
Wait!

238
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,030
Wait!

239
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,150
I'm joining you!

240
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,990
What are you doing here?

241
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,030
I'll join you.

242
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,510
I've already left a note.

243
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,720
Even if we cannot return home safely,

244
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,150
other people

245
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,200
will deliver the news to other areas.

246
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,080
But you're injured!

247
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,270
Don't worry about me.

248
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,499
Although I couldn't join
the suicide squad,

249
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,910
I can walk without any issues.

250
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,560
Come on. We're running out of time.

251
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,110
I thought you didn't trust me.

252
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,710
I don't.

253
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,470
But I'm willing to give it a try

254
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,320
if it means my tribe can be saved.

255
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,280
I hope you can succeed.

256
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,870
We can reach the Bronze Door
through this path.

257
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,809
Let's go.

258
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,110
This is the path I used
when I rescued you guys.

259
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,569
Over there.

260
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,476
Alright.

261
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,150
Here.

262
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,080
This is the place.

263
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,470
This is it.

264
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,520
That's the marking left by Qiling.

265
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,499
Qiling's drawing is almost the same as
the structures and positions

266
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,710
depicted on the wall.

267
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,910
If that's the case,

268
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,110
this floor

269
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,240
should be the ventilation shaft.

270
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,649
We should be on the upper floor.

271
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,950
As for this circle,

272
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,979
it should be

273
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,670
the area we're currently at.

274
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,320
If so, the room beside it

275
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,360
should be the control room.

276
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,939
So, this is indeed a mechanism
that can guide the heat source.

277
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,870
That's right.

278
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,910
This is great.

279
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,110
The control room

280
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,889
should be in that direction.

281
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,539
Alright.

282
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,409
Let's go.

283
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,520
This is great.

284
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,369
Something's off.

285
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,129
What's wrong?

286
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,369
Why is there nothing ahead?

287
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,630
What should we do now?

288
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,910
Maybe Qiling's drawing

289
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,190
is different from the actual dimensions.

290
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,040
But no matter what,

291
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,329
there should be a huge space

292
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,110
behind this wall.

293
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,280
Let's search the area.

294
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,150
Yindan!

295
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,360
What's wrong?

296
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,240
I found it.

297
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,979
This should be the place.

298
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,080
This is great.

299
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,699
It's almost time.

300
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,040
It's time to depart.

301
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,470
Why the rush?

302
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,800
It's not even time.
Why are we departing already?

303
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,219
Go and check on the storm.

304
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,280
Yes, Chieftain.

305
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,520
(At this moment,)

306
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,870
(I'm sure Naive has reached
the bronze processing factory.)

307
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,150
(Perhaps he'll resolve the issue soon.)

308
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,000
Wu Xie.

309
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,470
Is this the mechanism
you're looking for?

310
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,430
This should be it.

311
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,000
So, the storm will dissipate

312
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,000
once we activate this?

313
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,150
I'll give it a try, then.

314
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,710
Don't!

315
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,520
Let me observe it for a little longer.

316
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,760
Wu Xie, come and see this.

317
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,019
What's this on the wall?

318
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,280
It's so messy.

319
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,670
I think this drawing

320
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,630
should be the construction drawing
of the mechanism.

321
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,390
It describes its structure

322
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,280
and its method of activation.

323
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,299
We're right.

324
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,600
This is a huge ventilation system.

325
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,040
What we saw

326
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,840
should be the main switch.

327
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,760
It connects the starting device

328
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,499
and the transmission device

329
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,150
through various gears.

330
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,360
That's right.

331
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,299
Once we activate this switch,

332
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,470
it'll activate the entire mechanism.

333
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,150
It'll draw outer cold air

334
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,089
into the vent and neutralize
the heat source underground,

335
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,910
neutralizing the storm in the process.

336
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,369
Yindan, look.

337
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,360
Those two are the drive shafts.

338
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,059
There should be an ignition mechanism

339
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,000
inside this room.

340
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,710
It's over there.

341
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,190
I got it.

342
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,430
The winding springs on both side

343
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,320
allow them to connect.

344
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,169
As long as the ignition mechanism

345
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,840
can activate

346
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,739
one set of gears,

347
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,320
I can activate the entire thing.

348
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,779
That's right.

349
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,870
Yindan,

350
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,409
go and activate the switch.

351
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,649
I'll control the winding springs.

352
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,369
Come on.

353
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,320
Alright.

354
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,800
Are you ready?

355
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,950
Yeah.

356
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,150
What's going on?

357
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,870
I've already pressed it.

358
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,259
Have we neutralized the storm?

359
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,110
The mechanism wasn't activated at all.

360
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,080
I already pressed the switch.

361
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,520
Could it be that
the ignition mechanism is faulty?

362
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,000
How is it?

363
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,190
Get me a torch.

364
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,329
I knew there were issues with this part.

365
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,630
We're running out of time.

366
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,190
How's the situation inside?

367
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,800
It's been too long.

368
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,840
The mechanism is faulty.

369
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,190
Fuel cannot get in.

370
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,600
And, the ignition mechanism
is faulty as well.

371
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,059
The storm is still there.

372
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,430
Notify everyone. Tell them to get ready.

373
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,889
Since the mechanism inside is broken,

374
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,600
we can generate our own power source.

375
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,779
The power source here
depends on the burning of fuel.

376
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,569
An explosion can generate enough power.

377
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,019
As long as there's enough power
to drive the piston

378
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,699
and operate the gear system,

379
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,649
I can find a way

380
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,259
to connect the two systems

381
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,870
and operate them together.

382
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,459
However, the space must be enclosed.

383
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,710
This way, the force of the explosion
can be fully applied to the piston.

384
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,280
Come. Help me out.

385
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,910
Okay. Here.

386
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,360
See if we can shut the door.

387
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,240
If we can,

388
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,470
we can open a gap
and throw a torch inside later.

389
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,360
The clip is broken. It can't be closed.

390
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,150
What should we do, then?

391
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,609
Hold it for now.

392
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll find something to prop it up.

393
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,369
Let's give Naive a little bit more time.

394
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,259
This is a difficult task, you know?

395
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,910
Let's give him ten more minutes.

396
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,089
Since he's there as our representative,

397
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,080
we must trust him.

398
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,779
We need to provide him with strength.

399
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,320
Let's wait a little longer, okay?

400
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,809
We'll depart immediately
after ten minutes, okay?

401
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,609
I don't believe that Wu Xie
will fail his task.

402
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,150
Put the door down for now.

403
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,190
Okay!

404
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,939
It's fine!

405
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,110
I can hold the door open!

406
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,950
This explosive is too dangerous.

407
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,870
We have no way to predict
how powerful it is.

408
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,849
I'll deal with the valve.

409
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,329
You can operate the winding springs.

410
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,739
Come here. I'll teach you how to do it.

411
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,649
Come here.

412
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,630
I'll teach you how to operate the clip.

413
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,259
Listen closely

414
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,760
to every word I say.

415
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,950
Stick your ear here.

416
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,560
You have to listen to it closely.

417
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,280
Spin it with this hand.

418
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,840
When you hear that click,

419
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,240
that means the clip is attached.

420
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,280
When the clip is attached,

421
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,150
you have to turn this way
with all your might.

422
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,129
When you do so,

423
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,939
it'll be much faster
than the current speed.

424
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,710
You have to listen to it closely!

425
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,430
We're running out of time!

426
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,190
I have plenty of strength!

427
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,840
I'll do it!

428
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,110
Yindan!

429
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,240
Wu Xie!

430
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,760
Zazi Nimo!

431
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,110
All the best of luck!

432
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,409
Let's depart!

433
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,390
Yes, Chieftain!

434
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,760
There's no need to go!

435
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,849
There's no need to go!

436
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,910
Hurry and tell us!

437
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,710
The storm has vanished!

438
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,240
Feng, let's go!

439
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,110
Look!

440
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,800
It's getting smaller!

441
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,080
Did we succeed?

442
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,360
Yeah, we did.

443
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,600
I knew

444
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,280
you could do it.

445
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,040
Let's go.

446
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,630
Let's go home.

447
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,569
Wu Xie won!

448
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,910
He won!

449
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,670
This is my choice.

450
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,150
You should go.

451
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,430
Even if you wish to die,

452
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,150
would you rather die here

453
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,670
or die under the bright blue sky?

454
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,240
Wu Xie, you're right.

455
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,240
I should die here,

456
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,080
but not inside.

457
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,910
You aren't dead yet,

458
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,809
but you're giving up already?

459
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,280
Don't be silly.

460
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,539
Actually,

461
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,760
we know this well enough.

462
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,800
I can never return

463
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,190
to the Yinshaluo Tribe
with this injury of mine.

464
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,670
Wu Xie.

465
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,710
You have your own path to take.

466
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,080
And I,

467
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,870
I have my own place to stay.

468
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,470
I disagree.

469
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,760
Paths are forged by humans.

470
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,600
The sky is so blue.

471
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,219
Put... Put me down.

472
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,470
What's wrong?

473
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,470
Put me down.

474
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,950
It's so warm.

475
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,000
It's been so long

476
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,110
since I saw such a beautiful sky.

477
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,390
When I was young, I kept thinking

478
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,280
that I would leave the mountains

479
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,560
when I grow up

480
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,630
so that I could explore
the vast world and the wide sky.

481
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,000
But now,

482
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,129
I...

483
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,600
Now,

484
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,110
I only realized

485
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,910
I had always been living
under the widest sky.

486
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,670
The vastness of Heaven and Earth

487
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,360
doesn't lie in Heaven and Earth itself.

488
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,520
It lies in one's heart.

489
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,360
You protected this sky of ours.

490
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,800
Don't worry about the rest.

491
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,600
Thank you.

492
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,670
You must remember this.

493
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,040
One day,

494
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,670
if you ever return here again,

495
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,670
you must remember to...

496
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,760
You...

497
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,760
You must remember

498
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,150
to bring me some liquor.

499
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,320
I'll remember that.

500
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,430
Come.

501
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,800
Let us all raise our glass

502
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,280
on this joyous occasion.

503
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,710
This first drink

504
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,590
is to celebrate our survival.

505
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,840
Come.

506
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,030
Little brat.

507
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,950
This belongs to Yindan.

508
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,840
Yindan

509
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,680
is the hero of Yinshaluo Tribe.

510
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,169
He was prepared to give it his all

511
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,590
in order to protect all of us.

512
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,030
This dagger of him

513
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,990
shall serve as his symbol.

514
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,870
He will always be remembered.

515
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,800
The second drink

516
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,059
is to our hero,

517
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,510
Yindan.

518
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,950
Zazi Nimo!

519
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,590
What will you do with your brother?

520
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,320
I've supported him for so long.

521
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,510
I supported him throughout his journey

522
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,430
to fulfill that impossible wish of his,
which was to revive Niata.

523
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,430
I'm already tired of it.

524
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,870
I don't know what to do either.

525
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,440
I only hope that he can straighten out
his thoughts and come back.

526
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,840
I think it'll be difficult.

527
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,550
I'll be honest with you.

528
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,390
I'll never forgive him.

529
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,160
He'll never forgive me either.

530
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,289
If I see him again,

531
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll surely seek revenge.

532
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,240
This is the only moment
you're siding with me.

533
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,680
This is the only moment
we can have a casual chat like this.

534
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,800
It'll be difficult for you

535
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,950
to side with me after tomorrow.

536
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,680
I understand.

537
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,680
Naive,

538
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,000
you're understanding indeed.

539
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,920
You can comprehend
the situation better than him.

540
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,550
Now, you're
the main pillar of the family.

541
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,950
It's pointless to say that.

542
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,510
In the future, all of us
will go our separate ways.

543
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,120
I only wish to seek happiness

544
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,680
without having any regrets.

545
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,030
I'll tell you the same thing.

546
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,240
In the future,

547
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,680
you need to learn how
to take charge of your own life.

548
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,840
By the way,

549
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,590
I had no time to tell you
about this before.

550
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,120
This is the last scroll written by
the patriarch, which my brother had given to me.

551
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,280
This was the top-secret scroll

552
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,480
with the highest confidentiality
that the Deren had kept.

553
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,419
But before this,

554
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,470
Haike went to Jila Spiritual Retreat.

555
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,720
He stole this scroll beforehand.

556
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,470
Now, you can have it back.

557
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,950
The patriarch accepted the Tianshou.

558
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,240
He resolved the crisis
of the Snowy Peak.

559
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,819
However, he did something very important

560
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,760
not long after he accepted the Tianshou.

561
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,609
That event

562
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,910
was considered
the true ending of his tale.

563
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,569
The narrative is very important.

564
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,200
It's all in there.

565
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,609
There was a simple reason

566
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,209
Zhang Qiling took over

567
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,459
the Zhang Family as the patriarch.

568
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,030
I know why.

569
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,379
He did so in order

570
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,910
to search for his origins.

571
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,160
I'm a person with no past or future.

572
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,360
He wanted to learn about his background.

573
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,550
You shall know everything

574
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,590
after becoming the patriarch.

575
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,910
He wanted to know who he was

576
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,640
and why he came here.

577
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,070
He wanted to find the connection

578
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,280
between him and the world.

579
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,510
He forgot everything

580
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,510
after the first Tianshou.

581
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,910
However, he kept fulfilling other tasks

582
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,590
unconsciously.

583
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,550
He finally reached this stage

584
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,360
after resolving

585
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,760
the event of Dong Can.

586
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,539
He was going to resolve

587
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,390
the most important conflict
in his memory.
