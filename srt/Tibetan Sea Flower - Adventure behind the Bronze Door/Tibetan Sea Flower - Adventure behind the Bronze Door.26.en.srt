=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 26=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,630
You made such a huge huge!

5
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,550
But where are the fences?

6
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,670
Fatty, look over there.

7
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,110
What are those?

8
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,019
It looks like the nest
of a certain creature.

9
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,760
The size of these holes

10
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,670
is similar to those
of the golden spheres.

11
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,600
Could it be the nest
of those golden spheres?

12
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,929
You're right.

13
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,320
They do resemble the nest
of the golden spheres.

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,110
However,

15
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,600
look at these bug nests.

16
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,910
There are no longer any bugs in them.

17
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,280
I guess

18
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,560
that the Zhang Family dug this hole

19
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,480
to create the Mystic Claw.

20
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,000
They made it while digging the hole

21
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,179
until they reached here

22
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,880
and discovered their nest.

23
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,859
These bugs were causing them trouble.

24
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,440
Thus, they got rid of them.

25
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,510
With their capabilities,

26
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,209
they can get rid of

27
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,419
the golden spheres easily.

28
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,790
That's right. But I assume they didn't
get rid of all of them.

29
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,200
Look at the structure.

30
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,579
If the golden spheres are able

31
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,299
to form such a gigantic nest here,

32
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,560
it indicates that
they have a strong reproductive ability.

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,699
If that's the case,

34
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,630
I'm sure there are plenty
of similar bug nests

35
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,040
within a hundred mile radius.

36
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,359
Even if they did get rid of all of them,

37
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,179
I'm afraid there are plenty of them
in other areas.

38
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,560
If not, we would never
encounter them outside.

39
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,630
There are mystical creatures
living here.

40
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,600
They built a Bronze Door here too.

41
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,350
The ecosystem here is magical.

42
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,369
I'm sure there's a magical secret

43
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,790
behind the Bronze Door.

44
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,209
Fatty,

45
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,280
analyze the situation for me
using the enumeration method.

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,510
I don't think I can analyze
the situation with that method.

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,600
It's too strange.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,040
We should wait for the host
to unravel its secrets.

49
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,649
Zhang Haixing!

50
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,720
Stop hiding!

51
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,350
I saw you!

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,790
Say, could she be hiding down there?

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,179
These holes are interconnected.

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,179
But they're tiny.

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,440
She won't be able to enter them.

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,790
Let's go, then.

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,950
Let's go.

58
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,800
What else is there?

59
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,070
Naive,

60
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,590
this is a major discovery.

61
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,150
It's Qiling's marking.

62
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,240
We've never seen
this marking before, right?

63
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah.

64
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,819
Judging from Qiling's personality,

65
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,510
what do you think he means

66
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,259
by leaving this marking behind?

67
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,200
Seems like we came to the right place.

68
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,459
Something's off.

69
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,510
This isn't a marking of direction.

70
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,440
Is he saying that this is the end point?

71
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,849
Since Qiling left his marking here,

72
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,379
I'm sure he left behind
some vital information for us.

73
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,680
Let's search the area.

74
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,320
Golden spheres?

75
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,360
Are all of these golden spheres?

76
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,360
This is information left behind by
the early members of the Zhang Family.

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,089
It described

78
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,760
how the golden spheres
descended the mountains

79
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,070
and attacked the city.

80
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,379
And, many people died

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,560
during the attack.

82
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,150
Fatty.

83
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,800
Look at all these buildings.

84
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,630
Look at their shapes

85
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,920
and forms.

86
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,849
They're the same as the ones

87
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,560
we saw in the shadow play.

88
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,729
This is Kumuligu.

89
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,899
I could tell too.

90
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,459
The people of Kumuligu

91
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,560
were fighting against
the golden spheres.

92
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,240
These strange people must be
the Zhang Family.

93
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,920
If so, I assume the creatures
are the golden spheres.

94
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,070
There's more over here.

95
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,270
There's more information here

96
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,440
than what we saw at the Kumuli Ruins.

97
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,579
So, Kumuli was infested with
the golden sphere bugs

98
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,070
before the Zhang Family's arrival.

99
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,440
Many people died.

100
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,120
They thought the Night King
were out to get them.

101
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,289
Thus, they sent many brave warriors
to the mountains

102
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,000
in order to combat it.

103
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,030
But almost all of them

104
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,390
suffered terrible deaths here.

105
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,089
What a tragedy.

106
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,590
Let's go. Let's continue.

107
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,360
Look at this tiny figure.

108
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,710
Look at how proud he looks.

109
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,320
Seems like he won.

110
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,560
That should be its description.

111
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,139
This Kumuli warrior

112
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,849
found the golden spheres' weaknesses

113
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,150
and killed them.

114
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,379
What are the Zhang Family doing here

115
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,200
if they can kill
the golden spheres themselves?

116
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,470
Unless,

117
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,200
the calamity didn't end.

118
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,870
In every Stone Year
of the 80-year cycle,

119
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,809
after the Yinshaluo Tribe's Luku Day,
golden rain will descend from the sky.

120
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,400
The Night King, who resides deep within
the Snowy Peak, will be awakened.

121
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,920
It will kill everything in the snow.

122
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,499
Bodies will litter the wilderness

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,569
as if it's Hell on Earth.

124
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,569
If Zhang Haike

125
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,019
didn't lie to us,

126
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,929
that means this creature

127
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,569
will be revived time and time again.

128
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,259
Kumuli will never find peace.

129
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,099
This method of theirs

130
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,870
doesn't work all the time.

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,979
Therefore, this cycle will continue

132
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,569
to play out.

133
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,110
Until the appearance
of the Zhang Family.

134
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,219
This time, it seems like

135
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,680
they combated them in a different way.

136
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,870
Under the lead of the Zhang Family,

137
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,920
they placed something unique here.

138
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,350
I assume it's the fight
where they used snakes as baits.

139
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,280
The golden spheres
stopped appearing after that.

140
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,990
The people of Kumuli found peace.

141
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,520
I'll hold it for you.

142
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,280
Everything makes sense now.

143
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,590
Due to the snake plague and earthquake,

144
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,200
this dynasty fell.

145
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,720
After that, another earthquake occurred.

146
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,590
All these snakes were buried together

147
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,280
with the remains of the ancient city.

148
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,139
However,

149
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,160
there's one thing I can't figure out.

150
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,870
What caused the snake plague
in the first place?

151
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,160
There's a flower on the wall painting.

152
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,200
Seems like it only thrives
in this place.

153
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,440
It looks like a brain to me.

154
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,560
Fatty,

155
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,569
get me the torch.

156
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,350
I knew there was more.

157
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,710
This place

158
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,160
is filled with that kind of flower.

159
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,560
The Zhang Family

160
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,200
built a bronze structure

161
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,800
while being surrounded by these flowers.

162
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,200
It should be where we are right now.

163
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,739
Look.

164
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,409
They forged a special bronze armor

165
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,649
for Mystic Claw

166
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,289
so that it could guard the gate.

167
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,409
Mystic Claw?

168
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,019
That's right.

169
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,169
After that, the remaining Kumuli people

170
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,809
moved into a mountain valley

171
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,870
and helped the Zhang Family
to keep guard over the area.

172
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,800
So, the Yinshaluo Tribe are
the descendants of the Kumuli people.

173
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,400
That's possible.

174
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,289
There should be two reasons

175
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,280
why they built

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,859
a bronze structure here.

177
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,520
Firstly, they built it
to protect these flowers

178
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,110
from outsiders.

179
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,800
Secondly, they built it to prevent
the golden spheres from escaping.

180
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,950
Fatty, there's more over here.

181
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,990
This looks familiar.

182
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,019
Kumuli and the monster box...

183
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,950
So, the Night King's hide is

184
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,320
actually the eggs of the golden spheres.

185
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,259
Therefore, what we saw

186
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,920
underground before this

187
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,040
wasn't the Night King's hide at all.

188
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,590
Instead, it was these eggs.

189
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,289
An enormous number of them
were piled together, forming something...

190
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,110
That resembles a cocoon.

191
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,349
What's so precious about the flower

192
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,979
that the Zhang Family had to build a structure
and weave a tale around it?

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,169
What is this?

194
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,470
It's pitch black.

195
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,569
They were scattered

196
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,870
from the flower's direction.

197
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,339
This is my assumption.

198
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,689
It's likely that these
are the seeds of the flower.

199
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,899
The golden sphere larvae

200
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,280
infested the roots as parasites.

201
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,350
They leave the root
and live independently

202
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,590
after growing mature.

203
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,870
They started becoming aggressive.

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
That's why they descended the mountains
and attacked the city.

205
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,520
Something's off about
the golden sphere bugs, huh?

206
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,640
Does this have something to do
with the brain flower?

207
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,870
If so, why didn't they destroy it?

208
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,320
They actually made Mystic Claw
guard the entrance instead.

209
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,099
I understand now.

210
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,259
Qiling's mission

211
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,739
might have been to lead us here

212
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,640
so that we could
deal with these flowers.

213
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,499
That's only my guess.

214
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,800
I might not be right.

215
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,160
Let's look at this painting.

216
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,070
It's finally Mystic Claw's turn.

217
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,400
This is the process where
the Zhang Family created Mystic Claw.

218
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,619
They spent so much effort

219
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,950
to set up a gigantic trap here

220
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,859
to prevent the seeds

221
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,800
and the golden sphere bugs
from leaving the area.

222
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,880
They also did so to prevent
outsiders from coming here.

223
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,739
If that's the case,

224
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,800
Zhang Haike's motive is quite obvious.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,099
He intends to get his hands
on the seeds and the flowers.

226
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,289
Let's forget about

227
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,750
Zhang Haike's motive for now.

228
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,809
I'm sure he's up to no good.

229
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,169
If not, he wouldn't need

230
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,859
to lie to us all the time,

231
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,950
am I right?

232
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,569
Therefore, he set up an elaborate plot

233
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,019
surely because
there's a certain trap here

234
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,339
that he cannot disarm

235
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,070
while I can, right?

236
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,400
What kind of trap it is?

237
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,230
My blood.

238
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,569
It's no wonder

239
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,859
they want to let me bleed out
after stealing the Heavenly Staff.

240
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,139
To them, I'm just medicinal dregs.

241
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,590
Zhang Haixing!

242
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,710
What do you remember?

243
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,470
Look.

244
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,230
This person,

245
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,870
doesn't he look like he's opening
the gate with the Heavenly Staff?

246
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,339
That's how you use the Heavenly Staff.

247
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,920
It's a key.

248
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,120
But I blew up the gate.

249
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,259
It didn't work when we first used
the Heavenly Staff, right?

250
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,259
Look.

251
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,649
I think we blew up
the gate in the middle.

252
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,049
But the gate he unlocked

253
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,169
is hidden within the inner circle.

254
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,019
So, your blood

255
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,649
can reveal the true form of Mystic Claw

256
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,259
and locate that gate, huh?

257
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,499
If so, Zhang Haixing
can unlock the gate at any time.

258
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,049
That's why we mustn't
let her get her way.

259
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,800
We have to retrieve the Heavenly Staff.

260
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,510
(Haike, please hurry up.)

261
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,059
(Haike, we finally did it.)

262
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,310
(Now, I just need to wait for you.)

263
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,880
Haixing.

264
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,990
Haike!

265
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,120
I've already unlocked the last gate.

266
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,779
The Zanghai Flower is inside.

267
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,550
Niata can finally be awakened.

268
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,920
Your wish will come true soon.

269
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,640
Let's hurry and leave.

270
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,230
You aren't Haike.

271
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,470
The hexagonal bell?

272
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,990
It's Wu Xie.

273
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,310
Wu Xie?

274
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,120
Wu Xie!

275
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,550
Wu Xie!

276
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,270
Wu Xie!

277
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,270
It already went berserk!

278
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,470
Run!

279
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,299
Don't let it catch up to you!

280
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,299
It'll ride you

281
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
and use you as its legs!

282
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,579
Do you have any explosives?

283
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,680
I don't!

284
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,510
Over here!

285
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,160
Over here!

286
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,680
Bring it on!

287
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,550
Isn't this pointless?

288
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,400
You're still trying to be kind

289
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,120
when death is knocking on your door.

290
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,160
I'm not doing it for your sake.

291
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,030
I'm doing it for its sake.

292
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,790
Aren't you the same?

293
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,120
At least I can wait until
my brother's here.

294
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,160
You can converse with it, right?

295
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,339
Why aren't you telling it to go away?

296
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,120
Someone only taught me

297
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,120
how to imitate its voice.

298
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,270
I don't know how to control it.

299
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,880
Seems like you're very familiar

300
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,640
with the place.

301
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,640
Haike!

302
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,729
I've already unlocked the last gate.

303
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,299
The Zanghai Flower is inside.

304
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,080
Niata can finally be awakened.

305
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,440
Your wish will come true soon.

306
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,400
(As mentioned by Zhang Haixing,
the Zanghai Flower)

307
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,649
(should be what the Zhang Family)

308
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,990
(is keeping behind the Bronze Door.)

309
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,880
Who's Niata, then?

310
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,600
What do you mean by "awakened?"

311
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,790
It's none of your business.

312
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,600
I'm dying.

313
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,880
Can't you

314
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,680
tell me what's going on

315
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,920
on account of my contributions
to your cause?

316
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,550
Since you're already dying,

317
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,750
I guess I can tell you the truth.

318
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,920
However, these so-called "truths"

319
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,550
are just speculations made
by outsiders like you all.

320
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,750
Have you ever wondered why

321
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,200
the members of the Zhang Family

322
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,710
live longer than ordinary people?

323
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,030
Actually, the Zanghai Flower

324
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,750
is the source of
the Zhang Family's longevity.

325
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,790
We don't know

326
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,270
where it came from either.

327
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,200
But it provided the Zhang Family
with great significance.

328
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,880
The Zanghai Flower
is within the Bronze Door.

329
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,339
The Zhang Family set up
plenty of traps here

330
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,400
to protect the Zanghai Flower.

331
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,550
Only the head of the Zhang Family

332
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,200
can enter the place.

333
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,360
The duty of the head of the Zhang Family

334
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,470
is to make sure no outsiders

335
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,400
get their hands on the Zanghai Flower.

336
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,750
But because of you,

337
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,640
Zhang Qiling had

338
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,640
to enter the Bronze Door
under Yunding Heavenly Palace

339
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,600
to resolve a bigger issue.

340
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,299
That means

341
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,339
he'll be so busy in the next ten years

342
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,360
that he cannot tend to anything else.

343
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,009
But due

344
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,880
to the sudden urgency of the incident

345
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,030
and the major threat he was facing,

346
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,230
he needed

347
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,680
someone else to keep guard
over the field of Zanghai Flower.

348
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,750
My brother seized a tape recorded

349
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,969
by Zhang Qiling

350
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,880
from Zhang Nian.

351
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,009
We found out that he entrusted someone

352
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,440
to keep guard over
the field of Zanghai Flower.

353
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,000
We also carefully examined Zhang Qiling's
activities during the entire period

354
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,680
leading up to the Bronze Door.

355
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,880
We were sure

356
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,790
that you were the one.

357
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,160
I gave it some thought.

358
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,680
I think you're the only person

359
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
(Right before Zhang Qiling
departs for the Bronze Door)

360
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,880
(Wuzhou, Louwailou)
that relates me to this world.

361
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,880
Therefore,

362
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,310
we lured you here

363
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,310
so that you could retrieve
the things we desire for us.

364
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,360
In order to make you act faster,

365
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,619
we used the legend of the Night King

366
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,080
to fabricate a tale

367
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,680
and lure you all the way here.

368
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,200
But we didn't expect you

369
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,790
to be this difficult to control.

370
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,409
You almost foiled our plan too.

371
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,200
Who exactly are you guys?

372
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,990
Why are you guys doing this?

373
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,790
We're members of the Zhang Family too.

374
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,440
However,

375
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,790
our ideas are different from them.

376
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,950
We betrayed the Zhang Family

377
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,920
and joined hands with the Wang Family.

378
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,950
We serve a different philosophy.

379
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,880
But you don't have time
to understand that.

380
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,470
Aren't you guys friends
with Zhang Qiling?

381
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,750
I read from the scroll

382
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,790
that you guys explored the outside world

383
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,510
and returned home together.

384
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,880
Why did you guys betray him?

385
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,080
It's because he betrayed us first.

386
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,880
Do you remember
what my brother told you guys about

387
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,270
our experience in Dejia?

388
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,160
That wasn't the entire truth.

389
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,200
It all started

390
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,080
from the day

391
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,710
when Zhang Qiling became the patriarch.

392
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,270
We never expected

393
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,790
that the patriarch ascension ceremony

394
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,600
was actually a farewell ceremony
for us and Zhang Qiling.

395
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,080
We never expected

396
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,360
a brat we got to know from our adventure

397
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,400
to overturn the fate
of the Zhang Family.

398
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,859
On the second day

399
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,120
after Zhang Qiling
joined the Zhang Family Ancient Tower,

400
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,950
our elders told us

401
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,470
that the Zhang Family was gone.

402
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,640
Tianshou illness no longer existed.

403
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,470
There was no suffering anymore.

404
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,600
We could leave the place.

405
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,160
Back then, we were too young

406
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,360
to understand what it meant.

407
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,880
We only knew

408
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,990
that we lost a companion.

409
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,880
After that,

410
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,880
the members of the Zhang Family
left the place gradually.

411
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,680
All of our elders chose
to live in Dejia.

412
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,160
After that,

413
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,339
we never received any news

414
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,230
of Zhang Qiling.

415
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,360
Slowly,

416
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,080
I started leading an ordinary life.

417
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,550
Only then I realized

418
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,750
that life was simple and happy

419
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,310
when you weren't a member
of the Zhang Family.

420
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,600
Let's drink.

421
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,950
Cheers.

422
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,200
Cheers.

423
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,950
Haike.

424
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,030
Isn't this nice?

425
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,600
It's pretty nice.

426
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,080
I'll buy this.

427
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,680
Haixing.

428
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,200
I think this is...

429
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,270
Are you okay?

430
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,440
What do you think about Niata?

431
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,400
We're from the Zhang Family, you know?

432
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,600
The Zhang Family no longer exists.

433
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,169
You're just not used

434
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,880
to being an ordinary person.

435
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,750
You have to learn that.

436
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,270
Actually, it's rare for people like us
to become ordinary people.

437
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,000
You can obtain true happiness.

438
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,960
This is what you cannot experience
as a member of the Zhang Family.

439
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,160
Did you forget?

440
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,270
We're here to wait for the patriarch.

441
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,800
All of you guys have forgotten about it.

442
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,390
The patriarch chose
a different path long ago.

443
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,000
It's the same for us.

444
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,390
Since we chose different paths,

445
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,870
it'll be difficult for us to meet again.

446
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,080
Therefore,
it's pointless to wait for him.

447
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,659
It's better for you

448
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,390
to think about how to lead
your own life.

449
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,870
You're my younger sister.

450
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,160
I hope that you can obtain
such happiness too.

451
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,910
What are you doing here?

452
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,640
Let's get into a relationship.

453
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,750
I wish to lead a normal life.

454
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,160
What has that got to do with me?

455
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,000
Zhang Nian is disgusting.

456
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,640
You're my only choice.

457
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,120
You were looking for thrills,
weren't you?

458
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,750
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

459
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,480
Shut up.

460
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,409
Zhang Jiuri!

461
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,600
I saw someone over there!

462
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,240
You have a death wish, don't you?

463
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,430
Zhang Haixing.

464
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,310
Just you wait!

465
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,750
Several years had passed.

466
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,310
We thought that punk would never return.

467
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,960
Who is it?

468
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,310
Punk?

469
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,120
You're finally back.

470
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,750
We've been waiting for you.

471
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,560
Stop!

472
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,310
Stop!

473
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,710
You're under Tianshou's control.

474
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,120
That's why you come to kill me?

475
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,080
Patriarch!

476
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,120
I can cancel the marriage!

477
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,080
I can choose to
obey the Zhang Family's destiny!

478
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm begging you!

479
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,120
Please spare her!

480
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,960
Please spare her!
