=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,240
=Episode 23=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,820
They are dead!

5
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,479
Dead! They are dead!

6
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,060
What?

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,170
Do you think it was a wrong call?

8
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,170
You know it could have been you.

9
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,959
Here!

10
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,149
Pull the trigger

11
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,570
and let us all die!

12
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,060
Do your thing.

13
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,220
Get them out of here.

14
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,500
Quick.

15
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,130
So many people are dead again.

16
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,100
It wasn't like this.

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,500
We could save everyone in the past.

18
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,079
What did I tell you?

19
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,220
This is the time
when you should be calm.

20
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,820
We are people who have
experienced these situations before.

21
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,660
Have you forgotten?

22
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,730
We've seen the Bronze Door.

23
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,340
Qiling was around previously.

24
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,100
In critical moments,

25
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,780
he would come and save us.

26
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,890
I just needed to come up with ideas.

27
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,300
I didn't expect having him around

28
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,450
would make such a big difference.

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,450
We are still alive
and that is the truth.

30
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,759
Besides, we've saved many people.

31
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,180
No, Fatty. You don't understand.

32
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,380
My luck is gone.

33
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,090
I can't solve this without Qiling!

34
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,450
You are on a different level
compared to him.

35
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,620
Why do you think
you should walk his path?

36
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,690
I have no right.

37
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,589
At least, we now know

38
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,210
that the golden sphere
is just a type of bug.

39
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,620
We can deal with it with smoke.

40
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,149
If we can deal
with the golden sphere bug,

41
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,260
do you think we can't defeat Night King?

42
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,679
Think about it. We've defeated

43
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,330
many amazing monsters.

44
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,860
If we can find Night King...

45
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,620
Of course,

46
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,890
if we can't find Night King,

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,180
that means it is lucky.

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,060
Night King moves near the Bronze Door.

49
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,130
In the previous records,

50
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,770
Night King appeared
together with the Bronze Door.

51
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,829
The golden sphere always appears

52
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,060
in records related to the Night King.

53
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,890
Meeting the golden spheres

54
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,469
means we are

55
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,999
very close to Night King.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,269
There's no use

57
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,820
even if you are analyzing here.

58
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,519
You're still taking your own sweet time.

59
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,570
Go and fight them if you're capable.

60
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,260
Are you relying on him?

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,010
He is just a child when compared to you.

62
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,180
You're still analyzing here.

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,980
What did you analyze?

64
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,789
Can you solve this problem?

65
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,300
This is about our lives!

66
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,450
As soon as we arrived
at Night King's turf,

67
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,060
we have already been wiped out!

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,330
We have underestimated
Night King's danger after all.

69
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,890
It seems like we need to rethink

70
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,829
our plan to kill Night King.

71
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,439
You sound so confident,

72
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,740
Old People.

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,060
Plan?

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,530
How can we plan when we don't even know
what Night King looks like?

75
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,260
Naive,

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,890
are you going?

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,820
At a time like this,

78
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,380
I'll listen to everything you say.

79
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,380
Wu Xie,

80
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,380
don't tell me that you're giving up.

81
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,650
Fatty,

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,860
I can't give up.

83
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,860
We can only move further inside.

84
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,500
If the exit is inside,

85
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,260
it'll be the exit.

86
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,650
If Night King is inside,

87
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,980
our wills will be useful.

88
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,999
You said Qiling dealt with Night King

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,420
and sealed it behind a large door.

90
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,269
How did he do it?

91
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,300
Isn't there a record about it?

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,180
Only the patriarch saw Night King

93
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,570
and he is the only one who knows

94
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,119
how to defeat Night King.

95
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,620
There is so much information
recorded on the scrolls

96
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,530
but why did Qiling forget

97
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,060
at such a critical moment?

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,090
Maybe Qiling experienced
Tianshou illness back then.

99
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,149
He couldn't decide

100
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,690
what to remember

101
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,829
and what to forget.

102
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,959
I understand. I'm just anxious.

103
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,420
I hope Qiling doesn't forget us both

104
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,130
when he comes out of the Bronze Door.

105
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,450
Just now,

106
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,210
Feng found sutras
left behind by the Yinshaluo Tribe.

107
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,890
There are records

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,980
of Night King appearing

109
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,530
when Luku Day starts.

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,159
Night King will appear once

111
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,770
every few years.

112
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,919
Isn't there a way

113
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,050
to deal with the Night King
once and for all?

114
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,199
Your problems

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,700
have been troubling us as well.

116
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,229
Ever since I knew the Patriarch

117
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,380
got you to complete his mission
in his place,

118
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,010
I've been trying to solve these problems

119
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,700
but I found nothing.

120
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,559
So, even if Night King

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,509
exceeds our imagination this time,

122
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,109
we still have no choice.

123
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,340
We can only know what's going on

124
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,749
when we see it ourselves.

125
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,170
There are many casualties

126
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,980
for the Denaxi people.

127
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,620
They've lost many weapons too.

128
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,290
I wonder
if they can keep moving forward.

129
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,130
Boss.

130
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,679
There is no medicinal value

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,290
on this creature.

132
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,860
What?

133
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,380
Are you sure?

134
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,079
This creature is not the same one

135
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,010
we found 80 years ago.

136
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,890
It's just an insect.

137
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,130
Wu Xie was right.

138
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,700
It really is just a giant insect.

139
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,220
Give me that.

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,010
This is impossible!

141
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,980
We could have gone back.

142
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,980
You said it was not the one.

143
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,050
You saw the test results.

144
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,860
Molecular structure doesn't lie.

145
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,810
There must be a mistake.

146
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,509
Check it! Test it again!

147
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,770
It's confirmed.

148
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,410
I said test it again!

149
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,799
Come. Check it again.

150
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,860
Take it.

151
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,109
Boss, sorry

152
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,860
but I have to check it again.

153
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,260
We only have a Heavenly Staff

154
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,650
and we don't know how to use it.

155
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,810
There's no use worrying about it now

156
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,050
because the real fear

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,580
hasn't arrived yet.

158
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,229
We have spent too much time in Dejia.

159
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,340
Time is of the essence.

160
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,439
If we still can't find the door

161
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,740
before Luku Day ends,

162
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:02,989
Night King will revive.

163
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,860
Then, it'll really be too late.

164
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,260
You are right.

165
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,460
Although there are
many dangers in front,

166
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,869
Qiling didn't have it

167
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,650
much easier than us back then.

168
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,980
He solved the Night King problem alone.

169
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,829
That means there's a way

170
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,860
to deal with Night King.

171
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,530
We have many people here.

172
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,580
We will surely find a way out.

173
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,460
Thank you

174
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,109
for saving us just now.

175
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,109
No need to thank me.

176
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,460
It was what I should do.

177
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,010
Besides, we wouldn't be alive
without you.

178
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,039
We didn't expect

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,410
things would be so bad.

180
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,679
My men are already broken

181
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,340
after watching so many people die.

182
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,890
These are for your teammates.

183
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,340
Thank you.

184
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,439
If the golden sphere isn't Night King,

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,340
that means we will be facing something
more dangerous ahead of us.

186
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,530
Mr. Wu,

187
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,810
let me tell you.

188
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,980
I am a science manager.

189
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,130
My job is to make sure
that the project succeeds

190
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,340
so I can make a profit.

191
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,500
However, my men

192
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,740
examined the body of the golden sphere

193
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,620
and realised it had no medicinal value.

194
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,980
Are you saying

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,439
that it is different

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,079
from that thing in the box

197
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,399
from many years ago?

198
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,650
Perhaps it's not the same thing

199
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,010
but the likely possibility

200
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,980
is that the golden sphere
has no medicinal value at all.

201
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,890
However, that golden sphere back then

202
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,980
ate something that had medicinal value.

203
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,290
So, its body

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,700
had the biological cells
that we are researching.

205
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,439
Actually, what we detect

206
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,860
is the thing that it consumes.

207
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,559
Are you telling me that you are not
looking for the golden sphere

208
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,740
but the thing that it consumes?

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,860
But we can't even avoid

210
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,319
the attacks

211
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,679
of these golden spheres.

212
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,709
We still need

213
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,410
to find the thing they consume?

214
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,159
This is no longer about
the research and money.

215
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,980
It's about life and death.

216
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,959
Moreover, this situation

217
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,260
is out of my control.

218
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,980
Mr. Wu,

219
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,810
I suggest

220
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,700
you consider giving up.

221
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,199
If you give up now,

222
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,349
I can try to convince them
to cancel this operation.

223
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,700
I won't give up.

224
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,100
Naive!

225
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,340
Naive!

226
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,050
No matter what you decide,

227
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,530
I will still go on.

228
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,589
We were looking for an exit here

229
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,010
and realized there was a breeze.

230
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,130
Then, we saw a group of these.

231
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,890
See them?

232
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,980
Here.

233
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,260
There's a breeze.

234
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,220
These are the bodies
of the Yinshaluo Tribe.

235
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,220
There aren't any fatal wounds

236
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,220
on these skeletons.

237
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,229
It seems like

238
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,770
they died from being trapped here.

239
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,220
Why did these people die here?

240
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,290
Did they come here

241
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,890
when they tried to escape an avalanche?

242
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,229
These people
have been dead for too long.

243
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,860
I can't determine the cause of death.

244
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,620
However, from their posture,

245
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,900
it seems like they were
trying to escape from this crack.

246
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,770
So, there should be something dangerous
inside this crack.

247
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,410
Don't scare me.

248
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,620
No matter
what kind of danger it contains,

249
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,220
having the Yinshaluo Tribe here

250
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,810
means there is something inside.

251
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,410
Let's go inside and take a look.

252
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,410
Feng,

253
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,170
do you still have any flares?

254
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,046
I need to scout ahead.

255
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,349
The caves here

256
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,159
might lead to the buried ancient city.

257
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,799
So, we need to explore everything.

258
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,220
I'm coming with you.

259
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,010
Hans.

260
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,610
I've just talked to Wu Xie.

261
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,180
Our mission is terminated.

262
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,679
You can all go back

263
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,370
and receive compensatory payment.

264
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,010
Go back?

265
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,900
What about our bonus?

266
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,180
I've lost my arm.

267
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,140
Half of my squad is dead.

268
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,900
And you're telling us

269
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,570
to stop halfway through?

270
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't care what Wu Xie told you.

271
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,180
We cannot go back empty-handed.

272
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,679
We need to finish our mission

273
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,180
so we can get our compensation.

274
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,980
Otherwise,

275
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,530
what did they die for?

276
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,770
You saw the data.

277
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,119
These golden spheres are most certainly

278
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,370
what 80 years ago
that attacked the expedition team.

279
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,119
But what our men brought back

280
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,850
didn't have any medicinal value in it.

281
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,770
So, tell me.

282
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,309
Even if you manage to catch another one,

283
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,770
what are the chances to succeed?

284
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,700
You know?
You're telling me this just now.

285
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,090
I can simply blow off your head
right now on the spot.

286
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,740
It doesn't matter what it is.

287
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,359
We need to find it

288
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,700
and get our money.

289
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,460
Or do you want us all to die in vain?

290
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,810
No way.

291
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,610
Take him away.

292
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,919
We need him to manipulate Wu Xie.

293
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,660
Go.

294
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,530
Go.

295
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,220
Move!

296
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,850
Fatty,

297
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,770
it seems like
the caves here are connected.

298
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,199
Be careful.

299
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,330
All right.

300
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,980
It's very deep.

301
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,660
Be careful.

302
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,010
Give me the flare gun.

303
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,570
Naive,

304
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,850
do you find this place familiar?

305
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,366
Naive,

306
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:07,959
your curse is unparalleled.

307
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,050
Fatty,

308
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,290
I have a bad feeling about this.

309
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,530
What?

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,119
This place looks like

311
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,700
a place we've been to.

312
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,050
It's nothing.

313
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,740
It might be very dangerous in front.

314
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,029
We'll go back and regroup

315
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,460
before we move forward.

316
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,879
Let's go.

317
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,570
It's all right. Let's go.

318
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,839
Do you still remember

319
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,770
the Yunding Heavenly Palace I mentioned?

320
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,029
There was also a huge crack

321
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,460
under the Yunding Heavenly Palace.

322
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,839
Inside the crack,

323
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,679
there were many bronze chains

324
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,460
and at the end of the bronze chains

325
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,980
was the Bronze Door.

326
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,679
Hurry up.

327
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,789
The environment

328
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,010
was similar to what we saw just now.

329
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,050
So, I suspect

330
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,709
the large door

331
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,420
we are looking for
in the snowy mountains

332
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,330
is inside the depths of the crack.

333
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,679
Does it mean

334
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,989
Night King is down there?

335
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,900
If my guess is right,

336
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,370
we are very near to the goal.

337
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,159
The Denaxi people
suffered heavy casualties.

338
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,050
They are mentally broken now

339
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,180
and can't go forward anymore.

340
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,159
After this,

341
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,570
we must be extremely careful.

342
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,010
Mr. Wu.

343
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,749
My boss

344
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,029
is asking you to have a talk

345
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,850
to discuss the plans afterwards.

346
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,119
Let's talk

347
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,469
when your team members have rested.

348
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,330
We should talk first.

349
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,789
It'll only take you a few minutes.

350
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,090
Are we close?

351
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,980
Ask Feng to talk to us.

352
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,260
Feng!

353
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,460
Where's Feng?

354
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,199
Since you are

355
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,740
not showing any sincerity,

356
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,420
there's no need to chat anymore.

357
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,900
Let's go.

358
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,509
Get him!

359
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,180
We can't let Wu Xie kill Night King!
It's our trophy!

360
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,469
Quickly!

361
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,740
Stop them!

362
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,399
Haixing, take Wu Xie with you.

363
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,959
I'll stop them.

364
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,980
We will go together.

365
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,199
They are right ahead!

366
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,879
Go!

367
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,180
Be careful.

368
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,770
Hurry.

369
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,850
Where are they?

370
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,900
Sir, they blocked the entrance!

371
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,599
The Zhang's Clan
knows they're in our way.

372
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,740
Find them!

373
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,420
Be careful.

374
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,740
Let's go.

375
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,069
Naive.

376
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,220
Let me catch my breath.

377
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,500
Let me catch my breath.

378
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,140
I knew that guy

379
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,140
wasn't any good.

380
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,900
I didn't expect

381
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,740
him to be so arrogant

382
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,530
when his arm

383
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,660
was already gone.

384
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,050
Do you think he killed Feng?

385
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,530
I don't think so.

386
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,900
If Feng is really dead,

387
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,140
every mercenary

388
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,010
won't get any money.

389
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,260
Hans has only abducted Feng

390
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,980
to complete his mission.

391
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,159
He won't hurt Feng.

392
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,420
Zhang

393
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,010
is useful.

394
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,810
He is righteous.

395
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,679
The Zhangs

396
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,570
are really decent people.

397
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,740
He is worried about your brother.

398
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,740
You better succeed.

399
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,159
Otherwise, the end result

400
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,309
might be more pointless than you think.

401
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,740
Don't worry too much.

402
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,220
Your brother

403
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,700
is good at fighting
and adapts well to any situation.

404
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,370
I'm sure he will survive.

405
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,570
I am thinking

406
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,959
if we do find the Bronze Door

407
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,570
after going forward,

408
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,199
how can we open the door

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,199
since I don't have

410
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,509
the Ghost Seal with me?

411
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,900
We've carried it all the way here.

412
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,660
Why can't the Heavenly Staff be used
to open the door?

413
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,180
You are right.

414
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,980
Of course.

415
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,180
Since Qiling said the Heavenly Staff is
a key item to defeating the Night King,

416
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,440
it must have a special use.

417
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,140
We should find the Bronze Door first.

418
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,980
Be careful.

419
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,740
Careful.

420
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,010
Let's go.

421
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,610
I'm fine.

422
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,090
Walk slowly.

423
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,570
We've walked for half a day.

424
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,879
There's nothing here besides rocks.

425
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,789
Wu Xie,

426
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,549
did you make a wrong judgment?

427
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,460
There's nothing here.

428
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,679
Is there a traffic jam?

429
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,220
The Zhang Clan cannot be praised at all.

430
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,300
You're so pampered.

431
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,420
You are already complaining
after walking for a few steps.

432
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,020
Do you think it's easy
to visit Night King?

433
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,980
Overtake her.

434
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,530
Hurry.

435
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,140
Let's keep moving forward.

436
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,330
A mission left behind by Qiling

437
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,420
can't be completed so easily.

438
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,660
Quick.

439
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,610
I'm skinnier than him.

440
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,180
What?
You're not letting me overtake you?

441
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,850
In Qiling's notes,

442
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,180
he mentioned Dong Can
being crushed into a ball

443
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,460
after Night King killed him.

444
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,090
These people

445
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,570
probably met Night King as well.

446
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,260
We are really

447
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,010
getting closer to Night King.

448
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,460
Should we go back

449
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,090
or not?

450
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,180
Be careful.

451
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,530
We'll have to die in the end.

452
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,050
I'll risk my life

453
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,850
to follow Naive.

454
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,660
Old Woman,

455
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,570
don't you have anything nutritious
to eat at your age?

456
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,770
You have good teeth.

457
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,050
How can you enjoy this?

458
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,420
It's almost time.

459
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,260
Let's pack up and leave.

460
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,280
Is this real?

461
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,439
(Yunding Heavenly Palace, Bronze Door)

462
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,090
This isn't the Bronze Door
Qiling entered, right?

463
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,980
Wu Xie.

464
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,919
Door.

465
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,290
How odd.

466
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,810
There's really a second Bronze Door

467
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,090
in this world.

468
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,090
Who built this?

469
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,900
Why was it built?

470
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,199
This seems to be made

471
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,140
with the same material
as the Heavenly Staff.

472
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,850
It is very dense.

473
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,900
Fatty,

474
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,660
take the Heavenly Staff out of my bag.

475
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,260
Let's give it a try.

476
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,469
What are you doing?

477
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,570
Are you trying to see
if this door is electrified?

478
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,839
How can you fool around
with this holy artefact?

479
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,199
I don't know how to use it. Try it.

480
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,980
Go away!

481
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,370
Open sesame!

482
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,090
Haixing is jumping around.

483
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,810
Where did you go? Are you a swallow?

484
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,100
It's tightly sealed on top.

485
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,799
That's weird.

486
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,260
According to the tribe's record
of the Bronze Door,

487
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,970
the door is extremely heavy.

488
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,439
It has been pressing
on the rock surface.

489
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,810
After a long time,
it will sink into the rock surface.

490
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,770
There will be a gap appearing on top.

491
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,500
However,
there are no gaps for this door.

492
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,580
Is it possible

493
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,839
that this door

494
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,180
isn't that heavy?

495
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,220
Or

496
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,850
the foundation has been specially made?

497
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,890
If it's not that heavy,

498
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,370
it might be empty in the middle.

499
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,810
Fatty!

500
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,020
Come and take a look here.

501
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,850
Look.

502
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,540
The color of this piece
and the colour of the piece next to it.

503
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,970
It has been repaired.

504
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,260
The bronze hasn't been
rusting for a long time.

505
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,260
Only a few decades have passed.

506
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,850
A few decades?

507
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,140
Perhaps Qiling did this.

508
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,759
Qiling is good

509
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,799
at repairing things.

510
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,879
There's no need to worry.

511
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,450
He can find jobs when he comes out.

512
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,810
Come on. This is just an itch
that needs to be scratched.

513
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,740
Fatty, why do you have this?

514
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,290
I got it from Hans during the chaos.

515
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,439
This is under the mountain.

516
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,109
If the impact of the bomb goes upwards

517
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,469
and blasts the rocks down,

518
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,260
we will be crushed before the door.

519
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,620
Do I need to introduce myself to you?

520
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,719
I am the Explosive Prince,

521
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,839
Handsome Boom Fatty

522
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,669
in the legends.

523
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,149
I am standing right in front of you!

524
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,729
We've been working together
for a few days no

525
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,149
but you still don't know who I am?

526
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,669
I'm different from other fatties.

527
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,469
Anywhere I blast will bring us victory!

528
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,330
Fine, you decide.

529
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,580
We don't know
what's inside the Bronze Door.

530
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,719
Perhaps Night King will wake up soon.

531
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,370
Wu Xie, we don't have time to lose.

532
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,549
If Night King is still asleep,

533
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,399
blasting it

534
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,879
might wake him up.

535
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,970
Fatty.

536
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,669
How long does it take

537
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,439
for Night King

538
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,700
to go from waking up from its slumber
to completely waking up?

539
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,959
If it doesn't throw a tantrum,
it takes some time for it to wake up.

540
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,359
It is a king.

541
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,500
It needs to sleep in.

542
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,859
- What if it throws a tantrum?
- It should throw a tantrum at you.

543
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,500
- That means it is grumpy when it wakes up.
- Are you saying it will fart?

544
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,589
Do you know what time is it?

545
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,189
Can you two be serious?

546
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,580
We have always been serious, Swallow.

547
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,490
Fatty, there's no time to think.
Let's take a gamble.

548
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,450
If Night King is still asleep,

549
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,279
we will go in

550
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,656
and kill it in its sleep.

551
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:39,490
If it is awake...

552
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,410
Explosives.

553
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,290
Come. Let's take a group picture.

554
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,100
Let's hope for a huge blessing!

555
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,100
Congratulations!

556
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,440
With your experience,
do you think it can be blasted open?

557
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,970
If the door is solid, it won't open no matter
how many explosives we use. It's coming.

558
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,810
Two, three, one. Blast!

559
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,330
Has it exploded?

560
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,770
Is it a dud?

561
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,540
Fatty, be careful.

562
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,109
Oh no.

563
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,359
My face.

564
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,580
Don't move.

565
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,490
My beautiful face
that I use to make a living.

566
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,359
Fatty, don't panic.

567
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,399
This thing isn't corrosive

568
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,850
to the skin.

569
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,509
Slowly.

570
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,439
Does it hurt?

571
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,490
No.

572
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,970
Slowly.

573
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,060
It has been removed.

574
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,989
You are really careless.

575
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,540
How can you take a peek
at the explosive?

576
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,140
You should get it off immediately.

577
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,319
That scared me.

578
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,970
I thought I'd be disfigured.

579
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,850
Naive, it's open.

580
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,989
Why is there

581
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,509
so much weird mud inside?

582
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,029
The mud flowed out from inside.

583
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,189
Thankfully, it went
into the crevices on the surface.

584
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,020
Otherwise, we would be dead

585
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,020
from drowning in the mud.

586
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,490
This mountain creek is deep.

587
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,700
The falling rocks fell

588
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,020
and filled the cracks.

589
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,410
It became the surface
we are stepping on now.

590
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,490
Otherwise,

591
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,839
we can't reach the Bronze Door

592
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,540
in the middle of the mountain.

593
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,669
It's weird.

594
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,580
The Bronze Door didn't have mud

595
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,970
when it was opened
at the Yunding Heavenly Palace.

596
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,759
The situation has changed.

597
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,100
The Bronze Door

598
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,770
has a bad stomach now.

599
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,140
Let me treat it for you.

600
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,700
Be careful.

601
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,220
Qiling's repair wasn't that great.

602
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,370
It got blasted open so easily.

603
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,020
There's no movement inside.

604
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,490
Night King is sleeping soundly.

605
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,700
It can't be awakened

606
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,770
by such a loud alarm.

607
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,149
Let's get it over with.
Everyone, be careful.

608
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,290
