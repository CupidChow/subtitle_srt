=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 18=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,700
The people from the back hills

5
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,210
can only accept

6
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,980
the people who bring the token out
as genuine members of the Zhang family.

7
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,510
(There are only weird jars
like these here.)

8
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,680
(It seems like these are the tokens
to be brought out.)

9
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,190
(The Fire God descends.)

10
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,750
(This is the test set up by
the members of the Zhang family.)

11
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
An illusion.

12
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,980
This is an illusion.

13
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,210
An illusion. This is an illusion!

14
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,440
(Who dragged me back here?)

15
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,190
(Why am I back at the starting point?)

16
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,800
(What is the meaning of this?)

17
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,890
An illusion.

18
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
This is also an illusion.

19
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,880
(Again.)

20
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,970
It's happening again.

21
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,290
I can do it.

22
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,170
♪Junior Third Master♪

23
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,930
♪Walk forward bravely♪

24
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,050
♪Walk forward♪

25
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,740
♪Don't look back♪

26
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,220
Don't worry.

27
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,020
The illusion of the flames

28
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,460
comes from the hexagonal bell powder
inside the jar.

29
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,620
Are you the acting patriarch
of the Zhang family?

30
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,170
I used to be.

31
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,620
It was you

32
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,290
who made Zhang Qiling
into what he is now.

33
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,360
Zhang Qiling made the choice

34
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,040
to inherit the position
of the Zhang family's patriarch.

35
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,530
I only provided him with a possibility.

36
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,100
Keep these grandiose excuses
to yourself.

37
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,330
You were only finding a way out

38
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,500
for your selfishness.

39
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
What about you?

40
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
In order to investigate
Zhang Qiling's past,

41
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
you insisted on coming here.

42
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,650
You created trouble

43
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,260
and put the people around you in danger.

44
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
What do you call

45
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,380
your actions then?

46
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,050
You know what happened on the outside?

47
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,980
I don't care what you think.

48
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,930
Every choice I made

49
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,100
was the right one.

50
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,290
Sacrificing a person

51
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,980
for the whole Zhang family's freedom.

52
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,930
It is the best choice

53
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,290
for both Zhang Qiling
and the Zhang family.

54
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,100
All of them

55
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,260
obtained what they wanted.

56
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,810
So,

57
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,930
if I was given another chance,

58
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,100
I would still do the same.

59
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
Meanwhile,

60
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,050
you are just an ordinary person.

61
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,740
Whether you get it or not

62
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,380
is not important.

63
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,140
But he had too much burden on him.

64
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
He could have

65
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,140
a completely different life.

66
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,620
He sought the path on his own.

67
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,890
He wanted a life like that.

68
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,530
That was his destiny.

69
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,770
Tell me what you want.

70
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,810
I am Wu Xie.

71
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,260
I am Zhang Qiling's friend.

72
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,930
I need your help

73
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,740
to rescue my friends
who were captured by Zhang Nian.

74
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,170
Sure.

75
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,930
I can give you the Cloud-piercing Beacon

76
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,380
to call for the Zhang family members
scattered at Niles.

77
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,460
However, many years have passed.

78
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,890
They no longer care about
the Zhang family matters.

79
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I don't know

80
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,260
if people are still willing

81
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,777
to listen to Zhang Qiling's orders.

82
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,810
So,

83
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,290
you need to be prepared
to have no one to help you.

84
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,530
Even so,

85
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,100
I still need to give it a try.

86
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,500
Know this.

87
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,810
Even if they accept your invitation,

88
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,620
they also do it to help Zhang Qiling.

89
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,100
However, Zhang Qiling

90
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,410
isn't here.

91
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,140
What if

92
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,650
Zhang Qiling

93
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,260
can appear here?

94
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
Zhang Nian,

95
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,810
your poison
is quite effective this time.

96
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,530
It seems like

97
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,930
you haven't suffered enough

98
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,860
from what Zhang Qiling did back then.

99
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,740
You are still helping him now?

100
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,860
Zhang Haike,

101
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,530
is this foolish loyalty

102
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,650
or do you have another goal in mind?

103
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,570
The Night King as well.

104
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,690
Why don't I know

105
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,810
about some invisible Night King there?

106
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,890
Didn't you keep it a secret from Feng

107
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,500
about what was there too?

108
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,860
I was too lazy to explain to them.

109
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,500
The legend of Night King
is more convenient for me.

110
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,620
However, I'm the bad guy.

111
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,690
Why do you lie
when you are the good guy?

112
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,570
Don't you want Wu Xie to know the truth?

113
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,410
Perhaps I think

114
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,380
it's not time yet.

115
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,810
They came

116
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,050
to find you as well, right?

117
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,170
As expected.

118
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,890
Zhang Jiuri was the only one
who refused among us.

119
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,770
My first information

120
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,260
was also obtained from them.

121
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,380
I only made a deal with them.

122
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,570
Meanwhile,

123
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,380
did you, Zhang Haike,

124
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,740
and your sister

125
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,290
betray them

126
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,860
and go to that faction?

127
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,340
What are they trying to do?

128
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
You won't tell me?

129
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,220
Both of us know what the Zhang family will do
in this circumstance.

130
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,290
I don't want to use it
on a former friend of mine.

131
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,410
If it goes any deeper,

132
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,500
I will stab your vein.

133
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,380
If you don't tell me,

134
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,980
the next person
will be your younger sister.

135
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,340
Feng,

136
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,740
We are close in private.

137
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
I think you are quite nice.

138
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,100
I'll treat you to a meal later.

139
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,890
We have obtained the Heavenly Staff.

140
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,420
I won't trouble you.

141
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,660
We are scientists,

142
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,850
not murderers.

143
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,770
That's great.

144
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Forget about me

145
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,420
and go rescue Naive.

146
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,330
We accept our loss
and we'll go back to Wuzhou.

147
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,810
We didn't find his body.

148
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,500
He should still be alive.

149
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,980
However, he can't do anything alone.

150
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,980
What did I say?

151
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,740
Nothing will happen to Naive.

152
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,320
Isn't it always the same
for the main character of a movie?

153
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,000
He will surely have the last laugh.

154
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,020
The same might not happen
for the advisor you hired.

155
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,850
He is here to harm you.

156
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,460
Feng,

157
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm reminding you as a friend.

158
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,240
Don't end up getting nothing
and even sacrificing your life instead.

159
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,700
This is a special drug we create.

160
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,330
It relaxes your leg muscles.

161
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,180
It'll be difficult for you to stand
for about half a month.

162
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,330
This is to make sure

163
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,370
that you don't spoil our plans.

164
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,980
Julia.

165
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,330
Feng, Naive is going to counter soon.

166
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,570
The final result

167
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,900
hasn't been decided yet.

168
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,090
Don't inject me with the drug first.
Wait half a day more.

169
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,220
Why don't we make a bet?

170
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,530
If Naive comes to save me in half a day,

171
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,770
I will tell him to forget
about what happened in the past.

172
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,850
What do you think?

173
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,610
Give yourself a way out, Feng.

174
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,260
As soon as his blood pressure
stabilizes, give him the injection.

175
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,420
Feng,

176
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,740
I'm reminding you
for one last time. Feng!

177
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,810
You need to choose us.

178
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,370
We abandon you halfway at most
but they will kill you.

179
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,220
Feng!

180
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,610
Feng, we are true friends!

181
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,330
I'm doing this for your own good!

182
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,180
This is an international friendship!

183
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,290
A fate that stems from 500 years ago!

184
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,980
Mr. Zhang,

185
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,700
Zhang Haike is still valuable to me.

186
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,850
Please don't kill him.

187
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,500
Mr. Feng,

188
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,740
no need to care about him.

189
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,500
He only has

190
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,610
some entertainment value to me.

191
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,770
Wu Xie is the key now.

192
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,050
He is missing now.

193
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,700
I don't know what he will do.

194
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,370
We must be very cautious

195
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,420
if we want to go against him.

196
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,810
Before we enter the snow mountains,

197
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,020
we must find Wu Xie.

198
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,050
(This is a signal
to gather the Zhang family.)

199
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,330
(If the members of the Zhang family
are willing to help you,)

200
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,530
(they will respond with fireworks)

201
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,770
(when they reach Dejia.)

202
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,740
(Luck is still with you.)

203
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,290
(That was why you weren't killed
by the knife.)

204
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,570
(Just wait for a while.)

205
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,660
My men have searched

206
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,810
the nearby areas.

207
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,370
They didn't find Wu Xie.

208
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,130
Maybe he's dead.

209
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,500
Is there a festival today?

210
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,610
There are no festivals today.

211
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,370
What's wrong?

212
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
This is a signal
for the Zhang family to take action.

213
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,180
We know that these people
start to gather up

214
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,130
after they see all the fireworks.

215
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,260
They are moving towards us
and they are moving fast.

216
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,370
It's the main Zhang family.

217
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,570
How is that possible?

218
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,330
Aren't they living in seclusion?

219
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,940
Don't tell me...

220
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,610
Impossible.

221
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,220
He should still be
inside the Bronze Door.

222
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,460
Hey,

223
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,700
zoom in on that.

224
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,810
The line has been cut off.

225
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,260
Switch to another one.

226
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,130
Yes, Sir.

227
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,850
It's impossible.

228
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,220
Zhang Qiling is a lone wolf.

229
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,290
He will never use a Sky-piercing Beacon.

230
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,220
Why?

231
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I know him.

232
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,940
He will never appear in this manner.

233
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,500
The person
who will appear in this manner

234
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,500
is Wu Xie.

235
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,610
That's impossible.

236
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,740
The Zhang family members of Niles
have never acted outside for a long time.

237
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,660
How did Wu Xie invite them successfully?

238
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,220
No worries.

239
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,570
I'll let my men to increase the defense.

240
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,700
With our weaponry,

241
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,700
no matter how tough they are,

242
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,420
they are not bulletproof.

243
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,330
Okay.

244
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,330
Sir, we are back online.

245
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,700
Mr. Zhang,

246
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,050
what are our plans after this?

247
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,700
We have the Heavenly Staff.

248
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,770
There's no need to confront them.

249
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,600
I'll go and get rid
of every document here.

250
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,120
We should depart to the snow mountains
as soon as possible.

251
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,329
(That's impossible.
The Zhang family members of Niles)

252
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,179
(have never acted outside
for a long time.)

253
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,430
(How did Wu Xie invite them successfully?)

254
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,850
Boss.

255
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,500
That guy is pretty nervous.

256
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Could it be
he's just looking for a pretext

257
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,290
to get rid of us?

258
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,810
He already fooled us once.

259
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,290
We cannot trust him.

260
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,020
Keep an eye on him.

261
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,660
I want to talk to you.

262
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,850
What are you doing?

263
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,810
Try this side. Try again.

264
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,940
Can't you do it on the other side?
Try over that side!

265
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,660
Try...

266
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,090
I'm not working with you!
I have high blood pressure!

267
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,810
Again!

268
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,330
Again!

269
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,770
Julia,

270
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,260
don't inject him yet.

271
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,260
Tell him I take his bet.

272
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,180
Yes.

273
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,700
The last incident is over.

274
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,420
I've told you
I'm not interested in Wu Xie.

275
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,370
Why are you still looking for me?

276
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,570
He's back.

277
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,660
Is this him?

278
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,370
Whether this is him or not.

279
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,500
Do you have an answer?

280
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,370
Give me some time.

281
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,530
What do you think?

282
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,500
Is it him?

283
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,130
I can only tell you

284
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,900
when I see him in person.

285
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,500
You can't recognise him?

286
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,180
You are already terrified
whether it's him or not.

287
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,370
Just run.

288
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,330
This time,

289
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,220
I will never run again.

290
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,090
Jiuri,

291
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,460
if he is really Zhang Qiling,

292
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,810
how confident are you about winning?

293
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,940
Understand the situation.

294
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,130
Zhang Qiling is bringing
a group of Zhang family members.

295
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,560
We can talk about my chance of winning
when you can bring me to him.

296
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,460
Deal.

297
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,850
I will distract the others

298
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,740
and let you meet Zhang Qiling alone.

299
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,220
Pick one.

300
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,260
What's the situation outside?

301
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Nothing. It's just the fog.

302
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,850
It's the Zhang's clan!

303
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,420
Dispatch all our men.

304
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,740
Seal off the gate.

305
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,090
Clan? What clan?

306
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,700
They are just a bunch of pricks.

307
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,940
This way.

308
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,530
Be careful.

309
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,050
They must be here.

310
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,980
Found them.

311
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,570
Watch your six.

312
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,020
This way. Come on.

313
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,940
Copy that.

314
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,380
I'm searching the ground floor.

315
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,170
Unit A. Unit B. Do you read me?

316
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,250
What's your status?

317
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,980
Do you copy?

318
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,980
Unit A. Unit B. Do you copy?

319
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
Report your status.

320
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
Do you copy?

321
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,730
Do you copy?

322
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,860
Mr. Zhang,

323
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,130
I have no intention
of becoming your enemy.

324
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,500
We can have a discussion about this.

325
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,900
Where are they?

326
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,420
Mr. Wang, Zhang Haike, and his sister

327
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,900
should already be
controlled by Zhang Nian.

328
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,650
I didn't see Zhang Nian

329
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,820
but your friends

330
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,570
should still be in the base.

331
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,650
Mr. Zhang,

332
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,460
perhaps we can make a deal.

333
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,690
We will help you with the problem
of Night King Devours The Sky

334
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,730
as long as you give me
the right to study Night King.

335
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,130
Zhang Qiling,

336
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,170
it has been a long time.

337
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,860
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

338
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,020
Let's end this.

339
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,390
(He's really an idiot
after he has been entranced.)

340
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,430
(Is Qiling that strong)

341
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,320
(in his opinion?)

342
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,610
No.

343
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,730
These are not the right eyes.

344
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,940
You are not Zhang Qiling.

345
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,650
Who are you?

346
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,050
It's you?

347
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,610
Is it him?

348
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,420
Yes.

349
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,020
Did you kill him?

350
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,250
You can defeat Zhang Jiuri.

351
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,250
It really is you.

352
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,170
Zhang Qiling,

353
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,860
after all these years,

354
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,500
I've finally killed you.

355
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,500
Zhang Nian.

356
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:27,602
You are still the same.

357
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,690
You would do anything
to achieve your goal.

358
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,020
You are seriously injured.

359
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,610
With my years of experience as a doctor,

360
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,500
you will die

361
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,050
in one hour.

362
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,340
I know you don't like to die.

363
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,050
Enjoy your final moments.

364
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,090
Zhang Qiling!

365
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,090
