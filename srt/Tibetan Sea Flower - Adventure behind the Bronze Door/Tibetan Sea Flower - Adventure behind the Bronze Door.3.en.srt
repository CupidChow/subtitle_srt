00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 3=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,315
(There's a lot of
miscellaneous stuff here.)

5
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,714
(There are many drawings and notes
that I don't understand.)

6
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:00,795
(I searched for a long time,)

7
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,253
(and finally found things
about Qiling's childhood)

8
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:05,554
(among some scrolls.)

9
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,795
(The Zhang family is
a very mysterious clan.)

10
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,035
(Their skills are extraordinary,)

11
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,355
(and their family rules
are extremely strict.)

12
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:21,355
(They are somewhat like the mysterious
martial arts family in kung fu novels.)

13
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,114
(The Zhang family has
a test called "wilding".)

14
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:30,133
(Wilding means that the Zhang family's children
who are turning into their adulthood)

15
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,674
(go out to explore
and eliminate the evildoers,)

16
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,195
(to obtain a weapon that suits them.)

17
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,154
(The rarer the weapon they acquire,)

18
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,195
(the more it can prove his status
in the family in the future.)

19
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,600
(Many years ago, during the period
when Zhang Qiling had his wilding)

20
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:52,994
Brother,

21
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,734
these few poor kids

22
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,394
have nothing but a few broken baskets.

23
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,635
What should I do?

24
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,834
What to do?

25
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,075
Make us to death.

26
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:07,714
Get a new buddy

27
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:08,853
to train his gut.

28
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:09,454
Alright.

29
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,595
My fellow buddies,

30
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,235
get on your horses.

31
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,714
You're chosen!

32
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:17,874
Go!

33
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,155
Kill them for me.

34
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:27,573
Brat!

35
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:28,874
What do you mean by staring at me?

36
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,434
Don't you feel afraid
that I'll kill you?

37
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,754
You can try.

38
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:38,994
Useless!

39
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,253
Have you never killed a chicken?

40
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:47,715
Or can't you even bend your finger?

41
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:49,160
Just one pull of the trigger.

42
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,600
Isn't it easier than killing a chicken?

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,715
Hurry up!

44
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,035
Grab your weapons.

45
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,314
Zhang Haike worries about his sister.

46
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,213
Zhang Haike, you coward.

47
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,160
Zhang Haike, you big coward.

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,434
Your sister is braver than you are!

49
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,704
Our dinner is relying on you now.

50
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:33,373
(Young Zhang Jiuri)

51
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,654
It's just killing bandits.

52
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:36,479
(Young Zhang Haike)
Why did you have to drag us here to take a look?

53
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,955
If the elders in the clan find out,

54
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:38,893
they will scold us.

55
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,114
Who says so?

56
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,414
(Young Zhang Nian)
The Zhang family has no rules for wilding.

57
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,414
Moreover,

58
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,480
for the shot earlier,

59
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,280
I could have dodged the bullet
just by tilting my head.

60
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,440
(Young Zhang Haixing)
Why did you help me?

61
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,715
You looked down on me so much.

62
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,114
He was behind you.

63
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:53,994
If you had dodged, he would have died.

64
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,840
Anyway, he has no parents.

65
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,773
Following us on wilding
would be death for him anyway.

66
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,373
It's better to let him die quickly.

67
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,955
What a lousy brat!

68
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,813
If it weren't for Zhang Haike,
you'd have already died.

69
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:07,640
You're holding us back,
making no progress at all.

70
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,213
You're such a jinx.

71
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,795
No wonder everyone hates you.

72
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:14,534
Fine.

73
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:15,893
Then let the old maid and the jinx

74
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,133
settle the mess.

75
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,434
We have important matters to do.

76
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:19,715
Let's go.

77
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,813
Brother, are you sure that he knows
where to get the top-quality weapons?

78
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:27,955
I'm sure.

79
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,634
I'll try to figure it out from him.

80
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,795
Take anything that suits you.

81
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,475
You'll need it during the wilding.

82
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:01,874
Bring less food.

83
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,074
This is your first time on wilding.

84
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:19,674
Aren't you afraid?

85
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:24,094
Brat,

86
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,275
do you even understand the
wilding rules of the Zhang family?

87
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:28,955
Where are you going?

88
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,654
I heard that some squads have already
obtained the weapons and returned home.

89
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,955
Some have even invented their own.

90
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,434
We've been out for so long
and have nothing obtained still.

91
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:38,554
Are you hiding something?

92
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,035
Please share it.

93
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:43,674
You always keep silent.

94
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,155
Are you mute?

95
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:47,373
You're from the main family.

96
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:48,715
We're from a branch family.

97
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,835
Our status is much lower than yours.

98
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,560
I never get the chance to interact
with someone from the main family.

99
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,693
You're the first.

100
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:55,955
Let's be friends.

101
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,595
The New Year is drawing near.

102
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,573
We've just finished an act of chivalry,
but still haven't found any weapons.

103
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,934
If we don't finish this wilding soon,
we're all doomed.

104
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,595
You know where to get
the good stuff, right?

105
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:12,155
We're destined to meet each other.

106
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:13,754
Just tell us.

107
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:18,915
The place I know
that has weapons is prohibited.

108
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,155
If we can't finish wilding,
we're really doomed.

109
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,040
No matter how dangerous, we have to go.

110
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:26,654
Don't worry.

111
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:27,693
We won't blame you.

112
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,400
If anything happens,
we'll take responsibility.

113
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:30,795
Let's make a promise.

114
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,034
Let me see this.

115
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,453
(Ma'an Village)
Ma'an Village?

116
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,654
This is just a run-down village.

117
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,235
Could it possibly have
good knives or guns?

118
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:46,914
The place I'm talking about
isn't Ma'an village.

119
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,315
It's beneath Ma'an Village.

120
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,435
There's a very dangerous place there.

121
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:52,675
If you want to go,

122
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,394
you're sure to die.

123
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,034
We haven't even found the place yet,
and you're already saying we'll die.

124
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,355
How dangerous is it?

125
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:01,835
Tell us.

126
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:03,835
I come across

127
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:06,675
this place by chance
in a secret family scroll.

128
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,134
In Ma'an Village,

129
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,480
beneath this spot,

130
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,054
there buried the heritage
of the Zhang family.

131
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,555
It's called the Zhang Family Castle.

132
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,034
It's said that,

133
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:18,315
before we moved to the northeast,

134
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,994
that was where our family gathered.

135
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,134
There are many famous knives
and guns hidden inside,

136
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,595
along with secret scrolls.

137
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,514
But these things
are protected by very powerful traps.

138
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,235
Back in the day,
many martial arts masters

139
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,195
couldn't break these traps.

140
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,634
Now, the Zhang Family Castle
has long been buried by a mudslide.

141
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,595
No one knows what
the situation is beneath there.

142
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,835
One wrong step,

143
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:45,034
and you could trigger a deadly trap.

144
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,835
Unless you're in an urge,

145
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:51,675
you shouldn't go there.

146
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,315
That means, the more dangerous it is,
the better the stuff inside.

147
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,715
I'm definitely

148
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,794
going to this place.

149
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:10,693
So, that means

150
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,294
as long as we can avoid those traps,

151
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,054
then we can obtain any weapon there

152
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,613
and end our wilding journey.

153
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:16,835
Am I right, brat?

154
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,634
Brother,

155
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,200
he just offered us a location

156
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,720
that enabled him to
finish the wilding with us.

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,054
That's just too favorable for him.

158
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:28,774
Since we already knew the location,

159
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,355
why don't we just kick him off?

160
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,555
Finishing the wilding
is the most crucial aim now.

161
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:34,555
You can just take him as our labor.

162
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,634
Whether he lives or dies
after we go inside,

163
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,514
that's up to his own fate.

164
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,534
There are so many rules in our clan.

165
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,894
This is the only chance
we can stand out.

166
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:45,374
Everybody, it relies on
our own ability later.

167
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,493
Don't expect anyone to go easy on you.

168
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,654
Who's going easy on you?

169
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,435
Don't end up being the first to die.

170
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,955
How boastful you are!
Let's see what happens.

171
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,134
Taking the strange rock of Xishan
as the center,

172
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,555
go 80 zhang to the south,

173
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:37,994
and you will find
the Zhang Family Castle.

174
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:41,835
Has no one in Ma'an Village
ever discovered it?

175
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,160
(Ma Mansion)
Zhang Family Castle is buried deep.

176
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,894
Ordinary people can't get down there.

177
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:47,440
It's better if no one has realised it.

178
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,613
We can find a hidden spot

179
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,355
and figure out how to get inside there.

180
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:15,514
What happened with
the mudslide back then?

181
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,675
The whole town was buried.

182
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,595
That must be a very enormous one.

183
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,075
The mudslide affected a very large area.

184
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,754
No one knows the exact details.

185
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:25,813
Everyone around here was killed.

186
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,914
That's why we moved
to the northeast then?

187
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:29,715
I've never heard the elders mention it.

188
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:31,034
They didn't mention it

189
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,595
because they were afraid
we young ones would take the risk.

190
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,034
Maybe what happened back then
was complicated.

191
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:03,914
There's a passageway here.

192
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:06,160
Looks like someone has been here before.

193
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:08,555
Get your weapons ready.

194
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:09,835
Keep a sharp eye.

195
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:20,034
Could it be that another squad
got here first?

196
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,514
No.

197
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:22,733
This passageway

198
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,595
looks like it has been dug
for some time.

199
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,835
Maybe it was dug by
the rescuers back then.

200
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:28,754
I don't think it was for rescue.

201
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,040
More like someone was
taking advantage of the situation.

202
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,274
Brat, you better not be lying to us.

203
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,914
I'll kill him if he dares.

204
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,595
Are you afraid now?

205
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:20,154
Look!

206
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,680
The Zhang Family Castle
must be down there, right?

207
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:31,914
Can you guys see what's down there?

208
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,034
It seems to be an empty room.

209
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,955
Who's getting down first?

210
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:40,154
Haixing.

211
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,715
I can go.

212
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:45,154
Let the jinx go first for us.

213
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,675
Brat.

214
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,154
What is it like down there?

215
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,475
(This room)

216
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,914
(is upside down.)

217
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,955
Is this the Zhang Family Castle?

218
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,514
This is inverted.

219
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:08,354
This is the strangest room
I've ever seen.

220
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,013
I've seen square rooms, round rooms,

221
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,614
and even suspended rooms,

222
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,155
but I've never seen one
that's built upside down.

223
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:16,994
Could it be because of the mudslide

224
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:19,414
that flipped the whole room upside down?

225
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,115
If it was due to the mudslide,

226
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,395
the stuff on top should have fallen.

227
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,174
These objects

228
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,773
couldn't possibly be
hanging upside down.

229
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:27,955
I know why.

230
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:31,053
This is so-called
'Heaven as Earth, Earth as Heaven'.

231
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,915
- This is a room that fuses Heaven and Earth.
- Shut up!

232
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,374
Don't make jokes.

233
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,854
Have you forgotten the family rules?

234
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,475
Do you want to make it out alive?

235
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,754
So, what brilliant idea do you have?

236
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:44,435
I think that although the
arrangement of this room are strange,

237
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:46,675
they are actually

238
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,213
just decoys.

239
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,435
What do you mean?

240
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,574
This room looks like an armoury,

241
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,854
but it's upside down.

242
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,213
It makes people think
that these weapons must be very unique,

243
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:57,395
causing them to spend
a lot of effort here.

244
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,200
But, if you look closely,

245
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,435
you'll find the quality of
these weapons are pretty ordinary.

246
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:05,213
So this room is most likely a decoy
used to protect the weapons and scrolls

247
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,453
of Zhang Family Castle
at the deeper region.

248
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,834
Is there a passageway
leading deeper inside?

249
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:11,013
Let's search for it quickly.

250
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:12,675
These people died in a very strange way.

251
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:22,994
They've been dead a long time.

252
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,800
It looks like their bodies
were hurt by something,

253
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,915
making them die from infection.

254
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,693
I think that they must have

255
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,235
accidentally triggered some mechanisms

256
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,814
while staying here,

257
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,195
and it killed them.

258
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:41,594
It seems that this room was
meant to guard against thieves,

259
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:45,354
to prevent anyone from stealing the weapons
and scrolls of Zhang Family Castle.

260
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,934
Let's be careful
and find the passageway.

261
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:51,680
We must avoid triggering
any trap mechanism.

262
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,794
Don't get caught in the trap.

263
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,354
Did you find the passageway?

264
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,554
No.

265
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,754
I didn't find anything either.

266
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,134
Not even a door.

267
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,235
Are we going to have
to go home empty-handed?

268
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,955
Brother,

269
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,875
how did a right-side-up
bronze horse suddenly appear here?

270
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:36,955
There's a hole in the horse's body.

271
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:01,195
Look,

272
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,354
the distance between these corpses

273
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,955
and the horse seems significant.

274
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:07,994
It looks like they got here

275
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,435
and couldn't go any further.

276
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,600
There are all sorts of
mechanisms and wires inside.

277
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,794
It seems that

278
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:25,414
this bronze horse

279
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,514
is the defense mechanism of this room.

280
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,354
So,

281
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,293
these fools must have been killed

282
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,574
while trying to obtain the weapons.

283
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:34,800
So, does that mean we'll be safe

284
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,614
once we disable the mechanism
in this bronze horse?

285
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:37,814
Stop wasting time.

286
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,894
- Just go ahead and check it out.
- No way!

287
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:41,955
The wires inside this
bronze horse are complex.

288
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,514
I bet there are interconnected traps

289
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,115
in the nearby ground and walls.

290
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:49,834
We should better watch out.

291
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:51,554
Let's use the steel ropes.

292
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,493
This brat has done nothing
since just now.

293
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:57,693
He's just wandering around.

294
00:21:57,694 --> 00:22:00,293
But we're risking our lives here.
Why should we take him along?

295
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:01,475
Kick him out.

296
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:02,654
After all,

297
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,134
he did lead us to this place.

298
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:05,013
Leave him be.

299
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:06,034
No way!

300
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:07,894
This brat has done nothing at all.

301
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,293
He must be weak in skills.

302
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,453
If we run into danger,
we still have to save him.

303
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:13,074
Why should we bring him along?

304
00:22:14,575 --> 00:22:17,034
Don't do anything rash.
Let's dismantle the mechanism first.

305
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:18,635
Let's do it.

306
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:43,374
You brat.

307
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,514
Don't mess around. Get down now.

308
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:50,235
Don't move.

309
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,594
Don't cause any vibrations.

310
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:55,715
What's wrong?

311
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,115
What kind of mechanism?

312
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,840
This is a variant of
the Eighteen Strings mechanism,

313
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,754
and it's much more complicated.

314
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,395
Just as I expected.

315
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,560
I've heard the elders mention
the Eighteen Strings.

316
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,675
To dismantle this kind of
trap mechanism,

317
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,614
you have to remove all the tiny beads

318
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:33,915
at the bottom of the strings.

319
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:36,675
However, these beads
are placed on a disc.

320
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,493
A slight vibration will cause the beads
to roll off from the disc

321
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:40,715
and hit the strings.

322
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,514
Each string triggers a different trap.

323
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,894
If a bead hits ten strings,

324
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:47,834
it will trigger
ten traps simultaneously,

325
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:49,693
with no discernible pattern.

326
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:51,235
How many strings are there?

327
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:53,754
Over a hundred.

328
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:55,554
This type of mechanism

329
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:57,475
is something even
our elders couldn't handle.

330
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,435
I've seen this mechanism

331
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:03,733
in the main family house,
so I know a little about it.

332
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,554
Stop bluffing. Don't believe him.

333
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:08,675
Can you really do this on your own?

334
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,475
Do you need us to do anything?

335
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:12,675
The disc

336
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,395
is in a very deep spot.

337
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:18,514
I have to put my hand in
directly to absorb the beads,

338
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,314
but I will definitely
touch one of the strings

339
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:24,074
and it will trigger a trap.

340
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,594
You all need to be ready to respond.

341
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:20,235
Here we go.

342
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,354
The arrows are poisoned.

343
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,514
Hold the rope tightly. I'll continue.

344
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,213
Brother,

345
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:07,195
we managed to dismantle a mechanism
that even our elders couldn't.

346
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,174
How impressive this brat is!

347
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,475
What impressive?

348
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,155
He's just lucky.

349
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,834
You guessed it right.

350
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:34,693
This room is indeed a decoy.

351
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,475
There is another passageway.

352
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:38,754
We're definitely

353
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:41,274
in the core region of
the Zhang Family Castle.

354
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:45,034
Based on the common sense, only the
core region of the Zhang Family Castle

355
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,794
would have traps
that even experts couldn't solve.

356
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:51,274
I can't believe we made it
into such a crucial place in a brief time.

357
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:55,115
Beneath here is the core region
of the Zhang Family Castle,

358
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:57,715
where countless scrolls
and weapons are stored.

359
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:52,155
We reached the end now.

360
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,754
What is this place?

361
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:13,955
I can't see anything.

362
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,654
This wall has been smashed open.

363
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,274
It seems that there's space behind it.

364
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:20,715
What is the place behind the wall?

365
00:30:21,014 --> 00:30:23,115
Why would someone build a wall
to block this place?

366
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:33,594
The bricks were pulled outwards.

367
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,800
This is a common technique used
among our Zhang family members.

368
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,955
This means that someone from our family
tried to remove the bricks to get inside

369
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:40,675
but failed.

370
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,654
So,

371
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,654
along with the mudslide back then,

372
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,574
there might have been
something else going on.

373
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:47,733
What else happened?

374
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:48,814
I have no idea.

375
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,134
Breaking through this wall

376
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:51,955
will reveal the truth.

377
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:02,493
Why does the fire suddenly put out?

378
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,213
Perhaps it has been
blocked by something.

379
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:05,880
Let's try to reach inside
by putting a hand in.

380
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,994
Whose turn is it?

381
00:31:07,175 --> 00:31:08,274
I'll do it.

382
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:09,994
You're still young.

383
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:10,894
Let me do it.

384
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,834
Didn't you say we should take turns?

385
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:14,560
Are you feeling protective
of your sister?

386
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,854
Give me the horse-leg shears.

387
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,675
I won't hesitate to cut.

388
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:45,034
If anything happens inside,

389
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:48,915
I'll cut off your arm
as a sacrifice for a major advantage.

390
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,115
It's a dried corpse.

391
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:01,994
It's leaning against
the other side of the wall.

392
00:33:02,895 --> 00:33:04,414
Was he trapped inside

393
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,280
and someone from the outside
tried to save him?

394
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,235
There's a wound.

395
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:14,514
He was killed.

396
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,834
I touch something.

397
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:35,395
Give it to me.

398
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:46,074
It's the Zhang family's qilin emblem.

399
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,915
Does this mean that
someone from our family

400
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:50,773
once entered Zhang Family Castle

401
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:52,675
and got sealed inside?

402
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:56,395
Care no more.

403
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:57,533
Let's break down this wall.

404
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:58,733
We'll see

405
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,435
what's going on.

406
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:34,195
Why is there only half of it?

407
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:38,794
Four.

408
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:41,394
Mr. Yu.

409
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,653
Come, have a seat.

410
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:44,715
Alright.

411
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:47,155
Thanks.

412
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:49,635
Mr. Yu.

413
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,834
The data I own is incomplete.

414
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:53,235
I know.

415
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:55,013
No, I mean,

416
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:56,694
is there any other data?

417
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,294
Yes.

418
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,954
Could you show it to me?

419
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:01,334
Mr. Yu?

420
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,394
Yes?

421
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:04,555
I mean...

422
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:05,613
The data.

423
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:06,595
Oh.

424
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:08,995
The data

425
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:10,515
is not accessible anymore.

426
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,613
I'll look for it.

427
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:14,493
Once I find it,
I'll hand it over to you.

428
00:35:14,494 --> 00:35:16,555
Okay, thank you.

429
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:18,274
And also this.

430
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,474
Regarding these paintings,

431
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:21,995
could you explain them to me?

432
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:29,555
When the time comes,

433
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,354
you'll understand them.
