=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 31=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,790
What's wrong?

5
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,320
I was wrong.

6
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,720
I was wrong about all of this.

7
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,600
I told you, don't look at anything.

8
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,089
Don't look at anything.

9
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,900
If you look at anything,
you'll get into trouble.

10
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,070
What's going on?

11
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,200
It won't be.

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,360
No.

13
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,390
Are you done with this,

14
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,480
Wu Xie?

15
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,360
It's all over now.

16
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,040
What's it?

17
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,510
Why do I have to watch it?

18
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,640
Someone will finish it.

19
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,070
How could anyone possibly finish it?

20
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,299
When the time comes, give the tape

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,670
to anyone who's worked with me
for more than three years.

22
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,230
This guy

23
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,920
can definitely do it.

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,640
What's wrong with this?

25
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,390
Wasn't he talking about you?

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,910
I've been complimenting you
all night. What else do you want?

27
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,510
If Zanghai Flower Field is
to be destroyed once in many years,

28
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,489
Qiling destroyed it

29
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,070
before the last time limit.

30
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,689
Because the time
of Tianshou was uncertain,

31
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,769
he was afraid

32
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,440
that he would forget about it
during the next Tianshou,

33
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,649
so he made a video saying

34
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,270
that he would appoint someone

35
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,179
to destroy Zanghai Flower Field for him

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,040
before the next 80 years came.

37
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,760
Later, Zhang Haike
intercepted the tape.

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,809
You're the one

39
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,739
the patriarch chose.

40
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,689
It was at this point in time

41
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,649
that he found

42
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,179
the most possible person
to be Qiling's proxy,

43
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,360
namely me,

44
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,920
to fulfill this mission.

45
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,179
I'll go back and find you a psychiatrist

46
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,760
to help you forget about it.

47
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,079
Why did Qiling say that this person
must be able to do it?

48
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,059
What kind of conditions
does this person have to meet?

49
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,459
Okay, let me make it clear to you.

50
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,179
Firstly,

51
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,419
this person has to believe him

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,739
after watching the video, right?

53
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,569
Secondly,

54
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,110
Wang Jinyuan believes this person

55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,979
believes Qiling and knows Qiling well.

56
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,889
It's you, isn't it?

57
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,179
And thirdly? Is there more?

58
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,739
This person must have Dragon's Plasma.

59
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,739
Or he can't open the door
to Zanghai Flower Field.

60
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,569
I got this fake Dragon's Plasma

61
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,979
at Seven Stars Lu Palace.

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,059
It was our first adventure and
I accidentally consumed Dragon's Blood.

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,659
It was a complete accident

64
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,920
and it was after Qiling made the video.

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,009
If you hadn't eaten Dragon's Blood,

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,750
you wouldn't be the proxy.

67
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,329
How could Qiling have foreseen

68
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,160
that I would accidentally
consume Dragon's Blood?

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,870
The truth of the matter is

70
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,159
that Qiling simply couldn't have

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,929
foreseen that many years later
there would be someone

72
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,960
who fits all the criteria.

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,310
That means the proxy doesn't exist.

74
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,280
We've been tricked.

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,080
Who is he

76
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,990
recording this video for?

77
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,080
If this proxy doesn't exist,

78
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,369
this tape

79
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,160
wasn't meant for me.

80
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,840
It's also a mechanism.

81
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,360
It's what Qiling keeps for himself.

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,990
A mechanism to remind himself.

83
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,430
Even Yu Da's wrong.

84
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,310
He said I'm the chosen one,

85
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,630
but I'm not.

86
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,430
It's Qiling himself.

87
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,430
For so long,

88
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,870
Qiling has always been alone.

89
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,670
For such an important mission,

90
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,630
he had to make a video tape
to remind himself,

91
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,110
and he couldn't even find someone
to give a word to.

92
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,790
It's not a clever trick at all.

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,790
In the old days,

94
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,040
I would have recognised it immediately.

95
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,670
And along the way,

96
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,190
I've had plenty of chances

97
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,600
to expose their flaws.

98
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,040
But because of the obsession
I have in my heart with Qiling's past,

99
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,670
it affects all my judgments.

100
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,670
Zhang Haike also took advantage of this

101
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,750
and led me step by step
to where I am today.

102
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,720
Okay. It's fine.

103
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,280
I treat you the same way, don't I?

104
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,659
All these years,

105
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,080
I've been with you, pretending
to be a fool and being tricked.

106
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,960
That's what

107
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,630
I'm willing to do, isn't it?

108
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,160
I got it.

109
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,489
Fine.

110
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,859
Anyway, we're going back tomorrow.

111
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,840
Come on.

112
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,080
Drink up.

113
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,520
Before we go back to Wuzhou,

114
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,230
let's go to the spiritual retreat

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,920
to say goodbye to Qiling.

116
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,400
Sir.

117
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,630
What a coincidence.

118
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,230
I was just going
for a walk down the hill.

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
Mister,

120
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,360
have you finished your business here?

121
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,489
Yes,

122
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,929
I have.

123
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,400
We're going back to Wuzhou.

124
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,360
We came to say goodbye to him,

125
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,249
and to look at the previous scrolls.

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,929
I found a few more scrolls last night

127
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,430
and put them in Zhang Qiling's room.

128
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,630
That's a lot.

129
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,110
Qiling's just a painting seller.

130
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,059
Anyway, the matter
of Zanghai Flower is settled,

131
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,630
and we have plenty of time now.

132
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,099
I just wonder

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,280
what kind of message he left this time.

134
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,990
Just take a look.

135
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,870
Good luck with your new discovery.

136
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,390
Fatty,

137
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,800
look.

138
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,179
This drawing

139
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,630
seems to show the origin
of the Zhang family.

140
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,499
The origin of the Zhang family

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,990
is a lump of carbon?

142
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,270
Meteoric copper.

143
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,480
You know that?

144
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,910
Tell me about it.

145
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,929
I've always thought

146
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,680
that the Zhang family system
was complicated,

147
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,230
but now that I've seen this drawing,

148
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,200
it seems like I can figure it out.

149
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,610
The mystical power of the hexagonal bell
and the Heavenly Staff

150
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,200
is derived from the meteoric copper.

151
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,139
The Zhang family's mystical power

152
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,870
also comes from meteoric copper.

153
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,720
And Zhang Haike told me

154
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,000
about the reason for the
hexagonal bell's hallucinogenic effect.

155
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,499
The ringing is just a cover-up.

156
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,990
It's the powder

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,750
that really does the trick.

158
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,600
Look, is it possible?

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,320
There are two kinds of parasites

160
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,720
in this meteoric copper
from outer space.

161
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,089
The parasites in the red meteoric copper

162
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,929
are called red bugs,

163
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,899
and the parasites in the blue meteoric
copper is called blue bugs.

164
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,390
One is called Blue,

165
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,969
one is called Red,

166
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,480
and those outside are called Black.

167
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,899
So the Zhangs

168
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,659
are in trouble with the bugs.

169
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,800
Go on.

170
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,809
Blue bugs have been parasitising
the Zhangs for a long time.

171
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,849
Blue bugs give the Zhangs

172
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,360
extraordinary abilities.

173
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,729
At the same time, they discovered

174
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,999
that the secretion of blue bugs
can make people hallucinogenic.

175
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,929
So they made a hexagonal bell
out of meteoric copper

176
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,499
parasitised with blue bugs.

177
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,089
Whenever the bell is rung,

178
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,929
the secretion
of blue bugs will float out

179
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,209
and make people hallucinate.

180
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,659
But because the Zhangs
have blue bugs in their bodies,

181
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,779
they have antibodies,

182
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,200
so they won't be affected.

183
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,729
And on the Heavenly Staff are red bugs.

184
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,329
These red bugs are highly intelligent

185
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,840
and can influence the blue bugs.

186
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,329
When the Heavenly Staff activates
the mechanism in Zhang Family Ancient Tower,

187
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,089
the red bugs will be activated,

188
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,539
emitting specific pheromones

189
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,499
and exchanging pheromones
with the blue bugs

190
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,449
living in the Zhang family's bodies.

191
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,659
In nature,

192
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,899
many bugs

193
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,870
communicate in this way.

194
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,609
After the exchange,
a special substance is secreted

195
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,750
that affects the Zhangs' brains

196
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,569
and manipulates their behaviour.

197
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,030
This is what the Zhangs call Tianshou.

198
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,539
You mean

199
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,990
that when Red and Blue mate,

200
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,440
the Zhangs' disease flares up?

201
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,230
That's a good way to put it.

202
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,600
So the impressive Zhang family

203
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:10,863
is being played
by these two kinds of bugs.

204
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,139
In fact,
it's the Zhang family's patriarch

205
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,560
who's really controlling all this.

206
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,080
The Zhang family members

207
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,569
who first invented the use of bugs
to control the clan's Tianshou

208
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,150
left the antidote
in Zhang Family Ancient Tower.

209
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,960
Only the patriarch knows the secret.

210
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,079
But successive generations
of Zhang family patriarchs

211
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,969
chose to continue controlling the clan

212
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,270
in this way

213
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,990
until the appearance of Qiling.

214
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,729
If the Heavenly Staff is activated,

215
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,539
Qiling will suffer a seizure

216
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,510
and lose control of his brain.

217
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,960
Tianshou

218
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,870
will make him forget the way
to remove it,

219
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,510
so Qiling can save all the Zhangs

220
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,990
but not himself.

221
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,569
Though he never wanted
to save himself either.

222
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,630
That's why he's our Qiling.

223
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,729
Anyway, Naive,

224
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,330
You've explained everything

225
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,179
but there's still one thing
that doesn't make sense.

226
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,510
If the Zhangs can't be affected
by hallucinations,

227
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,449
how can the hexagonal bell
make Zhang Haixing

228
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,870
hallucinate?

229
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,259
When the Zhangs

230
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,200
drank the water from the well,

231
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,019
the blue bugs
in their bodies were killed

232
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,270
and they lost their immunity
to hallucinations.

233
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,320
But to save Niata, Zhang Haike

234
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,960
used the forbidden hexagonal bell again.

235
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,569
That's why they can accidentally

236
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,969
get infected by the secretions
of the blue bugs

237
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,560
and hallucinate.

238
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,379
I didn't expect Zhang Haike

239
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,209
to be such a passionate man.

240
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,929
There's one more thing I've figured out.

241
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,499
Why does the blood of some of the Zhangs

242
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,659
repel bugs?

243
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,689
Could it be because the worms

244
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,179
can sense the special substance
secreted by the red bugs

245
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,539
in the blood of the Zhangs,

246
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,200
so they just avoid it?

247
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,019
Amazing.

248
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,539
You took three minutes

249
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,800
to explain the family history

250
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,600
of the Zhangs.

251
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,960
So these are the problems

252
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,809
that Qiling must endure

253
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,230
and solve.

254
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,320
Most of the world's secrets

255
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,680
are here.

256
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,729
That's why he has to enter

257
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,630
Bronze Door again and again

258
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,440
to solve these problems.

259
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,510
Have some.

260
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,230
(After reading the scrolls,)

261
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,630
(I finally got
the whole story straight.)

262
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,560
(Zanghai Flower is innocent.)

263
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,560
(It's not the seeds of Zanghai Flower)

264
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,720
(that really drove
the Mystic Claw crazy,)

265
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,360
(it's these golden sphere bugs.)

266
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,689
(I guessed wrong)

267
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,990
(when I looked at the mural.)

268
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,800
(Zhang Haixing and the others'
speculation was also wrong.)

269
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,870
(According to the scrolls,)

270
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,480
(a long time ago,)

271
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,154
(the Zhang family accidentally
discovered Zanghai Flower)

272
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,320
(while investigating
a strange incident.)

273
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,800
(That area was special.)

274
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,200
(Zanghai Flower
could only survive there.)

275
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,560
(So a field of Zanghai Flower Field)

276
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,910
(was created there.)

277
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,440
(But unexpectedly,)

278
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,299
(there was)

279
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,230
(a golden sphere-shaped creature
in that place.)

280
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,230
(The creature)

281
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,560
(seems to come
from deep within the earth,)

282
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,089
(and it's ever-present)

283
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,440
(and impossible to eradicate.)

284
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,750
(They have a parasitic habit
when they're young.)

285
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,200
(On other organisms.)

286
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,750
(This parasitism)

287
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,840
(is very damaging to the host.)

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
(With the exception of Zanghai Flower,)

289
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,030
(all other parasitised organisms)

290
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,150
(undergo some degree of mutation,)

291
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,990
(which is very dangerous.)

292
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,990
(Much of the information in the scrolls)

293
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,200
(is actually shown on the murals.)

294
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,449
(The small snakes left in the ruins)

295
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,990
(of the Mystic Claw and Kumuli)

296
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,390
(were mutated)

297
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,630
(because they were parasitised
by the golden sphere bugs.)

298
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,870
(Those golden spheres we encountered
at Snowy Peak)

299
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,080
(are the adults of that species.)

300
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,870
(When they mature,
they can survive independently)

301
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,320
(from their hosts)

302
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,800
(and are very aggressive.)

303
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,230
(When the Zhangs hunted
for snakes in Kumuli,)

304
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,080
(they were actually dealing
with the golden sphere bugs.)

305
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,593
(The golden spheres
have no medicinal value.)

306
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,720
(The golden sphere caught by the Denaxi)

307
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,089
(was tested for its medicinal value)

308
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,539
(because it had harmed
the Zhang family member, Dong Chan.)

309
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,910
(And the so-called medicinal value)

310
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,840
(is supposed to come
from the blue bugs in Zhangs' body.)

311
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,969
(In order to prevent the golden spheres
from spreading)

312
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,960
(and causing serious harm,)

313
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,809
(the Zhangs built a huge bronze door)

314
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,960
(outside the flower field.)

315
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,030
(But the golden spheres breed too fast.)

316
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,449
(Every 80 years,)

317
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,480
(they could flood the field)

318
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,080
(with ripe Zanghai Flower seeds)

319
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,110
(and spread beyond
Zanghai Flower Field.)

320
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,390
(That's why the Zhang family
set up a trap)

321
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,419
(to kill the little golden sphere bugs)

322
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,299
(parasitised on Zanghai Flower)

323
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,720
(by eliminating them)

324
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,019
(and asked their descendants)

325
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,539
(to come to Zanghai Flower Field)

326
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,870
(every 80 years to deal with them.)

327
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,150
(After the Zhang family fell apart,)

328
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,089
(Zanghai Flower Field
was left unmanaged.)

329
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,360
(Beyond this time limit,)

330
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,569
(the little golden sphere bugs
were rapidly growing)

331
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,320
(and flowing out
of Zanghai Flower Field.)

332
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,510
(The Mystic Claw in armor could have dealt
with the golden spheres.)

333
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,720
(But when the armor
fell into disrepair,)

334
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,480
(the Mystic Claw went berserk,)

335
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,139
(causing a great deal of damage)

336
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,200
(to Yinshaluo Tribe.)

337
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,960
(After that,)

338
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,800
(Qiling arrived here)

339
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,110
(and got rid of the Mystic Claw
and activated the mechanism)

340
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,800
(to destroy the little golden
spheres bugs in the flower field.)

341
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,569
(But they won't be wiped out
completely.)

342
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,150
(That's why Qiling)

343
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,699
(has to come here again after 80 years)

344
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,320
(to activate the mechanism.)

345
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,939
(Fearing that he'd forget the matter)

346
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,430
(due to his frequent memory loss,)

347
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,870
(he left himself a video tape
as a reminder.)

348
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,870
(Unexpectedly, by accident,)

349
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,040
(I ended up carrying out the mission.)

350
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,150
(But thankfully,)

351
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,299
(the mechanism of Zanghai Flower Field)

352
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,080
(kills only
the little golden sphere bugs.)

353
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,649
(Someday,)

354
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,430
(Zanghai Flower)

355
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,110
(will grow back.)

356
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,280
(The Zhangs)

357
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,240
(had been researching the function
of Zanghai Flower Field,)

358
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,470
(and found
that once the flowers were picked,)

359
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,670
(they withered quickly)

360
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,870
(and the seeds were inactivated.)

361
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,760
(The medicine made from it)

362
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,630
(only protects people from death,)

363
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,560
(and is stored away.)

364
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,910
(The Zhang family has done an
excellent job of keeping secrets.)

365
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,110
(Except for the core members,)

366
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,950
(no one knows the truth
about Zanghai Flower.)

367
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,630
(After the Zhang family fell apart,)

368
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,110
(the transmission
of the core secrets was interrupted.)

369
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,499
(Zhang Haike
and other outside family members)

370
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,600
(don't know the secret.)

371
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,320
(In fact, Zanghai Flower)

372
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,110
(is a very precious herb)

373
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,910
(that can strengthen
the Zhang family's constitution,)

374
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,840
(and maybe
there's a special way to use it.)

375
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,950
(But it has no power
to bring the dead back to life.)

376
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,280
(Zhang Haike has been pursuing it
for many years.)

377
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,670
(But his obsession is so strong)

378
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,630
(that he can be easily used.)

379
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,430
(Behind the whole thing)

380
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,329
(is the mysterious family)

381
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,040
(that's hiding in the darkness
and pushing the envelope.)

382
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,000
(This family)

383
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,560
(has been fighting the Zhangs
for thousands of years.)

384
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,080
(It's the Zhang family's)

385
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,560
(and Zhang Qiling's archenemy.)

386
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,470
Fatty.

387
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,840
Fatty, wake up.

388
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,560
Time for breakfast?

389
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,430
Finished?

390
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,240
What did you find out?

391
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,670
Let's go say goodbye to Qiling

392
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,710
and get ready to go back to Wuzhou.

393
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,470
We've got a lot of work ahead of us.

394
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,190
Qiling,

395
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,390
Fatty and I

396
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,950
have taken care of this mission for you.

397
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,870
Don't worry.

398
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,870
When you get out,

399
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,609
we'll establish

400
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,520
the anchoring point
between you and the world.

401
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,569
Although

402
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,259
you are your own chosen one in the end,

403
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,409
after this incident,

404
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,280
Naive and I

405
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,089
are already qualified

406
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,129
to become your chosen ones.

407
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,219
We've saved

408
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,430
your face for once.

409
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,360
Wait another five years.

410
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,040
You must

411
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,329
live a long life.

412
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,390
Great luck.

413
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,089
Great fortune.

414
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,190
We'll see you then.

415
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,400
(Travel newsletter)

416
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,710
Come in.

417
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,110
Sir.

418
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,910
Come on.

419
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,539
Come in and sit down.

420
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,459
No,

421
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,040
we came to say goodbye.

422
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,110
We're really leaving this time.

423
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,539
Sit down for a while.

424
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,219
I have something to tell you.

425
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,089
Come on.

426
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,539
Don't tell me there's a new scroll.

427
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,809
It's over.

428
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,939
We really should go. Let's go.

429
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,889
Come on.

430
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,520
There's no rush. Come on.

431
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,840
Sit down for a while.

432
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,950
No.

433
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,240
It's too much of a drag.

434
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,840
It's not cooked yet.

435
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,430
What's your plan for the future?

436
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,710
There's something very important
waiting for us.

437
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,040
I've got a

438
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,110
little advice.

439
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,870
Please go ahead.

440
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,800
Stay

441
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,360
and be Deren.

442
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,169
30,000 yuan a month,

443
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,360
food and lodging included.

444
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,739
The Zhangs

445
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,219
don't have any work now.

446
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,110
It's very easy.

447
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,779
So the Zhang family
is a multinational corporation,

448
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,000
so rich.

449
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,089
We had been doing a lot
of odd jobs for Qiling,

450
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,840
and he didn't pay us a cent.

451
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,569
Qiling is even more shady than you,
the shady boss.

452
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,870
To be precise,

453
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,779
some years ago, it was Qiling
who did odd jobs for us

454
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,320
and cleaned up our messes for us.

455
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,470
So he's still the most shady one.

456
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,569
Here you go.

457
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,870
Try this.

458
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,710
Thank you.

459
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,110
Wu Xie,

460
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,390
you're the man

461
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,800
for the position, Deren.

462
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,040
Look,

463
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,710
Deren has been vacant for years.

464
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,910
You are here at the right time.

465
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,040
And you have a deep connection

466
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,110
with Zhang Qiling.

467
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,360
As long as you're Deren,

468
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,219
you can continue to take your time

469
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,600
and study about him in the future.

470
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,670
If he comes back one day,

471
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,369
you can still

472
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,080
record his memories.

473
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,699
Isn't that

474
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,280
two birds with one stone?

475
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,870
We've gone over all the information.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,080
What if there's more?

477
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,080
Look again.

478
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,600
You're short of staff, aren't you?

479
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,800
You're looking for help
with the work, aren't you?

480
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,110
No.

481
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,950
I'm...

482
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,499
I'm very rigorous.

483
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,630
Besides,

484
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,569
we have high expectations

485
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,870
of Deren.

486
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,760
Wu Xie,

487
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,470
you're strong-minded

488
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,569
and meticulous.

489
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,630
If you're going to take
on the position of Deren,

490
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,739
it'll be the result

491
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,670
of causality.

492
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,470
I'll be relieved

493
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,280
if you stay.

494
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,870
I got it.

495
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,600
You want to go out and have fun?

496
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,089
(Newspaper)
Travel guide.

497
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,000
You're picking out the best land
in the world.

498
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,760
You're looking for a replacement,

499
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,169
a second-hand Deren, aren't you?

500
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm not going out to have fun,

501
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,390
I'm going traveling.

502
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,459
Tell me more about it.

503
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,040
Spiritual practice

504
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,710
can't be limited to a single place.

505
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,840
We must go out into the crowd

506
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,499
to gain a deeper understanding.

507
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,670
Anyway,

508
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,280
we can't leave

509
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,710
the spiritual retreat unattended,
can we?

510
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,569
You don't have to tell us
about your spiritual practice,

511
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,870
you can just say I want to retire

512
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,840
and go around the world.

513
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,630
We all understand.

514
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,409
You're so old, aren't you?

515
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,760
It's only right to enjoy your old age.

516
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,390
Here you go.

517
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,950
Keep it.

518
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,840
30,000 yuan, right?

519
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,430
30,000 yuan.

520
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,000
It's not a small amount.

521
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,129
That's

522
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,649
as many ham sausages

523
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,600
as you want in one meal.

524
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,649
Can Deren resign?

525
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,870
No.

526
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,569
Deren is for life.

527
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,000
Once you take on the job,
you have to stay on for life.

528
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,240
Unless he dies of old age

529
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,430
or

530
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,369
someone else takes his place.

531
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,649
No one can take on this job.

532
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,979
Not for any amount of money.

533
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,840
No freedom, no way.

534
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,800
Please let us go.

535
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,240
Stop talking about Deren.

536
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,630
If you two

537
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,240
decide to leave,

538
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,560
leaving this spiritual retreat,

539
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,609
you'll go back

540
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,710
to your old lives.

541
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,040
The world is like the sea.

542
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,320
A man

543
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,080
is like a grain of sand,

544
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,150
once it enters the sea,

545
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,320
it can never return.

546
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,950
Misters,

547
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,630
think about it again.

548
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,950
Thank you for your kind offer.

549
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,040
It's just that there's still

550
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,150
my unfinished business in the crowd.

551
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,040
If it's meant to be,

552
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,080
we'll meet again.

553
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,800
You said

554
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,560
our karmic line is still long.

555
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,280
All right, that's it.

556
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,040
Wait.

557
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,889
We really have to go home.

558
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,849
We haven't been home for a long time.

559
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,710
It's fine that you won't
take on the position.

560
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,760
It's fate that we met.

561
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,219
Before you go,

562
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,870
I have something to give you.

563
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,520
One for each of you.

564
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,739
You're being

565
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,059
too particular.

566
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,569
You're being too courteous.

567
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,219
We're embarrassed.

568
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,569
Don't get too much for us.

569
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,950
Just get one.

570
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,320
Well...

571
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,870
Come on, take it.

572
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,520
This is yours.

573
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,360
No, this...

574
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,609
The more insignificant something is,

575
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,390
the more secret it contains.

576
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,569
Let me ask you.

577
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,430
Is there a trick of fortune,

578
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,390
secret manual or treasure in it?

579
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,280
Let me see yours.

580
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,110
There's nothing.

581
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,889
What do you mean?

582
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,390
Are you fooling us?

583
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,040
Both of you are men of action

584
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,390
who have a mission

585
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,600
and a long way to go.

586
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,710
It's a spiritual practice

587
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,320
for you to read the scrolls here,

588
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,320
and it's a spiritual practice for you

589
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,649
to walk for thousands of miles later.

590
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,710
Now that you've made up your mind,

591
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,910
it's a tough road ahead.

592
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,360
The shoes may be old,

593
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,710
but they'll

594
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,240
save you some hard time.

595
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,630
Thank you.

596
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,800
I

597
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,910
don't need shoes.

598
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,139
(A week later, Wuzhou)

599
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:25,040
(Flock of sheep, bait, us)

600
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,110
What's this?

601
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,040
That's what we're going to fix

602
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,800
before Qiling gets out.

603
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,870
Gosh, that's a lot.

604
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,190
It will be solved.

605
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,670
Haixing's reply.

606
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,459
(Wu Xie: My brother buried Niata and
succeeded to the position of Deren.)

607
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,019
Zhang Haike has become Deren.

608
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,190
What?

609
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,390
What's going on?

610
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,360
You're going away, Sir?

611
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,000
Mister,

612
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,840
let's

613
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,280
talk about you first.

614
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,520
It's cold outside.

615
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,280
Come on,

616
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,169
have a hot cup of tea.

617
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,710
I want to stay here

618
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,320
to atone for what I did before.

619
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,600
I wonder if the spiritual retreat

620
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,870
will accept a sinner like me.

621
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,520
Even sinners need tea.

622
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,320
I've buried her here

623
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,080
at Snow Peak

624
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,360
so I can be with her all the time.

625
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,080
Why don't you let go?

626
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,779
How do I let it go?

627
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,259
Just put it

628
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,760
on the table.

629
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,710
I wonder why

630
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,840
young people think so much nowadays.

631
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,760
Repentance and

632
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,320
obsession.

633
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,059
I forgot

634
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,470
that you're not a young man.

635
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,499
But I'd say

636
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,760
at your age, you've lived in vain.

637
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,840
I understand.

638
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,280
You mean

639
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,320
I shouldn't think

640
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,240
about how to atone for my sins,

641
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,240
but how to let go of my obsession?

642
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,600
Only when I've unburdened myself

643
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,910
of the past

644
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,320
will I be able to meditate.

645
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,520
Let me get you a job.

646
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,800
Take on the position of Deren.

647
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,360
A one-track mind like yours

648
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,390
is perfect for this job.

649
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,150
If you want to be Deren,

650
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,870
you can't leave here
for the rest of your life.

651
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,190
Unless Zhang Qiling

652
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,150
doesn't need Deren anymore,

653
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,280
you can leave.

654
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,950
Don't worry.

655
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,320
I'll do my duty as Deren.

656
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,800
I've been polishing

657
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,939
this string of beads for years

658
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,089
but I just can't

659
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,979
get it as round and seamless

660
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,699
as other beads.

661
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,190
Later, I realised

662
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,190
that the material I'd chosen

663
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,169
was the hardest stone to polish.

664
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,430
I think it's fine the way it is.

665
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,950
As Deren,

666
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,000
you should always do your best,

667
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,390
but don't be too hard on yourself.

668
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,520
Thank you, Sir.

669
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,110
A man

670
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,499
who's obsessed for decades

671
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,240
and finds out it's all a scam.

672
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,240
What is this if not a tragedy?

673
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,320
So I can now understand

674
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,280
why he chose
to go for spiritual practice.

675
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,520
Hope he finds his inner peace soon.

676
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,560
It's not over yet.

677
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,160
You've decided to stay here?

678
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,160
Haixing,

679
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,030
I've read Wu Xie's letter.

680
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,760
I'm not here to run away.

681
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm here to start over.

682
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,769
Do you really want to stay here
for the rest of your life

683
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,510
and leave me behind?

684
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,800
I don't know.

685
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,720
Spiritual practitioners
can see causality,

686
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,120
but I can't.

687
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,390
My thoughts are so messed up.

688
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,870
It's quiet here.

689
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,120
Maybe I can figure it out

690
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,910
if I stay here.

691
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,590
You've got to stop living for me.

692
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,640
You should have your own life.

693
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,160
My own life?

694
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,070
Leave me as a burden behind

695
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,430
and you'll find it.

696
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,720
Leave.

697
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,160
You should leave now.

698
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,780
Do you really think you're so charming?

699
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,479
If it wasn't for the fact
that you're my brother

700
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:02,120
and I'm afraid you'll die out there,
I wouldn't bother with you.

701
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,840
I should have stopped you
from the beginning.

702
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,760
But after all,

703
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,240
I'm the one who got you into this mess.

704
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,550
They say

705
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,840
children born
into the Zhang family aren't happy,

706
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,390
but I'm different.

707
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,240
When I was a kid,

708
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,470
no matter how much danger I was in,

709
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,200
no matter how difficult things were,

710
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,870
I was never afraid

711
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,870
because you were there.

712
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,360
Everyone envied me.

713
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,200
So at that time, I thought

714
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,360
that when I grow up,

715
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,470
I'll protect you

716
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,910
like you protected me.

717
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,550
Unfortunately,

718
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,160
I went about it the wrong way.

719
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,760
I know you were wrong,

720
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,120
but I still kept making mistakes
with you.

721
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,720
It's my tolerance
that got you into trouble.

722
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,249
Haixing,

723
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,720
I need your help.

724
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,800
If I'm going to save her,
I have to make a choice.

725
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,430
This is wrong.

726
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,680
I've worked so hard for the Zhang family
for so many years,

727
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,289
can't I get a Zanghai Flower

728
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,870
for my life's happiness?

729
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,030
You've changed.

730
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,360
How come you've become like Zhang Nian?

731
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,680
We've just chosen different paths.

732
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,950
Just like we chose different paths
from the patriarch back then.

733
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,499
Now that I've chosen this path,

734
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,640
what do you choose?

735
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,910
I can't help you.

736
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,430
Haixing,

737
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,320
I beg you.

738
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,200
I just need you to help me this once.

739
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,720
Just this once.

740
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,280
Okay?

741
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,390
We screwed it all up.

742
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,800
You don't have to blame yourself.

743
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm the one who didn't do it right.

744
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,120
You've given me more than

745
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,019
I can repay in a lifetime.

746
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,800
Enough.

747
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,320
The Zhang Haike I know

748
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,200
wouldn't say

749
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,360
anything mushy even if he was a loser.

750
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,800
Haike,

751
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,510
I'm leaving.

752
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,510
But this time,

753
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm not doing it
because I listen to you.

754
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,280
Anyway,

755
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,590
Deren is a position in the Zhang family.

756
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,200
Can I still inherit this position

757
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,950
after betraying the Zhang family?

758
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,360
In fact, I know all about

759
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,120
your and Zhang Qiling's plan.

760
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,200
I know if you've really betrayed

761
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,030
the Zhangs.

762
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,070
There's still a long way to go.

763
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,235
But I think

764
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,819
it's worth

765
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,470
making an exception.

766
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,169
I've read about the Wang family

767
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,590
in the scrolls

768
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,200
from Jila Spiritual Retreat before.

769
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,990
As long as they're around,

770
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,019
the nine families,

771
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,870
the Zhangs,

772
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,070
the Wangs,

773
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,160
guarding the Bronze Door,

774
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,550
these things will never end.

775
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,169
So in these five years,

776
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,249
(Gutongjing, treasure bait)

777
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,510
we need to step

778
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,800
(Desert, flock of sheep)
by step

779
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,160
to solve all the remaining problems
once and for all.

780
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,950
I need to take care of my health.

781
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,430
It's a big endeavor.

782
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,820
(Sand Sea, Gutongjing)

783
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,660
(6th year of Qiling's entry into the Bronze Door)
(It's a forbidden land in the desert.)

784
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,950
(It's also a magical ancient city.)

785
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,720
(The showdown will begin here.)

786
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,430
(I know there will be many sacrifices.)

787
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,950
(But I've decided)

788
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,120
(to gamble the future of nine families)

789
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,340
(Wu Xie's initiated the killing plan.)
(to declare war on a destiny)

790
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,000
(Afterwards, after a tough fight,)
(that was set thousands of years ago.)

791
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
(Wu Xie solved all the problems
left by Zhang Qiling)

792
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,920
(and completed all the tasks for him.)
