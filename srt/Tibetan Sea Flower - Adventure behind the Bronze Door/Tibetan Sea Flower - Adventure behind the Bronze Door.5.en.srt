00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,186
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 5=

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,961
That hurts.

5
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,481
Okay, that's enough.

6
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't scare him to death.

7
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:12,760
Earlier,

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,681
we just injected some local anesthetic

9
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,560
into the back of your neck

10
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,121
and poured some pig's blood.

11
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,081
Then you foolishly thought

12
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,480
you lost your head.

13
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,241
Let me introduce myself.

14
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,641
My last name is Zhang.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,121
I'm Zhang Haike.

16
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,480
Just you say you're Zhang Haike
doesn't mean you are.

17
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,320
There are plenty of impostors out there.

18
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,681
Let me introduce you.

19
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
The girl who tried to cut off your head

20
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,961
is Zhang Haixing.

21
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:07,121
She's my younger sister.

22
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
This is Zhang Longban.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,961
Everyone here

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,361
is from the Zhang family overseas.

25
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,560
To prove you're the real Wu Xie,

26
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,330
we had to go through quite
a bit of trouble.

27
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,921
Then

28
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,841
what about those heads on the table?

29
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,160
They are all fake.

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,961
Consider it a practical joke of mine.

31
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,641
I was always wondering

32
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:34,560
what kind of situation

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,841
we would meet in.

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,600
I usually do psychological training.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,241
So, I was thinking
about how to test you.

36
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,361
So, it was a nonsense test.

37
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:47,801
Wu Xie,

38
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,440
(Personality Type Item)
your response-ability is four points,

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,921
(Personality Type Item)
four points for physical fitness,

40
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,841
four points for mental toughness,

41
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,040
seven for intelligence,

42
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,760
and zero for additional skills.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
Your total score is nineteen.

44
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,361
You're classified
as an avoidant personality.

45
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,320
What's the total score? Forty?

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,241
It's four hundred.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Honestly,

48
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,280
we didn't expect
this test result either.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,961
So, we did not prepare a Plan B.

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,480
So,

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,760
we'll just follow the procedure.

52
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,961
We need you to do
the Zhang family a favor.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,641
It is also a task to you

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,270
from our clan leader, Zhang Qiling.

55
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,961
We're here to cooperate with you.

56
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:26,881
I don't quite understand

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,120
this test.

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,360
Miss.

59
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:54,920
Fine, I'll stay.

60
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,201
But could you please make up

61
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,441
a convincing story?

62
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,201
It has been five years

63
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,920
since Qiling entered the Bronze Door.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,680
Did he call you with a satellite phone
to give you the mission?

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,441
Besides,

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,001
everyone from the Zhang family

67
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,081
is high and mighty.

68
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,570
What can someone
who scored nineteen points do to help?

69
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,480
I know you might not believe this.

70
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,240
Let me show you something.

71
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,710
You'll understand after you watch it.

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,841
Qiling.

73
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Nobody can complete this except you.

74
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:14,761
I know.

75
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,360
Must you leave to solve that matter?

76
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
I must go.

77
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,480
But have you ever considered

78
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,420
how severe the consequences
could be if you left?

79
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,441
Things might go out of control.

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,761
It won't.

81
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,761
Someone will complete this matter.

82
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,120
There's no one else who can do this.

83
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,761
When that happens,

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,160
just hand over the video tape

85
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,580
to someone who has worked with me
for more than three years.

86
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,160
This person

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
can definitely do it.

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,370
You're the one who worked
over three years with the clan leader.

89
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,120
You were chosen by the clan leader.

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,841
What's the situation?

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
Who's the one talking to him?

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
Was it you?

93
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,761
What I'm about to tell you

94
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,920
might sound unbelievable
to ordinary people.

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,920
Didn't you want to know

96
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,570
what happened after the clan leader entered
the snowy mountain?

97
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,970
Portrait of the Night King Devours The Sky.

98
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:36,201
I've seen this in the guide.

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
In some places,

100
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
this portrait is used to ward off evil.

101
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,001
It's not a portrait.

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,321
The Night King Devours The Sky
truly exists.

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,961
Deep within the snow mountain in Mosang,

104
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,770
there's a hidden tribe called
the Yinsha.

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,321
There's a legend circulated

106
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,761
within the tribe.

107
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,120
Around a thousand years ago,

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,081
many other tribes dwelt
on the snowy mountain.

109
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:05,160
There was also a monster called

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
the Night King

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,641
that coexisted with them.

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
To some snow mountain tribes,

113
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,920
the Night King is an evil god
who rules the underworld,

114
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:14,401
similar to our King of Hell.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,841
Legend says
the Night King has a thousand eyes,

116
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,800
always watching and present.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Every eighty years, during the odd year,

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,270
on the day the Yinsha Tribe reaches
the end of the harsh winter,

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,240
gold rain falls from the sky

120
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,881
and the Night King awakens
from deep within the snow mountains

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
to slaughter everything in the snow.

122
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,270
The mountains are littered with corpses,

123
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:34,720
like a living hell.

124
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,161
The threatened tribes

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,161
would send their bravest warriors

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,640
to kill the Night King.

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,201
But the Night King could turn invisible.

128
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,240
The Night King would kill the warriors

129
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,760
before they even saw it.

130
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,360
The enraged Night King dragged

131
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
all the rebelling tribes deep

132
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,921
into the snow mountains,

133
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,060
burying them beneath the ice.

134
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,161
After that, it never appeared again.

135
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,321
Alongside the Night King,

136
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,760
there was also the Night Lady.

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,560
She was originally a mortal punished
by the Night King.

138
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,921
After suffering the agony
of burning in fire,

139
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,561
she was reborn from the smoke.

140
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,720
They are a pair of twin gods,

141
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:15,000
hidden in the clouds
that block out the sun.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
When they appear,
lightning flashes and thunder roars.

143
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:19,640
It's like the sky

144
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,961
is being devoured.

145
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,820
Every generation of Yinsha people
who fought the Night King paid

146
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,720
a terrible price.

147
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
Eighty years ago,

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,081
the clan leader came here

149
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,240
and helped the Yinsha people defeat
the Night King,

150
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,480
sealing it

151
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,321
behind a giant door

152
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:40,161
because the Night King can't truly die.

153
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,760
After being killed,

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,161
it revives every eighty years,

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,520
over and over again without end.

156
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:48,921
Now, eighty years later,

157
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,760
the clan leader needs to find someone

158
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,240
to take his place

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,520
in dealing with the Night King.

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,640
Time has passed,

161
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,681
and the Night King is about to awaken.

162
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,400
The clan leader requested you

163
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,921
to help him defeat the Night King

164
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,921
and help the Yinsha people

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,321
survive this disaster.

166
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:12,681
We're here to assist you

167
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,760
with this task

168
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,170
and escort you to the snow mountain.

169
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,760
Qiling wants me to fight the Night King?

170
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:25,921
Not long ago,

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,561
we received a distress letter

172
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,760
from the Yinsha Tribe.

173
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,720
According to reliable information,

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,230
the Night King was actually a term
the ancient Yinsha people used

175
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,041
to describe some kind
of biological disaster.

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,370
The language from that time
was extremely obscure.

177
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,760
We couldn't fully understand the events.

178
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,000
We only know
the Yinsha people called this disaster

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,370
as the "Night King Devouring the Sky."

180
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,000
Among modern people,

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,321
only the clan leader experienced
that disaster

182
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,000
and dealt with it.

183
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,201
After receiving the distress letter,

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
I tried to contact the Yinsha Tribe.

185
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,201
But they're out of contact.

186
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,441
I'm afraid the situation might be grim.

187
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,520
The only thing we can do now

188
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,561
is enter the snow mountains

189
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,281
before this disaster spreads
on a large scale

190
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,600
and deal with the crisis.

191
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:15,961
I never expected

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,081
he'd still tell you about this.

193
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,120
Since that's the case,

194
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,081
I won't hide it from you any longer.

195
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,360
Everyone here,

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,640
do you remember

197
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,321
the prophecy

198
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,520
about the end of the world?

199
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,360
Actually,

200
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,161
it's a lie

201
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,640
made up by aliens
to cover up an assassination plot

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,360
against me.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,921
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,561
My identity is too sensitive.

205
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,281
Since you know now,

206
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,161
for the safety of all humanity,

207
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,600
I have to kill you to keep this quiet.

208
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Are you done?

209
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm not joking.

210
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm telling you the truth.

211
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,681
Can't you stop treating me like a fool?

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,240
I've been on adventures

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
with Qiling too.

214
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,600
I believe there are strange phenomena

215
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
in some uncharted areas.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,000
Aren't these things usually handled
by the Zhang family?

217
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,321
I would never believe

218
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,041
that Qiling asked for my help.

219
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,000
If you believed it,

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,281
it means you were deceived.

221
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,841
If you don't believe it,

222
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:30,400
that means you're lying to me.

223
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,870
Even if you beat me to death,
I would never believe it.

224
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,770
Let's start
from a different perspective.

225
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,520
If you're not willing to help us,

226
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,760
then you have nothing to do
with Zhang Qiling.

227
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,520
Then Zhang Qiling's memories
had nothing to do with you either.

228
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,081
If I don't help you,

229
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:46,600
you'll kill me?

230
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,041
No.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,921
We won't kill the clan leader's friend.

232
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,000
But we'll burn
this spiritual retreat down.

233
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,841
Then the thing you're looking for
will go up in flames with it.

234
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,760
You can think about it.

235
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,561
We can wait.

236
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,600
Tell me.

237
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,720
What do you want me to do?

238
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,400
The clan leader left something

239
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,880
in the capital of Nilaisi.

240
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,161
That thing

241
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,081
was hidden with great secrecy.

242
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,281
You are the only person

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,281
who can find it.

244
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:35,281
He never told me

245
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,321
he hid something.

246
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,120
So I don't know where it is.

247
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,081
The clan leader
is a very cautious person.

248
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,880
The clue should be hidden

249
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,441
during the time you spent with him.

250
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:45,520
That's why he said only someone

251
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,120
who has worked
with him for over three years

252
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,400
can complete this task.

253
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,000
What did he hide in Dejia?

254
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,281
The Zhang family's heirloom,

255
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,321
the Heavenly Staff.

256
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,000
It's the clan leader's artifact

257
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,281
and the key to dealing
with the Night King.

258
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,720
Is it some kind

259
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,201
of single-shot rocket launcher?

260
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:07,921
It's just a staff.

261
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,630
So, the Zhang family traditionally uses

262
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,161
a staff to poke at the Night King?

263
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,801
A staff?

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How long is the staff?

265
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,161
Is it like

266
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,480
a wizard's staff?

267
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,921
It is

268
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,600
about this long.

269
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,870
This is what the clan leader left
for you.

270
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,120
Our role is just

271
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,441
to help you get it.

272
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,161
As for what this staff actually is,

273
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:32,801
how to use it,

274
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:34,640
and how to deal
with the Night King with it,

275
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,041
we don't know.

276
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:37,961
But I am certain

277
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,640
the clan leader will tell you
in his own way.

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
You just need to decide
whether to join in or not.

279
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,240
We just met, after all.

280
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,760
You may be from the Zhang family.

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,681
But I don't know you at all.

282
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Besides,
I can't trust all of you completely.

283
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
So, I need to talk to my friend.

284
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,470
You brought your friend with you?

285
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,801
Of course.

286
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,260
I'm not someone
who would sit and wait to be killed.

287
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,801
If I were given a few more days,

288
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,770
you would find you're not
that impressive at all.

289
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,520
Sounds like your friend is skillful.

290
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:10,841
Okay.

291
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,441
How about this?

292
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,600
I will test him.

293
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,400
If your friend can get past me,

294
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,921
we will let him join us.

295
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,640
Otherwise,

296
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,681
he is not qualified to be part of this.

297
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:23,921
No honey trap.

298
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:24,921
In your dreams.

299
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,081
It's been four hours.

300
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,520
Why are you just sitting around,

301
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,201
not saying a word?

302
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,081
Can your sister handle it?

303
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,441
Or is she outmatched

304
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,760
by my friend?

305
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,921
Still quiet, huh?

306
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,520
That hurts.

307
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,880
I'll just stay still, okay?
Come on, let me go.

308
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,681
How capable is he?

309
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,841
His skills are decent.

310
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:47,640
But he's a bit slow-witted.

311
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:49,520
Someone like him

312
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,400
would never make the right decisions

313
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,520
and is of no help

314
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,000
to our mission.

315
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:57,921
I'm sorry, Wu Xie.

316
00:16:58,841 --> 00:16:59,801
I believe

317
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,081
Haixing's analysis is more objective.

318
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,681
Can you accept her opinion?

319
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,960
No, I can't.

320
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,801
I need to talk to him myself.

321
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,120
Sure.

322
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,561
Unless

323
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,440
he can free himself and escape.

324
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,200
Otherwise,

325
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,241
he's dead to us.

326
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,360
Stop saying he's dead.

327
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,801
He's struggling to move.

328
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,200
You've even covered his head.

329
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
Did you gag his mouth too?

330
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Can you hurry up
and take the cover off?

331
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,241
He could be suffocating.

332
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,281
This guy is too sneaky.

333
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,521
We can take the cover off.

334
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,721
But we can't untie his hands.

335
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,321
Can you take it off now?

336
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Who are you?

337
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:50,960
What did you do?

338
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,521
What are you doing?

339
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
Who's this?

340
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,160
Did you get the wrong guy?

341
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,680
Isn't he, your friend?

342
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,801
No.

343
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,721
My friend is more devious than him.

344
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,761
Then who is he?

345
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,570
Are you asking me?
You were the one who caught him.

346
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,920
Who are you?

347
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,561
Why were you in that room?

348
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,321
What is going on?

349
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,721
Who are you?

350
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,281
Are you ganging up with these bad guys

351
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,400
to screw me?

352
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,001
Who?

353
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:31,761
What do you mean?

354
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
He drank a lot with me.

355
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,041
I got drunk.

356
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
Then you came here

357
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,721
and kidnap me!

358
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,561
Do you know you will be sentenced
to over ten years in prison?

359
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:48,001
Then where is your friend?

360
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,521
How would I know?

361
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,721
Ah.

362
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:51,481
You guys

363
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,600
might not know my friend that well.

364
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,160
I'll briefly tell you about my friend.

365
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
This friend

366
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,001
of mine usually sets traps

367
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,241
not to escape,

368
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:02,041
but to screw people over.

369
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,120
He's ruthless.

370
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,960
Those who fall into his traps

371
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,721
meet a terribly brutal end.

372
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,721
But don't get too worried.

373
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,321
Fatty's traps are quite crude.

374
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,281
So,

375
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,041
only the exceptionally arrogant

376
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,360
would fall for them.

377
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,680
So, chill down.

378
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,801
Fatty?

379
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:23,960
Fatty is in Mosang?

380
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,081
He should be nearby.

381
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,880
If it were me,

382
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,761
I'd be tailing you,

383
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,521
making thorough preparations.

384
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,120
If the opponent's team is complete,

385
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,721
we'd already be in a dire situation.

386
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,360
Everyone needs to be alert.

387
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,400
There's no need.

388
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,001
As Wu Xie said,

389
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,920
he knows about us.

390
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:45,640
So…

391
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,700
Since we've got the wrong person,

392
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,281
let him go.

393
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,020
(Unknown number)

394
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,070
Poison gas! Everyone, stay vigilant
and open the windows!

395
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,640
Is anyone coming in for an ambush?

396
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:16,321
No.

397
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,801
Anyone missing?

398
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:18,801
Everyone is here.

399
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,081
Tell your friend to show up now.

400
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:28,360
Petty tricks like yours

401
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,680
don't work on us.

402
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,321
Stay still.

403
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,081
That's a laser sight.

404
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,920
You should listen to him and stay still.

405
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,240
You were looking for my friend, right?

406
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:54,880
He's right there.

407
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm sure he thinks

408
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,041
that you are threatening my life.

409
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,721
I need

410
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:00,761
to show him

411
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,360
that you're not enemies.

412
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,721
Can I move?

413
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,120
Let your friend come in.

414
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,521
He passed the test.

415
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
He's indeed capable.

416
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:25,321
Fatty!

417
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,600
Done so soon?

418
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,561
I haven't had enough yet.

419
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,281
Fatty.

420
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:50,880
My baby.

421
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm so worried about you.

422
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,440
Come here.

423
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,440
It's been a long time.

424
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,561
You still have a nice hairstyle.

425
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:58,680
How have you been?

426
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,801
What a chemistry.

427
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,041
Our chemistry is something.

428
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,640
You two teamed up to set me up.

429
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,041
What's going on outside the window?

430
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,160
Hey, I'm talking to you.

431
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:11,521
You mean this?

432
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,001
It's just a toy

433
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,400
from the innkeeper's kid.

434
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
The one who aimed at you from outside

435
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,960
is the innkeeper's son.

436
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,960
I got him to help with a lollipop.

437
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,200
You bullied a kid.

438
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
So, I got a kid to bully you.

439
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:30,761
Come here.

440
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:32,321
Take a break here.

441
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,041
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

442
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,561
You guys can't even spare

443
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
a little innocent kid

444
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,360
who's completely defenseless.

445
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:43,160
Give it to me.

446
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,481
The cigarette pack.

447
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,841
This is a baby monitor

448
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,960
I had ready for our little one.

449
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,521
I heard everything

450
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,001
you've been saying.

451
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,001
Miss,

452
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,041
you're still green.

453
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,321
How can your parents trust you
to be out here in society?

454
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,281
You should go home and drink more milk!

455
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,721
Stop it!

456
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Let's welcome our new friend.

457
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,081
Everyone,

458
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,081
allow me to introduce myself.

459
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,081
I'm Naive's agent

460
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:20,841
especially to deal
with mean people like you

461
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,440
who pick on

462
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,721
inexperienced young people.

463
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,400
You lured Naive

464
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,281
with a little bit of information
on Qiling.

465
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:31,120
Now that I'm here.

466
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
So we'll have a fresh discussion.

467
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,041
What leverage do you have

468
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,241
to negotiate with me?

469
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,960
Anyone who doubts my abilities

470
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,841
is in for a big loss.

471
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:49,160
Naive,

472
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,600
check your phone

473
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,801
for missed calls.

474
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,100
(Missed calls)

475
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,241
Make a call.

476
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,920
Well,

477
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,281
I just gave everyone
a display of courtesy then force.

478
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:07,440
So, I've shown my courtesy.

479
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,481
Hello.

480
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,321
It's time to show force next.

481
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,241
You don't have to say yes to them.

482
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
Who are you?

483
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,120
It doesn't matter who I am.

484
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,481
What matters is your choice.

485
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
There are only two of us here.

486
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
They have over a dozen people here

487
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,721
and are highly skilled.

488
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
Do we even have a choice?

489
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,360
So,

490
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
can you choose us now?

491
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

492
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,241
the show is about to start.

493
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:49,360
Stay still.

494
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,880
It's not a rehearsal this time.

495
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,960
Naive,

496
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,521
come with me.

497
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,001
Trying to trick me again?

498
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:02,160
Run!

499
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,880
Turn off the lights!

500
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:23,680
Go.

501
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:42,400
Go!

502
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,160
Go.

503
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,761
Pretty accurate.

504
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Are you okay?

505
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:22,160
Luckily, I've got a way
of dodging bullets.

506
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,600
What about you?

507
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,970
I was having a pretty good talk
with them inside the house.

508
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,001
Can you tell them to stop firing?

509
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,160
What they said doesn't mean it's true.

510
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:31,761
Listen.

511
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:32,920
I also had a good talk

512
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,200
with the people I brought.

513
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,600
Why don't you talk to both sides?

514
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:37,160
How can we talk now?

515
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,561
We should stay alive first.

516
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
You're really something.

517
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,721
I am, right?

518
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,041
Run.

519
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,281
Mr. Wang,

520
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,160
this must be Mr. Wu.

521
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,801
I've heard so much about you.

522
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,160
Please, have a seat.

523
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,321
What's going on?

524
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:56,360
It's complicated.

525
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,081
I have no time
to explain it to you in detail.

526
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,360
Hello.

527
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:06,241
You arrived just in time.

528
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,160
Come here, Naive.

529
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,841
Speaking of this matter,

530
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,001
we need to go back to
when I ran into them in the loo.

531
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:20,241
As soon as you
and that practitioner left,

532
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,200
This guy...

533
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,761
I meant it in a good way.

534
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,880
This guy came.

535
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,321
There are so many people.

536
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,640
Diarrhea attack?

537
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,440
I squatted longer than expected.

538
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,530
So my legs are numb.

539
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,640
You would feel the same too.

540
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,400
One by one.

541
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,801
Who is your boss?

542
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,170
How about we talk about it?

543
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:35,640
Where is your boss?

544
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,920
What's with the fire extinguishers?

545
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,561
Who are these for?

546
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,521
Stop being so cool.

547
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,710
I've seen plenty of people trying
to act cool.

548
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,200
Where is your boss?

549
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,960
Excuse me. Where is your boss?

550
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:21,041
Follow me.

551
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Where is the mechanic?

552
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:50,200
Boss.

553
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,081
Hello, Mr. Wang.

554
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm Feng,

555
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:56,001
from Denasi.

556
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,600
We finally meet.

557
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,761
Are you trying to scare me?

558
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
So, tell me.

559
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,081
What do you want?

560
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,841
You can kill
or do whatever you want with me.

561
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:08,400
Or do you have any special preferences?

562
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:10,001
Mr. Wang, don't get me wrong.

563
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,440
We place a lot of importance
on this meeting.

564
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:14,200
I can tell.

565
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,880
Let me introduce myself.

566
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,600
I'm in biological research.

567
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:19,721
Recently,

568
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,761
we acquired Qiu Dekao's company.

569
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,001
He should be related to you, right?

570
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,440
Oh, you're Qiu's friend.

571
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,540
Trying to get close to us?

572
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
I thought

573
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,120
Qiu was obsessed with immortality.

574
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:40,680
But he's passed away, hasn't he?

575
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,740
Do you miss him that much?

576
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,081
Do you want to talk to him?

577
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,920
We certainly don't believe
in these things.

578
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,241
We do legitimate scientific research,

579
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,360
mainly focusing on the origins
and evolution of ancient organisms.

580
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,081
Mr. Qiu Dekao brought back

581
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,321
some items from ancient ruins

582
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,081
that happened

583
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,281
to be species we needed
for our research.

584
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,640
That's why we acquired his company.

585
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,521
Later, we found some information

586
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,841
about the three of you
while sorting through the materials.

587
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,241
I have great respect
for your achievements

588
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:09,960
and have always hoped to meet you.

589
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,281
So, you're a fan.

590
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:16,241
One of my latest research projects

591
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,870
is called,
the "Night King Devours The Sky."

592
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,600
The Night King creature

593
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,761
is very important to our company.

594
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,041
I'm here

595
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,521
because I hope we get the chance

596
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:25,841
to work together.

597
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,761
That's a lot of money.

598
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
Mr. Wu,

599
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,081
I've already discussed

600
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:41,440
the price with Mr. Wang.

601
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:44,801
You only have two options now.

602
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
You can leave with them.

603
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,001
But I'm pretty certain

604
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,120
you don't know
whether they'll give you information

605
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,721
about Zhang Qiling.

606
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Or you can work with us.

607
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,561
Apart from money,

608
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,640
we can guarantee your safety.

609
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,920
I can also protect
this spiritual retreat

610
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,561
and keep it open for you.

611
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,041
Do you really think we're fools?

612
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:09,640
Just a moment ago

613
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,001
in that room,

614
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,321
you started shooting

615
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,761
when we were still in the room.

616
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,960
Do you think bullets have eyes,

617
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,400
or do you think we're invincible?

618
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,281
We've seen these kinds
of situations a lot.

619
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:22,200
But there's no need to go overboard.

620
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,081
Mr. Wu,

621
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,561
we're all professionally trained.

622
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,041
We were confident.

623
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,281
Just like the battle outside earlier,

624
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,001
we can end it

625
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,521
within three minutes.

626
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,640
Well, it really did stop
within three minutes.

627
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
You don't even have
to consider it anymore.

628
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,521
You're that confident?

629
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,841
How can you be so sure you'll win?

630
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,281
Of course, I'm sure.

631
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,120
Mr. Wu,

632
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,440
I know business people

633
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,241
like you are very cautious.

634
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,241
But I can assure you

635
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,920
that we're offering you the best option.

636
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,080
I'm sure we'll make a great team.

637
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,161
Okay.

638
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,000
How about this?

639
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,841
Mr. Wu. Mr. Wang.

640
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,601
Why don't you discuss this?

641
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:27,201
I'll go and check things out.

642
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,281
I'll be right back,

643
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:30,270
and we'll finalize the details
of our cooperation.

644
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,801
I haven't agreed to work with you.

645
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,641
This is a big investor.

646
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,241
They didn't really wipe out

647
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,641
the Zhang family, right?

648
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,170
I don't think they would go that far.

649
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,440
These Denasi people

650
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:06,641
are all about profit.

651
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:08,681
The Zhang family

652
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,121
looks like they have
more experience than us.

653
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,841
They wouldn't have offered them
a higher price, would they?

654
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:18,121
I haven't asked you yet.

655
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
What price did they offer you

656
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,080
that won you over

657
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,560
and dragged me

658
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,241
into these dangerous situations?

659
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,601
- How much did they offer?
-  What do you mean by that?

660
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:29,841
This guy's holding a nail gun
in one hand

661
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,040
and a million bucks in the other,

662
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
and said he's our fan.
How can I refuse him?

663
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,960
So we must work with them.

664
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,040
What if I fail to rescue you

665
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,281
from the Zhang family?

666
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,520
We need a backup plan and an ally.

667
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,161
Clever, right?

668
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:48,201
So

669
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
you really want to work with them?

670
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm doing it for you.

671
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
Fatty, are you really that foolish?

672
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,121
Are the Denasi people good guys?

673
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:58,880
Both these groups are terrifying
in their own way.

674
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,880
Right now, we're like meat
on the chopping block.

675
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:04,281
But the meat isn't without hope.

676
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:05,440
Oh, shut up.

677
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,920
They've investigated all our information

678
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,880
and materials

679
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,241
and have everything down to a tee.

680
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:14,400
But we don't know a thing

681
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,601
about them.

682
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,960
Naive,

683
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,681
you've hit the nail on the head.

684
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:24,440
The key is to understand them.

685
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,080
We should dig up their dirty secrets.

686
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,241
Are you saying

687
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:29,560
we have to find ways

688
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,400
to look into them?

689
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,321
We should use their conflict
to our advantage

690
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:34,201
and make a mess of them.

691
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,121
Say,

692
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:06,121
do you think something happened?

693
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,641
They wouldn't just leave

694
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,040
with the Zhang family, would they?

695
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,070
If so, I need to ask for a fee
for breaking the deal

696
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:13,601
and also a referral fee.

697
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,721
They wouldn't have some special trick

698
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:21,000
to harm us, would they?

699
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,641
Like some kind of sorcery.

700
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,080
The Zhang family does seem
a bit sinister.

701
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,241
Fatty!

702
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,801
Fatty!

703
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,201
Fatty.

704
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,740
Why do you still make me worry
when you're at this age?

705
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,681
Why did you barge over
in this situation?

706
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:48,681
You should've stayed on the ground.

707
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:50,170
Try not to let anyone shoot your head.

708
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,641
Who did it?

709
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:54,641
Don't tell me Feng backed out
of the deal

710
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,040
and turned the tables on us.

711
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,400
He's three meters away.

712
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,060
All the best of luck.

713
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,201
Wealth and prosperity!

714
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,920
You dare to mess with us

715
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,201
with this piece of junk?

716
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,920
Your skills are still good.

717
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,260
The chemistry is still there.

718
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
What happened back then
is happening again.

719
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,841
