=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 6=

4
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,660
What happened back then
is happening again.

5
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,704
Isn't this that practitioner?

6
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,545
Even he is acting strange now.

7
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,025
Everyone in this place seems off.

8
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,025
We need to be extra careful.

9
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,585
That means this room isn't safe anymore.

10
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:04,945
I have to take you somewhere safer.

11
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,025
Let's go. We are taking him with us too.

12
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:18,985
Okay.

13
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:19,985
Get in.

14
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,985
I'll check out who this guy is.

15
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,185
There's nothing on him.

16
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,064
Wake up.

17
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,504
Naive, you've gotten pretty tough.

18
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:39,624
That hit

19
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,185
must've really hurt the guy.

20
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,064
Things are getting
more complicated here.

21
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:51,865
We don't even know
how many groups are involved.

22
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:55,305
Next thing you know, the cafeteria lady
or the convenience lady

23
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,985
might pop out and try to kill us.

24
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,544
I won't be able to take it.

25
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,624
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

26
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:02,905
Keep an eye on him.

27
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,865
I'll go out to check out the place.

28
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:05,705
No.

29
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:07,465
I should go.

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,070
I know this place better than you do.

31
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,265
Don't wander around,

32
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,425
or you might get lost.

33
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,050
I'm glad you're still here

34
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,025
and did not vanish
with those in the spiritual retreat.

35
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,744
The spiritual retreat mass
disappearance.

36
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,970
Is this some kind
of Detective Conan's case?

37
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:01,585
Does that mean we are the only
three people left in this spiritual retreat?

38
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,505
Could it be

39
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,505
that the Denaxi guy took everyone
down the mountain?

40
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:09,905
There were so many of them.

41
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,385
They couldn't have vanished suddenly.

42
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,970
They would have left footprints behind.

43
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:22,864
Fatty, look.

44
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:34,784
There is not a single footprint.

45
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,905
Our guess is wrong.

46
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,060
If everyone was chased down
the mountain,

47
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:40,984
there would be footprints all over.

48
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,784
Is there any other exit?

49
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:47,465
No.

50
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,740
This should be the only way down
the mountain.

51
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,945
Everyone could still
be in the spiritual retreat.

52
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,465
This is not working, Fatty.
I can't think of anything.

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,025
You've got a radical brain.
Can you think about what's going on?

54
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,784
If I break it down,

55
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,265
there are two possibilities.

56
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,465
The first one,

57
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,385
this place is
a haunted spiritual retreat.

58
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:09,265
Everyone here is a ghost.

59
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,784
Of course, we can't see them.

60
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:11,800
The second possibility,

61
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,224
we were shot dead earlier

62
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,664
and we are the ghosts.

63
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
There is also a third possibility.

64
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,945
There are secret rooms
or hidden passages

65
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:21,970
within the spiritual retreat.

66
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,104
Everyone is hiding in there.

67
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,905
But you must explain

68
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:27,664
what exactly happened

69
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,585
that made both parties agree

70
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,424
to go into hiding.

71
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,585
A new enemy has arrived.

72
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:34,984
And this enemy is even more terrifying.

73
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:39,744
Is it Night King?

74
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,664
You're finally up, pal.

75
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,664
You're truly a rare one, huh?

76
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:48,945
How about a chat?

77
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:50,664
Where did everyone go?

78
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,544
Who ordered you to attack us?

79
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,385
Where's the spiritual retreat's
secret passage?

80
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,104
What's the hour?

81
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,424
It's 6 o'clock.

82
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:01,705
The sun's about to come up.

83
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,385
Why are you asking?

84
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:04,705
It's over.

85
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:06,145
It's over now.

86
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:08,744
Putting up an act now, huh?

87
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,184
We are going to die.

88
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:13,784
Are you trying to scare us?

89
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,025
Follow him.

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,570
Where you're running off to?

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,770
How is this a secret room
and a secret passage?

92
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,385
Close all of the windows.

93
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:31,544
They're about to come.

94
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:32,304
Hurry.

95
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,465
Who are you talking about? Who's coming?

96
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:35,544
Anyone who runs into them

97
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,664
will die.

98
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,760
Then why head back inside
instead of leaving the mountain?

99
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:39,625
It's useless.

100
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:41,465
They are everywhere.

101
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,784
We would die
if we headed down the mountain.

102
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,065
Buddy,

103
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:46,465
I beg you.

104
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,104
Close all of the windows now.

105
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:50,664
I still want to live. Please, I beg you.

106
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,544
Let's see what tricks you've got.

107
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:53,465
If you trick me,

108
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,505
I will beat you up.

109
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,065
Buddy.

110
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,304
In another half an hour,

111
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:58,265
you will understand

112
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:00,060
that things are even worse
than I have described.

113
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,000
We still have a chance
if you listen to me.

114
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,344
So, tell me something.

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,230
Has there ever been
some kind of monster here?

116
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,784
For instance, every year
on a certain day,

117
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:10,945
it will appear at dawn.

118
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:15,104
What could scare you this much?

119
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,224
Is it Night King?

120
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:35,304
Buddy.

121
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:38,265
Buddy, untie me now.
I can help you get through this.

122
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:39,664
Hurry! We are running out of time.

123
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:46,345
Hurry.

124
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:47,824
Take off your jackets now.

125
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,664
Hurry.

126
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,664
What are you up to now?

127
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,704
Enjoying sauna?

128
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,664
We are really running out of time.
We must be ready within three minutes.

129
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:58,745
Do you understand me?

130
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:05,544
This charcoal fire

131
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,025
is your only chance to stay alive now.

132
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,345
Why did you attack us?

133
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,225
Of course, to stay alive.

134
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,064
But it is too late to explain now.

135
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:17,265
Hold on to this.

136
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,625
Earthquake?

137
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,424
Do not make any sound.

138
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,985
Those things are clever.

139
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,625
Don't let them know we are here.

140
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:35,784
No one.

141
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,225
Who exactly are they?

142
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,064
They are fooling around with us.

143
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,270
They're hiding in the blind spots,
so we can't see them.

144
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,105
Who has the time to do that?

145
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,184
Could it be
the spiritual retreat group coming back?

146
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,464
I'll go check it out.

147
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,784
They are here.

148
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:25,784
He ran off.

149
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,025
It's the insects!

150
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,584
What's going on here?

151
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Why is there suddenly
an insect infestation?

152
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,064
They like the heat.

153
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:48,505
Get rid of the baggage now!

154
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,985
They like heat, huh?

155
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,464
Then, let's start a fire.

156
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,025
Fatty!

157
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:20,905
Fatty!

158
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:24,145
Get up.

159
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:28,464
These dumb insects

160
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:29,584
are afraid of your blood.

161
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,225
Back at Yunding Heavenly Palace,

162
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:32,625
my blood worked once too.

163
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,220
We get out of here now.
I can't hold them off for too long.

164
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:38,704
Go!

165
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,025
I have to cover my head again?

166
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,040
Put it on first.
Staying alive is more important.

167
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,905
I'm wearing one. What about you?

168
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,184
I can use my blood.

169
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:54,025
We must leave the spiritual retreat
and head down the mountain.

170
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:55,704
Wait!

171
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,464
The basket has gaps.

172
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,424
Let's go.

173
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,664
Are you in cahoots with the insects?

174
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,105
Hold onto me. Let's go.

175
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:14,584
Slow down!

176
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:18,720
The bugs really are coming from outside.

177
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,424
That practitioner was right.

178
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,184
Run! Go this way!

179
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,145
This way.

180
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:48,944
Fatty, be careful.

181
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,385
They've been probing us
from the outside for a while now.

182
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,064
They might be really smart.

183
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,345
The ones in front are covering

184
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,865
the scent of your blood
with their bodies

185
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:57,985
to let the ones behind come through.

186
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,584
We must get out of here quick.

187
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,145
Even if I bled out completely,

188
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,505
it wouldn't stop them.

189
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,184
We're caught with no way out.

190
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:04,985
Let's go.

191
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:11,704
Out the window.

192
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:18,664
I am stuck.

193
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:19,505
Let me help!

194
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,544
Was that the scum
who screwed us just now?

195
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,360
He's already been eaten alive
by the insects.

196
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,270
Luckily, we have your blood
and this basket.

197
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,944
Or else I would end up like him.

198
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,025
Let's go.

199
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:03,664
Naive, why aren't you saying anything?

200
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,145
Is this the end for us?

201
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:09,985
Fatty,

202
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,225
I am sorry.

203
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,784
Is there any way out of this?

204
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,704
Even if we hide in a room,

205
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,745
those insects will find a way
to get inside.

206
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,944
What should we do then?

207
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:20,464
The only way

208
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,385
is not to stop finding a way.

209
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,064
We can only run around the insects.

210
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,625
We have to bolt
as soon as we break through.

211
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:29,944
There are so many of them.

212
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,424
They must be starving.

213
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,985
The altitude sickness
is making it hard for me to run.

214
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:33,960
We still have to run anyway.

215
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,385
Go that way.

216
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:54,544
The insects are poisonous.

217
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:55,640
I am feeling a little dizzy.

218
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,745
I am seeing you and Qiling.

219
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,664
Are we

220
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,385
in heaven now?

221
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:27,824
These dumb bugs

222
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:31,025
are all under Qiling's control.

223
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,025
We're so frozen

224
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,265
that we've lost all body heat.

225
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,784
They can no longer sense our body heat.

226
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,745
They're not the only ones.

227
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,784
Even I can't feel

228
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,385
my body heat.

229
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:55,584
What is so funny?

230
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,064
We're both going to die.

231
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,424
I mean, I'm already disfigured.

232
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,224
I am too ashamed to live.

233
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,944
And you're not going

234
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,105
to make it either.

235
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:14,184
Why did you give me your jacket?

236
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:17,264
Even to my death,

237
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,825
I will still take good care of you.

238
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,145
This isn't

239
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:26,184
a spiritual retreat.

240
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,785
It's an insect nest.

241
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:34,625
What's waiting for us
is an insect burial.

242
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,305
An insect burial?

243
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,424
Before I die,

244
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,464
I have one last thing to say.

245
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,464
The most worthwhile

246
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,825
and unfortunate thing

247
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:51,744
in my life

248
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:56,664
is becoming friends with you.

249
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,744
Not forgetting, Qiling too.

250
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:06,744
Don't you think

251
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:08,825
it's a bit early to say that?

252
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,024
You will definitely live

253
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,625
a long life.

254
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,360
Wealth and prosperity to you.

255
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:14,825
Continue to prosper.

256
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,625
Do you really think
you're some kind of savior?

257
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:24,224
You're out of ideas too, aren't you?

258
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,704
Even now,

259
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:30,504
we still have to go through the motions.

260
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,944
If Qiling is here,

261
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,270
he will definitely have
a way out of this.

262
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,825
Yet, he insisted on choosing you
to take on Night King.

263
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:43,585
The two of us together

264
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,385
can't even handle a bunch of insects.

265
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,424
Are you mad?

266
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:54,145
What were you thinking?

267
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,184
Qiling,

268
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,305
why are you crying?

269
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:06,504
Was I

270
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,385
too harsh?

271
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:10,385
Fatty,

272
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:14,105
I am sorry.

273
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,424
I dragged you into this.

274
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,345
It is all my fault.

275
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:24,464
What are you even talking about?

276
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,944
If I give you another chance,

277
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:32,984
you would still make the same decision.

278
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,024
Even if you knew

279
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:37,345
you would die here,

280
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:40,305
you would still come

281
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,424
and I would still choose

282
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,305
to come with you

283
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,744
until the end.

284
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:51,744
This is fate, Naive.

285
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:53,024
I am sorry.

286
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,385
Enough with that pointless talking.

287
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,464
You must be confused by exhaustion.

288
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:01,585
How about you sleep for a while?

289
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:05,145
If you cannot sleep,
I will tell you a story.

290
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:07,224
Long ago,

291
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:10,184
there lived three fools.

292
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,664
They are foolish as kids.

293
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,105
They...

294
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,370
Something is not right.
We're so frozen right now

295
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,345
that we lost our body heat.

296
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,224
They can no longer sense our body heat.

297
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,424
Even I cannot feel

298
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:52,744
my body heat.

299
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,345
Something is not right.

300
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,850
You are not supposed to swarm down here.

301
00:20:58,865 --> 00:20:59,865
You are not supposed to.

302
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,984
You can't sense us.
You shouldn't be swarming down here.

303
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,305
It's an illusion!

304
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,264
You've put us under an illusion.

305
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,264
What is that?

306
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,504
This is the Zhang family's
hexagonal bell.

307
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,184
It's made from a special type
of meteorite bronze.

308
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:48,224
It can induce hallucinations.

309
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,305
It can be incredibly realistic.

310
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:52,825
If I didn't tell you,

311
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,984
you would think

312
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:55,905
all of this was real.

313
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,704
This bell is extremely dangerous.

314
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:00,905
We don't dare to use it carelessly.

315
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:02,385
So

316
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,224
I usually keep it sealed.

317
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:07,184
Can you guess

318
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,704
when you entered the illusion?

319
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,385
We heard the sound of the bell

320
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,224
when we were in this room last night.

321
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:31,825
Pretty smart.

322
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:33,424
Well done.

323
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:34,585
You have passed the test.

324
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,224
Very few people can snap
out of it on their own.

325
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:38,385
But he is not as good.

326
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,940
But having him with you would give
some peace of mind.

327
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,530
You can say he passed the test too.

328
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,345
Catch the insects.

329
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,345
Catch them.

330
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,424
What test?

331
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,625
What was the test for?

332
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:55,664
To test whether you are qualified

333
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,270
to fight Night King in the snowy mountain.

334
00:22:58,424 --> 00:22:59,625
This is the second test.

335
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,065
Another test after the first one?

336
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,944
The Zhang family

337
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,105
usually has three tests.

338
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,744
The first was cutting off the head.

339
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,105
What we just did was the second.

340
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,424
I requested for the test.

341
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:11,625
You did badly on the first test.

342
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:13,545
You barely passed this one.

343
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:17,625
One test after the other.

344
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,720
Don't you have enough of it?

345
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:21,385
Why are you testing me?

346
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:22,865
To test my bottom line?

347
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:24,944
What am I to you guys?

348
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:27,664
From the start,

349
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:29,184
you all acted high and mighty,

350
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,065
looking down on us ordinary folk, huh?

351
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,464
Then don't ask me to help.

352
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,570
You can do it yourself
if you are that competent.

353
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:36,105
You think I'm happy to serve you?

354
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:38,984
Don't worry.

355
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:40,704
There's one more test left.

356
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,744
What are you going to test next?

357
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:47,825
When will it be?

358
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:49,664
Just wait.

359
00:23:58,744 --> 00:23:59,545
Fine.

360
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:01,865
I don't want to talk about this yet.

361
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:03,905
Let's get back to your predicament.

362
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,504
If you want me to proceed
with the third test,

363
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,944
share your information with me.

364
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:09,905
First of all,

365
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:12,105
how's it going with the Denaxi people?

366
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:14,905
Unfortunately,

367
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:17,264
we fought them to a draw.

368
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:18,504
So,

369
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:20,664
you only have the guts to bully me, huh?

370
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:22,545
They're also after Night King.

371
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:24,264
For now, we've called for a ceasefire.

372
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:25,865
There's a meeting coming up

373
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,865
to exchange information.

374
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,785
Only to decide whether to cooperate.

375
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,224
You will attend the meeting too.

376
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:33,385
Me?

377
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:36,184
Do I even qualify
to join the discussion?

378
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,270
The clan leader hid
the Heavenly Staff in a certain place.

379
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,704
To open that place,

380
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:43,664
we need three special keys,

381
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,024
which are hidden

382
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,305
in three different locations

383
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,504
in Dejia.

384
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:49,224
One of those keys

385
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,785
is with the foreigners.

386
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,424
So, we have to attend the meeting

387
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,224
and see

388
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:54,825
what other information they have.

389
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,145
We seek you out to find the key.

390
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,105
You're the key to finding it.

391
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:02,224
So, you've got a hand to play.

392
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:03,944
Why me?

393
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:04,905
We're not sure yet.

394
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,184
So, you're saying I've got a hand.

395
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,424
But it's a blind hand.

396
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,065
Could be a winning flush,

397
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:12,105
or it could be nothing.

398
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,704
How do we find the key?

399
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:15,424
I don't know.

400
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,970
The clan leader was very cautious.

401
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,640
The Heavenly Staff is well hidden,
and the keys are even better hidden.

402
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:20,385
So,

403
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,704
we'll need to stay in Dejia for a while.

404
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:25,664
You're saying that
if we want to kill Night King,

405
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:27,105
we have to go to Dejia

406
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,105
to find the keys first,
then the Heavenly Staff?

407
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,664
Feng already has one key.

408
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,630
So that leaves two more.

409
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:35,105
So, once we get to Dejia,

410
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:36,570
we will be hunting some keys
and treasure?

411
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:38,184
You can say that.

412
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:41,625
Get ready. The meeting's about to start.

413
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:46,065
What about him?

414
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:47,905
If Naive is heading to the meeting,

415
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,024
how can the agent not go too?

416
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:52,105
I didn't expect you

417
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:54,424
to get up so fast.

418
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:01,105
Good thing

419
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:03,785
you didn't badmouth me
while I was napping.

420
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,345
Or else…

421
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,224
Your sister's face would be ruined.

422
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:11,305
With skills like yours?

423
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,270
No wonder you can't get
anything done.

424
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:22,184
All the best of luck.

425
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:23,345
Wealth and prosperity.

426
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,345
You'd better reach an agreement
with the Denaxi people.

427
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,024
Or else

428
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:28,825
we'll side with them.

429
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,145
This pretty boy has bad intentions.

430
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,545
I never trust pretty boys.

431
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:35,224
Except for you, of course.

432
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:41,905
Haike,

433
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,744
can we trust those guys?

434
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,560
Let's see what they have to say.

435
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:47,825
I bet

436
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:48,944
Zhang Haike's brain

437
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:51,105
is messed up.

438
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,024
How do you know
when you barely know him?

439
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,145
Who would test
and score people for no reason?

440
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:56,385
That lady who kicked me

441
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,305
won't be much different than him.

442
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,704
If you keep spouting nonsense,

443
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,905
I will break your legs.

444
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,145
Let's get to what's next.

445
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:14,470
Are we really joining the meeting?

446
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:16,664
Based on my guess,

447
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:18,145
no matter who we partner with,

448
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:19,424
we'll be dragged along.

449
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:20,545
So, don't blow it.

450
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,504
It works in our favor.

451
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:22,744
Come on.

452
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,224
Let's talk while we walk.
Walls have ears.

453
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:27,024
We thought we had the upper hand.

454
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:29,385
But we're the ones being played.

455
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,305
If the Zhang family pulls
a third test on us,

456
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:33,145
we're done for.

457
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,224
What do we do?

458
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,865
I'm still waiting for Yu Da's scroll.

459
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:38,345
We might as well use the meeting
to gather information.

460
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:40,504
Who knows? Yu Da might
be another force at play.

461
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:41,585
Let's see what happens.

462
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,065
Just a heads up.

463
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,664
Don't let your obsession blind you

464
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,630
and walk right into the trap
when you know it is one.

465
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,504
When Qiling comes out,

466
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:48,905
he would not want
to see you dead.

467
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,385
Don't worry. It won't happen.

468
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:51,860
We'll run once we get the information.

469
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,545
I guess walls really do have ears.

470
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,224
That's too many ears.

471
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,785
How is this a meeting?

472
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,065
They are obviously threatening us.

473
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,944
The meeting's just an excuse

474
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,345
for everyone to size each other up

475
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:19,184
and to see who can outmaneuver whom.

476
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,184
You're Qiling's chosen Night King hunter.

477
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,270
They'll all be fighting
to get you on their side.

478
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:27,264
So,

479
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,464
you need to show them you're worth it.

480
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,704
Once we get in,

481
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:35,865
don't say anything first.

482
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:37,385
Let's listen

483
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,305
and see what they've got.

484
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:42,024
If things start to turn against us,

485
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:44,464
we'll create some chaos and bolt.

486
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:45,865
Don't worry.

487
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,504
That is what I am good at.

488
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:50,105
Then all the best.

489
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:51,944
Long life to you.

490
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:54,504
Thank you all

491
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:56,065
for joining this meeting.

492
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:59,664
Since our target is Night King,

493
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:03,345
the best way forward
is for the three of us

494
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:04,585
to work together.

495
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,744
Since we're talking about cooperation,

496
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,464
how about we all show some sincerity

497
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:10,944
and lay our cards on the table

498
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:11,865
for everyone to share?

499
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:16,625
What is it?

500
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,424
Share what you have.

501
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:18,545
What about you?

502
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,865
You can share yours first.

503
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:22,305
Fine.

504
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,704
I won't let you fall short.

505
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:24,984
We'll do it first.

506
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:27,504
This charming and dashing Mr. Wu Xie,

507
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,825
the Third Master,

508
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:30,865
is the only agent

509
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:32,625
personally appointed

510
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,264
by Zhang Qiling,

511
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:40,345
the one who took care
of Night King previously.

512
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,480
That's how impressive he is.

513
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:43,825
That's all.

514
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:44,905
It is your turn now.

515
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,264
Mr. Zhang, do you have anything
to share?

516
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:49,825
Mr. Feng,

517
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,170
you might not be fully aware
of Night King Devours The Sky yet.

518
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:53,704
I can only tell you

519
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,224
that this situation

520
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,664
might be even worse than you imagined.

521
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,920
With the people and weapons you've got,
you won't be able to handle it.

522
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,585
Mr. Zhang might not know us well.

523
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:06,625
But we actually know more

524
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,744
about Night King Devours The Sky than you do.

525
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:09,944
Our research on it

526
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,224
began over eighty years ago.

527
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:15,704
To show our sincerity,

528
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:17,385
Anjing Company is offering

529
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,145
all our research data

530
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:21,744
on Night King Devours The Sky
for your reference.

531
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:27,545
A century ago,

532
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:29,984
a renowned naturalist,

533
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:31,065
Hicklefort,

534
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:33,145
and anthropologist William Boulogne

535
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,664
once led two expeditions into Mosang.

536
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:37,264
There were rumors

537
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:39,065
that they discovered

538
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,905
a mysterious ancient city in Mosang.

539
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:44,905
But they mysteriously disappeared
soon after.

540
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:46,585
It wasn't until years later

541
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,184
that we obtained

542
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:50,305
the materials they brought back
from Mosang.

543
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,905
Among the documents
about that ancient city,

544
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,704
we found some clues about Night King.

545
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,305
The records mention

546
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:00,984
that deep in the snowy mountains,

547
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,704
there is a strange building

548
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:05,865
located at the end
of an uncharted underground area.

549
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,184
The earliest records

550
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,704
date back to the year 1040,

551
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:10,825
indicating

552
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:13,625
that this structure has been around
for a very long time.

553
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,704
We don't even know

554
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,744
which civilization built it.

555
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:18,664
Go on.

556
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:20,664
Based on our deduction,

557
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:24,065
this building could be the entrance
to an ancient city.

558
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:25,984
During the summer,

559
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,065
the snow melts,

560
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,504
the path from this entrance
to the ancient city

561
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:31,944
becomes visible.

562
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:33,865
Inside that city,

563
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,984
something beyond imagination

564
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:37,424
is present.

565
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,944
That is

566
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:45,984
the legendary Night King.

567
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:49,264
According to the records,

568
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,840
Night King frequently moves around
the ancient city.

569
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:54,224
Eighty years ago,

570
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,664
we sent out several expedition teams

571
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,385
to venture into the snowy mountains

572
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:00,625
to find

573
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:03,065
this mysterious ancient city

574
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,625
and locate Night King.

575
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,065
But most of them went missing.

576
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:08,880
Only one team left behind
a video recording.

577
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:10,585
These explorers

578
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:13,024
were experienced special forces veterans.

579
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:16,545
They were experienced
in various harsh environments.

580
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:18,105
This is the footage

581
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:20,704
we've restored using our technology.

582
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,264
We've been searching for three months.

583
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:25,944
But there's no trace
of the ancient city.

584
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:35,704
The storm is coming!

585
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:38,105
Let's go and find a shelter!

586
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:43,024
There is a cave!

587
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:46,704
Let's go and hide inside.

588
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,905
Come on!

589
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:02,145
I've never seen such symbols before.

590
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:06,744
Come and take a look at this.

591
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:07,664
Come here.

592
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:08,984
Come here quickly.

593
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:09,825
Faster. Come on.

594
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:11,585
Can you see it?

595
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,625
It's the mural from the legend.

596
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,224
We've finally found the mural
of the Night King Devours The Sky.

597
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,984
I think we are getting close
to the ancient city.

598
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,224
Tell everyone

599
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,704
we will start exploring
when the storm stops tomorrow.

600
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:25,424
Don't you guys think
this mural is weird?

601
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,984
Why would the Night King's mural
appear in this cave in isolation?

602
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:28,944
What do you mean?

603
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,944
This is not the area
of the ancient city.

604
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:34,664
So could there be something special
about this cave

605
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:36,585
which is why this mural of Night King

606
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:37,944
is here?

607
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:40,585
I feel uncomfortable about the legend

608
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,184
of Night King Devours The Sky.

609
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:43,345
Then it must be fake.

610
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:45,105
The legend was made by the locals

611
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,464
to protect their relics.

612
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:47,744
I hope you are right.

613
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,065
What is that?

614
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:52,744
Look!

615
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,024
What's that?

616
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:30,104
Do you believe this?

617
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,984
We sent many people to search for them

618
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:39,424
and finally found the bodies

619
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:41,984
of that expedition team deep
in the snowy mountains.

620
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,745
All fifteen members of the team

621
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:44,584
were dead.

622
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:47,104
The rescuers

623
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,544
who came back

624
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:51,905
underwent years
of psychological counseling

625
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,424
because the way
the expedition teams died

626
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,665
was just too horrific.

627
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:56,225
It looked like they were chewed up

628
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,345
by a huge creature.

629
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:00,785
Their bones had been chewed to pieces.

630
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:02,825
For some unknown reason,

631
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:04,665
the remains were frozen

632
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:06,464
deep within the ice.

633
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:09,944
Among their belongings,

634
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,745
we discovered

635
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:14,665
a very securely locked safe.

636
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,705
Judging by the traces at the scene,

637
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,705
it seems that the expedition team

638
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,984
must have locked something
important inside before they died.

639
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,385
We believe whatever was in that safe

640
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:31,464
is closely related
to Night King Devours The Sky.

641
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:33,305
But

642
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,265
when we finally opened the safe,

643
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,624
we found a rotting mass of flesh inside.

644
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:39,424
From its shape and size,

645
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:40,705
this mass

646
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,265
was identical to the golden sphere

647
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,305
that attacked the expedition team
in the video.

648
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:47,064
We researched

649
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,225
this rotting mass

650
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:51,225
and found it
to be a biological organism.

651
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:53,785
Based on Night King's legend,

652
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:54,745
we think

653
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:57,905
this golden sphere
is closely related to Night King.

654
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,064
Can you guess

655
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:02,024
the connection between these two?

656
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:03,504
It's round and bloated.

657
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:05,424
Could it be Night King's eyeball?

658
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,544
We speculate that this golden sphere

659
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:09,385
is an organ of Night King.

660
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,064
In other words,

661
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,305
that expedition team

662
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:16,865
was attacked by Night King,

663
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:19,385
and the golden sphere

664
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,064
must have fallen off

665
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:22,424
and rapidly decayed

666
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:25,064
into what we see now.

667
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:28,745
Did you guys shoot its eye out?

668
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:32,024
Of course, Night King would go after you.

669
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,185
Our study of the mass

670
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:37,584
revealed substances
we've never seen before.

671
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,944
These substances have significant

672
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:41,584
medicinal value.

673
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:44,584
They can accelerate cell repair.

674
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:46,424
We've been applying
this part of the findings

675
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:48,825
to medical research

676
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:51,944
with tremendous results.

677
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,385
We even discovered that these substances

678
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,464
can affect

679
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,104
the molecular structure of DNA

680
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:00,544
and alter human genes.

681
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,825
If we continue our research,

682
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:05,705
we might even be able
to eliminate all diseases.

683
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,745
But you already have one.

684
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:16,665
Just use it for research

685
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:18,464
and apply what you discover as you go.

686
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:43,665
Night King's eye?

687
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,185
It's all wrinkled.

688
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:53,225
Stop messing around.

689
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:54,584
This thing

690
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:57,024
will soon be useless.

691
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:58,944
The useful substances

692
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:00,825
degrade quickly.

693
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:04,104
We need a living Night King

694
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,624
to continue our research.

695
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:13,504
A little piece of advice.

696
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,265
You should give up

697
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,530
unless you have a clear plan
for dealing with Night King.

698
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,670
Otherwise, it's a death sentence.

699
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,544
I've heard that Zhang's family

700
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:27,104
once killed Night King.

701
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:28,905
So

702
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:31,185
capturing one shouldn't be a problem.

703
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,745
We're willing to offer a huge reward.

704
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,520
This Night King must be eliminated.

705
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:39,424
I know

706
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:42,745
the Zhang family clan leader
has something called the Heavenly Staff.

707
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,544
This Heavenly Staff

708
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:48,225
is crucial for dealing with Night King.

709
00:38:48,504 --> 00:38:50,624
I also know that you don't have

710
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,424
the Heavenly Staff.

711
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:55,624
If my investigation is correct,

712
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,665
Zhang Qiling has hidden
the Heavenly Staff

713
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:00,064
in a very secret place

714
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:03,024
that requires three keys

715
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,504
to unlock.

716
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:07,785
But you don't even have a single key

717
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:11,064
to obtain the Heavenly Staff
to deal with Night King.

718
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:12,385
I thought

719
00:39:12,944 --> 00:39:14,705
you already had one of the keys.

720
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,624
I really can't hide anything from you.

721
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,825
Do you really think I would sit here

722
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,464
if it weren't for that key of yours?

723
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:23,185
If we can reach an agreement,

724
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:25,424
I will definitely hand over the key.

725
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,745
