=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 25=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,480
Give me a hand.

5
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,710
Quick.

6
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,350
I didn't realize that.

7
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,240
She got us good.

8
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,240
If I hadn't been quick enough,

9
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,110
we wouldn't have met again.

10
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,670
Just now, she told me

11
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,369
she was no longer part
of the Zhang Family.

12
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,350
Is she not the real Zhang Haixing?

13
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,880
A disguise mask?

14
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,600
She's real.

15
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,830
That's strange.

16
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,880
She's Zhang Haixing,

17
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,649
but

18
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,910
she said she was no longer
part of the Zhang Family.

19
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,110
Did she cut ties with them

20
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,769
for some rebellious reason?

21
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,760
She may be stubborn,

22
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,110
but she's not childish.

23
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,320
I think what she said

24
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,200
has meaning.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,320
You see,

26
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,230
ordinary members of the Zhang Family

27
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,350
still identify themselves

28
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,480
as part of the clan,

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,600
even though they don't serve it.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,769
There's no need to deny that,

31
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,609
right?

32
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,950
If she emphasized that,

33
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,459
it means what she has been doing

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,979
doesn't align with the interests

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,230
of the Zhang Family.

36
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,760
If that's the case,

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,390
she has betrayed the Zhang Family

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,000
and is doing something
that undermines them.

39
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,040
The Zhang Family
is already down and out,

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,720
so what's left to undermine?

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,160
Even so,

42
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,200
they still hold many secrets.

43
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,950
These secrets are valuable,

44
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,390
and some could bring power.

45
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,259
If so, the traitor

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,040
hasn't just betrayed the patriarch

47
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,769
but also their kin
and the clan's principles.

48
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,299
Do you think it's the whole group

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,579
that has betrayed the Zhang Family,

50
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,160
or is it just her

51
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,040
being a mole?

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,899
If so, her brother,
Zhang Haike, is suspicious.

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,040
Something's wrong with Zhang Haike.

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,760
(Green Home)

55
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,720
My surname is also Zhang.

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,979
I'm Zhang Haike.

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,489
The one chosen by the patriarch

58
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,649
is you.

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,630
Can I have your trust now?

60
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,019
By that logic,

61
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,720
if I were using you to get the key,

62
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,510
why would I have
made things so complicated?

63
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,590
Considering Zhang Haike's personality

64
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,440
and their close sibling bond,

65
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,800
she wouldn't be able to
hide anything from him.

66
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,240
Besides, she isn't very independent.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,730
There's no way she would betray the clan
without her brother knowing.

68
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,339
If she has broken faith
with the Zhang Family,

69
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,150
her brother undoubtedly has, too.

70
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,139
They are close,

71
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,270
so it's highly likely

72
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,390
this has been Zhang Haike's scheme
from the get-go.

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,270
They have betrayed the Zhang Family

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,880
for a purpose.

75
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,699
Then, they came to me

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,579
and lured me into helping Qiling
kill the Night King

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,019
so they could get into this place.

78
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,760
Hexagonal bell?

79
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,819
For what I have been through before

80
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,139
might be in their plan.

81
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,409
They orchestrated all of this.

82
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,000
But this symbol means this place is
ten times more dangerous than above.

83
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,320
Crap! They outfoxed us big time.

84
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,950
They completely fooled us.

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,470
Fatty,

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,320
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,830
I thought I had learned something
after all these years.

88
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,880
Still, we ended up
being wrapped around their fingers.

89
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,529
They betrayed the Zhang Family

90
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,030
and Qiling.

91
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,390
What are they after?

92
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,630
What's inside here?

93
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,819
They used you

94
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,579
to resolve Qiling's trap.

95
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,710
They are certainly smart.

96
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,270
Anyway, you're not a total failure.

97
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,059
At least they couldn't resolve

98
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,590
the trap left by Qiling,

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,899
but you did.

100
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,920
You have done an excellent job
as a puppet.

101
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,070
My strength is my unique blood.

102
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,240
And my ability to resist illusions.

103
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,630
It's an illusion.

104
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,529
An illusion.

105
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,680
This is an illusion.

106
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,849
I'm the only person

107
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,070
who can resist the illusion
caused by hexagonal bells.

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,849
So

109
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,760
they have been testing me on that

110
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,030
once entered Jila Spiritual Retreat.

111
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,510
They must've studied me a lot.

112
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,289
Now that all obstacles
have been cleared,

113
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,059
they don't need me anymore,

114
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,329
so they are going to kill me.

115
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,619
We should act before they do.

116
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,760
Kill her now.

117
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,390
This is just speculation.

118
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,059
We can't kill her based on that.

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,729
Well, since this is just speculation,

120
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,510
and there's no evidence, right?

121
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,019
The only conscientious and legal way is

122
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,440
to leave her here, right?

123
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,880
Well,

124
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,139
our priority now
is to get out of this place.

125
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,600
We will die if we remain trapped here.

126
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,830
Not even satellites
can locate this place.

127
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,390
We must find a way out.

128
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,510
The entrance has collapsed.

129
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,510
We can't return the way we came.

130
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,070
We need to figure something out.

131
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,209
We went there,

132
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,950
it's a dead end.

133
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,360
This is the inland of the Snowy Peak.

134
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,950
The builders of the Bronze Door

135
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,360
were concerned about its obscurity.

136
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,320
I guess they didn't dig many exits here.

137
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,030
Just sit on our hands here?

138
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,899
There's a crack over there.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,360
An abyss.

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,710
This person

141
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,440
can definitely do it.

142
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,440
Wait, Fatty. Something's amiss.

143
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,830
We missed one thing

144
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,150
in our speculation.

145
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,630
The Qiling in that videotape is real.

146
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,390
The way he speaks

147
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,499
and his eyes, I recognized them.

148
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,470
He was asking for a favor.

149
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,950
Maybe he was looking
for an overseas purchasing agent.

150
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,969
The videotape doesn't give
a clear message.

151
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,699
It might be an excerpt
from some random video.

152
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,499
Perhaps it's about something else.

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,920
Stop being naive.

154
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,920
He recorded that
in Jila Spiritual Retreat.

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,169
He came here

156
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,409
for Dong Can's case.

157
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,800
And that's related
to the Night King's golden sphere.

158
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,379
The memories from before that

159
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,800
are with me now.

160
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,529
The favor he asked in that videotape
must have something to do with this place.

161
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,979
Come on, Naive.

162
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,160
Just get to the point.

163
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,259
What I'm saying is the Zhang siblings
have betrayed the Zhang Family

164
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,689
and lured me into guiding them here
to defeat the Night King.

165
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,449
They also want to enter the Bronze Door.

166
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,899
On the other hand, Qiling seeks someone

167
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,499
to come to Snowy Peak for something.

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,680
There's a secret behind the Bronze Door.

169
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,379
A secret that Qiling highly values

170
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,830
and that the siblings
desperately want to get,

171
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,160
even if it means betrayal.

172
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,710
Hans!

173
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,950
We have looked at all corners
of this cave.

174
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,710
Maybe he has already gone.

175
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,350
He's not here, too.

176
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,160
It's impossible.

177
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,569
All the way here,
there are no side holes.

178
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,800
Keep looking.

179
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,750
Tell them to drop their guns.

180
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,520
You won't kill me.

181
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,379
In this situation,

182
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,870
you will die if you kill me.

183
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,040
Put down your guns.

184
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,259
It seems you don't understand

185
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,870
your situation.

186
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,280
They'd better not do anything silly.

187
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,990
Put your guns...

188
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,950
Put your guns down.

189
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,350
Why didn't you kill me?

190
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm not interested in killing you.

191
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,379
To be frank,

192
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,649
I couldn't care less
about everything you do.

193
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,400
What does it mean?

194
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,870
Aren't you here

195
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,990
for the Night King?

196
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,400
No?

197
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,110
My sister should've
already succeeded by now.

198
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,320
Anyway, Wu Xie will be dying soon.

199
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,230
I don't mind telling you a story.

200
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,440
In fact,

201
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,320
the Night King doesn't exist.

202
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,070
It's just a decoy.

203
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,040
The Night King doesn't exist?

204
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,289
What we have now

205
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,950
is the Heavenly Staff.

206
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,979
We must find a way

207
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,649
to kill the Night King
with the Heavenly Staff

208
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,099
and take control of the situation.

209
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,800
Then, we need to figure out
Zhang Haike's motive.

210
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,800
The more information we gather,
the more likely we can take control.

211
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,950
Are you sure the Heavenly Staff
can kill the Night King?

212
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,680
Why didn't she use it?

213
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,569
Perhaps they don't know

214
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,040
how to use it.

215
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,070
Try it. If it doesn't work, we run.

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,230
What else do you have in your backpack?

217
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,870
The Night King doesn't exist?

218
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,750
What have we been searching for

219
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,160
all this time?

220
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,040
Who do you think

221
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,920
created the tale
of Night King Devours The Sky?

222
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,569
The golden sphere bugs are just bugs.

223
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,640
They're not the Night King's organs.

224
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,859
Your assumption about them

225
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,750
has indeed helped me a lot.

226
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,640
If all my men hadn't died,

227
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,920
I wouldn't have collaborated with you.

228
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,350
There are many golden spheres there,

229
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,070
I can't handle them alone.

230
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,859
I need your men

231
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,750
to retrieve something I want.

232
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,649
So

233
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,280
the best way for us now

234
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,440
is to form an alliance.

235
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,280
We are looking for

236
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,800
what the golden spheres eat.

237
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,470
What exactly is that?

238
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,640
You will find out if we join hands.

239
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,070
If you agree with my terms,

240
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,560
after we get out,

241
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,929
I will double

242
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,649
what Feng offers you,

243
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,680
including for your dead members.

244
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,440
Why should I trust you?

245
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,470
I could've killed you effortlessly,

246
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,400
but I didn't.

247
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,470
I still have some toys left.

248
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,320
Are you interested in this?

249
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,739
Heavenly Staff and grenade?
Let's try it.

250
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,990
I will throw two first.

251
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,830
Wait.

252
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,689
You want to throw them into the door?

253
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,870
That won't do.

254
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,920
The space inside there is big.

255
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,560
What if the Night King
hides somewhere else and dodges them?

256
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,019
Besides,

257
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,590
as we saw just now,

258
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,649
it seems to have lost its stealth skill

259
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,809
after leaving the Bronze Door.

260
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,769
We must think of a way to lure it out

261
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,230
and kill it.

262
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,929
I remember

263
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,929
Qiling's scrolls

264
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,470
mentioned

265
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,070
he once encountered a woman
with a strange bone structure.

266
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,049
The Yinshaluo people crush animal bones

267
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,320
and put them in an incense burner.

268
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,649
Then,

269
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,689
they burn fragments

270
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,160
around the woman for steaming.

271
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,350
Creatures that live in the dark

272
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,739
have a keen sense of smell.

273
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,800
If the Night King is a creature,

274
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,859
could this bone incense be the key

275
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,200
to drawing the Night King out?

276
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,920
The smell of dead bodies.

277
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,219
We don't have much time.

278
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,219
We are the only three
living humans here.

279
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,520
It has to be her.

280
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,379
Stop making fun of her.

281
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,809
Qiling mentioned in the scrolls,
it's dried corpses.

282
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,689
The main components of dried corpses are

283
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,809
skin, hair, bones, and fat.

284
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,019
Skin and hair

285
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,440
are mostly proteins.

286
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,409
Bones have some too,

287
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,809
but not as much.

288
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,979
If there are no bones,

289
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,339
teeth can work, too.

290
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,769
Yes, teeth.

291
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,769
Are you sure?

292
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,920
One tooth

293
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,139
each.

294
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,230
I got one here.

295
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,160
That old woman slapped me earlier.

296
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,769
My tooth got loose.

297
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,049
Well, it might hurt a bit.

298
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,680
It's fine. Not at all.

299
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,049
You pulled it out?

300
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,809
Look, I told you.

301
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,929
This is my contribution.

302
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,950
Very good.

303
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,350
All right.

304
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,920
I will crush this tooth.

305
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,409
This should be enough.

306
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,400
Wait.

307
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,470
Hold on. Where's yours?

308
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,809
You said one tooth per person.

309
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,160
Are you not a person, huh?

310
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,689
I... I said one tooth
from one person should be enough.

311
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,409
Cut it out.

312
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,440
Trying to fool me again?

313
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,049
Don't be afraid. Just bite it out.

314
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,619
If you really want me
to knock out a tooth,

315
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,099
I will.

316
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,689
I didn't say that. That was you.

317
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,990
Are we good buddies?

318
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,979
We share good and bad together.

319
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,979
It will come loose with a quick slap.
Let me help you.

320
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,760
- I don't need your help.
- Do it yourself then.

321
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,120
A tooth is no big deal.
Get the Heavenly Staff to knock it out.

322
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,929
From what I know about you,
let me tell you this,

323
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,520
you don't have the guts.

324
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,320
Fine, don't do it.

325
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,929
Here you go.

326
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,099
Take it.

327
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,929
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.

328
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,859
Trying to see if

329
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,070
there's any body tissue.

330
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,560
Jeez.

331
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,070
Found it!

332
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,750
I didn't poop this out.

333
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,710
Here...

334
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,289
Here you go. One tooth per person.

335
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,049
Put it back. It's useless now.

336
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,990
We have got a big chunk here.

337
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,449
Couldn't you have found it sooner?

338
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,590
Just a little sooner.

339
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,529
Well.

340
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,379
This must be a gift

341
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,310
from the Zhang Family from underground.

342
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,710
It's just that it came late.

343
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,619
Well.

344
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,200
I will cook you congee when we get back.

345
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,080
Let's go.

346
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,750
Well,

347
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,880
you came at the wrong time.

348
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,689
Poor Naive.

349
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,680
Over here.

350
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,230
Here's a dried corpse.

351
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,409
Come on.

352
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,880
It works. It's flowing into the area.

353
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,200
Go.

354
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,990
Go.

355
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,859
Don't move. Slowly.

356
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,299
Don't put the torch on the mud membrane.

357
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,710
It will catch fire.

358
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,009
We might die

359
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,400
before the Night King even shows up.

360
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,600
Hold in for a while.

361
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,120
Go on.

362
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,030
How's it? Is everything okay?

363
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,510
Move. Come on.

364
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,710
Hurry up.

365
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,790
Be quick.

366
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,750
Is the thing out?

367
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,230
Is it out?

368
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,270
Not yet.

369
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,819
Can't you see for yourself?

370
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,880
Of course not.

371
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,400
Great teamwork.

373
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,510
Nothing's happening.

374
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,680
Is this

375
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,779
not working right?

376
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,920
Fatty.

377
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,059
I got it.

378
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,360
What?

379
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,230
It must be the Night King
from the painting.

380
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,990
The Night King is invisible

381
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,099
because the armor it wears

382
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,929
blends with the pattern
on the Bronze Door's.

383
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,489
It's like camouflage

384
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,449
that creates an illusion.

385
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,249
Anyway, this is its final happy time.

386
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,990
See you never.

387
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,550
Keep going.

388
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,600
Keep going.

389
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,550
Drat!

390
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,120
The woman is lying there.

391
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,120
What did Zhang Haixing tell that thing?

392
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,929
Nothing is better

393
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,880
than picking up a foreign language.

394
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,400
Naive.

395
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,750
Naive.

396
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,880
Fat...

397
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,840
The Heavenly Staff is useless.

398
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,400
We even risked our lives for it.

399
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,950
Qiling has screwed us up.

400
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,510
Don't you dare touch my buddy!

401
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,379
Night King Grappling Skills?

402
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,360
I will fight you!

403
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,249
It's broken.

404
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,880
Lead it to the trap.

405
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,950
- I will blow up the stone wall.
- Okay.

406
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,230
Fatty!

407
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,950
Naive!

408
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,339
Think of a way to get me up.

409
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,270
Hurry up.

410
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,840
Give me your hand.

411
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,649
Try another way!

412
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,710
Here.

413
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,550
Hurry.

414
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,899
Get a grenade!

415
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,859
Go and get a grenade!

416
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,779
We will all die together.

417
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,649
Take a chance!

418
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,880
All right. Let's take the risk.

419
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,400
Naive, get this.

420
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,030
Naive.

421
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:31,228
Naive!

422
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,880
Naive.

423
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,120
Naive.

424
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,840
We are still alive.

425
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,449
Another narrow escape, Naive.

426
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,510
Luck is waiting just ahead.

427
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,680
What's that sound?

428
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,310
Mystic Claw?

429
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,990
The Night King is Mystic Claw?

430
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,339
What we have been fighting desperately

431
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,120
is actually Mystic Claw?

432
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,550
Why is this happening?

433
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,750
Isn't that Mystic Claw tamed
to defend the Zhang Family?

434
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,310
Why did it become the Night King?

435
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,680
It's coming up.

436
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,920
See you never!

437
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,680
We defeated the Night King.

438
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,550
I'm not sure whether to be happy or not.

439
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,310
Come. Let me check on you.

440
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,400
Endure the pain.

441
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,230
You're not young anymore.

442
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,779
It's just ligament and muscle strain.

443
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,600
Soft tissue injury.

444
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,950
It's not serious.

445
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,310
Your arm is dislocated.

446
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,779
I will take care of this.

447
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,270
Back when I was in Banai,

448
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,539
horses and cows

449
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,579
came to me when they had bone injuries.

450
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,649
Are you a vet?

451
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,249
What's your problem?
A vet is still a doctor.

452
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,099
Come on.

453
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,649
Hold on.

454
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,619
What's wrong?

455
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,859
Say something

456
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,779
I don't know

457
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,470
to distract me.

458
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,649
Every time I went to your place,

459
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,640
I used your toothbrush.

460
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,710
Qiling?

461
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,120
Try moving your arm.

462
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,360
Move your arm.

463
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,680
Come on.

464
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,120
Yes.

465
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,470
That's right.

466
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,059
Yes, the Lucky Cat.

467
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,649
Let's see if I fixed it properly.

468
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,080
If it's reversed, I will fix it again.

469
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,209
Why did you hit me?

470
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,750
I fixed your arm, right?

471
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,840
Is that true?

472
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,649
What?

473
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,950
My toothbrush.

474
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,030
You...

475
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,059
You are petty. If you're not happy about that,
you can use mine when you come to my place.

476
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,249
Thanks a bunch.

477
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,840
Don't be.

478
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,400
Wait.

479
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,099
Mystic Claw resembles the Night King

480
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,360
from "Night King Devours The Sky".

481
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,880
Is it the Night King itself?

482
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,440
We defeated the Night King

483
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,230
without the Heavenly Staff.

484
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,400
Also, where did Mystic Claw come from?

485
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,729
Why does it have tentacles?

486
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,009
We saw one
in the Zhang Family Ancient Tower

487
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,539
when we tried to save Qiling,
but this one looks different.

488
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,920
It seems mutated.

489
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,969
My grandfather's notes said

490
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,539
Mystic Claw is a kind of ferocious ape

491
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,230
that lives in warm
and humid southern regions.

492
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,680
But this place

493
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,550
is cold, snowy mountains.

494
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,249
According to its habits,

495
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,440
it shouldn't be here.

496
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,750
Unless someone brought it here.

497
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,880
Did the Zhangs do it?

498
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,640
Moreover, you mentioned

499
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,339
we fought desperately

500
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,099
to get the Heavenly Staff,

501
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,990
but now it's useless.

502
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,139
Did Zhang Haike also lie to us

503
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,779
about it?

504
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,139
Besides, Qiling wouldn't come here

505
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,779
just for

506
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,209
a mutated Mystic Claw.

507
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,099
Since the Heavenly Staff

508
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,489
wasn't meant to kill the Night King,

509
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,209
it must have some other purpose

510
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,950
we don't know.

511
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,550
Where's the Heavenly Staff?

512
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,680
Heavenly Staff? It fell somewhere.

513
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,729
- Where's Zhang Haixing?
- I haven't seen that old womansince earlier.

514
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,320
- Why didn't you remind me?
- Come.

515
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,470
Let's go find her.

516
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,339
That old woman took the Heavenly Staff.

517
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,200
She must be hiding somewhere,
plotting something.

518
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,440
Naive.

519
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,080
Did you find anything?

520
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,200
Nothing inside here.

521
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,510
Nothing on top either.

522
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,640
Try to recall it.

523
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,950
How did the Heavenly Staff
get knocked away?

524
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,840
When the Heavenly Staff was with me,

525
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,379
I was standing here,

526
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,440
and Mystic Claw suddenly attacked me.

527
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,579
It got knocked away.

528
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,299
It should be in this direction.

529
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,880
If it's not on top,

530
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,840
it's most likely over there.

531
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,729
Let's go

532
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,840
and check it out.

533
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,880
It's over here.

534
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,640
Can you see it?

535
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,400
Yes.

536
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,819
Hold the torch for me.

537
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,310
I will go down and get it.

538
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,680
Save it.

539
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,200
Here.

540
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,470
Be careful.

541
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,619
Down.

542
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,750
Good.

543
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,099
Go.

544
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,120
Good.

545
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,840
Good. A bit lower.

546
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,710
Good. You are the best.

547
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,680
Come on. Hang in there.

548
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,929
Very good.

549
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,030
Wait.

550
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,270
One centimeter away.

551
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,470
Lower.

552
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,440
Watch out!

553
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,880
Fatty.

554
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,270
Fatty?

555
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,990
I'm good.

556
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,859
Come, Fatty.

557
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,360
Give me some time.

558
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,790
What have you seen?

559
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,310
This seems

560
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,520
like an artificial cave.

561
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,049
The pigeon flip trap up there

562
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,430
is an active door.

563
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,560
The mechanism was triggered,

564
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,179
so we and Zhang Haixing

565
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,960
fell into two different sides
of the active door.

566
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,000
You are right.

567
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,230
This is an artificial cave.

568
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,560
It looks like there's a door.

569
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,120
Naive.

570
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,790
It looks like a door.

571
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,640
Take a look.

572
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,080
It's a door.

573
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,960
It's ajar.

574
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,430
Xing,

575
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,200
I'm your brother.

576
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,680
I'm coming for you.

577
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,080
Ambush!

578
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,680
They are here everywhere.

579
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,430
Who are they?

580
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,560
Are they the Yinshaluo people?

581
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,520
Why did they die here?

582
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,560
Don't touch it.

583
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,080
Why is everything my fault? It broke

584
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,520
because it rusted.

585
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,739
That means it has been here for years.

586
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,009
These Yinshaluo people
failed to defeat Mystic Claw,

587
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,750
so they hid here.

588
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,310
It doesn't make sense.

589
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,230
Mystic Claw couldn't get in here,

590
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,529
and the Yinshaluo people

591
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,040
wouldn't have been trapped here.

592
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,600
They must have stayed

593
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,449
for another reason.

594
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,569
Why not?

595
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,219
The door was blocked,
so they couldn't get out, right?

596
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,120
That's why they died here.

597
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,520
Out of hunger?

598
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,379
Exactly. It's obvious.

599
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,790
I don't buy that.

600
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,009
We just got in here,

601
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,870
and I'm already hungry,

602
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,449
let alone them.

603
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,120
They probably hid here...

604
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,830
Don't move.

605
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,040
Hans.

606
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,120
Hans.

607
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,049
We are all tired.

608
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,350
Let's rest for a while.

609
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,160
Time is what we lack the most.

610
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,339
If Wu Xie is still alive
and gets there first,

611
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,160
we will fall behind.

612
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,910
Bear with me.

613
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,750
We can go back home

614
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,640
as soon as we get what we need.

615
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,710
It's Mystic Claw's armors

616
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,750
and masks.

617
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,430
There's more than one Night King.

618
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,960
Those Yinshaluo people

619
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,569
weren't hiding from the Night King here.

620
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,750
They were secretly creating Night Kings
in this place.

621
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,520
Be careful.

622
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,710
These bodies are too decayed.

623
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,710
We can't tell
if they are the Yinshaluo people.

624
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,830
That doesn't sound right either.

625
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,230
Throughout our journey to here,

626
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,179
we have never heard

627
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,009
of the Night King appearing in a group.

628
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,120
It has always been on its own.

629
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,710
But from what we see here,

630
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,960
the Night King isn't alone.

631
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,520
It's created by humans.

632
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,680
I'm just feeling it.

633
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,819
If I'm not wrong,

634
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,739
this should be

635
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,520
a factory producing Night Kings.

636
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,750
If that's the case,

637
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,409
it's possible that Qiling tasked us

638
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,750
with this mission.

639
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,009
Think about it.

640
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,680
From what we discussed earlier,

641
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,600
we can't kill the Night King,

642
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,120
but we are able to kill Mystic Claw.

643
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,350
Wait. Hold on.

644
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,969
If Mystic Claw is the Night King,

645
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,379
and the Night King is Mystic Claw,

646
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,449
killing the Night King

647
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,659
should be a cakewalk.

648
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,529
The Zhangs could've
handled it themselves.

649
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,659
Why did they bring us here?

650
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,390
Zhang Haike must have another motive.

651
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,569
So what Qiling said in the videotape

652
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,270
refers to something else.

653
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,659
The Zhangs

654
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,000
built a make-believe Bronze Door here

655
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,379
only to protect the production line
of Night Kings.

656
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,790
This is simply absurd.

657
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,560
Zhang Haike is a liar!

658
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,840
If defeating the Night King
isn't the point,

659
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,360
then Zhang Haike must've lured us here

660
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,699
for a very important reason
he doesn't want us to know.

661
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,819
At first, he told us to come here
to defeat the Night King.

662
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,129
He was playing us for fools!

663
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,969
Who knows how many things

664
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,529
he's hiding from us?

665
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,449
He better hide well.

666
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,870
- I will finish him when I see him.
- Fatty... Fatty!

667
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,910
Calm down now.

668
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,160
We need to think this through.

669
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,160
What is the Zhang Family trying to hide

670
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
by building the Bronze Door
and these armors?

671
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,350
They are hiding something for sure.

672
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,430
Am I right?

673
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,080
Mystic Claw

674
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,310
is the defensive mechanism
of the Zhang Family.

675
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,200
Besides,

676
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,710
the device behind the Bronze Door

677
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,049
can only be verified

678
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,009
by Dragon's Blood.

679
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,390
What exactly are they
hiding or protecting?

680
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,960
All right.

681
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,120
If the Zhangs created all of this,

682
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,430
let's follow the trail of clues
to analyze.

683
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,779
If this Mystic Claw

684
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,379
is the Zhang Family's
defensive mechanism,

685
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,779
then why was it sealed
behind the Bronze Door with mud?

686
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,779
Why did it mutate?

687
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,739
What is the Zhang Family
defending against?

688
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,259
Are they protecting the Bronze Door?

689
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,339
What is the Bronze Door

690
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,430
protecting?

691
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,179
Are they protecting the secret
behind it?

692
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,299
What exactly is the secret
behind this Bronze Door?

693
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,409
Naive,

694
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,259
I know you are anxious,

695
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,000
but you need to stop.

696
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,160
Listen to me.

697
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,430
This is all Zhang Haike's scheme
against us.

698
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,779
So everything

699
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,870
we are doing now

700
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,870
must be in his plan.

701
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,830
Naive,

702
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,609
we have to find Zhang Haike's weakness.

703
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,569
That's to catch Zhang Haixing
and get the Heavenly Staff back,

704
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,819
only then can we take control.

705
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,009
I must question them

706
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,600
what they are up to.

707
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,230
You have me.

708
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,960
I will get revenge for you.

709
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,870
Don't worry.

710
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,049
Let's go

711
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,899
and see if there are any clues
around here

712
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,160
to get us out of this place.

713
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,000
This is a library.

714
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,230
Someone's here.

715
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,120
Naive,

716
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,430
come check this out.

717
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,200
Long finger.

718
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,750
It's the Zhangs.

719
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,000
Let me see.

720
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,790
Each one has a person inside.

721
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,080
This is not a library.

722
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,750
These are spirit containers.

723
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,040
In Mosang,

724
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,270
there's a funerary tradition.

725
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,089
The items on top

726
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,000
belong to the deceased.

727
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,230
It's a way of remembrance.

728
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,000
What's wrong with these people?

729
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,790
They used books as offerings.

730
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,710
Can these books
really suppress the souls?

731
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,600
Zhang Haixing probably isn't here.

732
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,710
There's wind.

733
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,560
There's an opening.

734
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,640
Let's check it out.

735
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,230
What a big opening.

736
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,270
It's a spade shape.

737
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,230
