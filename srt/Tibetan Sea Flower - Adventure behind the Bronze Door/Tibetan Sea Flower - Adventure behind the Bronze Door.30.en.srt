=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 30=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,289
(After Zhang Qiling's First Tianshou)

5
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,510
(When Qiling was completing his mission,)

6
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,280
(a memory)

7
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,979
(related to his origins)

8
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
(suddenly surfaced in his mind.)

9
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,600
Baima.

10
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,110
Patriarch.

11
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,070
Do you truly not remember anything?

12
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,550
Don't worry.

13
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,790
We're in charge of protecting
the memories

14
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,760
of the Zhang Family's patriarchs
for generations.

15
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,529
If you need anything

16
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,110
or have any questions for me,

17
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,360
I'll do my best to fulfill your request.

18
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,990
I want to see Baima.

19
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,920
Baima?

20
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,720
You know who Baima is?

21
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,320
A pair of deep eyes.

22
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,160
With fair complexion.

23
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,320
And, there's a mole

24
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,160
on her neck.

25
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,110
How did you find out about Baima?

26
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,960
How did you know what she looked like?

27
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,670
And, why would you want
to see her all of a sudden?

28
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,990
I had a dream.

29
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,299
It could be the content
of your Tianshou.

30
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,670
It could also be your past obsession.

31
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,040
Patriarch.

32
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,040
We're the only ones

33
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,280
who know about Baima's existence.

34
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,480
This is highly confidential.

35
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,750
Baima came to
our spiritual retreat ten years ago

36
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,040
to wait for a certain individual.

37
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,920
That person was her son.

38
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,670
I also just found out

39
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,600
that you were her son.

40
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,190
My guest, why are you kneeling here?

41
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,720
Master,

42
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,659
I have one request.

43
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,720
What is it?

44
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,299
My child

45
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,190
was taken by the Zhang Family.

46
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,040
A child who belongs to the Zhang Family
was taken by the Zhang Family.

47
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,059
How am I supposed
to help you out with that?

48
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,280
I know

49
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,990
that I cannot stop him
from returning to the Zhang Family.

50
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,889
But I also know

51
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,630
that the Zhang Family

52
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,840
can never raise a happy child.

53
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,600
Our fates are predestined, you know?

54
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,870
But I don't have much time left
due to my terminal illness.

55
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,920
I know I'm running out of time.

56
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,600
Maybe I can

57
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,430
never

58
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,790
meet my child again after this.

59
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,110
Master,

60
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,360
I heard that you guys know about
the secret of Zanghai Flower.

61
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,059
I hope that you guys

62
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,630
can seal me away

63
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,870
using the Zanghai Flower.

64
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,080
The Zanghai Flower

65
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,990
can only

66
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,520
seal a person away temporarily.

67
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,750
It cannot cure your condition.

68
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,720
And, we cannot guarantee

69
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,750
that we can wake you up
after several years.

70
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,539
Therefore,

71
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,550
it's forbidden to use
Zanghai Flower now.

72
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,990
But Master,

73
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,870
this child is different. He's different.

74
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,230
I hope you can give me a chance.

75
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,080
If he leads a happy life,

76
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,670
he won't know about me.

77
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,600
He won't need to find me either.

78
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,960
But if he doesn't lead a happy life,

79
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,080
he'll surely come back
to seek his origins.

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,670
I don't want him

81
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,310
to find a body.

82
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,920
I hope he can experience

83
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,230
the world,

84
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,280
even if there's barely any love in it.

85
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,110
Therefore, Master,

86
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,870
I truly hope

87
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,600
that you guys can give me a chance

88
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,280
so that I can meet my child again.

89
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,329
No.

90
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,219
Master!

91
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,310
No.

92
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,670
Master!

93
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,600
(We used the Zanghai Flower
on Baima that day.)

94
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,230
(After that,
she fell into a deep sleep.)

95
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,870
(By not being laid to rest,)

96
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,320
(Baima gave her son one final relief.)

97
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,080
(She awaits her son's arrival.)

98
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,270
Is she dead?

99
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,270
She's not dead.

100
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,870
But she's not alive either.

101
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,910
Do you wish to see her?

102
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,910
You're just like a piece of rock.

103
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,910
It makes no difference

104
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,910
whether you see her or not.

105
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,630
There's a massive boulder
in the courtyard.

106
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,680
You can carve it.

107
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,840
Carve whatever you desire.

108
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,910
You can see Baima

109
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,990
once the carving

110
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,870
is completed.

111
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,110
Master.

112
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,360
I don't understand.

113
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,449
Where did the idea of coming here

114
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,750
originate in his mind?

115
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,729
Master, you...

116
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,230
Why would you say
that he was a piece of rock?

117
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,840
I see him often.

118
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,200
It feels like

119
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,200
he never has any needs or desires.

120
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,259
If the world doesn't need him,

121
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,910
he'll just remain there.

122
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,870
He doesn't even have
the desire to think.

123
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,600
First, he possesses. Then, he loses.

124
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,990
That's what you call
a thorough enlightenment.

125
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,110
He's born without any desires.

126
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,030
He's just a piece of rock.

127
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,270
You shouldn't be just a piece of rock.

128
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,569
You shouldn't make your mother

129
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,800
unable to feel your presence.

130
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,600
You need to learn how to think.

131
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,390
You need to learn
how to long for something.

132
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,720
Your life is your mother's
first gift to you.

133
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,750
And, that's her last gift
for you as well.

134
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,680
It's a heart that they've concealed.

135
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,680
Patriarch.

136
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,089
Master told me

137
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,360
to prepare a room.

138
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,270
Baima will be sent to that room.

139
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,230
Congratulations.

140
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,680
(Baima was sealed away
under the ice for many years.)

141
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,480
(Under the influence
of the Zanghai Flower,)

142
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,150
(she was able to fall into a deep sleep
and survive for decades.)

143
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,360
(We made a promise to her.)

144
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,480
(When her son is here to find her,)

145
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,910
(we'll show her to him.)

146
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,230
(By then,)

147
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,110
(Baima will be awakened.)

148
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,390
(Although she will be awakened,)

149
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,710
(most of her senses will be gone.)

150
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,280
(She cannot see,)

151
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,870
(hear,)

152
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,280
(or speak.)

153
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,840
(But Baima knows)

154
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,870
(that her son is right by her side.)

155
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,110
(However,)

156
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,630
(when the medicinal effect
of the Zanghai Flower fades,)

157
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,520
(Baima will die)

158
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,950
(in three days.)

159
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,000
(He needs to find a reason to think.)

160
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,760
(As long as his heart)

161
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,369
(tells him what to do)

162
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,600
(with that boulder,)

163
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,711
(that boulder)

164
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,870
(will take a meaningful shape
when he carves it.)

165
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,560
(By then,)

166
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,190
(he'll only truly be human)

167
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,150
(after growing out a heart.)

168
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,840
(Only then will his mother)

169
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,910
(stop worrying about him.)

170
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,870
(Humans are born without feelings.)

171
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,560
(Therefore, no one can hurt him.)

172
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,000
(However,)

173
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,670
(once we possess feelings,)

174
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,539
(anything in the world)

175
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,280
(will be able to hurt us.)

176
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,870
(Therefore,)

177
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,840
(we made him develop feelings)

178
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,950
(so that we could hurt him better.)

179
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,630
After that,

180
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,520
I heard that the patriarch
left Jila Spiritual Retreat.

181
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,539
No one knew where he went

182
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,670
or what he did

183
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,430
for the longest time.

184
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,670
After that,

185
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,150
both the old practitioner and Deren
passed away.

186
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,240
Only this scroll

187
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,430
contains the record of that encounter.

188
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,910
Every member of the Zhang Family
faces the same fate.

189
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,360
The children have no right
to live in a warm family.

190
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,539
The parents have no right to see
their children live happily

191
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,390
throughout their lives.

192
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,169
Baima wanted to see
what his child looked like.

193
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,080
She wanted to know about
all the emotions he experienced.

194
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,080
She wanted to know about

195
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,889
all the moments

196
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,390
of their growth.

197
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,950
Although she did everything she could,

198
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,320
she only got herself

199
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,840
three days of silence.

200
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,390
However, her child

201
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,080
never led a decent life.

202
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,280
In the future, I will keep him company.

203
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,840
I will resolve
all of his issues for him.

204
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,710
I will lead an ordinary life with him.

205
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,499
Naive.

206
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,739
Come inside.

207
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,019
Come and drink with us.

208
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,430
Let's drink.

209
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,520
Let's go.

210
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,360
Granny, I'm afraid of heights.

211
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,190
I'm sure you've taken
a roller-coaster ride before.

212
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,329
I don't even understand
why we put ourselves through that.

213
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,800
It's so windy out there.

214
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,329
You guys are so brave.

215
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,459
You guys are unafraid of death.

216
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,849
I feel so ashamed.

217
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,019
Granny, I feel so ashamed.

218
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,609
You should stop drinking.

219
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,219
I'm just...

220
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,299
Fatty, you're drunk already?

221
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,459
Listen.

222
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,670
Naive.

223
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,920
Luckily, you blew the thing up in time.

224
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,939
If not, we would be chatting
in the afterlife by now.

225
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,240
Naive.

226
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,320
You feel like having
some peanuts, don't you?

227
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,360
It would be great if we had peanuts.

228
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,390
But this is pretty good too.

229
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,190
Mr. Wu,

230
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,520
this is my farewell drink.

231
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,600
What's wrong, Feng? Are you leaving?

232
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,600
The case is already over.

233
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm going to head home.

234
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,040
I'll depart by dawn.

235
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,110
What do you plan to do
after you head back?

236
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,950
I plan to return to the academy.

237
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,390
I'll become a lecturer again.

238
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,080
That's pretty good.

239
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,360
Is that all?

240
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,630
And,

241
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,600
I can spend some time
to look for my sister.

242
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,609
Actually,

243
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,280
I made myself busy

244
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,240
to avoid the fact

245
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,499
that I didn't manage

246
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,000
to protect my sister.

247
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,800
But no matter how busy I am,

248
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,710
this incident

249
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,800
is just like a scar in my life.

250
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,910
It'll always be there.

251
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,190
And, it always hurts.

252
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,609
Mr. Wu,

253
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,430
when I encountered you,

254
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,760
I understood

255
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,150
that no matter
how terrible the situation

256
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,240
or the result may be,

257
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,000
we could only change them
by facing them head-on.

258
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,840
Therefore, I no longer
wish to escape from reality.

259
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,080
Thank you.

260
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,840
Thank you too.

261
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,390
Fatty, thank you.

262
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,560
Nice.

263
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,950
Mr. Wu.

264
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,059
So now,

265
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,150
can you tell me about that matter?

266
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,000
What matter?

267
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,470
What's the story between you

268
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,150
and Zhang Qiling?

269
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,840
What exactly do you owe him?

270
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,630
Why are you risking
your life for his sake?

271
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,240
Tell us about it.

272
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,080
Back then,

273
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,910
after Qiling met his mother,

274
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,219
he continued his long journey

275
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,670
to fulfill his duties as the patriarch.

276
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,870
He had to endure the bouts
of Tianshou and amnesia

277
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,630
as he traveled the world.

278
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,560
He got involved in conflicts,

279
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,870
explored various areas
that were dangerous,

280
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,849
and investigated cases

281
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,110
that he had no idea about.

282
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,470
And, he had to return to the Bronze Door

283
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,670
after a certain period.

284
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,800
He had to guard the place
ten years at one time.

285
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,150
After that,

286
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,979
a mysterious organization

287
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,560
found Qiling.

288
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,910
The organization was formed by
nine families.

289
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,800
Their families are huge and influential.

290
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,390
They have rich histories too.

291
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,560
They uncover all kinds of
underground secrets for profit.

292
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,390
They coveted Qiling's
supernatural powers.

293
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,560
They found him

294
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,480
and negotiated a deal with him
after investigating him thoroughly.

295
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,240
The organization suggested Qiling

296
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,800
to complete a task on their behalf.

297
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,110
Once the task is completed,

298
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,040
they'll send their men
for rigorous training

299
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,800
so that they can guard
the Bronze Door in turn.

300
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,320
Qiling agreed to their proposal.

301
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,649
Qiling started to
serve the organization.

302
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,119
(Wuzhou)

303
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,520
(First Encounter Between Wu Xie and Zhang Qiling)
And I was caught up in it

304
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,190
purely by coincidence.

305
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,080
Back then, most of my adventures

306
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,840
overlapped with the issues

307
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,870
he needed to resolve.

308
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,630
You guys know

309
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,760
what happened after that.

310
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,600
I've heard about your adventures.

311
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,259
I just didn't expect Zhang Qiling

312
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,240
to have such a backstory.

313
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,630
Although we're buddies,

314
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,190
I feel like I owe him a lot.

315
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,699
The three of us

316
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,609
have experienced all kinds of hardships

317
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,129
and have been to many places.

318
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,539
A strong bond

319
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,710
was formed through our adventures.

320
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,870
If so, why do you feel like you owe him?

321
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,190
As an ignorant commoner,

322
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,110
I insisted on following him

323
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,760
to unravel the answers
behind all the mysterious riddles.

324
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,470
Maybe he was surprised

325
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,280
by how foolish and stubborn I was.

326
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,520
(Serpent Marsh Ghost City, Gobi Desert)
(One Year Before Qiling Entered The Bronze Door)

327
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,720
Wu Xie.

328
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,680
Why did you follow me here?

329
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,550
You shouldn't have
gotten yourself involved.

330
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,800
Your third uncle has done
plenty of things for you.

331
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,640
This isn't something

332
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,590
you can handle.

333
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,480
Actually, I didn't wish
for this to happen either.

334
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,320
My request is simple.

335
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,459
I just want to know

336
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,249
what's going on.

337
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,910
That's all I ask for.

338
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,720
But?

339
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,990
But no one is willing to tell me

340
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,030
what's going on.

341
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,569
I have no choice

342
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,160
but to get myself involved.

343
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,200
If so, have you ever considered

344
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,160
why they didn't want you
to know about the truth?

345
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,680
I have not.

346
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,590
I don't know what to think of it either.

347
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,320
You see,

348
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,510
sometimes, we lie to people

349
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,760
to protect them.

350
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,240
Maybe there are some truths

351
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,859
that one cannot bear.

352
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,129
I think that person

353
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,870
should be the judge of that.

354
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,169
Maybe that person doesn't want
to be protected.

355
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,059
Maybe he just seeks a satisfying death.

356
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,320
Do you understand the pain
of being in the dark?

357
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,550
I do.

358
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,160
And, I understand that feeling
better than you.

359
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,640
To me,

360
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,510
the things I want to know

361
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,320
are far more than yours.

362
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,819
But unlike you,

363
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,240
I don't have anyone

364
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,840
whom I can direct my questions to.

365
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,470
I don't have a past or a future.

366
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm doing all of this

367
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,169
in order to find

368
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,990
the tie between me and the world.

369
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,880
I'm doing this to find out
where I come from

370
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,430
and why I'm here.

371
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,840
Can you imagine this?

372
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,590
No one will find out

373
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,019
if a person like me

374
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,720
vanishes from the world.

375
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,430
It's as if

376
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,379
I never existed

377
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,899
in the world before.

378
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,950
There are no traces of me at all.

379
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,200
Sometimes, when I look in the mirror,

380
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,840
I wonder if I truly exist.

381
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,430
Sometimes,

382
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,800
I wonder if I'm just a phantom.

383
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,390
It's not as ridiculous as what you said.

384
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,800
Even if you do vanish one day,

385
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,990
at least I'll notice your absence.

386
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,030
Regarding my case,

387
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,120
maybe I'll tell you about it

388
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,160
once I get the answer.

389
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,459
But regarding your case,

390
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,510
you won't get any answers

391
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,240
by clinging on to me.

392
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,280
To me, all of this

393
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,320
is just another riddle.

394
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,120
I assume you already
have plenty of riddles to solve.

395
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,120
There's no point in getting another one.

396
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,550
Can you at least
tell me one thing, then?

397
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,360
Why are you trying
to enter the Bronze Door?

398
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,249
I'm just doing

399
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,390
what Wang Zanghai did back then.

400
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,499
What did you see

401
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,070
behind the giant door?

402
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,899
What exactly is behind

403
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,360
that giant door?

404
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,320
Inside,

405
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,390
I saw the ultimate.

406
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,240
The ultimate of all things.

407
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,360
The ultimate?

408
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,680
And,

409
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,030
I'm on your side.

410
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,680
You're on my side?

411
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,910
(After that,)

412
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,990
(when our adventures were over,)

413
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,550
(Qiling also fulfilled his promise
to the nine families.)

414
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,990
(He bade me farewell.)

415
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,280
(I wasn't ready for that.)

416
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
(And, I didn't know)

417
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,370
(Wuzhou, Louwailou)
(what would happen after that.)

418
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,880
(Before Zhang Qiling
Heads to The Bronze Door)

419
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,590
Everything's over.

420
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,280
I've given it some thought.

421
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,510
You seem to be

422
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,840
the only tie

423
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,800
that relates me to this world.

424
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,360
Tell me, then.

425
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,950
Where do you plan to go next?

426
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,070
We've been through so much together.

427
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,280
We'll be buddies forever.

428
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,470
We must keep in touch, okay?

429
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,059
Or,

430
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,419
you can tell me

431
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,990
if you need anything.

432
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,030
Although I'm not wealthy by any means,

433
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,720
I can still provide you
with a normal life.

434
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll be heading to Sansheng Snowy Peak.

435
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,550
I'm sure that place is cold.

436
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,200
The South is the best.

437
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,510
It has distinct seasons
and a humid climate.

438
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,510
It's a great place to live in.

439
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,390
I have no choice.

440
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,390
Goodbye.

441
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,950
Sansheng Snowy Peak, huh?

442
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,680
Waiter, get me the bill.

443
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,689
So, did Zhang Qiling head to

444
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,320
Yunding Heavenly Palace's Bronze Door
after he said goodbye to you?

445
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,560
(Yunding Heavenly Palace, Snowy Peak
Before Zhang Qiling Enters The Bronze Door)

446
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,590
You shouldn't be here.

447
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,079
(Yunding Heavenly Palace, Entrance to Fissure)

448
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,200
(Before Qiling Enters The Bronze Door)
Your journey ends here.

449
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,120
Why are you here, then?

450
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,320
There are some serious issues

451
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,590
within this door.

452
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,430
They need to be dealt with

453
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,800
periodically.

454
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,280
Whenever I enter this place,

455
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,289
I have to stay here for ten years.

456
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,990
But didn't you say

457
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,169
that Zhang Qiling had a pact
with the nine families?

458
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,870
I thought he didn't need
to guard the Bronze Door again

459
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,510
after fulfilling his part of the deal.

460
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,470
That's the reason why I owe him a favor.

461
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,950
Back then, I followed him
all the way to Snowy Peak.

462
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,550
I asked him the same question.

463
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,640
Many years ago,

464
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,249
I reached an agreement

465
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,840
with the nine families at the time.

466
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,070
I hoped that I could borrow their power

467
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,430
to help the Zhang Family

468
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,390
shoulder our burden.

469
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,800
According to the promise,

470
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,160
members of the nine families

471
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,280
will guard the door on
the Zhang Family's behalf in turns.

472
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,800
But none of them fulfilled
their end of the deal.

473
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,640
There's something more sinister
and dangerous

474
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,169
within Yunding Heavenly Palace

475
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,550
that needs to be dealt with.

476
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,070
According to the agreement,

477
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,800
I was supposed

478
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,320
to be the one

479
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,510
to guard the door.

480
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,800
But they never trained you.

481
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,360
If you go inside,

482
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,870
you will die.

483
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm the Zhang Family's last patriarch.

484
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,320
In the future,

485
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,870
I shall

486
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,510
guard the door.

487
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,510
Since you're already here,

488
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,390
I will tell you this.

489
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,680
If, after ten years,

490
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,680
you still remember who I am,

491
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,640
you may return here.

492
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,870
Maybe

493
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,590
you'll be able to see me again.

494
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,209
I was supposed

495
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,200
to be the one

496
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,030
spending ten years

497
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,070
in that abyss.

498
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,910
Qiling had an opportunity

499
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,360
to spare himself from the suffering.

500
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,160
But he gave up on that opportunity

501
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,840
for my sake.

502
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,320
He chose to bear the pain
and responsibilities

503
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,910
himself.

504
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,070
That's my debt to him.

505
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,950
Such friendship is rare indeed.

506
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,280
It's no wonder
you risked your life for him.

507
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,720
Mr. Wu, today's an occasion
worth celebrating indeed.

508
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,680
To Qiling.

509
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,070
To Qiling.

510
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,800
By tomorrow,

511
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,990
all of you will leave this place.

512
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,569
I would like to thank you all

513
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,590
for helping out the Yinshaluo Tribe.

514
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,760
Please take care of yourselves.

515
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,990
