=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 21=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,400
Who are you?

5
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,160
I'll shout

6
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,160
if you continue to keep quiet.

7
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,160
By then, you won't be able to escape.

8
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,560
You know that I'm not a local, huh?

9
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,600
I can tell from your scent.

10
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,950
Only one foreigner came here before.

11
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,950
You smell just like him.

12
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,190
But you're not him.

13
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,720
Are you from below the mountains too?

14
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,720
That's right.

15
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you here to look for him, then?

16
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,609
That person said

17
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,750
someone would definitely come here.

18
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,400
You should watch out.

19
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,190
They don't like foreigners.

20
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,120
I don't know who you're referring to.

21
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,379
Forget about that for now.

22
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,000
Take me with you,

23
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,630
and I'll tell you everything I know.

24
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,120
Alright.

25
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,440
Bone incense?

26
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,920
Mr. Zhang.

27
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,830
Please forgive us for testing you.

28
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,830
Please accept our sincere apologies.

29
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,880
Everything was arranged by Mr. Dong.

30
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,059
(Dong Can)
You've passed Mr. Dong's test.

31
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,950
We've been waiting for you.

32
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,150
(The secret is located here.)

33
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,950
(They can help you.)

34
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,240
Mr. Zhang.

35
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,190
This is Yinshaluo Lake.

36
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,449
Yinshaluo means

37
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,440
blue snow mountains when we translate it.

38
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,680
Our tribe lives right there
in the valley by the river.

39
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,870
This is Yinshaluo.

40
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,320
Over there

41
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,190
is where our chieftain resides.

42
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,590
It's been a long time

43
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,040
since our tribe had a true chieftain.

44
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,950
Our last chieftain

45
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,950
was Mr. Dong Can.

46
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,320
Before Mr. Dong's appearance,

47
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,499
the people here

48
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,590
resorted to traditional means

49
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,870
to relieve all disasters we faced.

50
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,190
What disasters?

51
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,379
I assume you've heard of

52
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,230
the legend of
Night King Devours The Sky, right?

53
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,640
Legend has it that a terrifying demon
called Night King

54
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,230
resides deep within the snow mountains.

55
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,400
Whenever it makes an appearance,

56
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,859
both the snow mountains and Yinshaluo

57
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,800
will face a calamity.

58
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,520
Legend has it

59
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,320
that the Night King has a favorite
concubine called the Night Lady.

60
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,689
Although it has a human form,

61
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,160
its limbs grow in reverse.

62
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,379
Maybe this is fate.

63
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,929
When some of our children were born,

64
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,529
they actually had the same form

65
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,560
as the Night Lady.

66
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,520
Our ancestors were terrified.

67
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,990
They believed that they were
the Night Lady's incarnation.

68
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,219
Therefore, they selected these children

69
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,640
and nurtured them with care

70
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,110
in an attempt to receive
the Night King's forgiveness.

71
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,219
That woman...

72
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,920
Hurry and take me with you.

73
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,230
Was she the Night Lady
that you guys nurtured?

74
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,470
That's right.

75
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,230
That woman

76
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,830
was selected to be the Night Lady's
incarnation when she was born.

77
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,560
After Mr. Dong came here

78
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,470
and saw the girl,

79
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,459
he thought that our children

80
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,710
were born different.

81
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,560
It was merely
a congenital physical disability.

82
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,710
Our tribesfolk took them
as Night Lady's incarnation by mistake.

83
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,409
Thus,

84
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,339
he gathered some unique pieces of bones.

85
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,280
A special fume was generated
by burning the pieces of bones.

86
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,560
It could relieve the woman's pain

87
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,350
and treat her bone disorder.

88
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,979
During the process,

89
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,440
Mr. Dong Can fell for that woman.

90
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,230
Thus, he remained in our tribe

91
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,870
and became our chieftain.

92
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,929
Chieftain wanted to help us

93
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,619
resolve the Night King's crisis.

94
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,440
However, the Night King
was too powerful.

95
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,789
Before he tried to deal with
the Night King,

96
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,040
he was worried that he might not
be able to resolve the crisis.

97
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,590
But he told us

98
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,440
that a member of his ex-tribe

99
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,139
would definitely come and replace him

100
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,739
if he didn't return.

101
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,379
All these years,

102
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,710
the porters have brought
many people back to the tribe.

103
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,529
But we realized

104
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,619
that they weren't the one
Chieftain had told us about

105
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,070
until your appearance.

106
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,459
You're the one whom Chieftain said
would help us kill the Night King

107
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,870
and resolve our crisis.

108
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,830
What exactly

109
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,160
is this Night King?

110
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,440
The Night King is its own entity.

111
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,320
No one survived an encounter with it,

112
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,590
including Chieftain.

113
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,710
Take me to this Night King.

114
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,070
Are you well-rested?

115
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,809
Tell me, then.

116
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,190
What did you see?

117
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,470
Qiling entered the snow mountains.

118
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,520
And, he met the legendary Night King.

119
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,289
What does it look like?

120
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,470
I don't know.

121
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,960
The scrolls only managed
to record his visit to the snow mountains.

122
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,470
Nothing else was recorded after that.

123
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,680
Nothing else was recorded?

124
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,400
That Yu Da, was he pretending to be dumb?
Or was he actually dumb?

125
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,099
How could he do this all the time?

126
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,320
He's always keeping us in suspense.

127
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,569
The content of the scrolls

128
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,049
roughly aligns with the information

129
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,470
we received from Zhang Haike.

130
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,379
According to the scrolls,

131
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,169
the Yinshaluo Tribe sought Qiling's help

132
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,169
to get rid of the Night King, who was hiding
within the snow mountains.

133
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,830
And, he also encountered the Night King.

134
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,339
Fatty, I can roughly

135
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,160
piece together the information
from the scrolls.

136
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,470
Dong Can is a member
of the Zhang Family.

137
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,460
He discovered the Yinshaluo Tribe
by accident

138
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,960
when he was investigating
the case of "Night King Devours The Sky."

139
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,280
After Qiling became
the patriarch of Zhang Family,

140
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,040
he received a mission
commissioned by the heavens

141
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,339
and entered the snow mountains.

142
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,830
In the end, these records

143
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,099
were kept at Jila Spiritual Retreat.

144
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,859
Do you want some?

145
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,920
No thanks.

146
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,459
That means

147
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,459
Qiling did resolve
the Night King issue back then.

148
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,070
If Qiling did see the painting of
Night King Devours The Sky as well,

149
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,849
what exactly is the Night King, then?

150
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,499
Is it the entity depicted
within the painting?

151
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,590
Enough.

152
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,830
Let's forget what it looks like for now.

153
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,760
We should be able
to gather more information

154
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,960
if we locate the Yinshaluo Tribe.

155
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,040
But you see,

156
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,390
this is an issue that Dong Can
and the Zhang Family

157
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,979
failed to resolve.

158
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,630
They even sought Qiling's help.

159
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,320
Now,

160
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,739
there's only you, me,

161
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,320
Zhang Haike, and Zhang Haixing.

162
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,320
Do you think we're better than Qiling?

163
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,240
What are you thinking?
Be confident in yourself.

164
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,129
Of course we aren't.

165
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,289
Therefore, it'll be a waste of time.

166
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,529
We'll lose everything.

167
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,000
At this moment,

168
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,529
don't you think we should
pack up and head home?

169
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,720
It's not too late, right?

170
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,200
Are we too late?

171
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,870
We have to deal with
the Night King eventually.

172
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,670
However, we aren't capable enough
to deal with him yet.

173
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,800
We have to think carefully.

174
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,670
Are we going to join hands with Feng?

175
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,430
Mr. Wu.

176
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,089
I've already gotten my statement
recorded in the police station.

177
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,350
The police have inspected me as well.

178
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,760
I told them to give me a special certificate
so that you can have peace of mind.

179
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,760
What do you think?

180
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,350
Isn't the Night King's true form mystical?

181
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,070
So, you guys think

182
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,259
this is the Night King?

183
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,040
It looks like a giant cauliflower.

184
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,280
Currently, this is
our most logical prediction.

185
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,390
Some of its unknown parts
are hidden under the snow.

186
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,830
Those spherical bodies
can be seen above the snow.

187
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,129
When animals and humans pass by,

188
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,459
the Night King will use
these spherical bodies to devour them.

189
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,240
So, you guys actually believe

190
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,739
in the existence of a being like this?

191
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,259
There's an ancient sea creature

192
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,049
that resembles it closely.

193
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,390
The ancient city was originally
a part of the ocean, right?

194
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,720
What if it's just a life form
that had undergone special mutation?

195
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,390
I don't think that's what
the Night King looks like.

196
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,000
Why is that so?

197
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,259
Zhang Nian said

198
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,240
that the Night King
was able to kill Zhang Qiling.

199
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,240
But a cauliflower like this

200
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,590
is no match for Zhang Qiling.

201
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,699
Mr. Wu,

202
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,899
will you let me join you

203
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,520
in the snow mountains

204
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,350
as per our agreement?

205
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,259
Show me your weapons inventory.

206
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,240
Alright.

207
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,110
Which of these weapons

208
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,910
are meant for dealing with
the Night King?

209
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,350
It's not listed.

210
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,910
It's a secret weapon.

211
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,049
I'll show it to you

212
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,960
during crucial moments.

213
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,830
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

214
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,720
I will never take our lives lightly.

215
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,830
That weapon will definitely work on it.

216
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,870
Alright. What about this?

217
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,670
This...

218
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,910
This item,

219
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,240
it's

220
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,910
a grenade bracelet.

221
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,280
It has a detonator.

222
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,280
Once you press it,

223
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,110
the bracelet will explode.

224
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,960
I will die from it.

225
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,670
If you're still worried,

226
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,960
you can use it as your trump card.

227
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,289
This is made of

228
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,350
a special alloy.

229
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,560
It cannot be removed.

230
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,480
It can be unlocked with a key.

231
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,110
Why should I trust you?

232
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,670
Are you out of your mind?

233
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,240
How do I turn it off?

234
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,110
You lunatic.

235
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,219
Even if you wish to die,

236
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,870
don't drag me down with you.

237
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,960
Mr. Wu.

238
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,590
You can take this as our agreement.

239
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,280
Alright.

240
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,769
Wear it.

241
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,070
What?

242
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,369
Those were all
Zhang Nian's responsibilities.

243
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,739
It has nothing to do with us!

244
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,200
This is an order.

245
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,049
If you don't comply,
you'll be violating our agreement.

246
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,630
Therefore, you won't get paid.

247
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,670
Is this okay now?

248
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,320
Happy?

249
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,760
When will we depart?

250
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,219
You guys can head back first.

251
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,070
- Wait for my notification.
- Alright.

252
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,280
Goodbye.

253
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,760
Why the heck did we do that?

254
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,659
Our technician

255
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,129
can remove this crap easily.

256
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,240
No need for that.

257
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,560
Wu Xie doesn't trust us.

258
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,739
If this can help

259
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,129
improve our partnership,

260
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,800
we're going to wear it.

261
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,110
Mind your steps.

262
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,390
Take care.

263
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,150
Stick to the cliff.

264
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,960
Fatty.

265
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,419
Get me the binoculars.

266
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,350
Alright.

267
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,390
You're looking for game, huh?

268
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,630
Here.

269
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,480
Judging from the terrain,

270
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,760
the area ahead

271
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,259
should be where Qiling

272
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,870
encountered the Night Lady.

273
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,150
I'm sure you guys
are exhausted from the long trip.

274
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,499
Let's take a break for now.

275
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,830
After that, we'll resume our journey.

276
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,809
Luckily, I kept the beverages
in an insulated bag.

277
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,769
If not, they would've been frozen.

278
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,800
Have some.

279
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,089
Have some.

280
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,110
Thank you.

281
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,720
Thank you.

282
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,150
I hate serving people.

283
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,630
Here's a life hack.

284
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,440
In high-altitude areas,
those in better physical condition

285
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,390
actually have a disadvantage.

286
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,590
The more muscular you are,
the more you lack oxygen.

287
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,760
Look at that old man.

288
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,000
He has a sturdy body indeed.

289
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,830
He should do the scouting.

290
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,390
Youngsters like us need to rest.

291
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,430
Was that a sneak attack?

292
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,200
Everything's normal.

293
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,240
Let's continue.

294
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,350
Watch your step.

295
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,200
This place

296
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,760
should be the Yinshaluo's shrine

297
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,430
as per Qiling's observation.

298
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,280
This trip

299
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,280
is too smooth to be true.

300
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,350
Stop scaring yourself.

301
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,219
It's been so many years.

302
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,590
Maybe that thing has
already starved to death.

303
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,910
There's something over there.

304
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,070
Let's go and take a look.

305
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,529
I've never seen something

306
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,910
like this on our way here.

307
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,529
At this altitude,

308
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,110
such animals shouldn't exist.

309
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,760
They were used as feed.

310
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,320
Look.

311
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,609
There's a bullet hole
in the goat's skull.

312
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,760
They were brought here as feed.

313
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,390
Look at the state it's in.

314
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,960
What could cause this?

315
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,830
Could it be a bear?

316
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,870
Bears aren't that particular
when it comes to finishing their food.

317
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,830
Since it devoured everything,

318
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,049
I assume the animal

319
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,630
possesses high intelligence.

320
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,809
There are no bite marks.

321
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,430
If not, I would have an answer.

322
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,120
As if.

323
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,559
You can identify the animal
behind this by observing the bite marks?

324
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,369
I have a degree in zoology.

325
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,960
I was an associate professor
at a university before I changed my job.

326
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,110
Check the ice's thickness.

327
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,480
What's wrong?

328
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,320
Qiling didn't write down

329
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,280
how he crossed the icy lake.

330
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,849
Maybe the trip was smooth.

331
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,520
That's why he didn't record it down.

332
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,480
I think

333
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,720
we won't be able

334
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,200
to reach the Yinshaluo's shrine
that easily.

335
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,830
Everything seems alright.

336
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,070
The thickness of the ice is 20 cm.

337
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,720
The ice is about 20 cm.

338
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,040
It should be safer in the middle.

339
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,800
Okay. Let's go.

340
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,720
Wait.

341
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,590
I don't know
if I can explain how I feel to you.

342
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,960
I have a hunch

343
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,200
that we mustn't act recklessly

344
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,110
before we get a hold of the situation.

345
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,630
What is that?

346
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,870
Hold on!

347
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,179
Don't move!

348
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,459
We're on a frozen lake.

349
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,870
All of us will die
if you shoot the lake.

350
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,089
Scan underneath the lake.

351
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,110
Yes, sir.

352
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,430
According to the scanning situation,

353
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,000
the dark shadow is kind
of a creature in the ice lake.

354
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,569
The reason why the fish is so large

355
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,289
should be the result

356
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,480
of people feeding it for centuries.

357
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,070
People won't feed it
at the center of the lake.

358
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,350
They must be feeding it
somewhere near the water.

359
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,560
The carcasses we saw just now

360
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,670
might be its feed.

361
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,960
Therefore, the shadow
is likely to be more active

362
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,590
in areas near the lake.

363
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,630
In addition, the ice is thicker

364
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,240
in the middle of the lake.

365
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,760
It might be safer instead.

366
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,760
Keep going!

367
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,070
Stop!

368
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,529
Feng,

369
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,520
I read this from Qiling's scroll.

370
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,150
He was assaulted by
a creature near the lake.

371
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,800
This creature

372
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,630
will drag people into the snow.

373
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,939
And, the giant shadow beneath the lake

374
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,720
might be that creature.

375
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,219
Maybe the Yinshaluo Tribe fed it

376
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,800
to defend themselves against outsiders.

377
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,659
It'll be risky if we walk

378
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,769
toward the center of the lake.

379
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,320
What's your plan, then?

380
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,630
We have to remain on land.

381
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,899
At least we can deal with the situation

382
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,720
if anything happens.

383
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,910
Over here!

384
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,000
This part of the cliff

385
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,899
looks relatively smooth.

386
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,899
Let's open a path

387
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,480
from here

388
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,240
and get across the lake.

389
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,280
That's impossible!

390
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,480
The path is too narrow!

391
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,659
Even if we can get through,

392
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,670
we can't take our equipment with us.

393
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,350
Enough already.

394
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,289
You see, this is our rule.

395
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,529
We'll never go anywhere
that Naive deems unsafe.

396
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,369
Listen.

397
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,480
Naive is notorious
for having a sharp sense.

398
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,809
You guys can get across
your way if you're scared.

399
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,419
We have to get across
as soon as possible.

400
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,129
You think I'm sacred? What a joke.

401
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,529
Mr. Wu, I assume you've heard that too.

402
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,899
I can't take my equipment with me
if I take that path.

403
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,259
And, this year's abnormally cold.

404
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,499
The ice layer is super thick.

405
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,240
We'll surely be safe.

406
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,430
Let's rendezvous at the shrine.

407
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,609
It's cold out here.

408
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,240
We have to get across
as soon as possible.

409
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,760
See you there.

410
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,720
Guys, let's go.

411
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,019
I'll keep an eye on them.

412
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,390
Go!

413
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,480
Go!

414
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,320
Are we being irresponsible

415
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,520
by doing so?

416
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,670
Who are we supposed
to be responsible for?

417
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,280
These stubborn fools?

418
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,800
What I have learned during this time

419
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,819
is that we cannot be responsible
for someone else's fate.

420
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,249
Naive, just be responsible for yourself.

421
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,470
Don't you agree, old man?

422
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,830
Aren't you going
to travel with your sister?

423
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,169
You're the patriarch's friend.

424
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,510
I have to ensure your safety.

425
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,120
Haixing can look after herself.

426
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,390
Hurry up!

427
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,510
We can warm up by the fire
after we cross the lake!

428
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,760
It's so cold.

429
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,870
I really miss the fireplace at home.

430
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,779
And a glass of wine.

431
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,640
Hurry up! Let's cross the lake
and light a fire!

432
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,920
The three of them are pretty quick, huh?

433
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,419
They're reaching the edge of the lake.

434
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,779
Old woman will surely
tease me for this.

435
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,609
This won't do.

436
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,200
It's fine as long as everyone's safe.

437
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,609
Say, the creature isn't showing itself.

438
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,299
Nothing is going wrong either.

439
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,830
I guess I'll feel better
if she slip and fall now.

440
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,120
Why are you staring at me?

441
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,089
We're taking this path

442
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,049
because we inherited Qiling's will.

443
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,569
This is how the Zhang Family will act.

444
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,470
You guys should learn from us.

445
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,920
At least they've arrived safely.

446
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,089
You're unimpressed, huh?

447
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,350
Wait.

448
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,030
Look.

449
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,760
Looks like they're in trouble.

450
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,600
All of them are running backward.

451
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,830
Seems like something
is chasing after them.

452
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,760
But there's nothing behind them.

453
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,649
They're undressing themselves.

454
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,840
They're undressing themselves?

455
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,600
Hold this.

456
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,030
What are they scratching?

457
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,720
There's nothing on their bodies.
Take a look!

458
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,350
Get out of the way!

459
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,470
Haixing!

460
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,550
Haixing, what's wrong?

461
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,129
What happened?

462
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,049
When they got there,
they started beating themselves!

463
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,320
It's as if they were on fire!

464
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,030
This way!

465
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,390
On fire?

466
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,240
They might be seeing hallucinations.

467
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,390
There's a dark layer

468
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,470
underneath the ice layer.

469
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,680
I can't see it clearly.

470
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,819
We have to think of a way

471
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,470
to drag them across the lake.

472
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,320
Head there and wait for me.

473
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,600
I'll head to the icy lake with a rope.

474
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,200
I'll drag them across with it.

475
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,129
Have you lost your mind?

476
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,990
What if you get in trouble too?

477
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,030
I know how to dispel
such hallucinations.

478
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,200
Trust me.

479
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,350
All the best of luck.

480
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,760
Wealth and prosperity.

481
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,950
(That fiery hallucination)

482
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,120
(came from the hexagonal bell powder
within the pot.)

483
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,240
(The hexagonal bell powder)

484
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,390
(melded with the ice layer.)

485
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,030
(When the wind blows,
the floating ice on the surface)

486
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,510
(was lifted up.)

487
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,470
(The hexagonal bell powder)

488
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,720
(was also lifted into the air.)

489
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,800
(Fire again?)

490
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,080
(Can't you come up
with something more creative?)

491
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,019
Over here!

492
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,209
Hurry!

493
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,990
Hurry!

494
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,830
Hurry!

495
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,979
Naive!

496
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,609
We'll be able to rendezvous soon!

497
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,160
