00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 27=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,430
Haike!

5
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,790
Haike.

6
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,760
What happened?

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,680
Who did this?

8
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,040
Seems like

9
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,739
he can't stand it

10
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,790
when we seek out happiness.

11
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,720
(After losing Niata,)

12
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,200
(it's as if)

13
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,880
(Haike was the living dead.)

14
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,630
Until, one day,

15
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,390
someone wrote him a letter.

16
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,630
(The sender told him)

17
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,200
(that they had a way to revive Niata.)

18
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,390
(And, the key to reviving her)

19
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,000
(is the Zanghai Flower.)

20
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,510
(Those people said)

21
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,320
(that they would revive Niata)

22
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,320
(as long as we followed
their instructions.)

23
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,830
(The Zanghai Flower gave Haike
a glimmer of hope.)

24
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,720
(Therefore,)

25
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,350
(he went to find the acting patriarch.)

26
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,040
What you desire is a forbidden item
of the Zhang Family.

27
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,609
I cannot give it to you.

28
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,929
The Zhang Family no longer exists.

29
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,979
Why can't you give it to me?

30
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,790
Zhang Qiling is still the patriarch.

31
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,259
He needs to accomplish the mission.

32
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,510
He was controlled by Tianshou.
He killed my wife and took everything from me.

33
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,280
I don't intend to seek revenge on him.

34
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,040
I just hope that he can give me
the Zanghai Flower so that I can save my wife.

35
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,070
You know that's impossible.

36
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,040
Once the Zanghai Flower
has been plucked,

37
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,040
it'll wilt rapidly.

38
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,760
Even if you turn it into a medicine,

39
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,209
it can only extend one's lifespan.

40
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,040
The user will fall into a deep sleep
and be sealed within a coffin.

41
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,000
It cannot revive the dead.

42
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,830
I don't care! I'll give it a try

43
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,000
as long as there's
a sliver of possibility!

44
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,200
I can give it to you.

45
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,200
However, she's already dead.

46
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,000
It's pointless if you feed her with it.

47
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,209
(However, the Zanghai Flowers they have)

48
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,760
(were all wilted.)

49
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,880
(All the seeds were dead.)

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,059
(Even if he were to study them,)

51
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,920
(it'd only yield one result.)

52
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,150
(Therefore, he started)

53
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,920
(to contact the mysterious person
who wrote him the letter.)

54
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,470
(He wanted to find a possibility
within the impossible.)

55
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,490
(Actually, I know his intentions.)

56
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,619
(He just wants to give himself)

57
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,560
(another reason to live.)

58
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,899
Who are you?

59
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,240
My surname is Wang.

60
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm an enemy of the Zhang Family.

61
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,579
(For Niata's sake,)

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,390
(Haike agreed to their conditions.)

63
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,329
(Although I know that the Wang Family)

64
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,800
(is up to no good,)

65
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,270
(Haike is my brother after all.)

66
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,320
(I have to help him.)

67
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,070
(Therefore,)

68
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,880
(we decided to execute
the Wang Family's plan.)

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,819
(But the keys, the Heavenly Staff,
the Bronze Door,)

70
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,000
(and the traps within
are interconnected.)

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,630
We have to decipher them one by one

72
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,510
to get our hands on the Zanghai Flower.

73
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,760
And, the only person
who can achieve that

74
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,880
is you.

75
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,200
So, you guys thought

76
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,070
Qiling murdered everyone

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,630
after being controlled by Tianshou?

78
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,710
I know you feel terrible
upon hearing that.

79
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,200
But that's the truth.

80
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,240
Many people had died

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,120
because of Zhang Qiling's Tianshou.

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,390
We're doing all of this

83
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,120
to save a person.

84
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,270
Qiling always had a clear goal
of utilizing Tianshou.

85
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,560
He dealt with Zhang Nian

86
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,769
because he studied the Night King
extensively.

87
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,440
It's likely that he found out the secret

88
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,760
behind the Night King
and the Zanghai Flower.

89
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,630
But why did he try
to deal with Zhang Jiuri

90
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,360
and you two?

91
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,529
He wanted us to return

92
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,059
and serve the Zhang Family.

93
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,680
Did you guys go back, then?

94
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,000
Your reason isn't valid at all.

95
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,590
Back then, Qiling became the patriarch

96
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,880
in order to set the Zhang Family free.

97
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,939
If so, why is he

98
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,800
trying to interrupt your lives?

99
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,849
Maybe he has other reasons...

100
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,270
What reasons?

101
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,760
He ruined your lives

102
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,390
and made you guys hate him, huh?

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,920
Why did he need to go that far

104
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,030
when he didn't have many friends

105
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,000
to begin with?

106
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,560
Even if your patriarch

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,470
has accepted Tianshou,

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,030
he would never kill the innocent.

109
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,289
He kept Zhang Nian alive.

110
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,019
But he killed Niata directly

111
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,320
without saying anything?

112
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,510
He murdered all those

113
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,710
insignificant individuals

114
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,680
who couldn't even defend themselves?

115
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,440
Do you think Zhang Qiling would
ever do something like that?

116
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,070
Where are Zhang Haike and Zhang Nian?

117
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,150
I knew you would try to rescue him.

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,390
The Zhang Family never
rescue anyone who will die for sure.

119
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,030
That wasn't the work of Tianshou.

120
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,360
It was a murder.

121
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,240
Someone

122
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,470
impersonated Qiling.

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,259
And, he made Zhang Haike

124
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,200
witness

125
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,230
Qiling murdering Niata personally.

126
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,640
He made him think
that he ruined his life.

127
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,710
Don't you think
your brother's experience

128
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,470
resemble another person's experience?

129
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,200
Hatred is the best weapon.

130
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,070
By making you two hate a common target,

131
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,619
they can use you guys
to their full advantage

132
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,590
to realize their goals.

133
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,520
So,

134
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,560
the person who murdered Niata

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,320
should be the one benefiting
from this conflict.

136
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,379
Think about it.

137
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,449
Who was the person

138
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,590
who found you guys and directed the hate
to Zhang Qiling right after the incident.

139
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,320
Seems like

140
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,040
he can't stand it
when we seek out happiness.

141
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,590
You can kill me
if you're capable enough.

142
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,710
If so, we'll be even, then.

143
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,520
So,

144
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,520
the person who murdered Niata

145
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,640
wasn't your patriarch.

146
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,040
It was Zhang Nian.

147
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,950
Your patriarch didn't let you guys down.

148
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,470
You guys let him down instead.

149
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,320
Wu Xie,

150
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,710
it no longer matters who murdered Niata.

151
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,680
It doesn't matter if Zhang Qiling
was the murderer or not.

152
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,110
Niata is already dead.

153
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,040
You do have a point.

154
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,070
If the culprit was your patriarch,

155
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,590
you guys could blame everything

156
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,110
on the fact that you guys
were members of the Zhang Family.

157
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,320
If the culprit was Zhang Nian,

158
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,520
you guys could only blame yourselves
for being utter fools.

159
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,830
Initially, I thought

160
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,470
the Zhang Family was extraordinary.

161
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,640
In the end,

162
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,830
you guys are actually
ordinary fools too.

163
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,320
You're dying.

164
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,110
Cut the crap.

165
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,400
Yes.

166
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,800
I'm dying.

167
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,739
But before that,

168
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,200
I need to get to the bottom of this.

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,230
What other questions do you have?

170
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,870
Does the Night King exist or not?

171
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,750
I'm not sure.

172
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,110
How do you explain the records
in the scroll, then?

173
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,870
Was the letter from the Yinshaluo Tribe
forged as well?

174
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,400
Regarding the letter,

175
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,590
Haike did forge it to dupe you.

176
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,350
But the patriarch's history

177
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,160
was recorded by Deren.

178
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,750
We're not sure about that.

179
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,320
If Qiling was here before,

180
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,379
I'm sure this place

181
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,040
has an issue more serious

182
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,200
than the Night King's existence
that needs to be dealt with.

183
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,320
Even if that's the case,

184
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,590
I'm sure the patriarch has resolved it

185
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,280
during his last visit.

186
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,350
If he did resolve the issue
during his last visit,

187
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,280
why would he send me here
to help him out

188
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,800
after all these years?

189
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,800
If his goal was to stop you guys
from finding the Zanghai Flower,

190
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,560
he didn't need to send me here at all.

191
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,040
It's because you guys
cannot find it yourselves.

192
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,200
Therefore, I'm sure there's more to it

193
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,110
than meets the eye.

194
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,040
Wu Xie,

195
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,990
you're truly intelligent.

196
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,990
I assume you've noticed that

197
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,320
long ago.

198
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,710
But because of this,

199
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,110
you had to travel with us

200
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,160
even though you had doubts about us.

201
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,360
In order to save Niata,

202
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,160
we inquired about this place
from many people.

203
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,760
Only then were we able to
piece together the general situation.

204
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,449
The Zanghai Flowers
will bloom every 80 years.

205
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,400
They'll generate plenty of spores.

206
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,350
They'll travel out
of the valley by random.

207
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,520
Living beings that are
infected by the spores

208
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,520
will go through a mutation.

209
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,830
And the snakes that could
control puppets in the Kumuli Dynasty,

210
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,219
they acted strangely

211
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,139
due to an outbreak

212
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,529
of

213
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,200
the Zanghai Flowers' spores.

214
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,520
The Zhang Family has to deal with

215
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,160
this issue every 80 years.

216
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,560
We speculated that the Zhang Family

217
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,680
had once lost the Heavenly Staff.

218
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,040
As there was no one monitoring
the field of Zanghai Flowers,

219
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,950
those spores started to infect

220
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,280
the Mystic Claw, which was trained
to protect the Bronze Door.

221
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,070
It underwent a mutation,

222
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,560
went berserk,

223
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,110
and started attacking
the Yinshaluo Tribe.

224
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,870
The Yinshaluo Tribe thought
of the mutated Mystic Claw as the Night King.

225
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,990
They tried to kill the Night King,

226
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,350
but they failed.

227
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,590
When Dong Can was
trying to resolve this issue,

228
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,990
he was murdered by
the mutated Mystic Claw.

229
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,619
Only then Zhang Qiling came here.

230
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,800
First, he went to the Yinshaluo Tribe
to deal with the mutated Mystic Claw.

231
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,979
After that, he came here

232
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,110
to deal with
the blooming Zanghai Flowers.

233
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,320
Therefore,

234
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,590
if you demand a definition
for the Night King,

235
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,990
it's a mutated Mystic Claw.

236
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,950
Haike used this blind spot

237
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,769
to turn this lie

238
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,750
into a perfect lie.

239
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,110
So, the mission I saw in the tape

240
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,200
wasn't actually about
defeating the Night King.

241
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,049
It's to destroy the seeds
of the Zanghai Flowers

242
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,990
and prevent the spreading of the spores.

243
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,990
Otherwise, a massive
ecological disaster will occur.

244
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,200
Am I right?

245
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
That's about it.

246
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,320
But we're not sure either.

247
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,870
Those were just speculations after all.

248
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,920
We pieced them together one by one.

249
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,680
So, Qiling wanted me

250
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,440
to destroy the field of Zanghai Flowers.

251
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,040
How should I destroy them?

252
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,350
I don't know.

253
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,200
I won't tell you the solution either.

254
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,200
Locating these flowers

255
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,440
was the sole reason
for my brother to live

256
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,680
all these years.

257
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,990
He needs to use them to revive Niata.

258
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,440
If I don't help him

259
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,230
gather these flowers,

260
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,449
I'll be sending him to his death.

261
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,950
Do you truly believe

262
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,750
that there's an item in the world

263
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,950
that can revive the dead?

264
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,280
You don't believe it either, am I right?

265
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,070
It's all because of
your brother's obsession.

266
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,950
That obsession of his

267
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,950
was what kept him alive until now.

268
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,680
Therefore, in order to protect him,

269
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,929
you joined him

270
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,739
and committed such an absurd deed.

271
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,750
Isn't he selfish?

272
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,230
- Has he ever considered your feelings?
- He has.

273
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,640
He cares about me.

274
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,320
The Zhang Family has always been

275
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,920
trying to deal with the people
who manipulated you guys.

276
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,139
But you guys betrayed
the Zhang Family...

277
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't care what
the Zhang Family thinks about me.

278
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,590
We only care about

279
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,920
certain individuals.

280
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,680
For example, Niata.

281
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,750
Zhang Haixing,

282
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,320
your brother may have lost his mind,

283
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,990
but you haven't.

284
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,830
You must pull him back
before it's too late.

285
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,200
Since birth,

286
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,680
I didn't have the right to choose.

287
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,990
I wouldn't end up like this

288
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,800
if I did have the right to choose.

289
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,200
Since it has come to this,

290
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,830
I have no choice
but to let the patriarch down.

291
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,350
Anyway,

292
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,200
the door to the field of Zanghai Flowers

293
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,990
has already been unlocked.

294
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,950
Haike will be here soon.

295
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,440
Now,

296
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,320
it's already a foregone conclusion.

297
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,830
Just rest in peace.

298
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,080
Wu Xie, you deceived me!

299
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,139
Did you hear that?

300
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,299
Qiling entrusted me

301
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,160
to destroy the field of Zanghai Flowers.

302
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,270
Wu Xie!

303
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,550
Let's go!

304
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,449
You guys have no idea

305
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,139
to destroy the field of Zanghai Flowers!

306
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,080
Demolition is our expertise!

307
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm going to pass out. Let's go!

308
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,160
Let's go!

309
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,120
Thank you, granny!

310
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,880
You guys won't be able to achieve it!

311
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,099
So, in the end,

312
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,299
Qiling wanted us to blow things up, huh?

313
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,750
He should've told me earlier.

314
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,750
That's my expertise.

315
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,600
Let's go.

316
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,560
These must be the Zanghai Flowers.

317
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,339
This is so beautiful.

318
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,710
I feel like cursing someone out.

319
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,400
Naive,

320
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,710
I would rather believe

321
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,990
that this is my hallucination.

322
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,249
According to the wall painting...

323
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,600
The Zanghai Flowers

324
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,209
will bloom every 80 years.

325
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,160
Once they bloom,

326
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,539
they'll release spores.

327
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,950
These spores

328
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,270
will travel out of the valley by random.

329
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,680
And, the golden sphere larvae
will infest the roots.

330
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,160
The combination of the two

331
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,950
could potentially
cause a massive disaster.

332
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,779
Therefore, the mission Qiling
had assigned to us should be

333
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,169
destroying the seeds of these flowers

334
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,680
and the golden sphere larvae

335
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,510
before they reach maturity.

336
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,200
The Zhang Family
planted these themselves.

337
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,649
In nature, the most beautiful things

338
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,550
are always poisonous.

339
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,080
Let's take a picture with them.

340
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,920
My battery is flat.

341
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,880
The more beautiful it is,
the harder it is to retain it.

342
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,990
I came up with a philosophical quote
by accident.

343
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,400
What should we do now?

344
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,649
Aren't you the one in charge here?

345
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,950
Tell me what to do.
I'll follow your instructions.

346
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,710
It's like this.

347
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,209
If we destroy the field
of Zanghai Flowers,

348
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,819
Zhang Haike will definitely kill us.

349
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,790
He won't be able to revive Niata.

350
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,139
However,

351
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,400
if we don't destroy them,

352
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,969
the spores might spread
throughout the world.

353
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,230
Mutation might occur in
every living being.

354
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,379
These spores will spread rapidly

355
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,680
just like nuclear radiation.

356
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,790
It'll destroy the world.

357
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,209
So, it's either we die

358
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,470
or the world ends, huh?

359
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,729
In my opinion, I don't think we need to
make a choice between both bad endings.

360
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,840
What if

361
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,689
Zhang Haike doesn't kill us?

362
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,689
Theoretically,

363
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,310
we still stand a chance.

364
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,579
We might

365
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,209
still stand a chance against them.

366
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,270
If we're lucky, that is.

367
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,360
That means we don't stand a chance.

368
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,710
Let's just pluck one of them.

369
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,640
We'll keep one for him

370
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,510
so that he can save Niata.

371
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,859
It depends on whether or not

372
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,790
he still retains his boundaries
and kindness.

373
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,360
We need time to blow up the place.

374
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,099
He's surely doing everything he can
to rush here.

375
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,209
If he arrives here

376
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,299
and not attack us when he sees us

377
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,649
blowing the place up,

378
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,409
I believe that he won't harm anyone else

379
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,489
in order to save Niata.

380
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,080
If so, we'll give him the flower.

381
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,120
Now,

382
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,600
it all depends on him.

383
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,099
If he kills us,

384
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,120
that means he'll kill everyone...

385
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,160
In order to save Niata.

386
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,080
If so, I won't give it to him
or sympathize with him

387
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,030
no matter how kind I am.

388
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,139
Alright.

389
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,339
If so, it's best for us to be done here

390
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,840
when they reach here.

391
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,099
If not,

392
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,539
I don't know

393
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,600
who gets to make the final call.

394
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,600
Come on. Let's do this.

395
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,449
Let's burn the place down!

396
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,880
Fire is useless.

397
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,270
Although they're blooming
above the icy surface,

398
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,640
their roots are located
beneath the icy layer.

399
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,169
Even if you burn them down,

400
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,640
they'll grow back.

401
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,649
And, the golden sphere larvae
are residing within the roots.

402
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,249
Therefore, we need to come up with a way

403
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,030
to destroy their roots
beneath the icy layer.

404
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,440
What did Qiling do

405
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,360
when he came here, then?

406
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,550
Don't tell me he plucked them
out one by one?

407
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,920
That'll do too.

408
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,950
If we start plucking now,

409
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,840
I reckon we can finish
the job in two years.

410
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,579
With the way
the Zhang Family does things,

411
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm sure they'll choose the fastest

412
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,099
and most comprehensive way

413
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,840
to deal with this issue.

414
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,339
The Zhang Family planted this field.

415
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,859
I'm sure they know

416
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,139
how dangerous they are.

417
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,209
Therefore, it's likely

418
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,379
that the Zhang Family had already set up

419
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,249
the final line of defense

420
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,880
before forming this field

421
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,339
just in case

422
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,470
these Zanghai Flowers
spread destruction to the world.

423
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,579
The Zhang Family
has to deal with this issue

424
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,409
every 80 years.

425
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,619
I'm sure they've set up
a defensive measure

426
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,489
for this field.

427
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,489
Just like the plethora of traps
they set outside

428
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,270
the Bronze Door.

429
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,729
If so, could the defensive measure

430
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,579
utilize a certain type of mechanism too?

431
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,249
We've witnessed the crazy traps set up
by the Zhang Family in the cave.

432
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,240
Therefore, I'm sure

433
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,249
they're capable of this.

434
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,840
Therefore, we need
to find this mechanism.

435
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,169
The most important function
of the mechanism

436
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,249
is to get rid of the roots

437
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,379
and golden sphere bugs

438
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,710
in one go.

439
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,550
If so, it's logical for them

440
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,200
to place it underneath the icy layer.

441
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,550
I got it.

442
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,449
I've been carrying this shovel with me

443
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,710
without using it.

444
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,550
Now, it's his time to shine.

445
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,600
I'll dig a hole

446
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,859
and shove it under the ground.

447
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,249
Once it activates the switch,

448
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,640
the ground will heat up.

449
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,990
And, the flowers will be toasted.

450
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,920
Fatty, what you said
might actually be true.

451
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,169
It can also deal with

452
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,990
the parasitic golden sphere bugs too.

453
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,299
Maybe he already told us

454
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,440
about the location of the switch.

455
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,579
Are you saying

456
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,360
that the location is imprinted
upon the Heavenly Staff?

457
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,059
The Heavenly Staff
is a symbol of the patriarch.

458
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,299
Only the Zhang Family's patriarch

459
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,099
may visit this place.

460
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,409
And, we used this staff

461
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,779
to unlock the secret door

462
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,550
to this place.

463
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,200
Therefore,

464
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,899
it's likely

465
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,139
that the location of the switch

466
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,600
is imprinted on this staff.

467
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,750
Lucky!

468
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,840
I need to find a place with a good view

469
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,270
so that I can get a good overview.

470
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,160
Over there.

471
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,600
How is it?

472
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,440
Did you find anything?

473
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,710
Not yet.

474
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,120
Fatty.

475
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,969
I have the feeling that
I've seen the shape

476
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,640
of the flower field before.

477
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,470
Is that so?

478
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,840
Try and think carefully.

479
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,640
Fatty.

480
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,840
I might have omitted
some important info.

481
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,270
Did you find anything?

482
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,680
Are we

483
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,840
being too presumptuous?

484
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,120
I think we can only use this
to scratch our back.

485
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh yeah, we have this too.

486
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,600
I forgot about it.

487
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,339
Fatty, I found it.

488
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,249
What is it? Show me!

489
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,969
Don't move!

490
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm not moving.

491
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,710
Look through this hole.

492
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,470
Did you see it?

493
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,680
Did you see that reflective spot?

494
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,550
It's glowing.

495
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,840
This is so magical.

496
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,160
To think that I almost threw it away.

497
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,030
We do have a sliver of hope left.

498
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,539
The design of the key

499
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,619
is the map of Dejia's sewer.

500
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,169
The shape of the key itself

501
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,689
is the map of the flower field.

502
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,249
The reflective spot

503
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,619
that we saw through the hole

504
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,550
should be where
the mechanism was located.

505
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,840
But usually, one needs verification

506
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,339
to activate such a mechanism.

507
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,950
Only the patriarch
has the authorization to do so.

508
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,080
It's either we use blood

509
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,030
or the Heavenly Staff.

510
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,840
What's wrong?

511
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,120
Feng is here.

512
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,209
Our main leads,

513
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:06,899
Zhang Haike.

514
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,160
Zhang Haixing is here too.

515
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,339
Feng was kidnapped? This is bad.

516
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,729
If that's the case,

517
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,209
that means Hans has already betrayed us

518
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,689
and joined Zhang Haike.

519
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,099
Now, the situation has changed.

520
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,120
No matter if we destroy
the place or not,

521
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,790
once we appear,

522
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,360
Hans and his men will kill us.

523
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,680
They're at the junction.

524
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,950
If we destroy the flower field,

525
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,539
we'll be killed for sure.

526
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,649
Even if we surrender,

527
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,209
I'm afraid they won't spare us.

528
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,790
Our only choice is to hide.

529
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,209
That's right.
We cannot charge recklessly.

530
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,929
Zhang Haike and the rest
have lost their minds.

531
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,409
We'll die for sure if we charge at them.

532
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,900
However, if we compare the recovery
of Qiling's memory to this matter,

533
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,840
which of the two
do you think is more important to him?

534
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,950
Right. We'll die anyway.
Let's finish this quickly.

535
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,230
Haike,

536
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,840
we finally found the Zanghai Flowers.

537
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,160
So, this is the secret
that the Zhang Family has been hiding.

538
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,009
Boss, as you can see,

539
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,160
these weird plants are priceless.

540
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,299
We just need to gather them

541
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,030
and report back.

542
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,619
Hurry up!

543
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,489
Take the flowers! Quick!

544
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,470
Yes, sir!

545
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,400
Grenade!

546
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,160
Get down!

547
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,950
A dummy grenade?

548
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,550
Cowards!

549
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,619
I'm the Night King!

550
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,899
You guys are too bold for your own good!

551
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,779
How dare you cover my flowers?

552
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,080
Do you guys wish to die?

553
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,400
Don't move!

554
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,510
That was just a reminder.

555
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,619
Now, I'm holding the real deal.

556
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,160
If anyone dares to move,

557
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,779
I'll drag you down to Hell with me!

558
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,790
Haike.

559
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,209
Don't trust him.

560
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,539
We're on a snowy mountain.

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,400
- He won't blow the place up.
- Don't move.

562
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,680
Nobody moves!

563
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,929
Don't move!

564
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,249
I told you not to move.

565
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,689
Are you unafraid of death?

566
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,080
That's right.

567
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,689
I have no reason to live

568
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,600
if this place is destroyed.

569
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,819
Let go if you dare.

570
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,160
We'll perish together.

571
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,950
I know you're unafraid of death.

572
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,750
Nobody moves!

573
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,470
Listen!

574
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,950
All of you will be done for if I let go!

575
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,030
Must you sacrifice your sister too?

576
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,950
She's your sister, you know?

577
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,880
It's been an arduous journey,

578
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,080
don't you think?

579
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,510
From Mosang to Dejia,
then to Snowy Peak,

580
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,120
then to the Zanghai Flower field.

581
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,520
I wouldn't say that we came here
based on mutual understanding.

582
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,200
After all, you and your sister
did deceive us plenty of times.

583
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,680
There are many things about you

584
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,899
that I only found out
through your sister.

585
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,689
But let's forget about that.

586
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,099
I guess

587
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,470
we did endure hardships together.

588
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,360
Although I wouldn't
consider us as friends,

589
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,899
at least we did experience
a lot of things together.

590
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,779
We should be able to talk this over.

591
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,310
I don't think we need

592
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,510
to resort to violence.

593
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,990
You see, how could you

594
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,270
not figure out

595
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,750
all these simple matters given your age?

596
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,299
Recklessness is the embodiment
of the Night King, you know?

597
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,680
I think there are plenty
of choices we can make in life.

598
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,950
For your sake,

599
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,030
your sister was willing
to do everything.

600
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,160
But you dwelt on the past obsessively.

601
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,539
You don't cherish
what you have right now

602
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,360
and your relationship with your sister.

603
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,270
I feel sorry for you.

604
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,680
I'm serious.

605
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,059
I can do anything

606
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,160
for Naive's sake.

607
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,379
That feeling has always stayed with me,

608
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,619
and it gives me plenty of energy.

609
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,550
What are you rambling on about?

610
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,600
You're stalling for time, aren't you?

611
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,270
Where's Wu Xie?

612
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,230
Where is Wu Xie?

613
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,360
Boss! There's someone over there!

614
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,689
Naive, you're off the path!

615
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,400
To your one o'clock!

616
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,710
Kill him!

617
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,080
After him!

618
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,129
Don't kill him!

619
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,680
He'll keep one for you!

620
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,480
Shoot them down!

621
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,560
Now,

622
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,600
you guys may kill me.

623
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,379
Everything's over.

624
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,600
Fatty.

625
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,790
We're still alive.

626
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,000
I didn't expect you

627
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,520
to actually do it.

628
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,600
You did it even after my deceit.

629
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,480
You don't understand me.

630
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,160
I understand you.

631
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,120
You want to save your wife, right?

632
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,179
I'll take it for myself

633
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,969
if this flower

634
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,230
can actually revive the dead.

635
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,830
It's God.

636
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,640
God doesn't understand you.

637
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,680
It's because what you desire

638
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,339
doesn't exist in the world.

639
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,480
The sample.

640
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,600
Where's the sample?

641
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,230
Did you guys gather the sample or not?

642
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,560
What the hell? Feng!

643
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,680
I'll kill you all!

644
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,040
This equipment is meant
for preserving the golden sphere.

645
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,259
We couldn't guarantee
whether or not we could take

646
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,350
the Zanghai Flower
with us from the start.

647
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,560
We've never studied
this kind of plant before.

648
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,270
It has been proven

649
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,870
that both the Zanghai Flower
and the golden spheres

650
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,910
cannot be taken away
for long-term research purposes.

651
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,609
They only belong here.

652
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,520
Zanghai Flowers will wilt rapidly

653
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,000
after being plucked.

654
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,750
You should know

655
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,819
that the Zanghai Flower

656
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,640
cannot be used to revive the dead.

657
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,000
If not, all of the members
of the Zhang Family would never die.

658
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,379
If so, the Zhang Family Ancient Tower
wouldn't even exist.

659
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,080
Wu Xie, what do you know?

660
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,750
Do you know how many years my brother
had devoted just to find these flowers?

661
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,569
You destroyed all of his hope

662
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,640
at this very moment.

663
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,600
Even if you do use it to save Niata,

664
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,750
you'll only deceive yourself
for a little longer.

665
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,080
Give me a reason.

666
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,790
If the spores of the Zanghai Flowers
spread outside,

667
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,750
even if Niata does get revived,

668
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,830
where do you plan to live with her?

669
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,870
Have you ever considered Niata's future?

670
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,129
Bad consequences are inevitable.

671
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,560
Stop it!

672
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,120
Bad consequences?

673
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,659
The technology the Zhang Family
had adopted before this was outdated.

674
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,310
I can definitely succeed.

675
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,929
By then, I'll spread the spores
and provide happiness to the world.

676
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,490
How will that result
in a bad consequence?

677
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,710
You've lost your mind.

678
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,259
Once the Zanghai Flowers bloom,

679
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,699
if the spores do spread,

680
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,049
it'll form a huge ecological disaster

681
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,160
if it goes out of control.

682
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,400
You know better than anyone else how dangerous
the mutated golden spheres and Mystic Claw are.

683
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,830
I don't care!

684
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,120
What else do you care about, then?

685
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,960
What you bear is merely

686
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,790
the selfish obsession in your heart.

687
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,350
You knew that you would never succeed.

688
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,259
Even so, you insisted on trying.

689
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,680
Do you believe

690
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,409
that I'll kill you right now?

691
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,560
Bring it on.

692
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,960
Will you keep my head in another chest?

693
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,960
The eighth head, right?

694
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,080
Bring it on.

695
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,120
Forget it.

696
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,480
I've looked at this face of yours

697
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,640
for too many years.

698
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,430
I'm already tired of it.

699
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,480
Zhang Haike.

700
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,299
Tell me.

701
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,960
What should we do next?

702
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,040
There's nothing to do next.

703
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,350
I cannot accept this result.

704
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,230
Everything's over.

705
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,680
Let's go.

706
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,200
You can do whatever you want with them.

707
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,910
Wu Xie!

708
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,160
You scum!

709
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,040
You finally accomplished your mission!

710
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,430
Happy?

711
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,480
Haike.

712
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,870
Everything'll be fine.

713
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,680
(At this moment,)

714
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,160
(I watched the Zhang siblings
as they left.)

715
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,480
(I think I've changed.)

716
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,680
(The past me)

717
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,270
(would never do such a thing.)

718
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,520
(Although this was
the right thing to do,)

719
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,600
(I still don't want anyone else)

720
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,040
(to suffer like them.)

721
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,790
You kept one with you,

722
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,350
am I right?
