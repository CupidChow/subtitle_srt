00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,255
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,300
(Years ago, Wu's old residence)

5
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,149
I can't believe

6
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,909
(Wu Laogou, Fifth Master of The Mystic Nine)
I can really die now.

7
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,790
Dad.

8
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,589
We're all here.

9
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:28,455
(Wu Yiqiong, Wu Xie's dad
Wu Erbai, Wu Xie's second uncle)

10
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,149
Yiqiong, Erbai, Sansheng

11
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,629
are here.

12
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,510
Grandson is here too.

13
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:39,580
(Young Wu Xie)

14
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,629
I have something to say.

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,505
(Wu Sanxing, Wu Xie's third uncle)

16
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,029
I don't have much to left,

17
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,189
three of you can divide them yourselves.

18
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,390
After I die,

19
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,990
you must cremate me within two hours.

20
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,429
You must ensure

21
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,830
that no one is within

22
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,629
30 meters

23
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,709
of the cremator.

24
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,230
No one can look into the cremator.

25
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,510
Dad.

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,189
Dad.

27
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,029
Fifth Master has passed away.

28
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,260
(Grave of Wu Laogou)

29
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,309
(My grandfather clearly passed away)

30
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,069
(with a huge secret.)

31
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,710
(Those secrets,)

32
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:04,389
(he never shared with anyone
in his lifetime.)

33
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,309
(Knowing too many secrets isn't
necessarily a good thing.)

34
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,590
(Based on my past experiences,)

35
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,749
(the more hidden something is,
the more dangerous it becomes.)

36
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,189
(It's often not something
an ordinary person can handle.)

37
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,949
(This is especially true
for people like Qiling.)

38
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,230
(But I still want to do what I can)

39
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,389
(to help him.)

40
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,350

Hua,

53
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,150
I just sent you an e-mail

54
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,350
with a picture in it.

55
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,069
Could you please take a look

56
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:24,389
and see if you recognize anything

57
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,590
or if you can provide any information?

58
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,476
♪Come back when it's snowing again♪

59
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,909
What's going on?

60
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,749
Why did so many people suddenly

61
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,029
show up overnight?

62
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,430
This is a group of hikers.

63
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,749
They arrived on the third day
after you moved in.

64
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,509
They come here every year

65
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,190
to go deeper into the mountains

66
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,269
and take pictures of the snow.

67
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,509
How about these foreigners?

68
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:21,470
Are they also part of that group?

69
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,389
It feels like this spiritual retreat

70
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:25,470
has suddenly turned into a motel.

71
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,389
I have no idea.

72
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,950
Although here is not isolated,

73
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,230
apart from a few fixed groups,

74
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,669
it's really rare

75
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,549
for so many people

76
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,830
to come in at once.

77
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,230
Excuse me.

78
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,110
Fatty.

79
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:04,549
Naive,

80
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:05,789
you miss me?

81
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,190
I haven't called you for a few days.

82
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,710
How's your stay at Gui's place?

83
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,310
When do you plan to come back?

84
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:13,749
I'm not going back.

85
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,950
I'm doing just fine here.

86
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,509
Many people want to be my father-in-law,

87
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,710
I can't even choose.

88
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,710
That's good to hear.

89
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,869
So, what have you discovered?

90
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,950
It's nothing, nothing at all.

91
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,190
Come on,

92
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,070
after so many years of friendship,

93
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,310
I know why you're calling

94
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,190
as soon as the phone rings.

95
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,350
Speak up, it seems like a big deal.

96
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,950
It's something about Qiling.

97
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,470
Yes.

98
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,710
That's what it's about.

99
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,710
Why aren't you speaking?

100
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,190
Based on what I heard,

101
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,590
I think something is off.

102
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,350
But maybe I'm overthinking it.

103
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,830
No, don't tell me half the story, okay?

104
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,070
What do you mean something is off?

105
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,710
You came back from Dejia

106
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,710
and passed through Mosang, right?

107
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,509
Yes.

108
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,230
You didn't find anything in Dejia.

109
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,509
Why didn't you go straight home?

110
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,430
You should have taken

111
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,830
a flight back from Dejia

112
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,549
and sort things out with Jin Wantang.

113
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,389
Think about how you got to Mosang.

114
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,149
Something must have

115
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,509
subtly influenced

116
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,590
your decision.

117
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,190
I heard that

118
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,549
their whole family moved to Mosang.

119
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,950
Antiques there are very cheap.

120
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,789
Boss,

121
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,430
I'm going to the nearby post office.

122
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,430
Wuzhou.

123
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:36,629
Think about it again.

124
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,110
You went to Mosang

125
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,950
and haven't investigated
the Ma family's descendants.

126
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,909
How did you end up seeing
Qiling's oil painting?

127
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,549
Do you think this is fate?

128
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,110
There aren't so many coincidences
in this world.

129
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,710
Even if he really stayed in Mosang

130
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,789
for a long time,

131
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,549
how could it be so coincidental
that someone drew him?

132
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,830
The Ma family is just a bait.

133
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,470
So, according to you,

134
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,149
I've been set up.

135
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,830
They intentionally used this painting

136
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,190
to keep me here.

137
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,590
You thought the matter was settled.

138
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:05,950
If it were the old you,

139
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,909
in your little mind,

140
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,350
you wouldn't have missed this.

141
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,190
Naive, you've fallen into their trap.

142
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,990
Congratulations,

143
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,950
You've successfully upgraded
to the quadratic of naivety.

144
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,869
Can you stop being so irritating?

145
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,869
What should I do now?

146
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,470
Should I leave immediately?

147
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,990
Definitely not.

148
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,430
You're already trapped.

149
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,149
Their plan is ongoing

150
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,389
and it's stable, you're safe now.

151
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,830
But if you act like

152
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,230
you've uncovered their plan,

153
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,909
they will definitely use a second plan

154
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:30,869
to keep you there,

155
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,909
and then you won't be as free anymore.

156
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,990
You just stay calm

157
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,230
and send me your location.

158
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,310
I'll get there as quickly as I can.

159
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,710
Are you leaving the mountain?

160
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,909
You're on another level of naivety now.

161
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,110
Before you get found out,

162
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,710
I need to come rescue you.

163
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,830
Besides, this matter also concerns me.

164
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:50,909
If you're out,

165
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,549
I might be next.

166
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,350
Hotel Taifuli, I'll wait for you.

167
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,470
But I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

168
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,029
I'll investigate myself

169
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,269
to see if I've really been played.

170
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,269
Hotel Taifuli, remember.

171
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:29,310
Hello.

172
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,509
What are you doing here?

173
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,830
I'm here to pay.

174
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:37,389
Pay for what?

175
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,869
I was supposed to send
something last time

176
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,149
but didn't bring enough money,

177
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,509
so I'm specifically bringing it today.

178
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,350
The receipt should be at the counter.

179
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:46,590
Receipt?

180
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,710
I didn't see any receipt.

181
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,789
It wasn't you last time.

182
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,029
It was another colleague.

183
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,230
Another one?

184
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,549
A woman?

185
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:55,950
Yes, it was a woman.

186
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:56,950
Could you please check

187
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,350
for that receipt?

188
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,470
Alright.

189
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,310
Thank you.

190
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,789
You can keep it first,

191
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,509
I'll go look for the receipt.

192
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,789
Okay, thank you.

193
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,950
(The nails are heavily oxidized,)

194
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,389
(they are old nails.)

195
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:28,909
(This painting should have been)

196
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,310
(hanging for a long time.)

197
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:32,990
(Am I wrong?)

198
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,990
(This painting was put up recently.)

199
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,190
Fatty,

200
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,789
I was indeed played.

201
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,830
Qiling's painting was too small.

202
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,230
To make me notice it,

203
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,950
they had to make it look conspicuous.

204
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,230
So, next to it,

205
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,710
there had to be a large item
that is different

206
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,230
while unobtrusive.

207
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,509
That's why they hung up
a large ink wash painting

208
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,509
to highlight Qiling's painting.

209
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,269
So what are you going to do now?

210
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,909
(First of all,)

211
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,909
(I need to isolate myself.)

212
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,029
(The ones plotting against me,)

213
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,749
(could be anyone around me.)

214
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,430
(I must make sure)

215
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,230
(whether someone is following me)

216
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,869
(and identify who they are.)

217
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,869
(Not finding clear signs
of being followed,)

218
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:43,909
(doesn't mean much.)

219
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,590
(Mosang is a place
that's hard to get in and out of.)

220
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,629
(If they want to control me,)

221
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,629
(they only need to station people )

222
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:51,950
(at a few intersections to keep watch.)

223
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,029
(Since I'm under their surveillance,)

224
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,590
(I need to start confusing them,)

225
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,230
(so they don't know what I'm planning.)

226
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,830
(These people are experts.)

227
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,310
(They have excellent
physical condition,)

228
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,830
(not just ordinary hikers.)

229
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:34,990
Chocolate bar

230
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:36,950
and a pack of instant noodles?

231
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,070
You're not used to

232
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,190
the food here?

233
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,549
Take this.

234
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,110
It's good for your appetite.

235
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,869
It's really just chocolate bar.

236
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,950
It's safe, not poisoned.

237
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,230
Is this your first time here?

238
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,069
How is

239
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,630
the altitude sickness?

240
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,870
I'm Wu Xie. What should I call you?

241
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,950
How about

242
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,109
we exchange phone numbers

243
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,230
and add as friend.

244
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,069
In case something happens,

245
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,309
it will be easier
to look out for each other.

246
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,309
Go away.

247
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,109
Alright.

248
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:30,509
Want to exchange contact?

249
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,870
Naive, what are you thinking?

250
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,870
Is this how you plan to lure them out?

251
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,309
This is a method I've developed

252
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,269
over the years in business.

253
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:58,870
I don't like conflict,

254
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,509
doesn't mean I'm not good at it.

255
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:03,109
The best way to make your
opponent reveal themselves

256
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,829
is to throw countless moves
at them at once.

257
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,789
Since they're monitoring me,

258
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,390
anything I do that's suspicious

259
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,390
will attract their interest.

260
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:21,269
(For example,)

261
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,029
(I suddenly hit on a woman.)

262
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,349
(For example,)

263
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,710
(I stay alone at the guesthouse)

264
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:30,589
(after coming down the mountain.)

265
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,069
(For example, I hide something)

266
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,509
(at the spiritual retreat.)

267
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,309
(They'll have to check one by one.)

268
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,589
(As long as I set up traps in advance,)

269
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,349
(they will eventually reveal flaws.)

270
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,870
(The watchers)

271
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,549
(are the most tired
and prone to mistakes)

272
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,589
(in the early morning hours.)

273
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,829
(So tonight,)

274
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,109
(I need to get a good night's sleep.)

275
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,430
(Someone moved it.)

276
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,470
(30, 37, 31)

277
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,029
(36)

278
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,710
(The sequence has changed.)

279
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:30,230
(As expected.)

280
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:12,509
Come.

281
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,910
Alright, thank you.

282
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,950
I've been staying here for a few days

283
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,630
and haven't helped with any work.

284
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,470
I'll clean up these dishes today.

285
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,710
Thank you, my guest.

286
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,190
So it's you.

287
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,420
(Green Home)

288
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,410
(Green Home)

289
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,880
(Trainers)

290
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,589
(Why does everyone
have the surname Zhang?)

291
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,029
(Could they be Qilingr's relatives?)

292
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,150
(Why would his relatives
be watching me?)

293
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,349
What's going on?

294
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,390
Went missing at a time like this?

295
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:22,630
Little sister, go ahead boldly.

296
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,470
Don't look back.

297
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,109
It's big like the sky.

298
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,630
Lady Boss.

299
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,269
Lady Boss.

300
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,269
Can you get me two pots of hot water?

301
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:44,470
I need to take a bath.

302
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,390
Coming right up.

303
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,710
Is the food here unsanitary?

304
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,910
I get diarrhea every morning at seven.

305
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,589
Every morning at seven,

306
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,549
I get diarrhea.

307
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:59,789
Impossible. There's no problem.

308
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,710
Everything is clean.

309
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,109
Maybe you're just

310
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,589
not used to our food.

311
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,950
I'll leave it here.

312
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,950
Seven o'clock.

313
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:14,990
Fatty,

314
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,749
why are you here so soon?

315
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,150
Was anyone following you?

316
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,509
Nope.

317
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:24,950
Naive, I tell you,

318
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:26,829
this is a trap.

319
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:27,749
You need to be extra careful.

320
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:28,589
I know.

321
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:30,029
I've found out that

322
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,269
they are all Qiling's relatives.

323
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,549
(Rraining Director
of Green Home Outdoor Sports)

324
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,950
I'm telling you, it's not that simple.

325
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,910
From what I know, there's also a group
of foreigners involved.

326
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,829
Foreigners?

327
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,309
The Zhang family is
collaborating with these foreigners

328
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,829
to set me up.

329
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:02,630
No.

330
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:04,549
That doesn't fit their style.

331
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,470
Fatty,

332
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:06,789
what's really going on?

333
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:07,910
When did you arrive?

334
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,630
Let me tell you, three weeks ago,

335
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,749
Gui's phone was being monitored.

336
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:13,349
Fatty,

337
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:14,749
how are you doing lately?

338
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,069
I've gained weight again.

339
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,789
Miss me?

340
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm doing just fine here.

341
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,230
The vegetables are homegrown,

342
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,549
and I catch the fish all by myself.

343
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,309
Jealous? They're all natural.

344
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:31,990
Fatty,

345
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,309
what's wrong?

346
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,549
Nothing.

347
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,309
Is the signal bad on your end?

348
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,029
I suddenly realized that

349
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:44,870
I'm quite suited for

350
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,630
this kind of ordinary lifestyle.

351
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,950
If you have time,

352
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,950
why not come over and enjoy it with me?

353
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:55,150
Then I went around the village,

354
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:57,829
and didn't find anyone watching me.

355
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,990
So, I guess the purpose

356
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,069
of the monitoring isn't to target me,

357
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,190
but you.

358
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:07,309
So I set up a trap as well.

359
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,589
I had Gui

360
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,910
listen in on the phone at home.

361
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,150
If you called me and he didn't answer,

362
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,390
he would call me immediately.

363
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,789
Then he would put his phone

364
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,269
and landline on speaker.

365
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,109
This would create the illusion

366
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,430
that I'm still at Gui's place.

367
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:22,950
You and the eavesdropper

368
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,749
would think I'm still there,

369
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,870
but in reality, I've arrived here
a long time ago.

370
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,829
I can't meet you directly,

371
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,430
I can only

372
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,029
follow you in secret.

373
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,509
I found out

374
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,710
that someone is indeed following you,

375
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,749
and they're following you very closely.

376
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,029
Just like the mantis catches the cicada,

377
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,470
the oriole waits in the wings too.

378
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,710
I haven't discovered who they are,

379
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:19,029
but I have to stay hidden

380
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,309
and not expose myself.

381
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,190
One of us is out in the open,
the other in the dark.

382
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,430
It's easier to handle this way.

383
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:27,430
Do you understand?

384
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:28,910
It seems this matter

385
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:31,269
is more complicated than I imagined.

386
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,630
I'm getting a handle on it.

387
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:33,789
I'll soon find out

388
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,150
the identities of these foreigners.

389
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,230
We need to keep in touch.

390
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,509
Until the time comes,

391
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,950
you need to act convincingly.

392
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,870
You mustn't let them realize

393
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,150
that we know

394
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,470
they're watching us.

395
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,309
What do you think they're after?

396
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,150
I don't know.

397
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,990
But don't worry,

398
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,749
I'm sure they're not trying to kill you.

399
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,390
Otherwise you'd be dead already.

400
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,190
Although you're safe now,

401
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,029
they could make a move anytime.

402
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:58,029
We have to react accordingly.

403
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,150
Take this cigarette case.

404
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,549
Inside is a baby monitor.

405
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:06,749
Remember to

406
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:08,190
keep it with you at all times.

407
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,829
That way, if there's any information,

408
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,150
I'll know about it in real-time.

409
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,029
Alright, I'll leave now.

410
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,710
Are you waiting for a slot?

411
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,749
No, no.

412
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,749
Mr. Wu,

413
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,990
Mr. Yu Da asks you to go up
the mountain immediately.

414
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,789
What's going on?

415
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,029
What happened back then
is happening again.

416
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,829
A person has appeared
from the snow-capped mountain.

417
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,549
Mr. Yu Da,

418
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,349
you were looking for me?

419
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:08,630
Hello.

420
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,870
Hello.

421
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,109
Who are you?

422
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,190
I'm Wu Xie.

423
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,589
Who are you?

424
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,069
This gentleman suddenly appeared

425
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,710
at the door this afternoon,

426
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:34,230
just like Zhang Qiling

427
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,269
did back then.

428
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,789
He looks exactly like you.

429
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,349
I thought you were joking.

430
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:46,870
I've guessed a hundred possibilities,

431
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,430
but never this one.

432
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,470
You came from the snowy mountain?

433
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,430
What's your name?

434
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,390
What do you want?

435
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,789
I told you, I'm Wu Xie.

436
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,390
I see.

437
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,190
You're a monster that
practiced in the mountain,

438
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,630
you've transformed into me
with your magic.

439
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,349
Back off. Back off.

440
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,549
Don't be so childish.

441
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,990
Buddy, I don't care who you are.

442
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,349
Stop lingering here.

443
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,630
I don't mind you impersonating me,

444
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:37,829
but I advise

445
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,549
you to leave

446
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:40,630
while you still can.

447
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,549
Otherwise,

448
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,829
you'll get caught up

449
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,230
in a great mystery.

450
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,150
Don't try to fool me.

451
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,630
I have nothing to worry about.

452
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,829
My presence here

453
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,549
is just a coincidence.

454
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,430
If you didn't come here on your own,

455
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,230
then how did you get here?

456
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,349
None of your business.

457
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,470
Buddy, you might not be
aware of the situation.

458
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,390
If you didn't come here on your own,

459
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,309
we're both in serious trouble.

460
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,270
Mr. Yu Da,

461
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,990
are there any other exits

462
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,310
from this room?

463
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,750
I mean,

464
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,270
that is the only door in this room.

465
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,709
Why are you pretending to be me?
Who are you?

466
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,350
You stay away from me.

467
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:36,470
As expected,

468
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,149
you fell for the trap.

469
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,790
We look the same,

470
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,270
can't you think straight?

471
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,629
What's the point of you having a brain?

472
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:44,950
Why did you

473
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,830
come here uninvited?

474
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,990
Mr. Yu Da, don't worry.

475
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,430
We're just looking for someone.

476
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,390
Both of you,

477
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,149
no need to use any tricks.

478
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:56,790
With your skills,

479
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,950
it's impossible to leave this room.

480
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:01,270
It's been hard

481
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:03,790
to get both of you in one place.

482
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,709
So some of our questions

483
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,390
seems to be able to unravel now.

484
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:09,029
May I ask who you are

485
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,870
and why you set up such a trap for us?

486
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,950
Before confirming if you are reliable,

487
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,310
I, like you,

488
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,310
won't reveal any information.

489
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,390
You seem to know me well,

490
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,470
but you're too confident in yourself.

491
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:26,910
Don't.

492
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,990
Step aside.

493
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,350
Otherwise,

494
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,509
you won't get what you want.

495
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:39,029
Thank you.

496
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,870
Just don't shoot me
with my own slingshot.

497
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,350
I'm just trying to scare you.

498
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,950
Uncle,

499
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,750
this guy must be real.

500
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,950
Not necessarily.

501
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:00,830
It's a tradition in Wu Laogou's family

502
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,350
to play dumb while hiding
their true strength.

503
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,830
They seem to get
along well with everyone,

504
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,990
but no one can guess

505
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:07,310
what's on their mind.

506
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,870
I know I'm Wu Xie.

507
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,990
Mr. Yu Da,

508
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,709
you can verify it.

509
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:18,470
Fine.

510
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,950
I don't know

511
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,229
what my ancestors

512
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,870
look like in your eyes.

513
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,109
I'm just a useless piece of work, okay?

514
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,069
But Mr. Zhang Robert,

515
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,709
You went to great lengths

516
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:29,709
to involve a worthless pawn

517
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:30,910
in such a big scheme.

518
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,310
What exactly do you want?

519
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,750
How do you know my name?

520
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,830
What I know

521
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:44,790
goes far beyond this.

522
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,709
All Mr. Zhang

523
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:47,990
and Ms. Zhang,

524
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,310
Could you please put down these weapons?

525
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:52,790
Let's be calm

526
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,390
and help me deal with this imposter.

527
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,950
Then, let's sit down for some tea

528
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:57,390
and talk things over.

529
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:58,430
Is that okay?

530
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:01,229
What exactly are you here for?

531
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,149
Mr. Yu Da,

532
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:04,589
don't be worry.

533
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,709
It's just a misunderstanding.

534
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,790
This...

535
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,310
Take it easy.

536
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,189
It hurts.

537
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:10,830
Gently...

538
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,589
Gently...

539
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,750
It's broken.

540
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:28,870
Take it easy.

541
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,390
Gently, gently...

542
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,750
Gently, okay?

543
00:37:35,229 --> 00:37:36,509
You're copying me now?

544
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:37,589
Who's copying you,

545
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,629
you idiot?

546
00:37:39,629 --> 00:37:40,910
If you hadn't pretended to be me,

547
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:42,189
would they have caught us here?

548
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:43,109
Who's pretending to be you?

549
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,470
Stop arguing or
I'll hit you somewhere else.

550
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,029
Why are you hitting me alone?

551
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,589
You two look the same,
I can't tell the difference.

552
00:37:55,629 --> 00:37:57,069
I ate your chocolate bar,

553
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,870
so I'm returning the favor.

554
00:37:59,029 --> 00:37:59,910
Keep arguing

555
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:01,229
and I'll beat you both up.

556
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,790
One of you

557
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,470
is an imposter.

558
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,109
This person

559
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,029
must have used very
sophisticated technology

560
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,029
to create a special human skin mask.

561
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:29,750
But since he's been wearing the mask

562
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,109
for over 20 years,

563
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,189
the mask

564
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,189
and his face

565
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:34,750
have completely merged.

566
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,750
This person wanted to erase all traces,

567
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:39,589
so he completed this work

568
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,109
long before the plan was implemented.

569
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,270
We don't have the
professional equipment right now,

570
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,350
so we can't determine by touching.

571
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,310
Without genetic testing

572
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,390
or professional verification,

573
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,430
you two

574
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,069
are almost the same person.

575
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,029
Speak up.

576
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,790
Wait,

577
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,069
so you mean

578
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,310
20 years ago?

579
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,589
How could he know

580
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,430
what I look like now

581
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,790
20 years ago?

582
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,750
Back then, Wu Xie
was already in his teens,

583
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:09,069
so it's possible

584
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,069
to estimate his appearance at that time.

585
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,589
We have a very important information

586
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:14,790
to share with Wu Xie.

587
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,750
I can tell you clearly that

588
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:18,270
the fake one

589
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,750
will be eliminated.

590
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:20,790
So,

591
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:22,509
you must do everything in your power

592
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:23,910
to prove you're the real one.

593
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,709
Wait a minute.

594
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,950
You don't know me

595
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,149
well enough.

596
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:28,709
Why should you judge

597
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:29,870
who the real Wu Xie is?

598
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:32,549
You'll understand my method

599
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,229
once you've tried it.

600
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:36,470
Don't be afraid.

601
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,790
If you're the real one,

602
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,549
then you'll be fine.

603
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,470
The seven heads in the box

604
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,270
are those who previously
impersonated Wu Xie

605
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,390
and were exposed by us.

606
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:48,910
Your test

607
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:50,709
is to carefully examine these heads

608
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,270
and point out which one most
resembles yourself.

609
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:55,629
You only have five minutes.

610
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,189
What kind of ridiculous test is this?

611
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,509
This is very subjective.

612
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,709
How can you measure it so precisely?

613
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:28,629
Four minutes.

614
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:30,310
If you don't make a choice

615
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,750
by the deadline,

616
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,509
I'll consider it a forfeit.

617
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:34,509
Then,

618
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,149
you'll become the eighth

619
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:37,629
and ninth heads.

620
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,430
Then he is the fake one.

621
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,229
There's no need to test.

622
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:42,709
How could anyone see their own head

623
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:43,830
and not feel any fear at all?

624
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,910
He's the fake one.

625
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:46,270
You're the fake one.

626
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,470
Look at how you acted just now.

627
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:49,709
He's the fake one.

628
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:53,430
Three minutes.

629
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:56,910
Hey, buddy.

630
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:57,990
Buddy.

631
00:40:58,149 --> 00:40:58,790
Buddy.

632
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,549
No.

633
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,750
Buddy, you don't have to choose, okay?

634
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,109
Buddy, look at me.

635
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,149
Listen to me.

636
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:04,750
Neither of us should make a choice.

637
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,069
We don't need to make a choice.

638
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,149
If we don't choose,

639
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:08,069
there's nothing they can do.

640
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:09,709
They can't kill both of us.

641
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,310
Do you understand?

642
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,750
If you can't tell the difference,

643
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,830
I'm going to cut the tendons
in your arms and legs.

644
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,430
I'll lock you in a room until you die.

645
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,509
Buddy.

646
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:21,029
Look at me!

647
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,109
If they are truly from the Zhang family,

648
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,149
they are really capable of doing that.

649
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:26,069
Two minutes.

650
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,310
Hurry up and choose.

651
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:31,830
No,

652
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,750
no, you really can't do this.

653
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:36,910
It's likely because of

654
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,310
Wu Xie's personality flaw,

655
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,870
so in extreme panic,

656
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,149
he might make a wrong choice.

657
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:41,910
If that happens,

658
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,549
the real Wu Xie

659
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:43,709
might be mistakenly killed.

660
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,950
You can't do this.

661
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,990
We don't care.

662
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,270
We're 100% confident

663
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,189
in our method.

664
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,029
But Wu Xie is not.

665
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,310
I've made my choice.

666
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,029
Give me paper and a pen,
I'll write it down.

667
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:56,270
But don't let him see it.

668
00:41:56,549 --> 00:41:58,109
Let's go, I'll write it down.

669
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,709
One minute.

670
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,790
Five.

671
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:24,069
Four.

672
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,430
Don't count so fast.

673
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,950
Three.

674
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,830
Two.

675
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,709
One.

676
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:33,589
This one, it's this one.

677
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:49,549
What's going on?

678
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,750
What are you doing?

679
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:53,390
What's going on?

680
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:54,549
Aren't we done?

681
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:55,910
You're all happy with me.

682
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:57,589
Why are you holding me down?

683
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,870
What...

684
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,390
Don't be scared.

685
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:05,709
Don't move.

686
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,709
I'll start cutting slowly

687
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,629
from the spinal cord.

688
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,509
You won't feel any pain.

689
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,029
No, no,

690
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,350
can we discuss this again?

691
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,750
I was

692
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,149
nervous earlier.

693
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,709
I might have chosen wrong.

694
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:22,629
Can you give me another chance?

695
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:24,990
