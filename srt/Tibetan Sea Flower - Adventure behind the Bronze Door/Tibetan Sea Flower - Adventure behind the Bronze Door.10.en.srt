=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 10=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,359
The Zhang family

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,300
are born with supernatural powers.

6
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,389
You easily

7
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,839
brought us down the mountain.

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,330
Easily brought?

9
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,810
They threw us down the mountain.

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,890
Don't you know I'm afraid of heights?

11
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,149
Wu Xie, you're quite clever.

12
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,420
You got the hang of it
the first time you used it.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,220
Aren't you afraid
something might go wrong?

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,780
I made preparations in advance
before using it.

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,559
Before the meeting,

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,269
I told the Denaxi people the story

17
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,380
of how everyone
in the spiritual retreat disappeared.

18
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,740
When I handed out the forms to them,

19
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,900
I lightly flicked the powder.

20
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,250
At the same time, I held my breath
to ensure that I don't inhale.

21
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,380
I remember what you told me before.

22
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,319
The duration of the hallucination

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,340
is proportional
to the amount of powder used,

24
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,460
so I flicked it lightly.

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,789
They should wake up soon,

26
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,250
and their lives won't be in danger.

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,840
(Personality Type Assessment Form PTI.
Name: Feng)

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,389
The Zhang family's bell helps.

29
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,740
What do you think, Sir?

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,079
A bonus point to them.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,010
Okay.

32
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,380
The mobile navigation is weak
and signal is poor.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,479
I have a map.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,460
No need.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,380
Wo, set the navigation to Dejia.

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,220
I've set the best route
to Dejia for you.

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,159
We're going to a place with
an altitude of more than 4,000 meters.

38
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,290
If you have any chronic diseases,
please tell me now.

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,250
We're in good health.

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,010
We don't have any senile diseases.

41
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,130
Our top priority now

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,500
is how to get Feng's key.

43
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,940
Haixing.

44
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,810
Did you find Feng's key?

45
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,919
I didn't have much time.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,949
I took advantage of the chaos
to fumble around.

47
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,250
I didn't find the key.

48
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,359
They were also negligent

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,780
that we had a chance.

50
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,389
They will be
more cautious in the future.

51
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,010
We can't use the bell anymore.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,479
Feng's advantage

53
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,010
is that he has plenty of money,

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,290
manpower, and equipment,

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,530
but their disadvantages
are also obvious.

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,789
They're not as smart as they look,

57
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,620
and they did not seem united.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,290
You're...

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,359
strong.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,940
This is your advantage.

61
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,639
You disadvantage

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,709
is that your funding,
manpower, and equipment

63
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,130
are no match for Feng's.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,500
Besides,

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,890
you're quite impulsive sometimes.

66
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,509
What do you mean?

67
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,509
What he's saying is you're dumb.

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,420
Right?

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,010
No.

70
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,709
Well...

71
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,239
I meant

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,559
acting rashly
has little chance of success.

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
We can't attack by force.

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,740
We have to outsmart them.

75
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,890
So they're not smart enough.

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,300
If you need help,

77
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,010
I can go back to Zhang Residence

78
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,679
and quickly

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,500
find you a group of experts.

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,799
Funding

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
isn't a problem for us,

82
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,380
so your analysis is unfair.

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,709
I'm analyzing what I saw.

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,620
External information doesn't help.

85
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,500
I have a better solution.

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,540
Go on.

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,420
I'll tell you when the time's right.

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,029
You have no solution, do you?

89
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,940
You tricked us into getting in the car.

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,770
But thank you

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
for choosing us.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,540
Choosing a more secure partner

93
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,810
will help us live longer.

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,010
You don't need to thank us.

95
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,980
How many meters is it now?

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,810
Over 4,000.

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,380
Don't force yourself.

98
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,469
You're so nice to me

99
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,180
that I'll become mindless
sooner or later.

100
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,799
Take a good rest after drinking it.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,210
I'll look at the scroll first.

102
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,100
No need to open the window.
I feel much more comfortable now.

103
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,320
(Zhang Family Ancient Residence)

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,810
We're finally back in Zhang Residence.

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,349
Haike.

106
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,210
Is today a special day?

107
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,420
I don't know.

108
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,100
Is someone getting married?

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,709
It must be
because we retrieved Heavenly Staff.

110
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,940
The patriarch wants to celebrate.

111
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,690
We're going to be rich.

112
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,330
Zhang Xuan.

113
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,010
Mr. Dong.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,890
Come with me.

115
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,620
What's the meaning of this?

116
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,420
Why did he only ask for the punk?

117
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,829
What does it mean?

118
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,349
He's the one who found Heavenly Staff.

119
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,650
Hurry. We found Heavenly Staff together.

120
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,650
This path leads to
the Zhang family's ancestral hall.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,149
Didn't they say that only seniors

122
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,500
can come in?

123
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,269
Let's just celebrate.

124
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,980
Why did they place a coffin here?

125
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,709
We retrieved Heavenly Staff together.

126
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,250
Why won't you let us in?

127
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,100
He's about to succeed as patriarch.

128
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,650
The acting patriarch
wants to discuss something with him.

129
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,890
Punk is becoming the patriarch?

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,949
I want to be deputy patriarch then.

131
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,919
Move aside.

132
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,199
You get to be an elder at best.

133
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,010
I'll be the deputy patriarch.

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,960
Why? We entered the ancient city together.

135
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,159
We should receive
the rewards and punishments together.

136
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,340
Shut up.

137
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,130
Disperse or die.

138
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,010
(On a snowy night with colorful lights,)

139
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,860
(Qiling)

140
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,500
(walked through the long corridor.)

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,980
(He walked from a prosperous place)

142
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,010
(to a deserted place.)

143
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,220
(The Zhang family might have
once been extremely prosperous,)

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,100
(but as the times changed,)

145
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,890
(the ancient family
has long gone downhill.)

146
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,380
(They're like a dying beast,)

147
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,890
(just waiting for a new scapegoat)

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,410
(to continue its life.)

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,679
(Qiling must have)

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,460
(sensed the danger)

151
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,700
(from the Zhang family's attitude,)

152
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,989
(but he must have)

153
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,250
(a huge doubt that's bothering him.)

154
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,530
(To find the answer to the mystery,)

155
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,319
(he still stepped)

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,340
(into the dark night
filled with danger)

157
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,820
(and entered the core
of the mysterious family)

158
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,469
(that protected secrets so long)

159
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,130
(that has ran through)

160
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,460
(almost all of history.)

161
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,100
You may come in now.

162
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,100
You're back.

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,650
I've found Heavenly Staff.

164
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,500
As agreed,

165
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,100
you have to be the next patriarch

166
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,159
and "Zhang Qiling".

167
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,340
You have to enter
Zhang Family Ancient Tower

168
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,460
to complete
the patriarch succession ceremony

169
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,380
(The Zhang Family's Acting Patriarch)
and set the Zhang family free.

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,580
Free?

171
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,410
This family

172
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,100
is rotten from its roots.

173
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,620
It's only a matter of time
before it falls apart.

174
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,250
Nothing lasts forever.

175
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,930
We're no exception.

176
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,010
I just want to know my origins.

177
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,530
Zhang Family Ancient Tower.

178
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,410
All the answers you want are there.

179
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,620
You'll know everything

180
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,460
after becoming the patriarch.

181
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,740
Once you succeed as patriarch,

182
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,010
you'll first lose
your name and your past.

183
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,980
When the future becomes the past,

184
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,220
you'll continue to forget.

185
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,109
You'll become

186
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,620
someone without a past or a future.

187
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,290
It will take

188
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,650
everything it can.

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,500
What you are left with is rotten.

190
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,010
If you're wavering,

191
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,130
now is your last chance to leave.

192
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll keep my promise.

193
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,220
(Heavenly Staff's return
to the Zhang family)

194
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,519
(means that the Zhang family's)

195
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,010
(peaceful life is broken)

196
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,580
(and bear Tianshou's fate again.)

197
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,469
(The Zhang family)

198
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,620
(has a special disease called Tianshou.)

199
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,279
(Once the disease acts up in adulthood,)

200
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,469
(the Zhang family can't leave)

201
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,439
(the water source here.)

202
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,589
(Only our water)

203
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,980
(can sustain our health.)

204
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,530
(If anyone
doesn't drink the water here,)

205
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,380
(they'll start getting sick)

206
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,460
(and behaving
unpredictably and dangerously.)

207
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,250
(Many people died because of this.)

208
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,820
(The Zhang family
has been living in this fear.)

209
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,159
(No matter how far they go,)

210
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,709
(they always have to
return to Zhang Residence.)

211
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,279
(Or they'll lose their memory.)

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,740
(Later, they'll probably die.)

213
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,170
(But I know a drug)

214
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,410
(that can completely cure the disease.)

215
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,170
(The cure
is in Zhang Family Ancient Tower,)

216
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,989
(but former patriarchs
have been reluctant to provide a cure

217
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,380
(to rule the family.)

218
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,500
(That's why we chose you.)

219
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,740
(Only the patriarch has access to it.)

220
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,949
(As long as you can get into)

221
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,629
(the bottom
of Zhang Family Ancient Tower for us,)

222
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,620
(insert Heavenly Staff
to activate the mechanism,)

223
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,770
(and give us the cure,)

224
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,250
(we'll never fall sick
with Tianshou again)

225
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,700
(and can live an ordinary life.)

226
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,890
Look.

227
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,250
That punk is about
to become the patriarch.

228
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,349
Father.

229
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,410
What is this coffin for?

230
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,930
Don't ask.

231
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,989
We all have to leave after the ceremony.

232
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,220
From now on,

233
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,620
we'll all live a peaceful life.

234
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,340
Where are we going?

235
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,460
(After the mechanism is activated,)

236
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,199
(due to Heavenly Staff's strong energy,)

237
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,250
(you'll immediately become the only one)

238
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,460
(not spared from Tianshou.)

239
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,130
(From then on,)

240
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,890
(you'll suffer)

241
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,460
(Tianshou alone.)

242
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,460
(From that moment on,)

243
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,159
(in the family that has been in decline)

244
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,580
(for thousands of years,)

245
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,170
(he has no choice
but put on that ugly outfit)

246
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,620
(and become the patriarch
of a family containing himself.)

247
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,220
Sir.

248
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,890
What will happen
after he inserts Heavenly Staff?

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,740
Will he really be the only one left?

250
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,380
After he inserts Heavenly Staff,

251
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,740
there's a good chance he'll die.

252
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,820
And this whole thing will be over.

253
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,980
Don't worry.
He won't be in pain for long.

254
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,250
Does he know?

255
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,930
Well...

256
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,100
Are you willing to take his place?

257
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,380
Hey, punk!

258
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,540
Don't drink. You'll die!

259
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,300
Punk!

260
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,450
Don't drink!

261
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,890
Punk!

262
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,450
No!

263
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,130
Punk.

264
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,340
Let me go.

265
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,490
Punk!

266
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,279
Punk!

267
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,890
What are you doing? Don't go there.

268
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,130
Punk.

269
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,380
(He entered
the dark and enclosed coffin)

270
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,490
(and walked
toward an unusually cold cave)

271
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,540
(to meet his unknown fate.)

272
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,300
Lift the coffin!
[*Sounds like "Qiling" in Chinese]

273
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,170
(Insert Heavenly Staff)

274
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,930
(to activate the mechanism,)

275
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,860
(and give us the cure,)

276
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,340
(we'll never fall sick
with Tianshou again)

277
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,690
(and can live an ordinary life.)

278
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,410
(From then on, you'll suffer)

279
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,490
(Tianshou alone.)

280
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,389
Do you think that punk can do it?

281
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,820
I don't know.

282
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,719
Look.

283
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,780
He did it.

284
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,279
He succeeded. We're free.

285
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,360
(Zhang Ancestral Hall)

286
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,799
Look, this is my new pinwheel.

287
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,189
It's pretty.

288
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,389
Let me play your pinwheel.

289
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,869
Just for a while.

290
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,799
He has no parents.

291
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,109
He's all alone.

292
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,669
Why does he keep wearing the hood?

293
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,669
Smile.

294
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,620
Why keep such a straight face?

295
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,279
He has no parents.

296
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,239
He's all alone.

297
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,239
He keeps wearing the hood.

298
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm not playing with him.

299
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,519
He has no parents.

300
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,130
Don't play with him.

301
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,300
Come on.

302
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,559
Why do you keep covering your head?

303
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,380
Am I not presentable?

304
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,300
Give me.

305
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,909
(Young Zhang Haike)

306
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,799
Punk.

307
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,279
If you miss your mother,

308
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,890
blink twice.

309
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,690
If you don't miss her, blink once.

310
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,170
All the answers you want

311
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,060
are in Zhang Family Ancient Tower.

312
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,020
You'll know everything

313
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,100
after becoming the patriarch.

314
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,690
(For the first time,)

315
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,860
(I understood what the past
and memory meant to Qiling.)

316
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,970
(In the indifferent Zhang family,)

317
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,130
(Qiling, who is an orphan,)

318
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,300
(doesn't know where he's from)

319
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,100
(and where he's going.)

320
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,690
(Zhang Qiling)

321
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,930
(isn't even his own name.)

322
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,340
(It's just the title
of the Zhang family's patriarch.)

323
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,389
(Zhang Qiling)
(He wants to know his connection)

324
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,930
(with the world. Even for just a bit.)

325
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,999
(He probably found the answer)

326
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,410
(from Zhang Family Ancient Tower)

327
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,100
(but quickly forgot it due to Tianshou.)

328
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,970
(According
to the description on the scroll,)

329
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,189
(Tianshou's probably)

330
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,860
(a special family disease.)

331
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,719
(When the disease acts up,
people'll be disturbed)

332
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,239
(and they'll lose self-awareness,)

333
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,820
(resulting in some unpredictable behavior.)

334
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,959
(The Zhang family doesn't understand
how the disease works)

335
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,759
(and thought it was god's instructions,)

336
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,020
(so they called it Tianshou.)

337
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,719
(Qiling's memory has begun to blur)

338
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,650
(when describing the experience.)

339
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,239
(He mentions
two kinds of poisonous bugs.)

340
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,039
(Tianshou seems)

341
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,970
(related to parasitic poisoning.)

342
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,130
(The recording then stopped.)

343
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,860
(But it doesn't matter.)

344
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,589
(Whatever happens,)

345
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,629
(even if Qiling forgot,)

346
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,540
(I can find it and record it.)

347
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,860
(If Fatty and I remember it,)

348
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,260
(he'll never forget again.)

349
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,970
Where are we going?

350
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,020
We have a base in Dejia.

351
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,620
Let's rest there first.

352
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,020
Wowo.

353
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,860
How far

354
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,999
is Dejia City?

355
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,589
Your location

356
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,450
is about 30 kilometers away
from the city.

357
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,210
Normally,

358
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,490
there's nothing wrong with passing by home
and going back home.

359
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,820
But it's not like you.

360
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,559
If Luku Day

361
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,450
is coming,

362
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,780
getting the key is a top priority.

363
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,759
With you in such a hurry to go home,

364
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,060
there's only one possibility.

365
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,130
The Zhang family has a clue to this key

366
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,340
inside the base.

367
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,079
It's a man named Wang Jinyuan.

368
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,340
Only he knows where the key is.

369
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,860
He's at the base.

370
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,340
Who's Wang Jinyuan?

371
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,020
Why would he know?

372
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,669
Did Qiling leave the information with him?

373
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,410
Why didn't he leave it
to the Zhang family?

374
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,890
I realize you like
to doubt the Zhang family.

375
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,170
We doubt everything but Zhang Qiling.

376
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,540
Wang Jinyuan is also a practitioner.

377
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,130
He belongs to
the Zhang family's special organization.

378
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,429
This organization

379
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,340
consists of several practitioners.

380
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,130
Yu Da, whom you met before,

381
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,690
is also one of them.

382
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,239
They're responsible for recording

383
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,580
and preserving the patriarch's memories
from different periods,

384
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,300
in case the patriarch
forgets some important information

385
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,340
after losing his memory.

386
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,820
The one responsible

387
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,519
for keeping the keepsakes and memories

388
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,180
is Wang Jinyuan,

389
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,669
but he's stubborn.

390
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,709
Without seeing the patriarch,

391
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,740
he won't tell us anything.

392
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,530
All we can do is treat him well.

393
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,660
How old is he now?

394
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,519
He's very old,

395
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,610
so we have to hurry up.

396
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,780
Stop.

397
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,090
Don't run.

398
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,490
Do you know how to drive?

399
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,450
The car stopped by itself.

400
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,959
This is so chaotic.

401
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,309
It's dangerous here.

402
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,860
Be careful when you go out.

403
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,090
Are we here?

404
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,090
This is the Zhang family's base.

405
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,709
It looks like a guesthouse.

406
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,789
It's ordinary.

407
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,090
Time to unload the luggage.

408
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,140
It's kind of enviable

409
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,300
that you guys live in a place like this.

410
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,490
I can reserve a room for you.

411
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,860
It turns out that so many members
of the Zhang family live here.

412
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,399
Over the years,

413
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,180
the Zhang family has been set free

414
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,930
and scattered around the world.

415
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,820
But sadly,

416
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,669
some of the Zhang family members
don't know how to live a normal life

417
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,340
after leaving Zhang Residence.

418
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,090
Later,

419
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,180
they slowly gathered together

420
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,519
and returned here.

421
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,780
They think

422
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,559
the Zhang family will live better

423
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,260
if they get together.

424
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,010
Have they never seen handsome men?

425
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,180
They look at us like we're aliens.

426
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,890
No outsiders
have been here for a long time.

427
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,570
Besides members of the Zhang family,
ordinary people can't get in.

428
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,709
People are busy working.
Men and women dress like outsiders.

429
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,700
Elderly people and children
are comfortable and enjoying themselves.

430
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,820
This must be little Qiling.

431
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,180
Haixing.

432
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,879
Take them to put their luggage away

433
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,879
and have something to eat.

434
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,930
I'll inform the person in charge.

435
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,570
Who are you?

436
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,820
Who are you?

437
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,519
Why are you dressed like that?

438
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,010
What does it have to do with you?

439
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,970
Boy.

440
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,269
You're violating someone's image rights.

441
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,149
Do you know that? Little Qiling.

442
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,010
Draw the sword.

443
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,570
Xiaoguo.

444
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,010
They're guests.

445
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,740
He has a bad temper.

446
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,589
Why is this child dressed up

447
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,140
as your patriarch?

448
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,789
He's an orphan.

449
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,380
He admires the patriarch.

450
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,660
The Zhang family
likes to keep a straight face.

451
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,930
This isn't good for your health.

452
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,559
I want to learn from Zhang Qiling.

453
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,140
I want to be like him.

454
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,999
But Zhang Qiling doesn't look like
the way you are now.

455
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,220
Nonsense.

456
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,839
The two of us

457
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,820
are Zhang Qiling's best friends.

458
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,340
Trust me.

459
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,919
He's the smiliest person

460
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,180
I've ever met.

461
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,380
Really?

462
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,359
In that case,

463
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,930
you're Wu Xie.

464
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,149
The patriarch chose you
to fight Night King,

465
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,410
so you must be very capable.

466
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,959
I'll take you as my master.

467
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,959
Teach me.

468
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,669
I want to learn everything you know.

469
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,789
Once I learn everything,

470
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,700
I can fight Night King
with the patriarch.

471
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,700
You are the only one
in the Zhang family who's smart.

472
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,450
Your name is Xiaoguo, right?

473
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,879
Yes, my name is Zhang Xiaoguo. Master.

474
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,229
No, don't call me that.

475
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,309
I'm not that capable.

476
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,820
I can't be your master.

477
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,039
I like this kid.

478
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,959
Here, I'll take him.

479
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,970
Get down on your knees.
Kowtow to me and call me Master.

480
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,010
Unwillingness
can't produce desired results.

481
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,090
Master!

482
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,220
No.

483
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,450
Master!

484
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,109
Xiaoguo.

485
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,220
Enough.

486
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,409
We brought you some delicious food.

487
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,720
Go back to your room and wait for me.

488
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,090
Well...

489
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,530
Xiaoguo, how about this?

490
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,229
Go back to your room first.

491
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,959
And I'll

492
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,709
accept you as my apprentice, okay?

493
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,260
Thank you, Master.

494
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,450
You tricked him.

495
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,090
Maybe.

496
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,959
Qiling needed someone
who loved to trick him

497
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,930
when he was little.

498
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,079
Wu Xie was appointed by the patriarch.

499
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,079
For this reason alone,

500
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,450
he isn't an outsider.

501
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,220
Do you

502
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,220
believe that?

503
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,820
Yes.

504
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,789
Not everyone

505
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,530
believes that.

506
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,700
As far as I know,

507
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,530
that person

508
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,090
can't even afford
the electricity bill for his own shop.

509
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,300
Our goal

510
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,789
is to find the key,

511
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,700
take out Heavenly Staff
and defeat Night King.

512
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,930
You already broke the rules

513
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,380
by bringing them back.

514
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,559
Not to mention

515
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,220
that you've offended those foreigners.

516
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,740
That was an accident.

517
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,039
I also don't know

518
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,570
why they have the key.

519
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,450
We need that key.

520
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,919
Wu Xie will help us.

521
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,109
I've tested him.

522
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,660
He isn't an ordinary person.

523
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,490
The patriarch must have his reasons
for choosing him.

524
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,450
I trust the patriarch's choice.

525
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,180
We've tried so many times

526
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,669
and haven't been able to get any clues

527
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,300
from Wang Jinyuan.

528
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,380
Now that Wu Xie is here,

529
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,970
we can try again.

530
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,450
If we fail,

531
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,260
I'll take him away immediately.

532
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,970
Okay.

533
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,610
I'll wait for your good news.

534
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,359
This is the room

535
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,010
the patriarch lived in at the base.

536
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,860
Wang Jinyuan will be here soon.

537
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,610
Wang Jinyuan
is very interested in you after hearing

538
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,340
that you were appointed
by the patriarch.

539
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,820
Have a chat.

540
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,490
Success or failure depends on it.

541
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,450
Okay.

542
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,519
(Before Zhang Qiling
Enters The Bronze Door)

543
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,180
I'm here to say goodbye.

544
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,610
I've thought about it.

545
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,820
You seem to be

546
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,410
my only connection

547
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,700
to this world.

548
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,189
Kid.

549
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,450
Are you filming a movie here?

550
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,490
Hello, Sir.

551
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,669
I'm Wu Xie.

552
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,149
Zhang Qiling asked me

553
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,839
to solve the Night King issue.

554
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,039
I need to find the key

555
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,450
to get Heavenly Staff.

556
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,610
Enough.

557
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,890
I've heard this opening line

558
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,260
a thousand times.

559
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,930
I've also answered this
a thousand times.

560
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,140
If the patriarch doesn't show up,

561
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,780
I won't say anything.

562
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,610
I'm

563
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,970
only keeping the patriarch's memory

564
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,090
and his secrets.

565
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,010
If you want to talk about this,
I'm leaving

566
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,930
because

567
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,610
I still need to take my calcium tablets.

568
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,140
I haven't even taken a walk.
I'm very busy.

569
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,519
Sorry.

570
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,450
I have a lumbar disc herniation.

571
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,970
I have to be careful.

572
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,490
Sit here and don't move.

573
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,229
Let's not

574
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,090
talk about the key, okay?

575
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,970
Since you've

576
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,260
been keeping a secret for the patriarch,

577
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,700
your mission won't be complete

578
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,300
until he returns.

579
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,530
In that case,

580
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,970
he must have

581
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,399
left an indelible mark on your life.

582
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,410
Right?

583
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,570
I...

584
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,260
Don't use that on me.

585
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,300
Forget it.

586
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,340
Let's start the process.

587
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,860
Sit.

588
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,860
Okay, thank you.

589
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,490
I'll ask you three questions.

590
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,970
If

591
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,930
your answer satisfies me,

592
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,109
I'll acknowledge

593
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,410
that you're with the patriarch.
