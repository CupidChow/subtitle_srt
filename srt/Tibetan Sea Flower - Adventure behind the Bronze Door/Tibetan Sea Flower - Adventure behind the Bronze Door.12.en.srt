00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,710
Is this the one from before?

5
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,270
Impossible.

6
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,450
How can the ragdolls move by themselves?

7
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,020
Wu Xie.

8
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,140
We'll check the road ahead.

9
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,500
Wait here.

10
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,580
Be careful.

11
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,130
Sorry.

12
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
It's fine.

13
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,060
Wu Xie.

14
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,060
How was it?

15
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,130
It's safe.

16
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,380
The road ahead is complicated.

17
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,780
Be careful not to get lost.

18
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,660
Let's go.

19
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,250
It was open just now.

20
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,290
Why did you lead us here?

21
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,500
By the looks of it,

22
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,130
this place must have collapsed
a long time ago.

23
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Are you sure this is the path you took?

24
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,850
It's the same road.

25
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,970
I saw it on the way in.

26
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,100
The markings on the brick walls

27
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,290
are the same.

28
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,460
Don't move.

29
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,930
There's someone here.

30
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,410
Was this thing here

31
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,340
when you came in just now?

32
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,140
It wasn't here just now.

33
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,930
I guess it followed you, pretty boy.

34
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,310
It probably got its eye on you.

35
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,460
It should choose Third Master instead.

36
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
What if it's blind?

37
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,700
Enough.

38
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,530
Which one do we choose next?

39
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,220
Listen to me for once.

40
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,970
Let's go.

41
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,780
Let's go.

42
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,610
How did we get back here?

43
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,780
Something's wrong.

44
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,730
Why did the directions
of these statues change?

45
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Are we going around in circles?

46
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm asking you.

47
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,260
Where's your leader?

48
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,930
Come clean.

49
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,410
Are you playing tricks here?

50
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,700
Not really.

51
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,930
Did someone

52
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,290
deliberately move these ragdolls?

53
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,770
Could it be the Niles people
who wandered in here by mistake?

54
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,820
I got it.

55
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,100
This is Kumuli's traditional magic,

56
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,820
Zhamang.

57
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,260
Maybe we activated

58
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,660
some mechanism on this stage,

59
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,100
so it started itself.

60
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,100
They look like

61
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,340
they're scared of this big ragdoll.

62
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,050
We don't have time
to dwell on this now...

63
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,580
We must find a way out immediately.

64
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,100
He said it. Let's just blow it up.

65
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,290
No.

66
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,010
The rock structure here is unstable.

67
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,610
If we rashly blow it up,

68
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,010
the whole place might collapse

69
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,180
and bury us here.

70
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,250
How about we try again?

71
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,130
You choose.

72
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,460
Why don't we take this one?

73
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,770
We haven't taken this one.

74
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,890
Okay.

75
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,010
Fatty.

76
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,610
Mark that exit.

77
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,970
I'm going to
make one more mark this time.

78
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,610
I'll help you out.

79
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,610
We did circle back here.

80
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,470
But the positions of these ragdolls
have changed again.

81
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,650
They really

82
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,340
disappeared.

83
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,540
Come out!

84
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,970
We kept going along this path.

85
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,850
How did we come back here?

86
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,940
All the data are normal.

87
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,420
The magnetic field is fine.

88
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,890
Could it have something to do
with the structure here?

89
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,700
No way.

90
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,460
This passage is straight

91
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,490
and has no turns.

92
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,420
As long as the direction is right,
there's no way we'll circle back here.

93
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,220
Fatty, give me a light.

94
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,130
Give him a light.

95
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,700
The structure here
is a little complicated.

96
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,540
I'm not sure

97
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,970
if I can find the right path.

98
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,340
And these ragdolls

99
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,770
keep moving.

100
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,650
I'm not sure

101
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,970
if it's directly related to
the structure of the building.

102
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,060
Isn't this a real-life maze?

103
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,420
Immerse the audience in the experience.

104
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,130
I didn't expect the Kumuli people
to be

105
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,580
so avant-garde in their magic shows.

106
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,730
Calm down.

107
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,200
The ragdolls are in the passages.

108
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,890
What are they hiding from?

109
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Did you notice

110
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,970
that the big ragdoll that was watching
the glow sticks for you

111
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
is missing?

112
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Is it scared of me?

113
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,750
Why are you looking for it?

114
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,580
We now only have this,

115
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,250
this,

116
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,580
this,

117
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,130
and this one that we haven't entered.

118
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,220
There are four.

119
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,300
I have a bad feeling.

120
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,820
What do you want to do?

121
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,850
Wait here.

122
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,490
Fatty.

123
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,060
Stay here

124
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,700
and watch the ragdolls.

125
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,420
I'll go in first.

126
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,180
I'll go with you.

127
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,940
No.

128
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,850
Call me if they move.

129
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,770
Mastermind little prince.

130
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,340
We ordinary people

131
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,770
don't know what he's thinking.

132
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,700
Let's just wait here.

133
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,060
Guess which exit he'll come out from.

134
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,420
According to my experience,

135
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,060
that big ragdoll is a big trouble.

136
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,370
I'll destroy it when I see it.

137
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,220
Fatty!

138
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,460
Zhang Haike!

139
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,770
Zhang Haixing!

140
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,730
Where are you?

141
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,220
Can you hear me?

142
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,010
Naive!

143
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,300
Naive!

144
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,610
Naive!

145
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,610
Can you hear me?

146
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,370
Fatty!

147
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,010
I can hear you!

148
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,970
I seem to be lost.

149
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,730
Naive!

150
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,340
I heard you!

151
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,940
I thought something happened to you.

152
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,130
You were gone for so long.

153
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm fine, Fatty.

154
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,970
How about this?

155
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,610
Keep talking to me.

156
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,580
Okay.

157
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,970
Fatty.

158
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,370
I found the big ragdoll.

159
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,420
It was chewing a ragdoll's head.

160
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,770
A ragdoll's head? Where?

161
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,460
I feel like it's right next to me!

162
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,370
Naive!

163
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,130
Naive!

164
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,370
Naive!

165
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,020
Naive!

166
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,740
Naive!

167
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,500
Fatty!

168
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,650
I think someone's playing a prank.

169
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,500
I can't hear you clearly!

170
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,450
What prank?

171
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,300
Fatty.

172
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,300
I think something's following me.

173
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,370
What did you say?

174
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,210
What's following you?

175
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,060
Naive!

176
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,130
I know who you are.

177
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,450
Don't play these tricks on me.

178
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,170
They're useless to me.

179
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,850
Fatty!

180
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,950
Watch out for the ragdolls!

181
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
There are snakes in them!

182
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,890
Is there a river where you are?

183
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,340
Be careful. Is it deep?

184
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,170
Let's find each other first, okay?

185
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,650
Don't cross the river first.

186
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,370
Naive!

187
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,410
Naive!

188
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,500
Fatty!

189
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,410
Naive!

190
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,850
Fatty!

191
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,850
Naive!

192
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,740
I can't hear your voice anymore!

193
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,650
Listen to me, Fatty.

194
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,020
The sound here is messy.

195
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,690
If we move together,

196
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,100
neither of us can find the other!

197
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,300
Are you coming to find me?

198
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,740
I'll just stand here and not move.

199
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,410
Yes!

200
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,130
Don't move!

201
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,610
You think
I'm where the sound comes from.

202
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,130
Not really.

203
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,260
Sound refracts specially here,

204
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,130
similar to a sound transmission wall.

205
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
You can't find me
by following the sound.

206
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,690
Just stop where you are

207
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,650
and keep talking.

208
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,020
I'll find you!

209
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,650
Listen here!

210
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,780
Fatty.

211
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,410
Wuzhou's Prince Fatty.

212
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,930
Zhuge Fatty Dragon. Captain Mojin.

213
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,020
Booming Handsome Boy.

214
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,210
My handle is Fatty.

215
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,130
An Aries born on April 18.

216
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,500
I love roasted whole lamb,
roasted kidneys, and wavy chips.

217
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
I'm fair and fat.

218
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,170
Leopard collar. Manly.

219
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,780
Steamed lamb!

220
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,260
Steamed bear paw!

221
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,260
Braised chicken, preserved meat.

222
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,580
Songhua pig stomach.

223
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,650
Dried sausage.

224
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,060
Red meatballs.

225
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
White meatballs.

226
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,820
Southern fried meatballs.

227
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,980
Sixi balls.

228
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,850
Chibi

229
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,210
Fatty-chan.

230
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,130
Are you okay?

231
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,930
I'm okay.

232
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,850
I was so worried.

233
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,930
Didn't I tell you not to move?

234
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,130
Weren't you gone for a long time?

235
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,020
So I ran out.

236
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,930
Where are those two?

237
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,890
Do you mean Haike and Haixing?

238
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,890
They're waiting at the side.

239
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,060
I don't know if they can go back.

240
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,500
You said there's a river.

241
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,890
What's going on?

242
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,500
Come on.

243
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,340
Meet up with them first.

244
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,780
I'll explain later.

245
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,890
Apparently they got down already.

246
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,650
Our men are taking watch
at the entrance.

247
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,690
But

248
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,650
it's way too easy to chase them.

249
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,980
Do you really think they would let us do that?

250
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,930
It certainly is a trap,

251
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,580
but we have no other choice.

252
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,690
Should we take off immediately?

253
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
Time's up.

254
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,210
Did you say

255
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,690
those ragdolls have snakes in them?

256
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes.

257
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,780
Those ragdolls will change positions

258
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,650
because there are snakes hiding in them.

259
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,270
They control the ragdolls' movements.

260
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,500
We'll have to avoid them then.

261
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,980
Why are there so many snakes?

262
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
I don't know.

263
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,020
Our goal is the key.

264
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,020
Let's find the patriarch's mark

265
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,580
or a way out first.

266
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,020
If you see a ragdoll, avoid it.

267
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,340
A large table lamp.

268
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,650
It looks like a device.

269
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,070
This should be the prop Niles use
to perform traditional magic shows.

270
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,580
It's so dark.

271
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,370
Let me light it up.

272
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,170
Fatty.

273
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,020
Surprise.

274
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,850
Fatty.

275
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,300
It's not just a wall.

276
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,650
It's a big screen.

277
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,820
Once this prop is activated,

278
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,450
a shadow play starts.

279
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,980
I guess
this is also one of their performances.

280
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,130
This shadow play

281
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,410
tells the story of Kumuli and snakes.

282
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,370
The Kumuli people raise a lot of snakes.

283
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,020
They contributed
these snakes to the king.

284
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,370
The king used snakes

285
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,100
in many traditional magic shows.

286
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,210
In this way,

287
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,020
snakes are also a prop for magic shows.

288
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,410
But it wasn't long
before these snakes became a disaster.

289
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,170
Kumuli

290
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,340
was thus plunged into a great disaster.

291
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,370
So Kumuli

292
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,610
perished due to a snake disaster.

293
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,370
Are these snakes

294
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,740
the so-called curse?

295
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,130
Look.

296
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,850
What's with the snake disaster
back then?

297
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,980
I don't know. It's not mentioned here.

298
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,690
But these snakes and ragdolls

299
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,650
are probably one of Kumuli magic shows.

300
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,870
They have nothing to do with the key.

301
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,890
Let's keep going.

302
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,930
Let's go.

303
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,450
Be careful, everyone.

304
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,100
The ragdolls ahead might have snakes.

305
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,210
Did you come up with a solution?

306
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,980
I'm still thinking.

307
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,370
We carry so much professional equipment.

308
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,890
Wu Xie's group only has four bags.

309
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,410
What I know about Kumuli.

310
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,100
They should be dead by now.

311
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,610
We came here

312
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,610
most likely just to get their bodies.

313
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,850
Trust me.

314
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,740
Wu Xie is going to find a way
to solve the equation.

315
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,410
Maybe a ridiculous one,

316
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,780
but he's going to make it.

317
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,740
Naive, I can't believe you.

318
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,740
If you have any shame,

319
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,850
you won't think of such a way.

320
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,650
Cut the crap.

321
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,060
All that matters is that it works.

322
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,370
It should be all right here.

323
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,610
It's suffocating me.

324
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,780
There are no ragdolls here.

325
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,580
We can take a break here.

326
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,540
Don't take it off.

327
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,370
What if they catch up with us later?

328
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,100
Here, let me spray some on you.

329
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,890
Snakes have poor eyesight

330
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,450
and rely on smell to find people.

331
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,370
We can spray some of this
to confuse them.

332
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,930
Let me summarize everyone's ideas.

333
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,210
Could this maze

334
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,850
be a large magic device?

335
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,500
Just like many of the magic props
we've seen earlier.

336
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,060
When we enter this maze,

337
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,100
we're already trapped

338
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,130
in a looping magic show

339
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,500
designed by Kumuli's king.

340
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,540
Amazing.

341
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,820
This is immersive magic experience.

342
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,410
Zhang Haike, you summed it up well.

343
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,340
Then we have to find a way
to crack this magic to get out.

344
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,170
How shall we crack it?

345
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,300
Smash it.

346
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,690
I know how to crack it.

347
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,690
100.

348
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,260
Did you figure it out?

349
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,130
The walls in these passages

350
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,540
look ordinary,

351
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,890
but they're arranged and combined.

352
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,820
It eventually

353
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,610
forms a special lotus structure
like this.

354
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,450
Every wall here

355
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,740
is actually the petals of this lotus.

356
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,850
The lotus petals

357
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,210
are all nested together,

358
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,340
forming a looping fractal.

359
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,370
That's why it's hard to find a way out
once you walk in.

360
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,650
The material of this wall is special.

361
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,450
It's like an echo wall.

362
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,300
That's why

363
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,740
you kept calling me,

364
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,060
but I couldn't find you.

365
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,260
Naive!

366
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,210
Fatty!

367
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,820
Steamed lamb.

368
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,100
Steamed bear paw, steamed deer.

369
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,850
Snakes can't hear.

370
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,060
Have some common sense, please.

371
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,500
It's difficult for us to determine
where the real sound source is.

372
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,070
It's possible that we'll
get further away from the sound source.

373
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,020
So where do we go now?

374
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,780
These walls are actually curved.

375
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,930
It's just that it's spacious
and the passage is long enough,

376
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,170
so we thought

377
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,690
we were walking in a straight line.

378
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,100
Actually,

379
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,450
we've been
following the arc and circling.

380
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,060
So we have to calculate

381
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,930
the arc of each fractal.

382
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,020
I did a simple calculation just now

383
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,500
and came up with a number.

384
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,260
100.

385
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,370
In other words,

386
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,100
we have to draw a contradictory arc

387
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,210
every 100 meters we walk.

388
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,130
This way,

389
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,740
we can walk a real straight line
and find the exit.

390
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,890
Fatty.

391
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,060
You can understand
what I'm saying, right?

392
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,020
You said it so clearly,

393
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,260
of course I can understand.

394
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,890
All right. Whether you understand,

395
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,820
just put on the hood and follow me.

396
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,030
A building of this size
is costly and laborious.

397
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,360
It seems that the Kumuli royal family
must be very obsessed with magic shows

398
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,890
that they went to great lengths

399
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,740
to build a maze like this

400
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,740
for entertainment.

401
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,890
What a tyrant.

402
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,100
No wonder it was short-lived.

403
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,260
We're out.

404
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,980
Wonderful. Amazing.

405
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,450
I... Wonderful.

406
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,980
Need I say more?

407
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,100
At critical moments,
we still have to rely

408
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,300
on Naive's real skills.

409
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,330
You didn't spend four years
studying architecture for nothing.

410
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,210
Wonderful.

411
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,760
All right. There are no more ragdolls,
so it's no longer dangerous.

412
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,690
Take the rags off.

413
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,170
Go.

414
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,460
Go.

415
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm free.

416
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,020
Let's go.

417
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,020
Fatty.

418
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,610
What?

419
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,210
You have to stop me when I guess.

420
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,460
Come on.
Tell me why you stopped me this time.

421
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,070
The structure of this ancient city
is quite special.

422
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,730
Let me review what happened

423
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,540
while I clear my mind.

424
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,100
Sure.

425
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,460
I can fix my hair too.

426
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,980
That maze earlier

427
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,500
is a magic venue.

428
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,690
Kumuli Kingdom

429
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,020
put snakes into ragdolls,

430
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,170
wanting to control the snakes

431
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,980
and make the ragdolls move
for entertainment.

432
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,380
This violation of nature's way of living

433
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,380
eventually harmed the king.

434
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,170
Kumuli suffered
a snake attack afterward,

435
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,420
so this place was abandoned.

436
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,810
But these snakes must be everywhere.

437
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,690
So I suspect there's more danger ahead.

438
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,690
The more dangerous it is,
the more correct we are.

439
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,460
Qiling

440
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,060
used this danger to hide the key.

441
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,580
The key

442
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,290
is right in front of us.

443
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,860
So

444
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,020
if we're right,

445
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,380
Qiling's mark

446
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,420
should be right ahead.

447
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,980
Wu Xie.

448
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,580
We didn't see

449
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,290
any messages from the patriarch
along the way.

450
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,500
If we go in rashly,

451
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,610
what if...

452
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,420
Wait.

453
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,290
Hahaha.

454
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,730
Speak of the devil.

455
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,460
Look at this rapport.

456
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,730
It's a mark Qiling left.

457
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,770
Did the patriarch teach you

458
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,770
how to find his mark?

459
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
Would you believe me

460
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,650
if I said no?

461
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,610
Are you jealous?

462
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,330
Haixing.

463
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,460
Get down to business.

464
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,020
I'm also curious.

465
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,170
What are these siblings doing?

466
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,060
What are you doing?

467
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,100
This part and this part.

468
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,130
Two of them.

469
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,420
This part and this part.

470
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,940
This one.

471
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,690
Set the net.

472
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,460
Is she a spider demon?

473
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,730
We're doomed.

474
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,770
The demon is trapping us in a cave.

475
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,330
The maze can trap us, and it can also trap
the Denaxi people.

476
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,380
When they come out,

477
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,500
they will be distracted.

478
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,460
Ask Haixing to ambush them here

479
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,860
and steal Feng's key.

480
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,380
But Feng and his group
had been fooled once before.

481
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,460
How sure are you?

482
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,250
The Zhang family's style
is to lure the enemy

483
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,330
into our home court

484
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,330
and then take the initiative to attack.

485
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,460
You spent so much time
with the patriarch.

486
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,900
Didn't you realize that?

487
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,170
No.

488
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,330
Qiling never uses

489
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,460
these bells and whistles.

490
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,860
Everywhere he is, his home court is.

491
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,900
Precisely.

492
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,980
Plans are for the weak.

493
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,020
Can this stop Feng and his group?

494
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,020
Just this alone?

495
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,770
Try it if you dare.

496
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,020
Fine.

497
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,690
Fatty.

498
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,020
Scorpion tail wag.

499
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,810
After getting the key,

500
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,100
hurry up and meet us.

501
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,580
But they have so many men

502
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,860
and are well-armed.

503
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,900
Don't worry.

504
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,900
If she's not completely sure, Haixing
won't take the initiative to attack.

505
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,500
She'll continue setting traps
on the road ahead

506
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,370
and wait for a chance.

507
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,330
Be careful.

508
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,770
Don't be impulsive.

509
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,170
Don't make meaningless attacks.

510
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,380
Think clearly before you strike.

511
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,020
I never do anything meaningless.

512
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,460
He cares about his sister after all.

513
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,060
You always have to say goodbye.

514
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,100
Many times after we parted,

515
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,330
I didn't know if we could meet again.

516
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,210
Compared with an old man, an old woman

517
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,500
is cuter.

518
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,860
The old man speaks like...

519
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,130
It's weird.

520
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,100
Are you really willing
to let your sister

521
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,610
face all these things alone?

522
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,580
This isn't difficult

523
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,250
for us.

524
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,250
You're right.

525
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,100
The Zhang family

526
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,540
puts mission before emotion.

527
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,980
See you later, Granny.

528
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,060
