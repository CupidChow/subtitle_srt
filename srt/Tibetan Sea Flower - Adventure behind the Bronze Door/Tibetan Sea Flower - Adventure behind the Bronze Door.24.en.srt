=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 24=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,790
Where's the Night King?

5
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,600
Don't tell me the Night King
is made of mud?

6
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,440
Did it fly away
after being blown to bits by me?

7
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm just kidding.

8
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,560
The Night King can turn invisible.

9
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,350
Maybe

10
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,910
it's right here with us.

11
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,320
It's just that we can't see it.

12
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,200
I found something.

13
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,209
Look.

14
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,699
There's mud on it.

15
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,560
Get rid of the mud.

16
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,110
Be careful.

17
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,800
Naive.

18
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,120
Naive!

19
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,950
These engravings...

20
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,630
These engravings are so complex.

21
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,030
How did they make this?

22
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,200
I can understand a little bit

23
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,510
of the bottom engravings.

24
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,200
But look at the top engravings.

25
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,320
Look at them.

26
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,150
Look at them.

27
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,510
How... How did they make this?

28
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,680
This is...

29
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,510
I feel like cursing someone out.

30
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,680
The engravings aren't the issue here.

31
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,200
The issue is, there's not
a single trace of injection molding.

32
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,240
What do you mean?

33
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,590
It's the same as we build houses.

34
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,590
We can see a seam

35
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,680
between bricks.

36
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,120
But I walked from there

37
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,169
to here.

38
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,529
I've been looking for that seam,

39
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,169
but I couldn't.

40
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,710
That means

41
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,120
this place

42
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,240
is forged from a single piece of bronze.

43
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,880
Have you not seen this before as well?

44
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,270
I thought we were outdated.

45
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm not afraid
of being embarrassed at all.

46
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,070
What exactly

47
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,360
do they use this for?

48
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know either.

49
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,950
Qiling didn't write anything about this

50
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,630
in his book.

51
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,590
Who's there?

52
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
What was that?

53
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,619
I saw you.

54
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,510
Fatty, what is it?

55
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,529
I don't know either.

56
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,710
I feel like someone's staring at us.

57
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,920
Don't tell me it's the Night King?

58
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,760
Stop scaring yourself.

59
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
We would've been dead

60
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,070
if it were the Night King.

61
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,000
You two, come here.

62
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,880
Where are we going?

63
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,259
Let's go and check it out.

64
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,769
Let's go.

65
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,590
Let's go.

66
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,270
It's petrified.

67
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,510
Be careful.

68
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,470
It's coming back to life.

69
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,750
Why does it seem like it's made of jade?

70
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,560
A corpse made of jade?

71
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,899
Remove the mud on top of it.

72
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's take a closer look.

73
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,470
The clothes have already decayed.

74
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,440
We can't identify

75
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,070
the jade carving
based on its clothing alone.

76
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,870
This is a silver accessory
from the Yinshaluo Tribe.

77
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,560
This is a statue
of a member of the Yinshaluo Tribe.

78
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,110
That's not true.

79
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,110
It's obvious that
this is from the Central Plains.

80
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,169
The statue might be
a person from the Central Plains.

81
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,350
Could it be that the Zhang Family
carved this statue?

82
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,830
We have too few clues.

83
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,520
I can't do an analysis.

84
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,070
But the statue has a strange form.

85
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,280
Look. It has a grim expression.

86
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,520
Openings were made
at the mouth and nose areas.

87
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,520
And, it's filled with mud.

88
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,219
It's as if the statue is imitating

89
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,470
the scene where a person
is drowning in mud.

90
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,019
I've seen plenty of deity statues.

91
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,280
Why did they have
to carve a statue of a drowning person?

92
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,830
This jade statue is placed
in the middle of the cave.

93
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,590
It's obvious that it's important.

94
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,470
During ancient times,

95
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,110
only one situation

96
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,400
calls for a human-imitating statue

97
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,689
that is treated

98
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,219
with utmost respect.

99
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,040
It's a ritual sacrifice.

100
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,950
Are you saying

101
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,870
that this jade statue is a sacrifice?

102
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,990
Is this place a sacrificial altar?

103
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,320
Here's my guess.

104
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,929
I think serious natural disasters

105
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,830
happened around this area.

106
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,800
Maybe many people were drowned in mud.

107
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,830
Our predecessors had no way
to explain this phenomenon.

108
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,280
They thought that the gods
were unleashing their wrath.

109
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,769
They thought this god loved offerings
that were drowned.

110
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,160
Therefore, they made a statue
of a drowning person

111
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,710
and offered it to the gods as a sacrifice
in hopes of averting disasters.

112
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:49,929
Ancient rituals

113
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,350
often used straw to make
human-like figures.

114
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,259
But there's not a single plant here.

115
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,770
Only rocks are available outside.

116
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,810
Therefore, they used whatever
that was available to them.

117
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,750
They made a status out of jade.

118
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,560
If so, what's with all the black cotton

119
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,040
inside its chest?

120
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,990
Is this also a tool
used for the ceremony?

121
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,470
I don't know.

122
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,440
I've never seen this

123
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,440
within
the Zhang Family's record as well.

124
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,990
Why don't we crack it open
and check out what's inside?

125
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,139
Alright.

126
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,859
No need for that.

127
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,280
Come. Take a look.

128
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,070
This area is already broken.

129
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,440
It's empty.

130
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,499
There's nothing inside.

131
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,680
It's just a hole.

132
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,230
It's just like a piggy bank.

133
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,160
There's also a possibility

134
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,289
that something inside

135
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,899
had escaped.

136
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,280
That's what I thought.

137
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,560
What could it be?

138
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,160
I don't know.

139
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,750
But I'm sure it was inside the mud.

140
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,750
Maybe it was flushed out.

141
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,040
What was that?

142
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,200
It suddenly rose.

143
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,289
It's likely

144
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,200
that we've triggered a mechanism.

145
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,560
Be careful.

146
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,830
These pillars,

147
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,950
they were built
to surround the jade statue.

148
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,619
What triggered that?

149
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,809
Maybe it's weight.

150
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,649
Maybe we stepped on a switch

151
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,640
when we walked around.

152
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,950
Let's retrace our steps.

153
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,920
Be careful.

154
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,440
Don't tell me someone is staring at us?

155
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,230
What exactly is this?

156
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,160
What's its function?

157
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,649
I don't know.

158
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,409
But I'm sure there's a reason

159
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,950
behind the ease of access
of this mechanism.

160
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,640
Let's try it again.

161
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,750
Every pillar here

162
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,920
is filled with bronze engravings.

163
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,950
And, they're much more exquisite

164
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,710
than the ones on the wall.

165
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,440
It's seamless.

166
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,040
That means everything was calculated

167
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,070
before it was built.

168
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm sure the engravings on the switch

169
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,110
aren't just for aesthetic purposes.

170
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,110
I assume there's a use to it.

171
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,160
What are you doing?
We're running out of water.

172
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,449
How did you figure that out?

173
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,859
I saw a bronze tree

174
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,350
on Mount Qin before.

175
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,529
There was a unique arrangement

176
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,490
on the branch itself.

177
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,899
It cannot be seen with our naked eyes.

178
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,339
We can only discover its secret

179
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,040
by pouring liquid on top of it.

180
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,920
Look.

181
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,230
An alpaca?

182
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,640
I think this is the right way.

183
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,040
Let's do it again
after the water dries up.

184
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,689
If the same pattern appears again,

185
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,499
I'm sure

186
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,470
there's a hidden meaning to the alpaca.

187
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,470
Your turn.

188
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,979
You failed.

189
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,160
It's picky.

190
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,680
What's going on?

191
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,230
Is the direction of the water flow
completely random?

192
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,529
But water flows seamlessly

193
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,070
within these engravings.

194
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,529
I'm sure these engravings

195
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,160
were designed to
let liquid flow in them.

196
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,920
Maybe it's an issue with the liquid.

197
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,950
It might not be water.

198
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,640
Maybe we can use alcohol instead.

199
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,859
If so, you would've smelled
the alcohol by now.

200
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,689
What's that?

201
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,649
Coke? Milk?

202
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,899
What do you think?

203
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,070
It's not Coke.

204
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,440
It's not milk.

205
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,110
It's blood.

206
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,320
Blood?

207
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,320
Got it.

208
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,110
That hurts.

209
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,110
Let me dress your wound.

210
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,600
It's flowing to the wall.

211
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,950
That's right.

212
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,840
Blood has a different density.

213
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,440
These engravings were designed

214
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,649
to let blood flow in them.

215
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,009
Is your blood trying to guide us

216
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,120
to something?

217
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,680
This time, it's definitely right.

218
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,200
It's not moving.

219
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,689
Stop that!

220
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,579
I'm fine.

221
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,080
I can persist for a little longer.
I haven't reached my limits yet.

222
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,510
Stop it!

223
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,470
Oh no.

224
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,160
We're in trouble again.

225
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,440
Fatty.

226
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,409
You're awake.

227
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,950
How long have I been unconscious?

228
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,230
Not very long.

229
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,680
But why did it feel like
it'd been a long time?

230
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,649
And, I had a dream.

231
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,969
I dreamt that

232
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,950
we were leading a retired life
in Wu's Mountain Abode.

233
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,680
Does it still hurt?

234
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,710
What happened to your hand?

235
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,680
It's nothing.

236
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,929
What happened?

237
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,230
I tried to do what you did.

238
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,950
When I thought about it,

239
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,400
I can't just let you bleed

240
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,009
and fall unconscious alone.

241
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,489
I'm rich, you know?

242
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,030
Am I right? It's fine to bleed

243
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,299
once or twice.

244
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,059
The key thing is, we must
inherit your glorious career.

245
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,230
Am I right?

246
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,790
However,

247
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,120
you see...

248
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,680
Look.

249
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,899
You're giddy, huh?

250
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,539
A little.

251
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,640
I feel giddy too.

252
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,950
Take a look.

253
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,310
Look at this.

254
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,689
You see,

255
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,449
your blood alone

256
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,750
already filled up such a huge area.

257
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,649
If I dripped my blood on it,

258
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,030
I'm sure it'd fill up everything.

259
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,470
But this is it.

260
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,440
It's flowing downward instead.

261
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,489
I failed.

262
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,239
Could it be that you had
consumed too much meat?

263
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,899
Maybe your blood has
too many lipids inside it.

264
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,660
Theoretically speaking,
it should flow smoothly.

265
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,230
It should flow quickly.

266
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,440
Zhang Haixing is healthy, right?

267
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,360
Even when she dripped her blood on it,

268
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,299
her blood

269
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,400
traveled together with mine.

270
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,950
Where is she?

271
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,339
She left.

272
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,950
She was worried about her brother
and was going to check on him.

273
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,400
It's so picky.

274
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,440
The blood formed a regular pattern

275
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,440
following the engravings.

276
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,779
That means the people
who built this place

277
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,470
have more in-depth knowledge of blood

278
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,440
than us.

279
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,200
Is it the Zhang Family?

280
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,080
The Zhang Family does
seem to fit the bill here.

281
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,230
However, they might not
be the only ones.

282
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,550
Look, you aren't a member
of the Zhang Family either.

283
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,950
You gained these abilities
later in life.

284
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,440
You tried Dragon's Blood before, right?

285
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,230
Dragon's Blood.

286
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,059
Only the Dragon's Blood can

287
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,249
reveal the true meaning
behind these engravings.

288
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,059
If that's the case,
these bronze engravings

289
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,680
are more like an identity
recognition system.

290
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,230
A recognition system for what?

291
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,470
For Dragon's Blood?

292
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,409
There are plenty
of easier methods to employ.

293
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,550
There's no need
to go through all this trouble.

294
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't you think so?

295
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,489
Since this is a huge project,

296
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,030
I'm sure there's a reason behind it.

297
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,950
That's right.

298
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,600
Come.

299
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,440
Time to put your wit to good use.

300
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,440
Slow down!

301
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,750
I assume you have an idea.

302
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,550
Fatty,

303
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,600
try and think of this.

304
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,400
This is a closed space filled with mud.

305
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,550
And, it's filled with exquisite
bronze engravings

306
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,440
and a jade statue.

307
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,339
If this place

308
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,230
was a sacrificial altar,

309
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,790
something doesn't make sense.

310
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,990
Why did these people
hold the statue in place with chains?

311
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,009
And, why did they build
mechanisms around it

312
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,400
to trap it in place?

313
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,680
Are you trying to say

314
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,510
that this is actually a cage?

315
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,080
And, this cage

316
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,409
is meant to keep the jade statue here?

317
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,859
Statues don't move.

318
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,279
Why are they keeping it here?

319
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,960
It's because they aren't
trying to trap it here.

320
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,750
They're trying to trap
the thing inside of it.

321
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,200
This isn't a sacrificial ceremony.
They built this to trap that thing.

322
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,310
The Night King?

323
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,640
Look.

324
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,779
These four chains

325
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,600
had locked it in place.

326
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,640
These two chains

327
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,920
penetrated its body.

328
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,310
They were fixed onto its scapula.

329
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,510
These four chains
weren't just decorations.

330
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,880
They were used to keep it in place.

331
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,929
The people who built these

332
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,600
thought that there was something

333
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,160
inside the statue.

334
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,550
Stop it.

335
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,729
Stop scaring yourself.

336
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,249
Maybe

337
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,710
the statue maker was
just cutting some corners.

338
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,400
That's why he stuffed it
with black cotton.

339
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,649
After that, he filled it with mud.

340
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,270
No one would discover that.

341
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,009
But there's one more issue.

342
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,160
Where did the mud come from?

343
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's do some deductions
with the enumeration method.

344
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,449
First scenario,

345
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,160
the mud was brought here by people.

346
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,230
This door is opened once every 80 years.

347
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,779
Someone filled the place with mud.

348
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,339
Qiling was the last person here.

349
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,339
He came here alone.

350
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,449
This is a huge project.

351
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,449
As he tries to fill it up, he...

352
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,270
How is that possible?

353
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,120
Second scenario,

354
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,249
the mud

355
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,579
is found here.

356
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,619
Therefore,

357
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,209
I'm sure there's a god of stomachache

358
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,969
filling the place with his "mud"

359
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,640
until the place is filled.

360
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,379
Even if it isn't him,
it must be someone else.

361
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,440
Fatty.

362
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,880
This time, you might be right.

363
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,030
Do you still remember
the Yinshaluo Ruins?

364
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,689
Back then, Feng said there were
certain geological changes

365
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,649
beneath the ruins.

366
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,059
Melted snow

367
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,169
and certain minerals

368
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,120
combined to form this mud.

369
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,510
The mud gushed out from this seam

370
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,710
and flooded the entire mountain.

371
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,880
After that, the entire space was filled.

372
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,080
This is a marvel of nature.

373
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,729
Wu Xie.

374
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,819
You're pretty smart.

375
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,819
You came back already?

376
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,689
Where's your brother?

377
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,339
My brother couldn't stop them.

378
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,059
Hans and his men are on our tails.

379
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,200
I've trapped them in a dead end for now.

380
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,400
Seems like they've escaped.

381
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,339
Once they come inside,

382
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,449
the situation will no longer
be in our control.

383
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,409
Now, our only way

384
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,139
is to blow up the path
outside the Bronze Door.

385
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,819
This way, we can buy us some time.

386
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,819
Blow up the path?

387
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,299
Do you want us to be trapped here?

388
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,059
Do you have any other choices, then?

389
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,059
This is the end.

390
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,409
Hans will never listen to us again.

391
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,249
This time, he'll surely kill us.

392
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,579
Come, hand me the detonators.

393
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,840
I'll blow up the path.

394
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,950
Hurry.

395
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,400
Of all the people to do it,
I should be the one doing it.

396
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,550
Be careful.

397
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,990
Leave this to me.

398
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,360
Wu Xie,

399
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,510
you have excellent analytical abilities.

400
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,009
You could gather

401
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,030
this much information
just from these clues alone.

402
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,270
You're quite outstanding.

403
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,200
Let's say that my analysis was correct.

404
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,510
If so, where's the thing inside of it?

405
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,080
I don't know.

406
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,120
But this no longer matters.

407
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,030
What do you mean?

408
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,360
Did you cause the explosion outside?

409
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,779
You didn't look for your brother.

410
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,710
Hans and his men
weren't on our tails either.

411
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,640
What exactly are you up to?

412
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,550
Why did you lie to Fatty
and lure him outside?

413
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,120
It's because I'll acquire the item

414
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,080
I desire soon.

415
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,680
Fatty!

416
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,230
Zhang Haixing!

417
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,539
What exactly are you up to?

418
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,990
Let me go right now!

419
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,249
Listen!

420
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,209
Don't think that I don't dare to act
against you just because you're a woman!

421
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,710
If you act crazily again,

422
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,840
I'll resist!

423
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll resist for real!

424
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,880
Naive, you're truly naive indeed.

425
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,080
You actually believed that a member of the
Zhang Family would join hands with you?

426
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,249
Don't you think
you're overestimating yourself?

427
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,600
What do you mean by that?

428
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,270
Who exactly are you?

429
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,360
I can only tell you

430
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,880
that I'm no longer
a member of the Zhang Family.

431
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,160
Fatty!

432
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,230
Fatty, save me!

433
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,859
Fatty!

434
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,729
Stop shouting.

435
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,689
Fatty, save me!

436
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,689
It's pointless to shout.

437
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,750
I've already set a trap for him outside.

438
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,640
It's likely that he's on his way
to find the Night King.

439
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,880
Zhang Haixing,
you'll be punished someday!

440
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,249
Since you didn't put
enough blood just now,

441
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,030
let's see what'll happen
if there's enough blood.

442
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,270
You set up such an elaborate plot

443
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,360
just to lure me here.

444
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,270
I'm sure you're not just doing this
to acquire my blood.

445
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,310
What's the meaning
behind these engravings?

446
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,310
At least explain yourself
before killing me.

447
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,440
I just left for a little while.

448
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,400
Look at the trouble
you got yourself into.

449
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,880
I'm speechless.

450
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,030
Fatty.

451
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,840
The Night King has appeared.

452
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,200
It almost attacked me
and Zhang Haixing just now.

453
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,819
But I couldn't see

454
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,310
its appearance clearly.

455
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,489
And,

456
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,640
Zhang Haixing also stole the Heavenly Staff,
the only weapon that works against it.

457
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,600
We have to retrieve it.

458
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,310
- That's enough.
- Don't move! I'm not done yet!

459
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,640
How did the Night King
appear out of nowhere?

460
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,360
It was here all along.

461
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,680
It's just that we couldn't see it.

462
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,030
My blood

463
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,680
avoided the area
where the Night King was at.

464
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,689
Therefore, it traced its contour.

465
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,880
My brain hurts just thinking about it.

466
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,750
Just now, when we were
inspecting the engravings,

467
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,640
it was hiding beside us all along.

468
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,510
Zhang Haixing wanted to use my blood

469
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,400
to locate the Night King.

470
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,510
Be careful.

471
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,299
My equipment should be nearby.

472
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,420
Let's get our equipment first.

473
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,640
I'll look for it.

474
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,640
Let's wait a little longer.

475
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,950
This is the last one.

476
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,920
I was planning to use this

477
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,790
while taking a leak.

478
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,750
I'll

479
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,360
scout the path ahead.

480
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,360
Try and lure the freak

481
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,120
to the wrong path.

482
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,920
I can see now.

483
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,200
I'll go.

484
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,710
Fatty!

485
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,310
Naive, don't come here!

486
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,120
I'll blow you to bits!

487
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,310
Wealth and prosperity!

488
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,640
Naive!

489
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,040
Naive!

490
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,230
Naive!

491
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,089
I'll protect you! I'll blow it to bits!

492
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,859
Fatty! There's no time left.

493
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,049
Just run!

494
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,790
Great idea! Hurry!

495
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,310
Go!

496
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,960
Hurry!

497
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,310
It didn't follow us, right?

498
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,870
It didn't.

499
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,560
It's so dark here.

500
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,179
Do you have
other light sources with you?

501
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:18,350
Let me check.

502
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,960
Nope.

503
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,560
I'm afraid I have nothing.

504
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,569
What about you?

505
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,040
This is the only item left.

506
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,680
This lighter concerns our survival.

507
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,969
This won't do.

508
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,910
I'm a wealthy person, you know?

509
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,310
I never expected myself
to end up like this.

510
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,960
Look at this.

511
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,160
It's like petroleum.

512
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,480
It's sticky too.

513
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,129
Can we ignite this?

514
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,790
- Let's give it a try.
- Yeah.

515
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,270
I have this.

516
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,929
If this doesn't ignite,

517
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,819
that lighter

518
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,339
will be the final flame
before our death,

519
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,520
you know?

520
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,350
Say, it won't follow us here, right?

521
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,560
I don't know.

522
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,830
Maybe that monster

523
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,600
is just a watchdog.

524
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,430
Maybe we're safe out here.

525
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,960
Let me give it a try.

526
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,960
Alright.

527
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,560
Seems like
it's not that sensitive to fire.

528
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,310
Come here.

529
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,680
What does that monster look like?

530
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,640
I'll burn you to death.

531
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,299
It's coming!

532
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,089
Go and hide!

533
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,600
Hurry and hide!

534
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,219
What took you so long?

535
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,219
I stuck the torch there.

536
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,080
I wanted to see what it looked like.

537
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,659
You almost blew me to bits.

538
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,899
I almost fell to my death
because of you!

539
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,040
Fatty!

540
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,960
Don't come here.

541
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,310
I shall engage her in a duel.

542
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,270
Don't force me
to use my ultimate technique.

543
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,910
Show me your ultimate technique.

544
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,520
Actually,

545
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,449
I had a crush on you for a long time.

546
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,160
Granny Haixing.

547
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,200
Don't think
that I don't dare to kill you!

548
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,739
We do have perfect chemistry.

549
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,339
Who are you trying to kill?

550
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,270
I was waiting for that.

551
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,680
I didn't embarrass myself for nothing.

552
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,750
How could you do something like that?

553
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,379
Isn't it obvious? We couldn't defeat her
even if there were ten of us.

554
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,250
She's disrespecting us
just because she's our senior.

555
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,350
That was close.

556
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,910
What's going on?

557
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,160
Why is she doing this to us?

558
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,270
This old lady is ruthless.

559
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,000
She wanted to take my life.

560
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,520
She lied to me and said
that Hans was here.

561
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,960
She told me to blow up the path outside.

562
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,230
Naive, listen.

563
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,129
Luckily, I was agile.

564
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,310
I hung on to the cliff.

565
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,870
If I fell,

566
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,790
I would've been in Hell by now.
