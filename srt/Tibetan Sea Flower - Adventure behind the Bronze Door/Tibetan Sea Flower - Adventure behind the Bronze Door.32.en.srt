00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 32=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,800
(The tenth year of Zhang Qiling's entry
into the Bronze Door.)

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,230
(Years later,)

6
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,280
(the Sand Sea Plan
was finally a success.)

7
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,760
(The feud between the ancestors)

8
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,510
(has come to an end.)

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,489
(Over the years of my adventures,)

10
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,920
(I've grown a lot,)

11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,760
(gained a lot,)

12
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,040
(but I've paid a terrible price.)

13
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,739
(Fatty and I have discussed)

14
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,040
(whether it's all worth it or not.)

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,419
(One by one, the people
we used to fight alongside)

16
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,600
(have left us.)

17
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,390
(For example, Pan Zi.)

18
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,440
(Tomb of late friend, Pan Zi)
(We come to pay respects every year.)

19
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,720
Pan,

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,270
we're here to see you.

21
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,390
What are you looking at?

22
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,200
You've got a lot of gray hair.

23
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,720
Can we get old and not have gray hair?

24
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,369
I'm old, but I'm still cool.

25
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't be so sentimental.

26
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,990
Don't let Pan Zi make fun of you.

27
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,070
Say goodbye to Pan Zi again.

28
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,209
Pan Zi,

29
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,459
we'll bring Qiling back

30
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,110
happily.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,440
Let's go.

32
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,369
Let's go

33
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,390
to somewhere cool for the summer.

34
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,480
(Now it's the eve of the ten-year pact,)

35
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,640
(and Wu Xie is going to the Bronze Door
to pick up Zhang Qiling.)

36
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,200
(I've tried to think about it
from a different perspective.)

37
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,160
(If I were Qiling,)

38
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,040
(what would I do if I knew someone
would come looking for me)

39
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,040
(in ten years?)

40
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,310
(How would he show up?)

41
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,870
(Would he come out alone?)

42
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,480
(What would be his first line?)

43
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,520
(I remember that huge Bronze Door)

44
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,739
(set into the rock wall,)

45
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,400
(and I couldn't even tell it was there.)

46
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,630
(The flashlight couldn't
reveal its full extent.)

47
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,840
(It really seemed to be there.)

48
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,960
(Walking through the Bronze Door,)

49
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,990
(the breathtaking luster)

50
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,160
(of the huge door)

51
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,110
(makes one feel the profoundness
of the ancient times.)

52
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,619
Qiling,

53
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,840
your friends are here!

54
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,310
Qiling,

55
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,059
we're here!

56
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,400
Respond if you hear me.

57
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,040
The door is too thick.

58
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,040
I don't think he can hear you.

59
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,809
Yes, the door is too thick.

60
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,689
It's been too long.

61
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,870
We're back in the same place.

62
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,870
Let's just wait, then.

63
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,480
Retirement

64
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,310
sounds so wonderful.

65
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,619
After ten years of traveling around,

66
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,630
it's time for us to take a break.

67
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,080
Have you thought

68
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,489
about what you're going to do

69
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,960
when Qiling gets out?

70
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,369
I found a village in the mountains

71
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,110
in the south.

72
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,859
The village

73
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,480
is located halfway up a valley

74
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,073
and there are six waterfalls nearby.

75
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,480
The water from the waterfalls

76
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,670
splashes down on the village
all year round.

77
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,179
It makes the village

78
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,110
look like it's raining all the time.

79
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,360
Sounds good.

80
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm going to take a break there.

81
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,659
When Qiling comes out
of the Bronze Door,

82
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,280
he'll be free.

83
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,190
I don't know

84
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,280
where he's going.

85
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,840
What about your business?

86
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,080
You're not doing it?

87
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll leave it to Hua.

88
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,230
I'll give it to him.

89
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,040
I owe it to him.

90
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,080
It's up to him whether
to close it down or go on.

91
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,549
Why are you giving it to Hua
and not me?

92
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:36,110
Haven't we been brothers for years?

93
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,750
Take my advice,

94
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,720
you need to rest.

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,059
Why don't you think

96
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,230
about retiring with me in that village?

97
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,080
That sounds like a wonderful retirement.

98
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,099
Only when you're truly gone can there...

99
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,080
Can there be real peace.

100
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,280
There's no real interesting story.

101
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,870
To be a man without a past or a future,

102
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,790
without the slightest connection

103
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,870
to the world.

104
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,790
You're sleepy, aren't you?

105
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,080
Sleep now.

106
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,870
Tomorrow is the day.

107
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,080
Fatty.

108
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,320
These are all me in ten years.

109
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,870
It's a hallucination.

110
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,030
It's all a hallucination.

111
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,750
It's all a hallucination.

112
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,480
It's a hallucination.

113
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,560
Is he out?

114
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,510
No.

115
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,720
Not yet.

116
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,480
Sorry to wake you up.

117
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,320
Go back to sleep.

118
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,200
Would you like some water?

119
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,510
You've been up all night?

120
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,270
I was asleep. I just woke up.

121
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,990
Why isn't he out yet?

122
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,800
Fatty,

123
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,800
I wonder

124
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,720
what his first line will be

125
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,230
when he gets out.

126
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,609
Just stop thinking about it.

127
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,720
We'll find out then.

128
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,750
How come my beautiful snoring

129
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,230
doesn't put you to sleep?

130
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,480
Let's listen to some songs.

131
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,779
Okay. Any songs on your cell phone?

132
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,259
I downloaded them just for Qiling.

133
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,510
It's our duty as brothers

134
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,019
to keep him up to date.

135
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,110
He's 10 years behind.

136
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,809
I'm afraid this song
will make Qiling cower

137
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,630
when he hears it.

138
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,800
Change the song.

139
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,080
I think this one's okay.

140
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,150

to come out, is he?

148
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,360
In the village I just mentioned,

149
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,320
because of the abundant rainwater,

150
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,800
there is a very special weed

151
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,840
called rain ginseng.

152
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,499
The locals

153
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,910
wrap its petals in pastries

154
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,030
and say that eating them
will improve one's memory.

155
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,360
Rain ginseng only has flowers
but no fruits.

156

If you want to sow it,

157
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,150
you can only reproduce it by the root.

158
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,510
I've heard there are fruit-bearing ones.

159
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,750
Because it's very rare,

160
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,360
it's said that people who eat its fruit

161
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,230

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,750

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,739
Captain Mojin, Booming Handsome Boy.

188
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,889
Nicknamed Fatty.

189
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,889
Aries, born April 18th.

190
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,409
I like roast lamb, roast loin,
and girls for company.

191
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,699
Fair and chubby.

192
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,329
I'm a hothead

193
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,019
who's good with both knives and guns.

194
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,670
I'm the best at raising pigs.

195
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,870
They're sleeping like pigs.

196
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,710
You two,

197
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,840
I've come to Rain Village

198
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,630
to enjoy my retirement.

199
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,360
I guess I'll have
to be the nanny and driver again.

200
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,560
(In the distant past,)

201
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,809
(our ancestors)

202
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,710
(learned the boundaries of the world)

203
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,430
(through adventure and exploration,)

204
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,240
(discovering problems,)

205
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,059
(gaining knowledge,)

206
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,710
(avoiding catastrophes)

207
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,470
(and accumulating countless lessons
for future generations.)

208
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,600
(But now, when I have stopped)

209
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,710
(and finally stopped moving forward,)

210
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,240
(I have suddenly realized something.)

211
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,040
(Maybe the meaning of adventuring)

212
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,240
(is to go home.)

213
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,520
This is the thousand-year-old
Rain Village.

214
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,360
We've arrived.

215
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,000
What's this?

216
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,939
Why?

217
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,150
Is this the life we want?

218
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,760
That's a lot of grass!

219
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,950
It's

220
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,910
a bit crude.

221
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,299
But it's okay.

222
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,390
As long as the three of us are together,

223
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,520
no matter where we are,

224
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,699
we're home.

225
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,800
Come on.

226
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,979
Let me propose a toast.

227
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,150
In the past ten years,
when Qiling wasn't with us,

228
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,809
Naive and I were really

229
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,390
at the end of our tether.

230
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,299
I didn't expect Qiling to come back.

231
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,080
We came to Rain Village again.

232
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,910
Come on. Here's to our new life.

233
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,800
It's so precious
to return to the forest.

234
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,430
Let's enjoy.

235
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,019
Happy.

236
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,190
So happy.

237
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,889
It's been ten years since we parted

238
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,630
and drank together in the spring breeze.

239
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,600
The foreign travelers coming and going

240
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,409
through Chang'an Road

241
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,910
seem to be getting older

242
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,080
every time.

243
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,539
Can you stand it, Qiling?

244
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,150
Do you want to go back
to the Bronze Door?

245
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,190
That's

246
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,870
Naive's style
of feeling sorry for himself.

247
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,040
You're the one
who's feeling sorry for yourself.

248
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,499
I know.

249
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,499
You're afraid of getting old.

250
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,760
You're afraid you won't catch up
with us, aren't you?

251
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,390
I'm not afraid.

252
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,840
It's been ten years.

253
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,539
What have I been afraid of
in the last ten years?

254
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,259
I know. You haven't been afraid
of anything in the last ten years,

255
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,840
but you're afraid of this.

256
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,390
Fatty.

257
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,779
All right.

258
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,609
We've been through everything now

259
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,129
and we're old enough

260
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,809
to finally retire here.

261
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,499
Stop being obsessive.

262
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,520
Come on.

263
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm not obsessed.

264
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,870
I'm not obsessed anymore.

265
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,760
(This is where the story)

266
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,360
(finally stumbles to a conclusion.)

267
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,089
(But in the process,)

268
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,950
(I gained neither wealth)

269
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,840
(nor honor.)

270
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,840
(It seems
that I have gained nothing tangible.)

271
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,950
Why do I have to keep going?

272
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,870
Fatty.

273
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,409
Hoeing in the paddy
under the mid-day sun.

274
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,240
Sweat dripping to the soil
underneath the plant.

275
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,630
(Because)

276
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,059
(if we have to go on the road)

277
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,080
(for the sake of getting real benefits,)

278
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,150
(then a lot of wonderful things)

279
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,710
(won't happen.)

280
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,080
(Like this field we're working on,)

281
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,360
(it's not the fruit that matters,)

282
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,470
(it's the process of sowing the seed.)

283
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,470
I've been feeling it for a few days.

284
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,910
It's a great place
to get away from it all.

285
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,259
Fatty, have some water
and rest for a while.

286
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,849
Help me collect the pickles

287
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,539
from the mountain later.

288
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,849
It's been drying for days.

289
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,369
Don't wait until it rains.

290
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,459
It's no rush, is it?

291
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,470
It doesn't look like it's going to rain.

292
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,699
You can't go later.

293
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,670
Liu will complain about the noise.

294
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,950
Where's Qiling?

295
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,569
I haven't seen him in a while.

296
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,849
Don't worry.

297
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,910
Can't he have some fun in the mountains?

298
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,979
He brought back

299
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,739
a wounded pheasant

300
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,129
the other day.

301
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,520
Within a couple of days of raising it,

302
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,870
Madam Shen stole it.

303
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm used to him walking away.

304
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,699
It's a reflex.

305
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,110
You have to get used
to the slower pace of retirement.

306
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,760
Well, speak of the devil.

307
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,600
What have you found?

308
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,470
Would you like

309
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,630
to go for a walk in the mountains?

310
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,240
(Much of the world's causality)

311
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,080
(is reversed.)

312
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,329
(You don't start a journey
because you see)

313
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,369
(something beautiful)

314
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,670
(at the end of it.)

315
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,800
(It's because you start the journey,)

316
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,190
(take the risk)

317
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,360
(and persevere)

318
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,360
(that the beautiful things happen.)

319
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,950
(You never know what you're going)

320
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,430
(to encounter next.)

321
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,800
We'll be tour guides
for the rest of our lives.

322
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,320
I think you're good at it.

323
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,329
I'm sure you can make a lot of money.

324
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,430
Am I right, Naive?

325
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,840
Look at this amazing view.

326
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,320
Let's go.

327
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,710
There's a lot of water here.

328
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,950
I didn't realize there was
such a lake hidden down there.

329
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,840
Who's that?

330
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,040
Any fish?

331
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,329
This smell

332
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,430
is so familiar.

333
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,670
It smells like old mud.

334
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,027
It's really strong.

335
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,080
Mister,

336
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,190
You're using a very special bait.

337
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,600
You've added something to it.

338
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,600
You know what that fish likes to eat,

339
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,760
so you prepared it just for it.

340
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,320
With plenty of bait,

341
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,000
the thickest line possible,

342
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,080
and bomb shackle,

343
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,409
it looks like you're dealing
with a big one.

344
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,950
So you know a lot about it.

345
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,539
If you do,

346
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,040
don't interfere with my fishing.

347
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,630
How could you blame us
for your failure to catch a fish?

348
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,219
What an old geezer.

349
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,040
Mister,

350
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,600
but I don't think

351
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,670
the big fish you're waiting for

352
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,649
will be

353
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,190
in such a narrow lake.

354
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,630
And even if it takes the bait,

355
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,990
you won't be able to handle it
with this rod.

356
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,240
What are you trying to say?

357
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,849
Don't be mad.

358
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,889
We live in this neighborhood, too.

359
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,510
We just came to the mountains
to have some fun

360
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,080
and came to see what's going on.

361
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,870
I'm just a little curious

362
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,560
as to why you're fishing here

363
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,190
for a fish you know
you can't even catch.

364
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,019
Fish.

365
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,979
Slowly.

366
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,499
Coming.

367
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,169
Slowly.

368
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,129
Hold it properly.

369
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,129
Slide this way.

370
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,670
Slide this way.

371
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,259
- Let me help you.
- Let him help you.

372
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,369
Come on, I...

373
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,560
Be careful.

374
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,470
Lift it up.

375
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,409
You're so strong.

376
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,059
Be careful.

377
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,459
Be careful.

378
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,219
It's all right.

379
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,059
It's all right.

380
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,040
S-shape, right on target.

381
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,889
Slowly.

382
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,040
Go.

383
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,150
Ten minutes. It's been
ten minutes of struggle.

384
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,630
Exert your strength!

385
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,800
Come on!

386
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,470
Come on!

387
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,059
Well done.

388
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,369
Come on.

389
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,670
Good job.

390
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,520
Fatty, come on.

391
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,299
Put it here. You can't get away.

392
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,560
Let's hold it down.

393
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,219
Okay.

394
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,950
It's so smart.

395
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,609
It's so big.

396
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,760
Mister,

397
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,889
forget what I just said.

398
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,849
It's so fun.

399
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,470
That's a pretty big fish.

400
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,240
What's wrong?

401
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,040
Is this not the fish

402
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,950
you wanted to catch?

403
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,040
Anything bigger than this?

404
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,520
It's enough to eat.

405
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,809
Is it cooked?

406
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes.

407
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,710
It smells so good.

408
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,870
Mister, here you go.

409
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,670
The beer is good, right?

410
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,470
Come on, let's drink.

411
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,499
Here's to you.

412
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,710
Stay healthy.

413
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,320
May your dream come true.

414
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,600
Just tell us.

415
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,259
What is this fish?

416
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,840
Why did you have to catch it?

417
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,760
The first time I heard of this fish

418
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,560
was 20 years ago.

419
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,870
My son

420
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,390
had been following me since he was a kid

421
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,950
and loved to fish.

422
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,240
He had been fishing all over the world.

423
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,710
He fished for whatever's fresh.

424
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,670
They say

425
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,219
they saw a fish here

426
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,430
they'd never seen before.

427
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,240
The fish's shadow

428
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,560
was big and long,

429
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,259
with water plants

430
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,910
and coins hanging from its body.

431
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,430
Isn't it amazing?

432
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,040
Stillwater Dragon King.

433
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,390
According to ancient books,

434
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:45,464
all the big fish that grow
in these closed waters

435
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,040
have this name.

436
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,600
I don't care what kind
of Dragon King it is,

437
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,240
I had to catch it.

438
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,670
Come on, Mister.

439
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,520
Here's to you.

440
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,110
Come on, your dream has come true.

441
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,409
Well, didn't your son see the fish?

442
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,910
Why didn't he catch it?

443
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,320
He and his fishing buddy

444
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,840
were dragged down by that fish

445
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,190
and have since been dead and gone.

446
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,710
Since then,

447
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,390
I've lived here.

448
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,630
I've even drawn a map
of the water system here,

449
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,910
and I've been fishing for 20 years.

450
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,840
Now,

451
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,910
I'm old.

452
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,710
My days are numbered.

453
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,360
Twenty years ago,

454
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,320
there was a drought here

455
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,860
and the water level plummeted.

456
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,760
The fish

457
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,630
was probably suffocating in the water,

458
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,939
so it came out.

459
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,329
So it's impossible to catch it

460
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,000
if it's not a drought?

461
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,470
Fatty.

462
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,110
I mean,

463
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,329
if we do one thing for 20 years,

464
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,800
of course it's cool.

465
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,809
But look,

466
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,889
you're so old,

467
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,849
life and death are unpredictable,
aren't they?

468
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,600
Then why should you bother?

469
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,630
I just want to catch it.

470
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,889
Okay.

471
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,240
All right, Mister.

472
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,129
All right.

473
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,040
Thank you. Thank you for the fish.

474
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,059
Okay?

475
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,190
Right now, eat the fish
and drink the beer.

476
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,979
Okay?

477
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,630
You have to enjoy the present.

478
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,950
The old man has nothing with him.

479
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,259
He doesn't want to leave.

480
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,110
He's insisting on dying there.

481
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,459
He's very sick.

482
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,670
He won't live long.

483
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,360
You could tell?

484
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,280
When you're dying,

485
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,470
you want to do what you want to do.

486
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,760
But what's the point?

487
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,320
It's been 20 years.

488
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,110
He's more obsessive than me.

489
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,710
Maybe we can find a way to help him.

490
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,670
Help him?

491
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,080
Can we?

492
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,059
Let's start helping.

493
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,259
Maybe we can help,

494
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,539
maybe we can't.

495
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,569
But if we don't help,

496
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,299
nothing will happen.

497
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,889
Maybe if we keep helping,

498
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,539
at some point,

499
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,169
by some chance,

500
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,459
he'll come to his senses.

501
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,299
Yes.

502
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,840
Let's help first.

503
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,840
(When we got back,)

504
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,569
(Fatty, Qiling and I hit it off
and decided to help the old man)

505
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,320
(catch the legendary
Stillwater Dragon King.)

506
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,649
(But before we left, we decided
to celebrate Chinese New Year)

507
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,360
(with Qiling.)

508
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,510
(It's also the first Chinese New Year)

509
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,390
(for the three of us,)

510
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,120
(and a new adventure.)

511
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,360
(Wonderful adventures)

512
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:25,436
(can be going into uninhabited areas)

513
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,320
(to do amazing adventures)

514
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,550
(that only happen in the movies)

515
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,160
(or any aspect of life.)

516
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,470
(Don't believe me?)

517
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,510
(Look at us.)

518
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,030
What are you going to do?

519
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,990
Kill a chicken.

520
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,720
I want a massage more than anything.

521
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,510
We've got everything we need.

522
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,539
How's your fire?

523
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,019
Everything tastes good

524
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,209
on my fire.

525
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,819
Okay.

526
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,910
Once the fire's ready,
it's time to cook.

527
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,510
Well...

528
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,910
Fatty.

529
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,390
Wait, what's wrong?

530
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,289
Sorry.

531
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,430
Seriously?

532
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,120
Wh... What?

533
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,430
I forgot to buy beer.

534
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,320
Beer?

535
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:19,939
Fatty.

536
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,019
How could you
forget something so important?

537
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,289
I'm sorry. I really forgot.

538
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,160
How do we celebrate
Chinese New Year without it?

539
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,569
Go and buy it.

540
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,379
Where? All the stores are closed.

541
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,070
Everyone's gone home
for Chinese New Year.

542
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,120
What to do?

543
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,030
Do we still have any at home?

544
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,510
Home?

545
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,840
Let look for it.

546
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,349
Look in the house. You look in this one.

547
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,870
I had a bottle at lunch.

548
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,510
Why are you killing my chicken?

549
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,010
This is my chicken!

550
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,859
Go away!
Why are you killing my chicken?

551
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,649
Fatty, go and take a look.

552
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,499
It's Chinese New Year.
Don't get into any trouble.

553
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,419
Put it down!

554
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,680
Apologize and compensate if needed.

555
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,499
We don't even have to pay

556
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,419
when we dine at restaurants in town.

557
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,769
Why do we care about your chicken?
Don't belittle us.

558
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,539
You don't care,

559
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,539
but the chicken is mine.

560
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,030
Why is it yours?

561
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,499
You're so old,

562
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,040
how can you bully my brother?

563
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,819
Did it answer when you called it?
Did it say something to you in your dream?

564
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,979
How could you say that?

565
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,419
Why am I bullying him?

566
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,089
I've been raising

567
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,769
this chicken for a year.
Of course I can recognise it.

568
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,689
Madam Shen!

569
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,059
What did I say that was wrong?

570
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,499
You're just in time to judge.

571
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,539
Sorry.

572
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,019
It's all our fault.

573
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,289
How is it our fault?

574
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,859
Fatty.

575
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,899
He killed my chicken without telling me!

576
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,910
Wine.

577
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,280
Yes, it's all our fault.

578
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,459
Madam, listen to me.

579
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,769
Those cute chickens,

580
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,990
you should protect them.

581
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,510
I don't hear the chickens crowing,

582
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,209
but I hear you sighing.

583
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,800
What are you talking about.

584
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,899
He went into my dream,

585
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,129
saying you're its mother.

586
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,979
No, you're its leader.

587
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,129
So,

588
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,339
it's so sad that the chicken died.

589
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,379
What should we do?

590
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:00,979
Compensate!

591
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,459
Sure.

592
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,729
Madam, the money is here.

593
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,209
Look, how sensible.

594
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,339
500 yuan. Is it enough?

595
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,819
Isn't it too much?

596
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,879
It's too much.

597
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,599
I really don't have any change.
Please keep it.

598
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,419
I don't have any change
for you. Why don't

599
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,840
you keep this 100 yuan?

600
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,030
No.

601
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
Why don't you give us some wine?

602
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,070
This 100 yuan is for your wine.

603
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,499
Well, the wine is not that expensive.

604
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,539
I've got some eggs and bacon.

605
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,120
Take them back and cook them.

606
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,649
It's Chinese New Year.

607
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,129
Let's all have a good time.

608
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,939
Thank you.

609
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,729
Madam Shen is so kind.

610
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,649
Madam Shen, Happy Chinese New Year.

611
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,769
I'm happy.

612
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,070
May you have a prosperous year.

613
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,590
Yeah, prosperous.

614
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,379
Madam, let's set off
some firecrackers together later.

615
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,019
Madam Shen, Happy Chinese New Year.

616
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,129
Happy Chinese New Year.

617
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,200
All right.

618
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,390
(Am I right,)

619
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,910
(guys?)

620
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,680
(Life)

621
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,870
(is an adventure.)

622
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,070
(People in life)

623
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,870
(through good times)

624
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,070
(and bad)

625
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,680
(are great adventurers.)

626
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,430
(Do you remember)

627
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,840
(our adventures in Niles,)

628
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,510
(in Mosang,)

629
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,539
(in Yinshaluo)

630
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,800
(and in the valley)

631
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,430
(of Snowy Peak?)

632
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,430
(Can you still tell)

633
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,680
(what you consider heroism?)

634
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,510
(Is it what we were then)

635
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,680
(or what we are now?)

636
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,280
Fatty.

637
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,169
To us three,

638
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,539
come on!

639
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,550
Nice.

640
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,910
(Lastly, I'd like to reintroduce)

641
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,430
(my name)

642
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,720
(is Wu Xie)

643
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,379
(and I run an)

644
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,550
(antique store called
Wu's Mountain Abode.)

645
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,360
(I'm the boss,)

646
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,240
(and there are two other bosses.)

647
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,640
(One is called Wang Fatty)

648
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,470
(and the other is called Zhang Qiling.)

649
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,360
(We have returned from our adventures)

650
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,550
(and returned to the adventure of life.)

651
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,950
(Don't you laugh at us.)

652
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,240
(Sometimes,)

653
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,390
(cooking a feast
for parents, family and friends)

654
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,680
(is saving the world.)

655
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,470
(All right.)

656
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,640
(Goodbye,)

657
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,840
(my friends.)

658
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,609
(I hope)

659
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,360
(we'll never forget this night.)

660
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,430
(May you have a prosperous year.)

661
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,320
