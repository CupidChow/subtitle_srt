1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,240
(My friend,)

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,839
(no matter who you are,)

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
(if you find this notebook
in the future,)

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,839
(please don't be surprised
by the story it holds.)

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,000
(What I'm about to tell)

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,719
(is pretty hard to explain.)

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
(But first, let me introduce myself.)

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
(My name's Wu Xie,)

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,600
(and I run a place)

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,679
(an antique store,
called Wu's Mountain Abode.)

11
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,220
(Wu's Mountain Abode)

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,130
(I may say I run it,)

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,240
(but I do almost everything.)

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,590
(Wu's Mountain Abode.
This store deals in all kinds of antiques)

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,759
(My ancestors were tomb raiders.)

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,240
(But)

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,240
(I'm not skilled in that area.)

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,990
(I'm the owner of Wu's Mountain Abode)

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,359
(and I've got two co-owners.)

20
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,560
(The chubby one)

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,840
(is Wang Fatty.)

22
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,719
(You can tell right away)

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,719
(that we're both pretty optimistic)

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,799
(and energetic guys.)

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,799
(As for the third person,)

26
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,560
(you can also tell)

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,790
(he's not easy to get along with.)

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,120
(There's something weird about him.)

29
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,879
(His name is Zhang Qiling,)

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,359
(but we call him Qiling.)

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,640
(To understand the story
I want to share,)

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,799
(we need to start with him.)

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
(And that's part of why this story
is so complicated.)

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
(So who is he?)

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,319
(No one really knows.)

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,400
(When I met Zhang Qiling,)

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,400
(he had already lost his memory.)

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,500
(He said he only remembered spending)

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,200
(a long time living)

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,599
(in the snowy mountains.)

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,599
(But he didn't know
what he was doing there.)

42
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,180
(Zhang Qiling)

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,040
(All he recalled)

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,799
(was continuously walking.)

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,760
(He kept walking endlessly.)

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,170
(He didn't know if he was trying
to find his way out)

47
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,840
(or go deeper.)

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
(What was he searching for)

49
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,919
(in those snowy peaks?)

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,879
(Please bear with me)

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,639
(as I continue with the story.)

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,130
=Adventure Behind The Bronze Door=

53
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,590
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

54
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:53,460
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 1=

55
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,000
(Zhang Qiling)

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,520
(While he was searching for his memory,)

57
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,840
(he ventured
into the Zhang Family Ancient Tower,)

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,090
(hidden deep
in the southwestern mountains.)

59
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,159
(It's said to be a family shrine)

60
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,560
(with clues about his past.)

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,759
(Zhang Qiling has been missing)

62
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,240
(for days
after exploring the underground caves.)

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,439
(Fatty and I went)

64
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,000
(to rescue him.)

65
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,990
(Zhang Family Ancient Tower's Entrance
To Zhang Qiling's Rescue)

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,780
It's safe for now.

67
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,120
Naive,

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
detach your gear.

69
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,399
Fatty.

70
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,400
(Young Wu Xie)

71
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,040
Use the intercom.

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
There might be a signal.

73
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,279
Okay.

74
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,800
Qiling, do you copy?

75
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,120
This is Wu Xie.

76
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,680
Fatty and I are coming for you.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,890
Zhang Qiling,
respond if you hear us.

78
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:14,678
(Young Wang Fatty)

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,839
Be careful.

80
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,319
I read about this in Grandpa's notes.

81
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,990
Ancient people used jade disks

82
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,079
to keep a creature called
the Mystic Claw.

83
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,639
It's dangerous here.

84
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,290
We need to move quickly.

85
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,759
I know that.

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on.

87
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,560
It's the Zhang Family Ancient Tower.

88
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,680
We've finally arrived.

89
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,639
That was no easy task.

90
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,879
Zhang Qiling!

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,720
Let's go.

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,480
We need to see it for ourselves
whether he's alive or not.

93
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,560
Isn't that what you said?

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,480
Zhang Family Ancient Tower

95
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
is Qiling's family shrine.

96
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,839
Let's explore it.

97
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
Why is this place covered

98
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,519
in white dust everywhere?

99
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,680
This place is huge.

100
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,319
Let's start looking around
to see if we can find Qiling's trace.

101
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,490
What kind of family

102
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,800
is the Zhang family?

103
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,399
Fatty,

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
the footprints lead this way.

105
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,360
Fatty,

106
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
the tracks are scattered here.

107
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
They must have run into something.

108
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,399
There are signs

109
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,960
of a fight everywhere.

110
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,200
There are claw marks too.

111
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,480
With all these signs of a struggle,

112
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,279
Qiling must have been involved.

113
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,679
Only Qiling could
do something this intense.

114
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
What is that?

115
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
It's the Mystic Claw!

116
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,919
Shoot it! Use the crossbow!

117
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's move.

118
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,759
Something melted here.

119
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
Any ideas?

120
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,890
Qiling brought quite
a few people with him.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,240
But he's injured.

122
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,279
How did you know?

123
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,519
We must hurry.

124
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,480
Can't you explain it clearly?

125
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,720
There are no footprints here.

126
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,679
What now?

127
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
After all this mess,

128
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
the tracks are all mixed up.

129
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,600
I recognize Qiling's footprints.

130
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,919
Come on,

131
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,440
show me a footprint.

132
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,600
Fatty.

133
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,039
Knife.

134
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,720
He couldn't be here.

135
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,320
These are all books.

136
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,000
This must be a collection
of ancient texts

137
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,000
about the Zhang family history.

138
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,600
So many rooms are packed with them.

139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
How big

140
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,399
must the Zhang family be?

141
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,159
When we find Qiling,

142
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,480
he'll have to tell us all about it.

143
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,399
(At that moment,)

144
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,380
(I saw the whole interior
of the Zhang Family Ancient Tower.)

145
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,559
(I was completely astonished)

146
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,320
(at the kind of place this is.)

147
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,399
(Why does Zhang Qiling's
family shrine look like this?)

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
(Then I realized)

149
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,240
(I knew nothing about Zhang Qiling.)

150
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,720
(But what I didn't know)

151
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
(was that what was coming next)

152
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,799
(would be the nightmare of my life.)

153
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,639
The footprints end here.

154
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,399
Naive,

155
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,600
do you smell that?

156
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Darn it!

157
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,360
What's happened?

158
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,240
It might be the flare we fired
that had ignited the wooden floor.

159
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,000
I told you

160
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,399
to be careful.

161
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
How is that my fault?

162
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,440
Isn't it because you just...

163
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,679
Was this here before?

164
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,480
This gear looks like

165
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,759
what Qiling's team wore.

166
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,080
He must have fallen from above.

167
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,799
We've found them.

168
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,639
Fatty, give me a lift.

169
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm getting old.

170
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,720
It's your turn to lift me.

171
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,759
Here I go.

172
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Hold my hand.

173
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,160
It was such a dangerous situation.

174
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,599
We didn't even come with Qiling.

175
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,160
Seeing all this mess,

176
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,119
it felt like we were not loyal enough.

177
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,039
Where's Qiling?

178
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,680
Qiling.

179
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,279
Fatty.

180
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:18,880
Fatty!

181
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,119
Qiling.

182
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
Qiling, open your eyes.

183
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,839
Qiling, wake up.

184
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,400
Qiling.

185
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,359
Open your eyes.

186
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,839
Open your eyes.

187
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,559
You don't know him at all.

188
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,039
Do you know who he is?

189
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
Stop pretending.

190
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,759
You don't know him at all.

191
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,680
Do you know who he is?

192
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,039
Stop pretending.

193
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,319
You don't know him at all.

194
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,039
Do you know who he is?

195
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,440
You don't know him at all.

196
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,119
Do you know who he is?

197
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,880
Stop pretending.

198
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,079
You don't know him at all.

199
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,599
I know him.

200
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
Do you know who he is?

201
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I know.

202
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,759
You don't know him at all.

203
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,319
I know him!

204
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,240
(Qiling didn't die.)

205
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,559
(He survived)

206
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,880
(by lowering his heart rate)

207
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
(through bloodletting.)

208
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,119
(But he didn't fully recover his memory)

209
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,200
(in the Zhang Family Ancient Tower.)

210
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
(After we rescued him,)

211
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,319
(we thought we'd continue searching)

212
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,799
(for his memories and past together.)

213
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,079
(But I never expected)

214
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,279
(he had to go away for ten years
to solve a huge problem,)

215
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,590
(which should have been mine to solve.)

216
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,079
There were

217
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,559
some serious issues involved.

218
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,430
(Yunding Heavenly Palace, Mountain Rift Entrance.
Zhang Qiling, before entering the Bronze Door)

219
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,880
Someone needs to go in and fix them
every now and then.

220
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,279
Ten years from now,

221
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
you can come back here

222
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,240
if you still remember me.

223
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:49,960
Maybe

224
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,160
you'll see me again.

225
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,279
(Ten years.)

226
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
(It was only later)

227
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,839
(that I found out that the one
who was supposed to keep guard)

228
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:04,690
(Zhang Family Ancient Tower)

229
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,119
(was actually me.)

230
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,880
(He hid the truth)

231
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,319
(and endured ten years of torment
in my place.)

232
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,160
(I was overwhelmed with guilt.)

233
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,480
(So I made up my mind)

234
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
(to do something)

235
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
(during those ten years.)

236
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,359
(I would find out
why he lost his memory.)

237
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,799
(I hope to see him again)

238
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,200
(and learn his secrets.)

239
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,740
(Several years later. Wuzhou)

240
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,580
(Wu Xie)

241
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,119
(This string of beads
that Qiling left behind)

242
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,799
(is my only clue now.)

243
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,279
(I know it's not going to be easy.)

244
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,279
(But some things)

245
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,400
(have to be done)

246
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,400
(no matter how hard they are.)

247
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
This kind of jewelry is pretty common.

248
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,756
(Xie Yuchen, Master Hua.
Antique Dealer. Wu Xie's Childhood Friend)

249
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,279
Xiu, take a look to see what this is.

250
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,880
The bead is an organic gemstone,

251
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,839
typically called a moonstone.

252
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,920
Its toughness allows

253
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,319
for incredibly detailed micro-carvings.

254
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,799
To hide information,

255
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
they usually engrave it

256
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,119
around the hole.

257
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,759
Even though it looks worn,

258
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,319
there are still

259
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
some hidden clues on it.

260
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,079
It's a scorpion.

261
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,960
Scorpions have
a lot of symbolic meanings

262
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,319
in traditional designs.

263
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
Can you help me trace
the origin of this pattern?

264
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
Don't worry.

265
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,540
I'll try online, newspapers,
my connections,

266
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,759
and everything I can use

267
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
to help you find it.

268
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,359
This pattern has to mean something.

269
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,720
I have a feeling
it's the key to something.

270
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm in the jewelry business.

271
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,079
I've never seen this material before.

272
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,279
The comment above is nonsense.

273
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,319
I've seen a bead like this
at my grandma's place.

274
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,170
I've come across similar stones
in the Mingchun area.

275
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,680
But the carvings weren't scorpions.

276
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,390
The person commenting
above is knowledgeable.

277
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,920
Let's be friends.
It's fate that we've met.

278
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,690
No, I've never seen
a bead like this before.

279
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,440
Could it be made
from a synthetic material?

280
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,359
(Every lead I've followed)

281
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,990
(over the years has
either been a dead end)

282
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
(or a prank.)

283
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
(I never expected)

284
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,400
(the most important clue)

285
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,759
(to show up in this way.)

286
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,000
Third Master, wishing you good fortune!

287
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,759
Get lost.

288
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,319
Wait, Third Master.

289
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,599
After...

290
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,519
After all these years,

291
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,160
your temper hasn't changed a bit?

292
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,119
Jin Wantang, enough talking.

293
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,480
If it weren't for you,

294
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,920
would I be entangled
in so many ridiculous situations?

295
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,759
Before I decide to beat you up,

296
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,240
get out of my sight now.

297
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,319
Third Master, I have something for you.

298
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,190
(Jin Wantang came
because of the scorpion bead.)

299
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,690
(He seems to have
some important information.)

300
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,039
(I've heard his story once.)

301
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,060
(But it's hard to tell
if it's true or not.)

302
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,920
(You should hear him out.)

303
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,680
(Once I'm done here,)

304
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,079
(I'll come to discuss it with you.)

305
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,380
Third Master, you're pretty meticulous.

306
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,759
You even prepared some beer.

307
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,160
Just cut to the chase.

308
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,000
Master Hua is loaded.

309
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
So I'm sure he's already paid you.

310
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,640
I don't need to pay again, right?

311
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,480
Third Master,

312
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,590
I'll walk out right now
if you start talking money with me.

313
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,960
I saw you put out a notice,

314
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
searching for the origin
of that scorpion pattern.

315
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,039
Don't you find

316
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,839
that design is very strange?

317
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,880
If I'm not mistaken,

318
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,119
it's related to that kid, Zhang.

319
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,440
Take a look at this.

320
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,759
The descendant
of a wealthy man surnamed Ma wanted

321
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,119
to sell this off

322
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,540
when their family fortunes declined.

323
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,160
One of my guys happened to see it
and thought the bead could be valuable.

324
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,290
So he brought it to me,
hoping I'd sell it for a good price.

325
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
When I saw it,

326
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,039
I realized it was identical
to your bead.

327
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,319
This guy

328
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,920
even showed me
a memoir from his grandfather

329
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,119
to boost the bead's value.

330
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,440
It tells a story.

331
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,680
Bring it here.

332
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,480
(Many Years Ago.
Maba Town, Ma'an Village)

333
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,200
His grandfather was Ma Pingchuan,

334
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,599
a wealthy man in Ma'an Village.

335
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,880
Behind the village was a mountain

336
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,160
shaped like the Wuqu star.

337
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,119
Since the Wuqu star is associated
with wealth,

338
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,200
the Ma family decided

339
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,720
to claim the mountain

340
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,799
and move their ancestral graves there.

341
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,319
But that same year,

342
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:50,279
something strange happened
on the mountain.

343
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
What's this?

344
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
What happened?

345
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,319
How did this happen?

346
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,400
What happened?

347
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,559
Why is everything black?

348
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,359
(Ma Pingchuan immediately felt)

349
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,880
(something was wrong with that place)

350
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
(and decided to move the graves again.)

351
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,960
(But when they started digging,)

352
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,039
(they went down over ten meters.)

353
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,519
Can you guess what happened?

354
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,920
They didn't find a single coffin.

355
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,839
Not only that, all the plants
within a hundred-mile radius

356
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,079
had withered away.

357
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,160
After a thorough investigation,

358
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,519
Ma Pingchuan discovered

359
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,480
that all the missing graves

360
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,599
were concentrated in the area
where the plants had died.

361
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,559
Dear ancestors, please watch over us.

362
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,440
Master!

363
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,640
Master!

364
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,839
Something happened.

365
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,519
Please make way.

366
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,240
Master.

367
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,160
Who did it?

368
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,839
Master,

369
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,599
it suddenly turned out like this.

370
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,799
The color of the plants

371
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,839
and the ground

372
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,519
is the same as the mountain.

373
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,799
If it weren't for something unclean
in the Ma family...

374
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,480
Nonsense!

375
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,119
Someone is playing a trick here.

376
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,880
A trick!

377
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,359
You're right, Master.

378
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,519
(The Ma residence
became tightly guarded and impenetrable)

379
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,599
(That kid)

380
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,400
(suddenly showed up
on the roof of his house.)

381
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
Someone!

382
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,759
Yes, Master.

383
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,720
Get him down from there now.

384
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,759
I know

385
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,759
