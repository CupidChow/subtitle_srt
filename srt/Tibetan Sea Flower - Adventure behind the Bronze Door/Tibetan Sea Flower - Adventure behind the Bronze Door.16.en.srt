=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 16=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,019
Don't the people of Zhang family

5
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,830
live quite a long life?

6
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,910
Why is Zhang Nian still trying to use the power
of authoritative people to study immortality?

7
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,800
We can be immortal

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,699
but the people who love us

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,059
and the people who we love

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,599
are not immortal.

11
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,380
What is the purpose
of us being immortal then?

12
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,390
In other words,

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,470
if immortality
cannot be given to other people,

14
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,489
what is our purpose

15
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,910
to other people?

16
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,329
So, Zhang Nian really loves his wife.

17
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,790
So, Zhang Nian

18
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,630
really hates the patriarch.

19
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,910
No.

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,160
The logic is not right.

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,120
After his wife dies,

22
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,400
Zhang Nian was supposed
to think about how to kill Qiling.

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,720
Why did he have to find
the Heavenly Staff then?

24
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,489
Because Zhang Nian knew

25
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,986
he couldn't kill the patriarch
with his ability

26
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,769
so he wanted the Heavenly Staff

27
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,910
and used it to control the Night King.

28
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,889
This is his only chance to get revenge.

29
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,000
What did you say?

30
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,030
The Heavenly Staff
can control the Night King?

31
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,470
I don't know.

32
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,320
Perhaps the patriarch
might give you hints

33
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,840
when you obtain the Heavenly Staff.

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,070
You are still lying to me now.

35
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,379
I told you.

36
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,979
I'm just telling you

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,510
everything I know.

38
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,400
You can decide whether it's true or not.

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,790
Keep talking.

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,489
Zhang Nian wants
to obtain the Heavenly Staff.

41
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,400
You are a very important part of his plan

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,070
because you are the only one
who can get the Heavenly Staff.

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,859
However, he was not confident
that he could trick you

44
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,840
so

45
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,680
he came up with a plan.

46
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,350
Be clear.

47
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,070
Do you know

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,350
why Wang Jinyuan
wasn't surprised to see you

49
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,950
and even told you
where the key was hidden?

50
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,160
Because I convinced him.

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,160
Wang Jinyuan experienced

52
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,120
the same situation seven times.

53
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,209
Zhang Nian also tried

54
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,000
to find the key
in the depths of the Old Niles

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,489
but he encountered

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,470
a disaster beyond his imagination.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,329
(He tried to find the key a few times)

58
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,880
(Many years later)
(but he failed.)

59
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,699
Later, he heard about a person

60
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,150
called Wang Jinyuan.

61
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,040
He knows he must go through Wang Jinyuan

62
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,320
to obtain the key.

63
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,739
However, Wang Jinyuan

64
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,019
won't tell anyone else the truth

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,270
besides the patriarch.

66
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,139
Until a few years ago,

67
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,819
the patriarch had
something more important to do

68
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,089
than dealing with the Night King

69
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,750
and entered the Bronze Door.

70
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,830
That place contains
the knowledge of everything.

71
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,680
Zhang Nian obtained a tape
left behind by the patriarch.

72
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,830
In the end, he thought
if someone could impersonate you,

73
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,590
Wang Jinyuan would be tricked.

74
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,190
What is your name?

75
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,560
How is your recovery
from the plastic surgery?

76
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,769
Then,

77
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,769
he could ask about the key's whereabouts

78
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,390
and obtain the Heavenly Staff.

79
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,070
So, Zhang Nian found a few people

80
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,379
who looked like you to meet Wang Jinyuan

81
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,830
behind our backs.

82
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,209
However, these people

83
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,390
did not pass Wang Jinyuan's test.

84
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,619
Wang Jinyuan realised
something fishy was going on

85
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,480
so he gave them fake locations.

86
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,000
At the fake Old Niles,

87
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,750
only death

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,440
was waiting for them.

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,510
The fake Old Niles were full of traps.

90
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,329
After they were killed,

91
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,070
their bodies would sink and disappear
into the traps.

92
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,750
Zhang Nian tried seven times.

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,969
He lost his rationality

94
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,680
after consecutive failures.

95
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,830
However, he couldn't vent it
on Wang Jinyuan.

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,950
He could only blame his own subordinates

97
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,750
for not finding a person
who resembles you the most.

98
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,409
Since Zhang Nian's style

99
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,950
was too cruel,

100
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,560
his subordinates

101
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,379
could not take it in the end

102
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,630
and betrayed him.

103
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,400
Later, there was once
when Haixing and I returned to Dejia

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
after we were done with our work,

105
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,510
one of Zhang Nian's subordinates
came to find us

106
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,920
and told us everything honestly.

107
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,270
That was when we realised

108
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,390
everything Zhang Nian did.

109
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,120
The people in these seven photos
have one similarity.

110
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,920
All of them look like Wu Xie.

111
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,590
This person is very elusive.

112
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,920
It took a long time for us to find him.

113
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,040
We thought

114
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,360
this matter was very serious

115
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,649
so we decided

116
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,000
to stop Zhang Nian.

117
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,070
Zhang Nian,

118
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,710
give up.

119
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,000
The Zhang family is no more.

120
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,480
What I do is none of your business.

121
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,889
What you are doing

122
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,710
will put more people in danger.

123
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,320
We must stop you.

124
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,320
Zhang Qiling caused my wife's death.

125
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,710
I have nothing now.

126
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,630
Why do I need to care about others?

127
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,190
Haike,

128
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,579
I think he won't listen.

129
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,089
We should just arrest him.

130
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,499
You should know

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,649
that you were the one
who caused the incident back then.

132
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,409
The patriarch had nothing to do
with your wife's death.

133
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,040
Stop talking to him.

134
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,139
Zhang Nian

135
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,240
didn't appear
for a few years after that.

136
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,209
No one knew where he went

137
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,520
or what he did.

138
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,499
From the things he left behind,

139
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,889
we found

140
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,640
the videotape left behind
by the patriarch

141
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,640
and understood what really happened.

142
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,710
That was when we started
to take notice of you.

143
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,520
After receiving a letter
from the Yinsha Tribe,

144
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,710
we lured you to Mosang

145
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,470
to complete the patriarch's mission.

146
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,590
So, killing Night King

147
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,280
wasn't a mission given to you by Qiling.

148
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,800
It was a mission
the patriarch left for you.

149
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,830
Naive.

150
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,640
Did you get bullied?

151
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,680
Why did all of you come here?

152
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,040
It's as you mentioned.

153
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,230
This is the Zhang family's matter.

154
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,760
I also want to see

155
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,780
why the patriarch chose you.

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,070
What about Zhang Jiuri?

157
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,160
To be honest, I don't know as well.

158
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,110
After leaving the Zhang Residence,

159
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,920
we lost contact with him.

160
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,929
Perhaps something happened

161
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,470
between him and the patriarch.

162
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,339
You can ask him yourself

163
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,640
after you leave this place.

164
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,320
Have you believed them?

165
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,920
We have the initiative.

166
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,070
I'll be keeping the key for now.

167
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,680
Of course.

168
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,350
You tricked me to come here

169
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,920
to ask me these things.

170
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,350
It's easy to do things
when we are a harmonious group.

171
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,619
Feng's men are coming.

172
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,440
It's illogical
to use the same route to go back.

173
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,800
What should we do?

174
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,739
You've chatted for so long

175
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,590
but nothing happened on top.

176
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,680
Even if Feng is a tortoise,

177
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,590
he should still be here by now.

178
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,320
From what you mentioned,

179
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,520
Zhang Nian is good at ambushing people.

180
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,259
In that case,

181
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,920
he should be waiting to ambush

182
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,190
and kill us at the entrance
with Feng's men.

183
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,800
Do you have any ideas?

184
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,649
Going back is not an option.

185
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,019
We can only go forward.

186
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,459
Perhaps we can find a way out.

187
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,110
We can just go out directly.

188
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,859
Let's go.

189
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,920
Wait.

190
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,230
Do you think I've kept it?

191
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,800
I only have one move.

192
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,950
You said

193
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,800
we were going out.

194
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,070
What's wrong?

195
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,990
We only have one key

196
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,520
but you said we should go out.

197
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,070
Do you already have the third key?

198
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,280
Was it the thing you burned just now?

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,040
I was honest with you.

200
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,110
You should also be honest with me.

201
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,710
All of you are sly.

202
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,920
It seems like the patriarch
chose the right person.

203
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,800
The only thing we need now

204
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,680
is the key in Feng's hands.

205
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,080
We'll plan for that key later.

206
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,320
We should think of a way
to leave this place for now.

207
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,800
Let's go.

208
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,979
We've set up the ambush.

209
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,400
Waiting for Wu Xie.

210
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,870
How is it?

211
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,560
This is not right.

212
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,280
According to the structure I deduced,

213
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,649
this place

214
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,950
should be near the lotus-shaped maze.

215
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,470
Did I make the wrong calculation?

216
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,280
This is a secret door.

217
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,649
I don't have to say anything.

218
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,160
You still need to rely on us in the end.

219
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,920
Did you find this by chance again?

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,190
Why are you being so sarcastic?

221
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,110
Ignore him. Come and take a look.

222
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,049
Did they put oil on this?

223
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,560
There's no sound when you open it.

224
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,019
Come here!

225
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,990
What is it?

226
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,110
The Denaxi are waiting outside.

227
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,190
Feng?

228
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,760
This guy have become sly.
He only lies in wait to ambush us.

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,689
Feng calculated our escape route.

230
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,190
We can't use this path.

231
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,219
Haixing and I will act as cover.

232
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,990
Both of you bring the key out.

233
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,739
Go first. I'll bring up the rear.

234
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,689
We have two keys now.

235
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,889
We only need the one Feng has.

236
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,259
A female warrior indeed.

237
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,649
Let's go.

238
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,680
No.

239
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,920
There are too many of them.

240
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,680
It is also too dangerous
for you to be alone.

241
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,350
We can't force our way out.

242
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,169
Let's think of something

243
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,889
and see if we can find another way out.

244
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,830
What else can you think of?

245
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,160
Come here.

246
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,950
All of you, run.

247
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,630
She feels at home
in an environment like this.

248
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,910
She can deal with it.

249
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,609
Feng put the key

250
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,670
in the left pocket of his coat.

251
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,800
Keeping things like this
is underestimating us.

252
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,910
We still need to depend on ourselves.

253
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,040
Hans!

254
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,430
After her!

255
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,590
She got the key.

256
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,280
Surround her! Quick!

257
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,520
This way!

258
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,870
Give it back to me.

259
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,240
You have nowhere to run.

260
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,000
After her!

261
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,910
How is that even possible?

262
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,720
No human can do that.

263
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,430
She can.

264
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,800
She is Zhang Haixing.

265
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,350
Haike.

266
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,049
I got the key.

267
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,320
Let's go.

268
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,630
Be careful.

269
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,569
Don't move.

270
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,809
Where is this place?

271
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,019
Why are there so many rag dolls?

272
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,800
Naive, did you take a wrong turn?

273
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,809
I'm taking the shortest route.

274
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,070
I can no longer get lost in this maze.

275
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,110
Heading in this direction
will take us to the exit quickly.

276
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,219
Let me go.

277
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,200
Let me go.

278
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,200
Go!

279
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,000
Gosh, who are you trying to scare?

280
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,630
You've finally seen a real rag doll.

281
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,335
I've got myself covered the whole way.

282
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,480
Get lost.

283
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,849
This should be

284
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,480
the place where they make the rag dolls.

285
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,870
What is this?

286
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,430
Be careful.

287
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,040
Fatty.

288
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,070
Does this look familiar to you?

289
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,320
We saw one before this.

290
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,350
It talked about Kumuli and Snake.

291
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,590
I wonder what this is about.

292
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,800
Do you want to do it?

293
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,830
You do it.

294
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,910
Here it comes.

295
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,110
This seems to talk about

296
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,630
a group of people who walked out

297
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,200
of the snow mountains

298
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,430
many years ago.

299
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,870
They catch snakes at Kumuli.

300
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,960
Kumuli's king sent people
to talk to them.

301
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,089
These people said
they were going to the snow mountains

302
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,630
to hunt a monster.

303
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,630
Snakes were its food.

304
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,320
They wanted to use snakes
to make a trap.

305
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,240
So, Kumuli's king sent an army

306
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,070
to go to the snow mountain with them.

307
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,369
They made a trap with snakes

308
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,200
and killed the monster for real.

309
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,110
To thank the king,

310
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,000
these people treated his illness

311
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,910
and the king lived a long life.

312
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,520
The king felt his longevity

313
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,000
was related to the monster they hunted

314
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,320
so he bred many snakes in secret

315
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,040
and planned to defeat the monster alone
in the future

316
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,760
and find a way to immortality.

317
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,110
However, the snakes multiplied

318
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,040
until they became a disaster

319
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,390
and even mutated into giant snakes.

320
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,110
Later, there was an earthquake

321
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,000
that caused the whole place
to sink under the ground.

322
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,480
The group of people who hunted
the monster returned to the place.

323
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,480
They inspected
the condition of Old Kumuli

324
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,150
and built

325
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,150
a large box here

326
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:27,551
with the surviving Kumuli residents

327
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,560
to suppress the snakes by trapping a part
of the monster inside the box.

328
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,960
These mutated snakes

329
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,520
were terrified of the monster.

330
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,720
That was how

331
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,849
the Kumuli people

332
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,870
sealed them in the depths of Old Kumuli.

333
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,200
It's all connected now.

334
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,960
Kumuli bred snakes.

335
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,800
Later, the snakes became a disaster

336
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,110
due to war

337
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,390
and greed.

338
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,320
The dynasty fell.

339
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,320
The monster in the mountain
they mentioned

340
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,200
must be Night King.

341
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,350
The snakes are Night King's food.

342
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,430
It's unlikely.

343
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,369
We've looked around for half a day

344
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,430
but we only found rag dolls
and some small snakes.

345
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,350
There are no mutated giant snakes.

346
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,830
If they exist,

347
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,200
they should be deeper underground.

348
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,240
Perhaps Qiling didn't go there before.

349
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,419
I wonder how dangerous the place is

350
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,830
since the patriarch did not go there.

351
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,259
We shouldn't stay any longer.

352
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,289
Since we got the key,
we should leave immediately.

353
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,200
All right.

354
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,200
Let's go, Fatty.

355
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,329
Why did you wear this rag again?

356
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,590
Take it off.

357
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,110
Fatty?

358
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,960
Fatty.

359
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,150
Zhang Jiuri?

360
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,320
Why are you here?

361
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm here
to kill Zhang Qiling's hatchet men.

362
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,430
Did Zhang Nian ask you to come here?

363
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,520
He did come to find me

364
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,569
but I'm not working with him.

365
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,040
Let go of Fatty.

366
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,720
Fatty!

367
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,000
Fatty!

368
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,480
Fatty!

369
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,129
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

370
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,070
Wu Xie.

371
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,259
I was pretending.

372
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,200
You look very different
from how I imagined you to be.

373
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,390
If you die,

374
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,390
will Zhang Qiling suffer?

375
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,070
What does it have to do with you?

376
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm just curious.

377
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,430
Zhang Jiuri, right?

378
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,590
According to
how you did things previously,

379
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,390
you are supposed to ambush us
from the shadows.

380
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,320
You are outnumbered now.

381
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,480
Since you can stand here,

382
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,760
it means
you are planning something else.

383
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,089
Tell us

384
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,720
and not waste each other's time.

385
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,659
Don't you want to talk?

386
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,870
There's no need.

387
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,830
All right.

388
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,289
Don't worry

389
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,960
about ambushing you.

390
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,560
Besides,

391
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,979
didn't you realize

392
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,560
there's something special
about this place?

393
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,179
This was a place

394
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,480
where sorcery was performed in Kumuli.

395
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,560
They used a strong psychedelic drug

396
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,520
to make people hallucinate
and think the rag dolls were moving.

397
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,979
The rag dolls are covered in that drug.

398
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,760
They are very hallucinogenic.

399
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,590
Anyone who comes here will be trapped.

400
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,430
Stop making up stories to scare us.

401
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,289
We knew

402
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,910
the rag dolls contained snakes.

403
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,820
Those contained snakes.
These contain psychedelic drugs.

404
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,259
The king of Kumuli

405
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,720
was a useless king who loved sorcery

406
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,240
yet the whole capital adored him.

407
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,200
Later, the king
was unsatisfied with snake performances

408
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,659
and tried various new tricks.

409
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,369
God couldn't stand him
and destroyed all these things.

410
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,419
You'll be trapped

411
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,280
if you are careless
while walking around this place.

412
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,070
So?

413
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,040
I was very unlucky.

414
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,699
I got trapped

415
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,110
the moment I came here.

416
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,070
The drug is strong.

417
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,830
All of you are the only people I found.

418
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,720
We must work together now.

419
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,070
Otherwise,
all of us will be trapped here.

420
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,899
You've lived long enough.

421
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,040
Are you still afraid of dying?

422
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,569
I don't mind living longer.

423
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,089
I'll be the one who lives the longest
besides the patriarch.

424
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,529
Maybe you ran out of bullets

425
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,110
and wanted to approach us
before finding an opportunity to strike.

426
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,430
Leave. I'm not stopping you.

427
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,870
I'll admit defeat
if you can leave this place.

428
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,040
Let's go, Fatty.

429
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,430
Fatty!

430
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,960
See you later.

431
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,110
This way.

432
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,590
This place is no different

433
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,609
from the previous maze.

434
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,000
The exit should be right in front.

435
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,219
Why is he pretending?

436
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,849
Hurry.

437
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,910
Let that fool wait there alone.

438
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,040
Someone's there.

439
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,670
Be careful.

440
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,910
Go and take a look.

441
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,720
Move.

442
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,150
Take two more steps.

443
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,150
Don't move.

444
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,000
Back up.

445
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,590
They are imitating you.

446
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,760
This is so creepy.

447
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,280
What are they wearing?

448
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,280
We've never seen such outfits before.

449
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,110
These are also

450
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,289
the outfits of Niles sorcery.

451
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,670
It must be those snakes.

452
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,350
Zhang Haike,

453
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,070
go and take a look.

454
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,259
Didn't you see
that their steps and speed

455
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,830
are the same as ours?

456
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,280
The rag dolls controlled by snakes

457
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,849
weren't as well-coordinated.

458
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,219
Take off your clothes

459
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,040
and they will remove the clothes.

460
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,480
Remove them.

461
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,769
Remove them!

462
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,179
Why aren't you removing yours?

463
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,760
Don't pull my pants!

464
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,320
Dumpling.

465
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,430
Should we run?

466
00:32:58,223 --> 00:32:59,670
Fatty, listen to me.

467
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,760
Don't move.

468
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,870
The three of us will slowly turn around.

469
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,739
See what their faces look like

470
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,200
and tell us.

471
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,720
Why should I look at them?

472
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,979
There's not enough light.
I can't see clearly.

473
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,520
You have better eyesight than me.

474
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,670
All of you should run.

475
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,040
Fatty.

476
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,699
What's going on?

477
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,480
Don't move.

478
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,129
If you turn around,

479
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,280
they will rush here.

480
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,240
Having fun?

481
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,569
This zone only has a dozen of rag dolls

482
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,779
but all of you can't escape.

483
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,939
I already tried it.

484
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,950
Got it. A treadmill, right?

485
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,459
No matter where you go,
you will still remain here.

486
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,859
Do you have a way to leave this place?

487
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,979
I have.

488
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,609
However, you can't do it alone

489
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,200
and need us to work with you.

490
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,200
Yes.

491
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,950
We can talk about working together now.

492
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,899
Can we have a chat before that?

493
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,390
We are running out of time.

494
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,470
I'm not asking you. I'm asking him.

495
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,120
What do you want to talk about?

496
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,160
If you die,

497
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,419
will Zhang Qiling suffer?

498
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,609
What does it have to do with you?

499
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,200
Are you crazy?
You are always asking me this question.

500
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,800
Do you not dare answer the question?

501
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,350
A normal person
won't consider this question.

502
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,510
I'm not normal perhaps.

503
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,950
Just think of me as a lunatic.

504
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,499
Can't you think about it

505
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,160
in order to leave this place alive?

506
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,830
I don't know.

507
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,220
I don't even know

508
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,800
if he still remembers me
when he comes out.

509
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,320
I'll ask you a second question.

510
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,280
Your performance on your way here

511
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,280
felt familiar.

512
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,510
The way you do things
resembles Zhang Qiling.

513
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,280
However, you know

514
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,569
Zhang Qiling can protect
the people around him

515
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,280
because he is capable.

516
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,910
Your ability is all over the place.

517
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,779
How did you do it?

518
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,470
What are you trying to ask?

519
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,160
Are you actually Zhang Qiling?

520
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,950
Are you fooling with Zhang Nian?

521
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,200
Hey.

522
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,649
You are an adult.

523
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,430
Are you fooling around with me?

524
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,609
I'm Wu Xie.

525
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,939
I'm not wearing a mask.
I'm not Zhang Qiling, all right?

526
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,689
You saved all of them.

527
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,080
You are supposed to be the weakest
but you've been saving people.

528
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,120
How did you do it
if you weren't Zhang Qiling?

529
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,870
I just don't want bad things
to happen to people around me.

530
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,049
Is this a fairy tale?

531
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,499
You know you can't do it.

532
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,390
I think I can do it.

533
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,339
Were you sure that no harm would come to
the people around you in your life before this?

534
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,307
Not absolutely

535
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,569
but I think there's always a way

536
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,649
to save everyone.

537
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,200
Beginner's luck.

538
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,640
What?

539
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,299
Every gambler wins

540
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,299
on their first bet.

541
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,510
Beginner's luck.

542
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,800
What are you trying to tell me?

543
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,800
You are overestimating yourself.

544
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,800
My judgment is right.

545
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,200
Zhang Nian is full of bluffs.

546
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,360
It's not worth it for Zhang Qiling
to suffer because of you.

547
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,430
I agree.

548
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,240
You are another pitiful Wang Jinyuan.

549
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,800
Are you done?

550
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,609
You've talked for a long time.

551
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,120
How do we get out?

552
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,910
You are different indeed.

553
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,779
What a pity.

554
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,720
How should we get out?

555
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,120
Even if I kill you,
Zhang Qiling won't suffer.

556
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,430
He is talking to you.

557
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,080
I have no mood now.

558
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,870
Everything I told you was a lie.

559
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,550
Do you really believe me?

560
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,299
I was the one
who used the psychedelic drugs.

561
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,280
They won't affect you if you burn them.

562
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,240
We should leave.

563
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,680
Let's go.

564
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,240
Zhang Jiuri in the scroll

565
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,080
looks normal

566
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,080
but why is he
behaving like a lunatic now?

567
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,499
I don't know the details

568
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,680
but I've heard rumors.

569
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,459
We waited a long time back then

570
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,240
but we didn't have news
of the patriarch.

571
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,510
Later,

572
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,390
everyone started living their own lives.

573
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,800
Only Jiuri
was keeping the Scorpion Team's mark.

574
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,030
He went there every day.

575
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,979
He believed the patriarch
would keep his promise

576
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,350
and not abandon us.

577
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:01,720
Until one day,

578
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,080
we heard Jiuri's parents died.

579
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,720
Apparently, it was an accident.

580
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,129
Since then, he stopped going there

581
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,030
and no longer kept in touch with us.

582
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,609
So, he lost his chance
to save his own parents

583
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,680
because was waiting for Qiling.

584
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,990
It's quite sad

585
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,030
but this isn't Qiling's fault.

586
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,459
Does he hate Qiling

587
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,120
because of this?

588
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,550
Perhaps this is part of the reason.

589
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,600
Later, the patriarch came to Dejia.

590
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,160
Apparently, he met the patriarch once.

591
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,870
No one knows what happened.

592
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,569
However, he went crazy after that.

593
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,609
I think it's because

594
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,249
the patriarch didn't remember who he was.

595
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,049
Are you saying

596
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,689
that he is acting like this

597
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,339
because the patriarch forgot him?

598
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,089
You can't try

599
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,819
to understand a lunatic's logic.

600
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,249
Perhaps he is simply
finding a person to hate.

601
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,920
Many people from the Zhang family
are the same.

602
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,529
They live for too long and have no goals
yet they aren't willing to die.

603
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,880
They have no choice but to find a goal.

604
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,870
He can't beat the patriarch.

605
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,689
He is hating a person he can't kill

606
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,470
so he can live on forever.

607
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,899
The logic of people
who live long lives like you

608
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,720
cannot be comprehended by us indeed.

609
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,299
I'm sure normal people

610
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,440
think people from the Zhang family
aren't normal as well.

611
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:22,379
When Qiling came to Dejia last time,

612
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,280
did something happen as well?

613
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,320
Do you have any special stories

614
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,200
with Qiling?

615
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,870
Something did happen back then.

616
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,720
Is that all?

617
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,870
I'm afraid

618
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,910
you can't accept it
if I tell you everything.

619
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,950
Does it mean you won't tell me
for my own good?

620
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,680
You are really an old jerk.

621
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,950
What do you know?

622
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,990
Let's go.

623
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,280
Many things happened back then

624
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,200
but I have no time to tell you now.

625
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,089
Feng has Zhang Nian leading him.

626
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,680
He acts in an unorthodox way.

627
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,870
I'll tell you everything

628
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,160
when we leave this place.

629
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,550
Sure. It's a promise.

630
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,979
We'll reach the exit soon.

631
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,350
Do you think
Feng set up a second ambush here?

632
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,910
No.

633
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,249
I counted just now.

634
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,459
All of their men came down.

635
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,600
You are so meticulous.

636
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,080
Yes. It must be placed back
in its original spot.

637
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
You deserve to be praised.

638
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,870
We reached the exit.

639
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,350
They won't use the shortcut.

640
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,960
It takes a long time
for them to come out.

641
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,550
Everyone has been waiting here
for a long time.

642
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,430
Take a shower first.

643
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,240
Take a break.

644
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,760
We have a celebration banquet at night.
