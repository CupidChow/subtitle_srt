00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 9=

4
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,360
That was close.

5
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,200
This place really does have space.

6
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,640
The ship was just a decoy.

7
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,070
The bottom of the ship
has completely rotted out.

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,120
The humidity here is so high.

9
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,920
Everything is rotted
and clumped together.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
There's a deep space here.

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,710
Where does it lead to?

12
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's move forward and check it out.

13
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,490
These are the cargoes from the ship.

14
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,880
Why are they piled up here?

15
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,480
It's stacked in many layers.

16
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,710
I don't know if it's completely sealed.

17
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,480
Let's go in and see.

18
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,920
There's more space inside.

19
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
It looks like

20
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
they tried to seal it off
with these crates.

21
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,830
But they died halfway through.

22
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,830
But why?

23
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,230
The bodies outside are mummified.

24
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,830
But the ones inside are just bones.

25
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,540
Maybe the Heavenly Staff is in there.

26
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,930
Let's go inside and take a look.

27
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,830
Wait.

28
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,830
I've got a bad feeling about this.

29
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,870
The bodies outside and inside
are different.

30
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,270
Something's off.

31
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,950
Just to be safe,

32
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,600
let's seal it up like

33
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,950
the Zhang ancestors did.

34
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,320
What's wrong?

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,510
Nothing.

36
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,910
Let's split up and search.

37
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,030
Be extra careful.

38
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,240
It's the patriarch's remains.

39
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,470
I found it.

40
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,200
Why is my shadow in front of me?

41
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,680
Wait for me!

42
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,000
It's Jiuri.

43
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,510
What's wrong?

44
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,680
Something feels really weird.

45
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,880
Why is our shadow in front of us?

46
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
Why doesn't it look like a person?

47
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,880
What is this thing?

48
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,030
They're bugs.

49
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,800
They're imitating our shadows.

50
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,270
Get that punk. His blood can help us.

51
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,870
The Heavenly Staff is over there.

52
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
That punk, retrieve the Heavenly Staff.

53
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,470
Stop wasting time!

54
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,070
There's probably a trap
under the Heavenly Staff.

55
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
So be careful.

56
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,370
There are explosives under the bodies.

57
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,920
Don't make too much commotion.

58
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,110
The bugs are swarming at us.

59
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,570
We can't keep the commotion down!

60
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,470
Leave now.

61
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,920
These bugs are really creepy.

62
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,070
They pretended to be our shadows
and messed with us.

63
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,160
What's going on?

64
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,080
It must be a death trap set up

65
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,990
by the Zhang ancestors

66
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,030
to prevent intruders
from taking the Heavenly Staff.

67
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,280
The bodies in the caves

68
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,020
didn't seal the entrance
to keep things out.

69
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,400
But they were keeping the bugs in.

70
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,200
The battle back then
must've been brutal

71
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,580
which forced them

72
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,550
to seal themselves in and feed the bugs
just to protect the Heavenly Staff.

73
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,400
If it fell into the wrong hands,
it cannot be imagined.

74
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
These bugs are too dangerous.

75
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,950
We must not let them out.

76
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,160
This punk,

77
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,870
you've got the Heavenly Staff.

78
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
How about showing it to us?

79
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,160
All you care about
is the Heavenly Staff.

80
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,900
- Focus on staying alive first.
-  Let's go.

81
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,440
Who let the bugs out?

82
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,230
Go now.

83
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,830
You guys go first.

84
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,870
I guess this pond

85
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,870
was the final barrier
keeping the bugs in.

86
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:37,990
You punk,

87
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,660
good thing you knew how to get out,

88
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
or we'd be stuck in there.

89
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,710
Thank you.

90
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,520
We can finally go home now.

91
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,560
Bugs!

92
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,080
What's wrong?

93
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,950
The bugs!

94
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Where?

95
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
You fell for it, didn't you?
I was messing with you.

96
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,230
What's your problem?

97
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,440
Zhang Jiuri, you brat.

98
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

99
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,560
- Throw him into the pond.
- No!

100
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,080
One, two...

101
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,470
Enough, stop messing around.

102
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,670
What's wrong with you?

103
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,230
Hey,

104
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,570
are you sure you want to take it back?

105
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,870
You better don't go back with me.

106
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,520
This will be your last chance.

107
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,160
After we return,

108
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't know what's going to happen.

109
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,630
I may not be able to protect all of you.

110
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,870
What do you take us for?

111
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,440
We chose this ourselves.

112
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,870
So we'll face the consequences.

113
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,230
That's right.

114
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,040
The outcome may not be that bad.

115
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,670
It won't be worse
than those bugs, right?

116
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,990
You punk,

117
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,350
if finding the Heavenly Staff is a credit,

118
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,440
you need to make it clear to them
that it was our team effort.

119
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,800
That's right.

120
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,830
So, from now on, we're the Scorpion Team

121
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,110
that shares the ups

122
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,160
and downs.

123
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,990
- Great.
- Okay.

124
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,520
(Zhang Haike wasn't lying about this.)

125
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,590
(The Heavenly Staff truly exists.)

126
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,590
(But why did Qiling want
to be the patriarch so bad?)

127
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
(During the time I spent with him,)

128
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,040
(I never met his clan members
from his past)

129
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,870
(or friends visiting him.)

130
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,470
(What happened)

131
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,990

(it feels like
I'm getting closer to you,)

136
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,670
(yet still so far away.)

137
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,560
(What are the answers)

138
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,720

Qiling, don't worry.

147
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,280
I'll complete the tasks you assigned

148
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,630
and then bring you home.

149
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,110
I knew you would be here.

150
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,270
What are you thinking about?

151
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,670
I'm not going to escape anymore.

152
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,080
What did you discover this time?

153
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,080
Qiling,

154
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,670
the scroll's appearance
is too coincidental.

155
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,910
Is this what you wanted?

156
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,280
If the Zhang family deceived us once,

157
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,390
they could deceive us again.

158
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,670
How can Naive not know

159
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,520
such simple logic?

160
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
The scroll does mention

161
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,720
that Qiling and Zhang Haike
know each other.

162
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
The information

163
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,830
about Qiling taking on the Night King

164
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,170
that Zhang Haike mentioned matches
what Yu Da said.

165
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,350
Moreover, Feng's records show

166
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,970
that a lot of information
and murals related

167
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,520
to the Night King were found deep

168
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,870
in the snowy mountain.

169
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,830
So, the information we have obtained

170
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,040
should be true.

171
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,280
Initially, I never really believed

172
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,800
that Qiling wanted me
to help him with something.

173
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,190
But now I'm starting
to believe it a little.

174
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,080
Maybe he couldn't find anyone
he could trust

175
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,150
and had no other choice?

176
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,870
Naive,

177
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,910
you speak with such confidence
and self-doubt.

178
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,630
How do you manage to do that?

179
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm not sure either.

180
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,910
It could be part of a bigger scheme.

181
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,630
But if we don't get involved,

182
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,280
we'll never know the truth
about this information.

183
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,000
So, are you ready to go along with me?

184
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,190
Okay.

185
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,240
Okay, then.

186
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,180
Let's take it one step at a time.

187
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,590
Until we gather

188
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,910
new information,

189
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,150
we'll follow their lead

190
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,560
and their train of thought.

191
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,110
Think of it as investigating

192
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,150
the second Bronze Door.

193
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,350
If they show any flaws,

194
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,430
we'll adapt as needed.

195
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,150
Isn't that how it always is?

196
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,110
But have you really decided not to leave?

197
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,110
Yes.

198
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,240
I guess

199
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,670
this is my destiny.

200
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,280
To be deceived

201
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
and find a chance

202
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,520
to turn things around.

203
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,910
That's easy for you to say.

204
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,110
You accept your fate.

205
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,520
But do you expect your friend,

206
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,000
Wang Fatty to accept it too?

207
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,040
Answer me.

208
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,080
Are you accepting your fate

209
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
while dragging your friend
along with you?

210
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,720
So, whose side are we on now?

211
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,390
Mine, of course.

212
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,110
But I still haven't decided

213
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,520
who to work with.

214
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,190
These two groups

215
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,430
are after different things.

216
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,870
But we need to choose a side.

217
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,510
We can't keep muddling
through like this.

218
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,910
Did you get that, Qiling?

219
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,560
He doesn't know anything right now.

220
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
Fatty, if you really think

221
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,590
I'm impulsive and foolish,

222
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,430
you can grab a stone

223
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,240
or this log

224
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,720
to knock me out and drag me away.

225
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,480
Why don't you do it yourself?

226
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
You're going to blackmail me
for life after this.

227
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,630
So it's not about being impulsive.

228
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,470
You just can't face the consequences
of making the wrong decision.

229
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,630
If Qiling really asked me for this favor,

230
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,590
but I mistook it for a scam,

231
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,430
I can never forgive myself.

232
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,670
Qiling,

233
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,080
this is for you.

234
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,040
Now, it all makes sense.

235
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,240
But don't worry.

236
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,520
If he's in trouble,

237
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,830
I'll knock him out

238
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,720
and bring him back.

239
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,560
Give me five.

240
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,350
Go and take a look.

241
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Hurry.

242
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,110
Come on.

243
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,830
Inform the Zhang family members
to pack up and get ready to move.

244
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,590
Okay.

245
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,630
Where were you?

246
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,430
You guys were nowhere to be found.

247
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,470
Are you dizzy?
We've been here the whole time.

248
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,430
What's going on here?

249
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,910
The bell sounds different today.

250
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,320
Luku Day has started.

251
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,560
Every eighty years, during the odd year,

252
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,320
the day on the calendar
when Luku Day ends for the Yinsha tribe,

253
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,800
gold rain falls from the sky

254
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,670
and the Night King awakens
from deep within the snowy mountains

255
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,520
to slaughter every living thing
in the snow.

256
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
Is Night King coming?

257
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,670
Everything's packed.

258
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,480
Thanks.

259
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,870
Don't mention it.

260
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,390
Want some?

261
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
No.

262
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,910
Nothing left anyway.

263
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,190
These guys are really wary of us.

264
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,350
Can we still work together or not?

265
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,080
We'll play it by ear.

266
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,000
But that said,

267
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,150
since we've already chosen to cooperate,

268
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,520
we should figure out

269
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,830
which side we can trust more.

270
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,960
How about you listen as I break it down?

271
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,830
Okay, go ahead.

272
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,720
We're definitely the good guys, right?

273
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,720
Not necessarily.

274
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,270
Can you be a little more confident?

275
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,630
Let's assume we are.

276
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,000
- Okay, hypothetically.
- Okay.

277
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's assume we're the good guys.

278
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,040
If you look below,

279
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,390
there are two main factions.

280
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,280
One side is Feng,

281
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
and the other is Zhang Haike.

282
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,240
If both sides are good guys,

283
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,360
then it's a win-win situation for all
and we'll be the perfect partners, right?

284
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,870
I don't see it that way.

285
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
The Zhang family seems like
the good guys

286
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,350
because they're the Zhangs.

287
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,670
Feng, on the other hand,
looks like the bad guy.

288
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,000
Because of Zhang Haixing, right?

289
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,720
What does she have to do with this?

290
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,240
It's because of Zhang Qiling.

291
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,670
If you put it that way,

292
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,240
on the surface,

293
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,280
Feng seems like the good guy,
and Zhang Haike looks like the bad guy.

294
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,390
But according to your birth chart,

295
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,670
only Qiling and I are
a good match with you.

296
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,320
The rest are the bad guys.

297
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,760
This is so frustrating. Keep analyzing.

298
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,590
No, I'll stop here.

299
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,830
We're just guessing here.

300
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,240
We leave tomorrow morning.

301
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,960
So, we only have one night left.

302
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,720
How about this?

303
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,830
You go test Feng,

304
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,040
and I'll test Zhang Haike.

305
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,720
You should start packing now.

306
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,800
I thought you already packed.

307
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,080
Yes, I packed mine.

308
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,630
So I thanked you for nothing.

309
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
So,

310
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,720
what did you find out
after reading the scroll?

311
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,110
After reading it, I realized

312
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,910
you and Qiling had quite
a history together.

313
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,590
Since that's the case, you're a Zhang

314
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,720
and share the same lineage as Qiling.

315
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,150
Then

316
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,240
that makes us family now.

317
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,970
As we move forward
with this cooperation,

318
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,590
I'd like you to share more information

319
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,800
about the Night King with me.

320
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,700
Can you do that?

321
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,190
Come.

322
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,590
Let's see

323
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,110
if the beer is stronger.

324
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,350
Come.

325
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Or if I'm the stronger one.

326
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
The existence of the Night King

327
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,870
is unknown even within the Zhang family.

328
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,320
We only found out after watching
the tape left by the patriarch

329
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,830
and the distress signal
from the Yinsha Tribe.

330
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,720
So, I don't know much more

331
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,560
than you do.

332
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,110
I hope you'll be honest with me.

333
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,830
After running away earlier,

334
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,000
you've already shown

335
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,960
how scared you are of this.

336
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,480
I don't know what happened to you

337
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,240
or what changed in your mind.

338
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,000
But since you've decided to stay,

339
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
I hope you won't play

340
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,000
any more games.

341
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,280
Fair enough.

342
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,280
Honesty, it is.

343
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,560
So tell me honestly,

344
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,670
do you really plan to work with Feng?

345
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,870
From our perspective,

346
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,350
the information Feng shared
at the meeting

347
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,670
was worthless.

348
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,390
He only held the meeting

349
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,480
to figure out

350
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,630
the cards we have.

351
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,430
Plus, we haven't agreed on

352
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,960
what to do about the Night King's fate.

353
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,480
So this partnership is just
a temporary measure.

354
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,150
I am sure

355
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,520
once he's ready,

356
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,670
he'll secretly move

357
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,150
against us.

358
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,910
If that's what you think,

359
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,720
what's the plan moving forward?

360
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,830
We plan to act tonight.

361
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,390
Before that,

362
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,190
I hope you can come to a decision.

363
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,110
Also, you might want to have a word
with your friend and make sure

364
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,240
he doesn't cause any more trouble.

365
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,430
Feng!

366
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,350
Keep drinking.

367
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,350
Naive.

368
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,910
What's the matter?

369
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,000
I can't live without you.

370
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,280
What's wrong? You...

371
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,910
He's a freak.

372
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,040
Feng's nothing but a mad scientist.

373
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,350
He wants to dissect you alive.

374
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Dissect me?

375
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,630
He's got your blood test reports

376
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
and a stack of anatomy diagrams.

377
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,630
It's this thick.

378
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,960
This is a piece of cake.

379
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,560
(Wu Xie)
He's an animal!

380
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,300
(Dissect)

381
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:44,460
(Arterie Meridians)

382
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,910
How did they get

383
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,240
my blood test reports?

384
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,870
That's the scary part.

385
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,190
They somehow got them

386
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,870
without you knowing.

387
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,960
Feng isn't just a freak.

388
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,870
He's cunning and evil.

389
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,350
I'll protect you

390
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,870
even if I have to rip him apart.

391
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,800
Don't worry, Naive.

392
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,240
If I fail to protect you,
I'll change my name.

393
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
Fatty, calm down for a bit.

394
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,630
So according to you,

395
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,150
Feng only sees me

396
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,430
as a tool.

397
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,240
That means we need
to be especially careful with him

398
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,040
with every move we make
from now on, right?

399
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
You bet.

400
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,320
There's one more thing. Sit down.

401
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,910
Sit down.

402
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,960
Listen.

403
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,590
Hey,

404
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,910
you wouldn't believe it.

405
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,040
Feng actually has a sister.

406
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,110
My dad was unemployed for a long time
and spent all his time gambling.

407
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,030
Whenever he came home,
he would beat my sister.

408
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
Eventually, she went missing.

409
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,110
Domestic violence

410
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,670
drove his sister to run away.

411
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,870
As for Feng,

412
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,080
he's been into violence
ever since he was a kid.

413
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,480
Do you understand?

414
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,480
But that doesn't quite make sense.

415
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,150
If Feng went through all that growing up,

416
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,390
he shouldn't be using violence
to solve problems.

417
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,430
Think about it from another perspective.

418
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,720
If Feng had fought back

419
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,390
and taken out his own father,

420
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,390
would he have lost his sister?

421
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,390
Feng went down the wrong path.

422
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,190
Both he and Zhang Haike have sisters.

423
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,390
Good thing.

424
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,190
Zhang Haike isn't as crazy as Feng.

425
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,390
So, how did it go with Zhang Haike?

426
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,240
If things don't work out,
we need to get out of here.

427
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,960
Isn't that the bell
that causes hallucinations?

428
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,410
Yes, it's the hexagonal bell.

429
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,910
Zhang Haike gave it to me.

430
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,960
You're too weak.

431
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
It could save your life

432
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,480
in a critical moment.

433
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,630
If you keep it on you,

434
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,770
it might even give you
a little extra confidence.

435
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,320
Hexagonal bell?

436
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,670
The Zhang family sure knows

437
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,040
how to win people over bluntly.

438
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,560
No way.

439
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
He just handed over

440
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,910
this powerful weapon to you?

441
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,000
Could it be a fake?

442
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,960
How do we use this?

443
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't mess with it, Fatty.

444
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,670
Fatty, put it down. Fatty!

445
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,080
Fatty.

446
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,670
Fatty.

447
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,520
Fatty.

448
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,350
Feng.

449
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,110
Naive, where are you?

450
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,480
Fatty.

451
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,430
Fatty?

452
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,720
It's me, Naive.

453
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,000
It's me.

454
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,800
Oh, Naive!

455
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,870
That Feng... He...

456
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,430
My intestines and my guts.

457
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,590
It was an illusion.

458
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,070
You've fallen
for the hexagonal bell's illusion.

459
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,040
Zhang Haike told me

460
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,240
that the hallucinations from the bell

461
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,870
weren't caused by the sound

462
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,960
but by the powdery substance inside.

463
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
Before using the bell,

464
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,960
you need to plant a psychological cue
in the target's mind.

465
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,670
It could be a sound

466
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,000
or an image.

467
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,630
Then, bring the bell closer

468
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,830
to them

469
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,670
and ring the bell.

470
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,000
I didn't set you up
with any cue just now.

471
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
That's why it didn't affect you.

472
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,430
You saw a lot of dissection diagrams
when you were in Feng's room.

473
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,430
That's why you thought

474
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,350
you were being dissected
in the illusion.

475
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,480
Based on your reaction,

476
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
the bell Zhang Haike gave us

477
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,190
isn't a fake. It's the real deal.

478
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,720
The fact that he gave me such
an important item

479
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,560
must mean

480
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,560
he's more trustworthy than Feng, right?

481
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,430
That was intense.

482
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,110
It'll take a while to recover from that.

483
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,150
But it's clear

484
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,830
that we need to work with Zhang Haike.

485
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,800
In any case,

486
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,670
Feng is definitely up to no good.

487
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,960
We need to find a way to shake him off.

488
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,280
Or else he'll definitely dissect you

489
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,040
like a lab rat.

490
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,960
Zhang Haike
and his team originally planned

491
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,350
to make their move tonight.

492
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,830
So before that,

493
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,190
we must stay in sync

494
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,590
with their actions.

495
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,370
We don't have enough time
to prepare for that tonight.

496
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,870
Feng is constantly watching us.

497
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,390
Escaping won't be easy.

498
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,110
How about we just fight?

499
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,390
No, that won't work.

500
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,390
Feng and Zhang Haike aren't the type

501
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,830
who will negotiate or reason things out.

502
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,350
They'll start a fight
at the drop of a hat.

503
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,790
If they start fighting,
it could get out of control.

504
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,590
It might put the practitioners
here in danger.

505
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,310
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

506
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:17,920
What should we do then?

507
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,660
I haven't figured it out yet.
Think about it.

508
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,360
Don't say a word.

509
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,670
This is really a...

510
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,230
Do you have confidence?

511
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,710
When have we ever been fully certain
before we acted?

512
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
You're right.

513
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,670
Who's there?

514
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll go and check.

515
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,190
Be careful.

516
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,360
Mister,

517
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,590
this is from Mr. Yu Da.

518
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,040
Thank you.

519
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,440
Did he set up

520
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,630
a listening device on us?

521
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,040
How does he always show up
at critical moments?

522
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,840
You can't barge in without knocking.
That's rude.

523
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,360
Have you decided?

524
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,400
The yard is filled with Feng's men now.

525
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,310
Our men are also ready

526
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,630
to act at any moment.

527
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,270
Wait, don't act just yet.

528
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,710
We already have

529
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,920
a detailed plan.

530
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,370
All you need to do is cooperate with us.

531
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,480
What's the plan?

532
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,080
Feng.

533
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,960
Your end has finally arrived.

534
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,670
What's wrong with him?

535
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,190
The hexagonal bell.

536
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,840
Didn't I tell you not

537
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
to let him mess with it?

538
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,070
He's just mischievous,
which can be controlled.

539
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,040
Die!

540
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
Die!

541
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,960
What did you foreigners

542
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,480
grow up eating

543
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,590
that you're tough as wood?

544
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,310
Today is the second day of Luku Day.

545
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,080
We shouldn't be wasting time here.

546
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,790
But Feng,

547
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,520
there's an old Chinese saying,

548
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,040
"To do a good job,
one must first sharpen their tools."

549
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,560
We're going to face the Night King soon.

550
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Before we set off,

551
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,230
I need to address

552
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,270
some fundamental issues.

553
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,230
Over the past few days,

554
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,310
I've been closely observing each of you

555
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,480
and had Fatty help me

556
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,590
with a comprehensive evaluation.

557
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,960
Including yesterday

558
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,590
when we pretended to escape

559
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,520
and then came back.

560
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,790
It was actually part of the assessment.

561
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,360
The results,

562
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,110
however, were truly disappointing.

563
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,560

Usually,

00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,310
you enjoy grading others.

567
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,840
So let's see how you scored.

Zhang Haixing.

569
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,480
Your response-ability is two points,

570
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,310
five points for physical fitness,

571
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,560
zero for mental toughness,

572
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
zero for intelligence,

573
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,150
and zero for additional skills.

574
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Each category
has a maximum score of 100.

575
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,080
The total score
for all categories is 400.

576
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Look at you.

577
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,000
How much

578
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,230
did you score?

579
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,360
A total of seven points.

580
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,590
Zhang Haike,

581
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,480
your scores are slightly
better than your sister's.

582
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,630
You got five points for mental toughness
and five for intelligence.

583
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,230
But even combined, your score is
still less than twenty points.

584
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,480
How can you still laugh at Naive's score?

Earlier,

587
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,110
I had high expectations for you

588
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,400
because you are an outstanding individual
in Qiling's clan.

589
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,150
But this evaluation

590
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,710
was a real eye-opener.

With your scores, you've got the cheek
to munch peanuts off your sheet.

594
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,480
You scored 26 points,

595
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,520
which is higher than the others.

596
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,630

in physical fitness.

598
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,590
You didn't score high
in other categories either.

599
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,040
But you scored eleven points

600
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
for additional skills,

601
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,920
which was added up
from the equipment you have.

603
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,670
You got a total of 5 points.

There's nobody inside.
