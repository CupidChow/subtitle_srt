00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 14=

4
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,860
A wall.

5
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,410
It's "Night King Devours The Sky."

6
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,930
Fatty.

7
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,610
Do you get it?

8
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,420
I think you do.

9
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,490
And I got it, too.

10
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,820
This isn't a wall.

11
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,170
It's a house.

12
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,820
And inside lies
the Night King himself, yeah?

13
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,420
The key is probably inside.

14
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,450
This is the Night King's house.

15
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,730
It must be where he,
his ancestors, offspring

16
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,170
and harem concubines are housed.

17
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,330
This time it's the jackpot.

18
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,140
You listen up.

19
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,540
Behave when we get inside.

20
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,260
Fatty.

21
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,140
Yes?

22
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,290
Find a way.

23
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,940
It's huge.

24
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,290
What can we do?

25
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,210
You know, if Qiling was here...

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,020
I doubt he'd have a solution either.

27
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,850
If this house contains the Night King,

28
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,620
there's probably a special mechanism.

29
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,970
It could be

30
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,620
like the outermost container.

31
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,820
The answer is will the ball.

32
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,090
The answer is will the ball.

33
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,410
Let it roll.

34
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,020
It stopped.

35
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,500
The mechanism should be
within this area.

36
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,970
But we'll need to get up

37
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,290
to know where the exact spot is.

38
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,380
Let's go, buddy.

39
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,650
It's your turn to shine.

40
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,700
Probe the top.

41
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,500
Look around that spot.

42
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,410
See if there's anything you can press.

43
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,260
Test the mouth.

44
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,940
Try the eyes.

45
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
There, over there.

46
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,060
You're truly the master of mechanisms.

47
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,740
How come it stopped?

48
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,700
Use the jack. Jack it up.

49
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,290
It stopped.

50
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,320
Perhaps it's been too long
and in disrepair.

51
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,330
That's why it jammed.

52
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,410
And it just had to jam at this moment.

53
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,500
We've found where the mechanism is.

54
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,940
There should be
a corresponding mechanism inside.

55
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,330
Zhang Haike.

56
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,770
We'll use the jacks

57
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,090
to create a gap.

58
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,410
One person then climbs in

59
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,740
and looks for the mechanism
inside to open it.

60
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,210
We'll leave it to you, Haike.

61
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,650
This jacks are customized
by the Zhang Family.

62
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,630
The bearing capacity is ten times
that of ordinary jacks.

63
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,620
The cover isn't as heavy as I thought.

64
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
It's likely hollow.

65
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,060
The jacks seem a little aged.

66
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,020
They're made from the same material

67
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,340
as the patriarch's
Ancient Black Gold Sword.

68
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,330
So it's actually a freezer.

69
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,820
Are you cold, Haike?

70
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,970
Stop talking nonsense.

71
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,380
Time is wasting.

72
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,740
This thing only works once.

73
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,580
There's huge hydraulic pressure inside.

74
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,970
Once loosened,

75
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,500
it will slowly release the pressure
through the mechanism.

76
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,370
The refrigeration effect is pretty good.

77
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
It's jacked up, Fatty.

78
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,140
It's up.

79
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,330
Twist it higher.

80
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,290
A little higher.

81
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,740
Go!

82
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I'll go in.

83
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,940
Are you sure?

84
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm more nimble than you.

85
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,770
I was the one who opened
the container outside.

86
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,140
I'm pretty sure

87
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,530
the mechanisms are the same kind.

88
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,020
I know them better than you.

89
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,410
You sure?

90
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,700
All the best to you, then.

91
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,850
And prosperity to you.

92
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll be out here keeping watch.

93
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,570
How's it going?

94
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,020
Found anything?

95
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,170
Fatty.

96
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,410
I found the mechanism.

97
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,810
It's collapsing!

98
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,050
There's no time for you to be naive.

99
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,460
Be quick!

100
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,410
Zhang Qiling's friends are here.

101
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,690
Zhang Qiling's friends...

102
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,810
What's going on?

103
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,740
Turn off the torchlight.

104
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,980
It chose to malfunction now?

105
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,770
Someone's shooting at us.

106
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,050
Could it be that the Feng gang
caught up to us?

107
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,020
Fatty!

108
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,980
What's happening?

109
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,220
Someone's attacking us.

110
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,530
Either you go in or come out.

111
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,620
Forget it. Find cover first.

112
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,570
If I move,

113
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,890
you're going to become mince meat.

114
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,810
I'm stuck.

115
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,380
Leave me and go find cover!

116
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,980
We have to get inside somehow.

117
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,530
We can take cover in here.

118
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,340
What if we go in
and can't go back outside?

119
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,570
We'll become

120
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,100
like turtles caught in a jar.

121
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,690
The mechanism should open
from the inside as well.

122
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,930
Get inside first.

123
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,050
We'll figure it out later.

124
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,410
Fatty.

125
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,290
Are you all right? Take cover, quick!

126
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,570
I'm fine.

127
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,170
Just hurry.

128
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,050
Zhang Jiuri.

129
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,460
Where's Zhang Haixing?

130
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,290
You would've seen her on the way down.

131
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,260
Take a guess.

132
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,650
Naive!

133
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,170
Hold on tight!

134
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,650
Or else you're going
to turn into mince meat.

135
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,500
We're out of time.

136
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,930
We're out of time!

137
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,260
Did I just become Superman?

138
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,410
Well...

139
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,220
Fatty.

140
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,660
No movement.

141
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,050
He's gone.

142
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,290
Anyhow, the cover is really heavy.

143
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,360
He won't be able to get in
even with explosives.

144
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,180
That also means we won't
be able to get out.

145
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,260
Fatty.

146
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,990
Are you all right?

147
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,290
Sit up.

148
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,180
Doing what I do, there comes a time
to throw in the towel.

149
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,290
I'm alright.

150
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,370
You've been shot

151
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
and bleeding lot.

152
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,570
Let me treat the wound.

153
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,940
Don't worry.

154
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,850
Your hand.

155
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,980
What happened to your hand?

156
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Just a little scratch.

157
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,660
That's not good.

158
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,290
Just a scratch.

159
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,260
I'll bandage it for you.

160
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
I'm fine.

161
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,660
I'm agile as can be.

162
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,500
Two shots. I avoided both.

163
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,420
I have no idea how I did it.

164
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,220
I'll bandage it for you.

165
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,850
Dress his wound.

166
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,260
He's bleeding.

167
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,570
Why are you so careless?

168
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,980
You're pretty quick with the undressing.

169
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,850
Bear with it.

170
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,570
Wait...

171
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,940
Is it serious?

172
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,850
Just an abrasion.

173
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,090
Not a big deal.

174
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,980
So I'm fine?

175
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,980
I'm good, right?

176
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,770
Bandage your hand, quickly.

177
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,420
I'll bandage him.

178
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,500
Take care of your wounds.

179
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,610
Thanks.

180
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,610
Hurry up and bandage your hand.

181
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,900
Little Naive.

182
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,050
How many times

183
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,740
have we bandaged each other's wounds?

184
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,530
I always get the small injuries,
while you get the big ones.

185
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,290
Your hand

186
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,810
is very important.

187
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,980
Hurry up and treat it.

188
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,700
I will.

189
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,500
Ow ow ow...

190
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,660
Easy does it.

191
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,260
Think of me as your sister.

192
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,660
Be gentle.

193
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,420
Up there just now.

194
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,980
What exactly happened?

195
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,700
Someone ambushed us,

196
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,050
shot us from the dark.

197
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,050
Thank goodness you had opened the cover.

198
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,670
Or else it would've been game over.

199
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,850
Shot from the dark?

200
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,130
It was Zhang Jiuri.

201
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,740
Zhang Jiuri?

202
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,500
You mean Zhang Xu.

203
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,810
What's up with the pretense?

204
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,260
Maybe I should call myself
Wang Half Fatty.

205
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,090
Zhang Jiuri.

206
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,420
Is that Qiling's companion
from his delinquent days back then?

207
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,050
Why is he attacking us?

208
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,530
A lot of things happened.

209
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,260
Zhang Jiuri pretty much went insane.

210
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,610
He's not of sound mind.

211
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,570
It's hard

212
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,020
to explain everything right now.

213
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,090
I'll tell you later.

214
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,850
What kind of trap
did your sister set up?

215
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,810
It's so lousy.

216
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,730
I think the situation is out of control.

217
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,370
If Zhang Jiuri managed to get in,

218
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,070
Feng and his men are probably here, too.

219
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,050
But why did Zhang Jiuri

220
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,770
come all the way down here?

221
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,940
What is it?

222
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,020
Haixing didn't send us a signal.

223
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,370
I'm not sure

224
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,660
if she's okay.

225
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,050
Don't panic.

226
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,570
She's probably okay.

227
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,220
There was no signal,

228
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,940
and there weren't any gunshots.

229
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,370
The most pressing matter now

230
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,370
is to find a way to get out.

231
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,460
Then you'll be able to find your sister.

232
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,900
Careful.

233
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,420
Leg... My leg...

234
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,050
My leg is crippled, too.

235
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,020
The mechanism at the top

236
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,090
is probably broken.

237
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,530
We have to find another way out.

238
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,850
Otherwise,

239
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,610
the three of us

240
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,500
are going to die here.

241
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,770
Fatty.

242
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,700
Do you still have any explosives?

243
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,980
There's a ball.

244
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,810
Be serious. Now is not the time
to joke around.

245
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,740
Anymore explosives?

246
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,260
I'm telling you, there's a ball.

247
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,940
What the heck is that?

248
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,050
It's a ball.

249
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,420
Are you okay?

250
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,530
What is this nasty thing?

251
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,980
It looks like a cocoon.

252
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,220
Thank goodness you're here.

253
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,180
I was about to touch it.

254
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,700
You should wrap that.

255
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,530
It could be a part of the Night King.

256
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
Be careful of its corrosiveness.

257
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,530
Which part?

258
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,740
The skin?

259
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,700
Before this, it was the eyeball.

260
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,090
Now, we have the skin.

261
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,130
Be careful.

262
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,290
Check this part out.

263
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,180
There's biological texture.

264
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,570
You don't say, it could be
the skin of some creature.

265
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,770
Heard that?

266
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,700
Biological texture.

267
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,460
Be more scientific.

268
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,940
But I can't say for sure.

269
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,330
We need more clues.

270
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,740
Fighting unseen enemies again.

271
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,660
Could it be the Night King?

272
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,850
Is that really Night King's skin?

273
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,850
Those people pulled it off?

274
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,700
Two extraordinary long fingers.

275
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,320
They're members of the Zhang Family.

276
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,220
I see.

277
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,740
The ancient people in this mural

278
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,130
are likely from the Kumuli Dynasty.

279
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,090
They're fighting the Night King

280
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,290
together with the Zhangs.

281
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,940
These few panels likely depict

282
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,500
how the Kumuli people

283
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,700
and Zhangs

284
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,810
built the monster container together.

285
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,850
Here, over here.

286
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,700
This way.

287
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,330
Listen.

288
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,090
If Qiling asked us
to fight that monster,

289
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,370
would we dare go?

290
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,020
These ancient murals

291
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,570
more or less contain elements
of beautification and romanticization.

292
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,260
As to how much of it is embellished,

293
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,260
I'm unable to say for now.

294
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,090
If it does happen,

295
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,500
how are we going to fight this thing?

296
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,220
Any new discovery?

297
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,660
Not yet.

298
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,850
I took photographs with my phone.

299
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,900
We'll look into it more
when we get out of here.

300
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,370
Yeah.

301
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,180
We have to get out first

302
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,420
before we can examine it, right?

303
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,980
Zhang Haike.

304
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,020
Shine your light back here.

305
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,610
Higher.

306
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,570
A little higher.

307
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,050
A bit more.

308
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,330
Stop!

309
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,610
Fatty, look.

310
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,050
Do you see something in the ball?

311
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,610
Don't try and scare me.

312
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,740
I don't see anything.

313
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,130
Take a look here.

314
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Right there.

315
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,130
Do you see a shadow?

316
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
There's nothing.

317
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,460
Zhang Haike.

318
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,050
Turn off your light.

319
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,020
Do you see anything inside the ball?

320
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,570
I do.

321
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,460
How come I'm the only one
who don't see it. Shine again.

322
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,610
You turn yours off.

323
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,460
I see an umbrella.

324
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,260
Do you think

325
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,980
it could be the key Qiling left behind?

326
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,530
If it's really the key
Qiling left behind,

327
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,700
with its size,

328
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,850
it probably opens a heaven's door.

329
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,130
But it does fit what Qiling would do,

330
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,940
hiding the stuff in Night King's skin.

331
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,810
That's what he always did.

332
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,370
Let's go.

333
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,370
This time it's serious.

334
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,260
Since we're here,

335
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,530
we should open it up

336
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,660
and find out what exactly it is.

337
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,370
But this thing reeks of danger.

338
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,420
It disintegrates

339
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,420
with the slightest touch.

340
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,530
Step back, you two.

341
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,770
Let me see if I can cut it open.

342
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,220
Take care.

343
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,330
Come.

344
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,530
It's poisonous! Put on the masks.

345
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,420
There really are keys.

346
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,700
How did Qiling hide them in here.

347
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,700
They're all keys.

348
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,980
So many.

349
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,530
The wooden material of the structure
must have been specially treated.

350
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,660
It's hollow underneath.

351
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,940
There should be a mechanism.

352
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,740
If the debris corrode and trigger

353
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,570
the mechanism below,

354
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,220
we'll die here.

355
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,850
The keys all look the same.

356
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,940
Does it mean any one would work?

357
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,290
Qiling set this up.

358
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,850
It wouldn't be so simple.

359
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,370
I'll take the whole thing down, Fatty.

360
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,260
Don't move!

361
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,290
Those threads

362
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,370
look like the Zhang Family's
Eighteen Strings machine.

363
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,020
Eighteen Strings?

364
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,760
The core mechanism
of the Eighteen Strings machine

365
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,770
is the extremely sensitive silk strings.

366
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,740
Countless strings connect
countless mechanisms.

367
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,900
Any mistake

368
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,610
and every string
would trigger the mechanisms.

369
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,050
They're so many strings.

370
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,220
How many lives do we need
to test them out.

371
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,290
The patriarch wouldn't leave us
with a lethal, unsolvable mechanism.

372
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
Surely he made it
in the form of the Eighteen Strings

373
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,660
and placed the real key
on one of the many strings.

374
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,610
Moreover,

375
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,700
that string will not
trigger the mechanism.

376
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,020
So we must find

377
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,090
the correct string.

378
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,020
Any ideas?

379
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,020
No.

380
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,070
I first have to determine
the logic behind the mechanism

381
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,570
in order to solve it.

382
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,700
What's the matter, Naive?

383
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,900
I got it.

384
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,290
Looking from this angle,

385
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,940
those keys outline the direction
of the mountain range.

386
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,570
The direction of the key

387
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,520
is the same as the mountain range
near Mosang.

388
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,330
Fatty, hold the light.

389
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,700
I've got you.

390
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,180
The keys array

391
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,900
is a mountain range chart.

392
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,090
It's not clear from this angle.

393
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
We can only see a part of the chart.

394
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,290
The real treasure
is in the dragon's lair.

395
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,980
We just have to complete
the whole picture

396
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,180
to find the real key.

397
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,250
Wu Xie.

398
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:20,940
There's not much time.

399
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,300
Those strings

400
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,980
are connected to the entire house.

401
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,460
Once corroded,

402
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,780
it will trigger the mechanism.

403
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,420
I saw it before in my grandpa's notes.

404
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,980
There are three dragons.

405
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,570
The Feng Shui Eye
is where the three dragons cross.

406
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,570
Found it.

407
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,500
It's here.

408
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,750
This is the Feng Shui Eye
of the entire mountain range.

409
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,610
If we can find this point,
we'll be able to find the real key.

410
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,050
To see the whole picture clearly,

411
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,440
we need to locate the Xun position
of the Bagua diagram.

412
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,860
There.

413
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,730
Climb up.

414
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,670
Climb up there and we'll be able to see
the meridian points.

415
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,860
Are you sure?

416
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,860
No, I'm not.

417
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,780
But this is our final chance.

418
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,730
We have to try.

419
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,050
Okay.

420
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,530
Found it!

421
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,020
Take two steps forward.

422
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,090
Two steps to the left.

423
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,570
Wu Xie!

424
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,530
That's the spot.

425
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,980
It's right in front of you.

426
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,610
Count upward, it's the second key.

427
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,940
Fatty, give me a lift.

428
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:25,780
Up you go.

429
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,460
Wu Xie, there's no time!

430
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,340
We're out of time. Quick!

431
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,020
Naive!

432
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,210
Naive!

433
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,130
Are you okay?

434
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,050
Naive!

435
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,500
Are you all right?

436
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:00,980
Fatty.

437
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,780
I'm fine.

438
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,130
Wait there. Don't move.

439
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,020
I'll find a way to save you.

440
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,020
Okay, you be careful.

441
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,500
Don't just sit there. Help me.

442
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,090
The corrosive burned through

443
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,860
the inner and outer structures.

444
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,420
Wu Xie likely fell into a crack

445
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,300
outside the house.

446
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,530
There's no imminent danger.

447
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,560
The whole structure
is leaning right now.

448
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,420
The roof cover should slide off.

449
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,630
I'm going to look for Haixing first.

450
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,900
The power of sibling love, huh?

451
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,340
Feng is likely in here.

452
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,170
Be careful.

453
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,690
Don't be scared. Fatty is here.

454
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,420
Naive.

455
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,610
How did you make such a big crack?

456
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,940
This is not right.

457
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,170
Fatty, I didn't create the crack.

458
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,420
Then what made it appear?

459
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,270
I think the crack has always been there.

460
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,570
It was hidden under the floor.

461
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,820
It's just that...

462
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,460
I happened to smash into its entrance.

463
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,900
Watch where you're going.

464
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,940
The rope isn't long enough. Wait up.

465
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,500
It's Qiling's sign.

466
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,130
Fatty.

467
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,650
Come down once Zhang Haike gets back.

468
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,980
I'm going ahead to scout.

469
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,530
You be careful.

470
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,020
Don't worry.

471
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,020
These are just normal puppets.

472
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,500
There are no snakes.

473
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,940
So what is your plan now,

474
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,530
Mr. Zhang?

475
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,530
We'll lie in wait here

476
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,380
for Wu Xie to show up.

477
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,650
From my experience,

478
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,610
the probability

479
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,170
of finding the exit
in this ancient city is close to zero.

480
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,050
So even if they found the way

481
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,460
into the maze-like cave,

482
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,500
their best option

483
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,820
would be to turn back.

484
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,250
The way they came

485
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,860
is the only way they're familiar with.

486
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,090
So let us wait on the road

487
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,940
that they must take to return.

488
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,610
There's a high chance

489
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,050
he'd have the key with him.

490
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,340
But Mr. Zhang,

491
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,650
I don't like

492
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,130
to bet everything on probability alone.

493
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,130
Since your men have gone inside,

494
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,530
they should know where Mr. Wu is.

495
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,420
I prefer to take the proactive approach

496
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,610
and capture Wu Xie directly.

497
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,210
Haixing.

498
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,130
Haixing!

499
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,530
Zhang Haixing!

500
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,170
Up.

501
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,780
Haixing.

502
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,300
Are you all right?

503
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,090
Haike.

504
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,820
Zhang Jiuri is here.

505
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,980
Zhang Nian and Feng also came down.

506
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,900
Zhang Nian?

507
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,500
When did he become acquainted with Feng?

508
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,690
I don't know.

509
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,780
But they must be here for the key.

510
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,020
We met Zhang Jiuri,

511
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,210
but he slipped away.

512
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,570
If he was able to escape from the maze,

513
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,960
I'm sure Zhang Nian could, too.

514
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,860
We should get out of here.

515
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,090
They may show up at any time.

516
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,300
Come.

517
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,900
