00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 28=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,910
Don't you think they look better

5
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,320
when they're wilted?

6
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,910
Have we truly accomplished

7
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,070
the mission Qiling had assigned to us?

8
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:05,600
If this isn't it, what should we do before
it's considered accomplished, then?

9
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,950
Although the Zanghai Flowers are gone,

10
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,070
the golden sphere bugs
haven't appeared yet.

11
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,440
I feel like something's off.

12
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,040
It's time to say goodbye.

13
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,910
Feng, let's go.

14
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,760
Let's go and have something nice.

15
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,179
You're still tied up, huh?

16
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,929
You don't have many friends, do you?

17
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,929
Come on.

18
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,440
During crucial moments,

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,160
you still need to depend on me.

20
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,320
All of you can go home.

21
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,899
How is it?

22
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,429
Don't you think
you've made a great friend?

23
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,320
A friend that can
go through thick and thin with you.

24
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,910
Hurry up.

25
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's go, Naive.

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,510
Hans.

27
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,440
It's over.

28
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,510
You can leave now.

29
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,480
No!

30
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,369
Search the area again!

31
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,979
There must be more flowers here!

32
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,910
You guys can go ahead.
We won't wait for you.

33
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,259
There's no Zanghai Flower.

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,609
Let's go.

35
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,950
The Night King doesn't exist either.

36
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,830
Stop acting like a fool.

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,320
Boss, there's something down there.

38
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,489
Fatty.

39
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,670
Over here!

40
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,790
Seems like they've discovered
something else.

41
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,200
Let's continue.

42
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,560
We'll be fine if we leave. Come on.

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,600
Here!

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,480
Did you see that?

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,910
Pull this thing out!

46
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,480
There's something underneath!

47
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,760
No.

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,040
What are you doing?

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,139
What are you doing?

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,489
Are you trying to kill us all?

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,489
- Oh, no. He's going to use a grenade.
- Naive, just ignore him.

52
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,280
No matter what happens,
it's none of your business.

53
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,830
What's going on?

54
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,240
The Night King Devours The Sky!

55
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,289
Golden spheres!

56
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,899
All of these are golden spheres!

57
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,849
They can be whatever they like!

58
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,240
Run!

59
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,630
Just run!

60
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,320
Come on! You darned bugs!

61
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,950
Naive!

62
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,939
Feng!

63
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,240
Naive!

64
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,320
Haike!

65
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,120
Haike!

66
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,630
(I'm not dead.)

67
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,950
(I was rescued.)

68
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,240
(Where am I?)

69
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,830
Fatty?

70
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,070
Fatty.

71
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,000
Fatty.

72
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,560
Hello.

73
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,680
Hello.

74
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,200
Did you see that storm over there?

75
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,920
It's very dangerous.

76
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,809
And, it travels quickly.

77
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,520
It'll reach here soon.

78
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,520
We have to make a phone call
and notify the people outside.

79
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,990
But there's no signal here.

80
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,920
Do you guys have a phone here?

81
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,800
What about a radio?

82
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:42,320
Can you understand me?

83
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,470
Telephone?

84
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,170
Radio?

85
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,820
Where exactly am I?

86
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,748
This is Yinshaluo.

87
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,550
Yinshaluo?

88
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,687
I thought the place
was buried under the snow.

89
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,620
Yinshaluo encountered an avalanche.

90
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,100
After that, we moved here.

91
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,799
We're at the back of the mountain.

92
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,070
We've been living here all along.

93
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,380
If so, you guys have to move now.

94
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,830
The storm is ferocious.

95
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,350
You must tell everyone to evacuate.

96
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,070
It hasn't arrived yet, right?

97
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,889
Why are you terrified?

98
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,070
It's because we're running out of time.

99
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,649
We have to contact the people out there

100
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,190
and seek their help.

101
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,220
Young man,

102
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,670
everything is predestined.

103
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,710
There's no way to seek help.

104
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,190
Come. Calm yourself down.

105
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,710
Sit down.

106
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,590
I've already

107
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,500
answered your question.

108
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,950
Now, I have a question for you.

109
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,950
Why didn't Zhang Qiling
come here personally?

110
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,350
You know who Zhang Qiling is?

111
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,790
You don't need to be surprised.

112
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,950
This is the other side of the mountain.

113
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,310
Ordinary people cannot come here.

114
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,260
So, you guys were the ones

115
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,190
who rescued me and Fatty, huh?

116
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,169
What about the rest?

117
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,769
We heard something during our patrol.

118
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,009
We found you guys.

119
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,369
It's just that some people

120
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,470
will never return.

121
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,900
As for those who managed to return,
you'll see them here.

122
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,790
It's decided by Heaven and Earth.

123
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,830
No matter how worried

124
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,129
a tiny human like you are,

125
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,220
you cannot change Heaven and Earth.

126
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,500
But Zhang Qiling can achieve that.

127
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,310
Am I right?

128
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,550
Zhang Qiling, he has
an extraordinary belief.

129
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,430
He's different from you.

130
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,470
But he's not here.

131
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,550
It's because he has another

132
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,070
serious issue to resolve.

133
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,590
If he says it's serious,

134
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,839
I'm sure it's more severe than

135
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,079
the issue we're facing here.

136
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,409
That means other people require
his help more than us.

137
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,980
Therefore, I'll accomplish his mission

138
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,020
on his behalf.

139
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,959
I'll help all of you

140
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,220
to evacuate the place.

141
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,529
Zhang Qiling has a friend now.

142
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,409
I thought

143
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,860
he would never make friends.

144
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,470
It's good that he managed
to make some friends.

145
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,380
Thank you for coming here on his behalf.

146
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,719
Yindan,

147
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,470
don't be rude.

148
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,350
I have no idea

149
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,070
why you guys are so calm.

150
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,380
The storm will arrive soon.

151
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,980
The storm is already there.

152
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,310
How could humans avoid
such a natural phenomenon?

153
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,470
It's too late.

154
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,980
Our ancestors

155
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,380
received the grace of the Zhang Family.

156
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,140
We promised to keep guard

157
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,350
over the Zanghai Flower field
for generations

158
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,550
without allowing outsiders
to enter the place.

159
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,470
But now that the storm is here,

160
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,350
you should hurry and leave.

161
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,220
Granny!

162
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,710
Here, stand up.

163
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,380
Give this a try.

164
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,070
Raise it.

165
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,079
Good.

166
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,249
Granny,

167
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,100
this robe is too long for me.

168
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,289
You're growing rapidly.

169
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,599
It'll only last you six months

170
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,430
if I make it short.

171
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,839
Dad and the rest
are slaughtering a goat.

172
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,260
Are we celebrating the New Year soon?

173
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,310
A major festival is nearing.

174
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,860
You can have goat ears
during the occasion.

175
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,620
Zazi Nimo!

176
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,980
Zazi Nimo.

177
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,049
Zazi Nimo means good fortune.

178
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,550
Listen to me.

179
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,889
The Zanghai Flower field
has been burned to the ground.

180
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,439
Its spores won't spread for now.

181
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,190
We have to avoid the storm.

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,199
Let's hurry and leave.

183
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,430
We can return after the storm is over.

184
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,559
The golden sphere larvae
are the threat here,

185
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,500
not the Zanghai Flowers.

186
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,590
The larvae infest the flowers.

187
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,070
The flowers simply spread them.

188
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,140
Now, a storm is coming.

189
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,620
The storm itself isn't a threat.

190
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,409
However, it'll carry
the golden sphere bugs

191
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,649
to the outside world.

192
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,220
By then, more living beings
will be infected.

193
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,079
Therefore, we have to stay here

194
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,100
and deal with the storm.

195
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,950
There's no signal here at all.

196
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,169
Hurry and pack your things

197
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,260
and leave.

198
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,220
It'll be too late

199
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,260
for you to leave later.

200
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,710
What about you guys, then?

201
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,980
Are you guys going
to deal with the storm?

202
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,310
Are you guys sure
that you can survive that?

203
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,500
People come and go, you know?

204
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,950
When you meet Zhang Qiling,

205
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,470
please tell him

206
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,980
that all of us miss him.

207
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,860
So,

208
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,620
Zhang Qiling's friend,

209
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,140
Yindan will escort you
down the mountains.

210
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,550
This happened because of us.

211
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,070
I'm not leaving.

212
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,830
I won't leave the place

213
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,550
until the issue has been resolved.

214
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,220
I'm not requesting you to leave.

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,380
You have to leave.

216
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,889
You have accomplished your mission.

217
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,009
Now, it's our turn.

218
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,790
What if Zhang Qiling was here?

219
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,470
Would you guys force him to leave

220
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,839
if he insisted on staying?

221
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,190
We wouldn't.

222
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,310
It's because he's Zhang Qiling.

223
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,310
He's the strongest warrior.

224
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,310
He is the most respected warrior

225
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
for Yinshaluo people.

226
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,430
I'm not the strongest warrior.

227
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,620
Since I'm his friend,

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,790
I'm definitely staying.

229
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,740
Young man,

230
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,860
as Zhang Qiling's friend,

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,140
you're already outstanding enough.

232
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,980
You don't need to be
the strongest warrior.

233
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,860
You're risking your life here.

234
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,350
I know.

235
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,670
But this happened because of us.

236
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,590
I won't just leave
you guys in the lurch.

237
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,919
And, Zhang Qiling told me

238
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,500
to accomplish his mission on his behalf.

239
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,249
Do you think

240
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,220
he'll make a lapse in his judgment?

241
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,409
Your expression

242
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,220
made you look like
a different person entirely.

243
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,310
If I do die,

244
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,660
please tell him

245
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,180
that I came here before.

246
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,700
I never expected our chieftain
to let you stay.

247
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,839
I'm very thankful to her.

248
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,620
Cut the fancy words.

249
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,940
You guys were the reason
behind the storm.

250
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,140
Why should you be in charge
of protecting the Yinshaluo Tribe?

251
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,359
You do say nice things.

252
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,689
But I'm sure

253
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,159
that you'll escape at the speed of light

254
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,310
when the storm arrives.

255
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,420
As for your friends,

256
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,230
I'll escort them down the mountains.

257
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,860
But you better think it through.

258
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,900
We'll only do it once.

259
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,100
Nurse Wu.

260
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,790
Nurse Wu.

261
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,489
You're finally awake.

262
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,660
Have some water.

263
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:12,559
Come.

264
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,790
Come closer. Look after me.

265
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,860
This won't do.

266
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,230
Don't move.

267
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,799
Are you trying to drown me?

268
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,750
Open your mouth.

269
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,700
Is it enough?

270
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,929
Yeah.

271
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,900
It'll make me use the restroom.
It's quite troublesome.

272
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,550
Are you okay?

273
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,900
That storm was crazy.

274
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,180
It was as if
someone gave me a tight slap.

275
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,990
We were slapped by the storm.

276
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,750
You can still crack jokes, huh?

277
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,510
I can rest at ease, then.

278
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,049
That means you're in good condition.

279
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,529
How is this considered good?

280
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,990
I mean, your mental condition.

281
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,700
Fatty,

282
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,270
I talked to the chieftain just now.

283
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,429
What did you two talk about?

284
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,359
It turns out that the Zanghai Flowers
aren't poisonous.

285
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,620
It's just that the golden sphere larvae
infest their roots.

286
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,790
So, we only burn down
the Zanghai Flower field

287
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,830
in order to kill
the parasitic larvae, huh?

288
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,900
Now,

289
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,079
the storm is nearing,

290
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,350
am I right?

291
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,879
It'll carry the golden sphere larvae
to the outside world

292
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,350
and infect other living beings.

293
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,799
I have something to discuss with you.

294
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,559
Don't. I know what you're thinking.

295
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,209
I'm sure you're not trying

296
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,270
to persuade us to go home.

297
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,660
Are you preparing
to deal with the storm?

298
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,750
I heard the commotion outside.

299
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,380
I'm sure the Yinshaluo Tribe
is up to something.

300
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,790
Did you discuss a way

301
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
to deal with the storm with them

302
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,420
while I was unconscious?

303
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,559
And, you've decided to stay

304
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,310
and fight alongside them until the end.

305
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,460
Am I right?

306
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,860
And, you think

307
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,079
that it's likely you'll die from this.

308
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,799
Therefore, you've decided
to stay here alone

309
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,070
while you want me to leave.

310
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,510
Am I right?

311
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,100
We still have perfect chemistry.

312
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,590
Although I know what you're thinking,

313
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,790
you should know what I'm thinking too.

314
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,489
Isn't it obvious?

315
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,529
I won't leave.

316
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,009
Even so, you're trying to persuade me.

317
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,790
Isn't this superficial?

318
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,310
Fatty,

319
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,420
now, we're dealing with a storm.

320
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,639
Our skills and prior experience

321
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,460
are literally useless.

322
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,529
And,

323
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,100
you're seriously wounded.

324
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,009
I'm sure you're worse

325
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,860
than an adult Yinshaluo man.

326
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,180
Later, they'll escort you
down the mountains.

327
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,900
You'll be safe by then.

328
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,399
This time, you should listen to me

329
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
and leave. Okay?

330
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,969
I'll show you an adult man.

331
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,689
Don't move.

332
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,489
I!

333
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,270
You!

334
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,590
Sorry about that.

335
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,929
What were you doing?

336
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,460
That's not a mask, huh?

337
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,900
I thought you were Zhang Haike.

338
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,599
Have you lost your mind?

339
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,460
What are you thinking?

340
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,180
You're not acting like yourself.

341
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,639
You're not sticking to our philosophy in life
by saying something like that.

342
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,550
What do you mean by
our philosophy in life?

343
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,380
We'll seek death together

344
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,990
for a good price.

345
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,420
But this time, we have no options.

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,620
It's time to change our philosophy.

347
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,990
You've changed indeed.

348
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,420
But I, Fatty, will never change.

349
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,049
That's why you need me more than ever.

350
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,310
Besides, this is my own choice.

351
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,070
I won't blame you for this.

352
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,550
Do you agree with it?

353
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,420
If you don't,

354
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,100
I'll cause a commotion!

355
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,159
I...

356
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,830
I'll drag you down!

357
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,969
Calm down.

358
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,769
Rest and recuperate.

359
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,350
Do your best to recover.

360
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,399
I need to find Feng. I'll discuss this
with you when I'm back, okay?

361
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,860
Don't ignore me.

362
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,879
Why did you take my beef jerky away?

363
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,009
I'll be back in a second.

364
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,230
What about me, then?

365
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,230
Get me a nurse.

366
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,230
Wu Xie.

367
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,140
I heard

368
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,230
that you're going to stay here
and deal with the storm with them.

369
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,230
You should know

370
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,799
that these people

371
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,460
are digging their own graves.

372
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,790
If you go there,

373
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,420
you'll perish as well.

374
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,700
Can you cut the crap?

375
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,100
I've already decided to stay.

376
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,070
I'm sure Zhang Qiling has his reasons
for choosing you.

377
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,620
You shouldn't risk your life.

378
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,350
You have more important missions
to accomplish.

379
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,799
When I was learning about your culture,

380
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,310
I thought that the myths
were ridiculous.

381
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,940
I never expected it
to come true this time around.

382
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,860
The Night King.

383
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,790
It's invisible.

384
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,350
And, it has 1,000 pairs of eyes.

385
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,159
However, the Night King

386
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,100
is useless to me.

387
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,860
My research direction
was off from the start.

388
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,180
As for you,

389
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,799
you always thought

390
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,070
that Zhang Haike came up
with the Night King to deceive you.

391
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,249
Now, you're finally
seeing it for yourself.

392
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,550
How do you feel now?

393
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,460
This is unbelievable.

394
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,100
Feng,

395
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,990
I need you to do me a favor.

396
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm costly to hire, you know?

397
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,100
We signed a contract before this.

398
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,100
You can have the three million.

399
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,079
That's just a tiny sum.

400
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,529
It's not enough to hire me.

401
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,750
Feng, how much do you earn per year?

402
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,070
Is there a way to hire you

403
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,700
without using any money?

404
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,270
Is that all?

405
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,750
Tell me directly.

406
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,590
What do you need me to do?

407
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm going to deal with the storm.

408
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,750
Will you die?

409
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,380
I've used up all my luck.

410
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,180
Therefore,
I can't accomplish this alone.

411
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,180
Feng, I truly need your help.

412
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,167
Mr. Wu,

413
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:33,310
seems like you still have some luck.

414
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,940
Although I can't contact
the outside world with my equipment,

415
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,900
at least it can still receive
the satellite signal.

416
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,270
We still stand a chance.

417
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,310
All in all,

418
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,700
the storm was formed

419
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,990
due to the surge of
the massive underground heat source

420
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,399
after Hans blew up
the Zanghai Flower field.

421
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,100
The violent convection of hot and cold air

422
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,209
caused a pressure
difference in the atmosphere.

423
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,599
Due to that, a cyclone was formed.

424
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,249
In the end,

425
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,380
it turned into the storm
we're looking at right now.

426
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
According to past records,

427
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,388
they used explosives

428
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,180
to disrupt the hot and cold particles
in the upper atmosphere

429
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,009
and scatter them.

430
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,750
This way, the cyclone will dissipate.

431
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,860
So, does that mean

432
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,207
we don't need to enter
the storm ourselves?

433
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,689
We just need to send the explosives
to the upper atmosphere

434
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,100
and detonate them, right?

435
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,249
It's a shame that this feat

436
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,900
is almost impossible to achieve.

437
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,209
Unless, you have nuclear rounds,
which can penetrate the storm.

438
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,639
However, if you do so,

439
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,900
the consequences will be more dire.

440
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,070
Wait.

441
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,790
Feng,

442
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,230
have you already come up with a plan?

443
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,940
I do have a plan.

444
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,100
But I'm sure you won't like it.

445
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,270
According to my plan,
someone has to be sacrificed.

446
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,790
What's the success rate?

447
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,119
If we assume the records

448
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,119
are accurate,

449
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,990
we'll have a 99% success rate.

450
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,289
You know that there's no plan

451
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,550
with a 100% success rate, right?

452
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,270
Tell me about your plan.

453
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,620
Mr. Wu,

454
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,140
you've changed.

455
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,100
Tell me about your plan.

456
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,799
Alright.

457
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,070
Actually,

458
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,380
when we're under such circumstances,

459
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,350
there's one thing we need to consider.

460
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,639
That is, how can we achieve victory

461
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,230
with the least casualties?

462
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,270
Therefore,

463
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,799
I'll assemble a suicide squad.

464
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,660
The suicide squad will escort one team

465
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,460
to break through the storm

466
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,070
and enter the eye of the storm.

467
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,249
As long as someone is able
to procure that position,

468
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,790
he'll be safe as there's no wind

469
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,420
at the eye of the storm.

470
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,009
If so, I'll have plenty of ways

471
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,620
to deliver the payload to that location.

472
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,380
With the current wind speed,

473
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,350
if the suicide squad enters the storm,

474
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,900
that means all of them...

475
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,180
They will face certain death.

476
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,940
However, at least the rest
will be able to survive.

477
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,100
How many men do you need?

478
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,790
At least 20.

479
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,550
20?

480
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,180
20, huh?

481
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,350
Warriors,

482
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,990
we've waited for our years
to fulfill our destiny.

483
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,140
And now, it has appeared in the sky.

484
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,270
Today's the day we'll transform
into valiant hawks.

485
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,180
We shall bid farewell
to our beloved partners

486
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,620
and children.

487
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,420
They will see us in the sky.

488
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,750
Our shadows will sweep across the land

489
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,380
and caress their faces,

490
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,990
as if we're

491
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,620
still together.

492
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,990
How is it?

493
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,180
(Outer circle: 17, Inner circle: 4)
We don't need 20 men.

494
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,750
17 is enough.

495
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,590
One, two, stab.

496
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,830
One, two, stab.

497
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,729
Shift your hand to the back.

498
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,359
A little more.

499
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,079
Okay, brother.

500
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,729
A little more.

501
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,449
Okay.

502
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,420
Again.

503
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,140
One, two, stab.

504
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,700
One, two, stab.

505
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,550
Why are you stabbing upward?
You can't hit anyone with that.

506
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,489
Again.

507
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,830
Got it, brother.

508
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,620
One, two, stab!

509
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,590
One, two, stab!

510
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,420
One, two, stab!

511
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,529
Wrong.

512
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,140
Shift your hand backward.

513
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,119
Again.

514
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,860
One, two, stab!

515
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,590
One, two, stab!

516
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,550
That's right. Higher.

517
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,230
(Haixing, come.)

518
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,510
(Just like this.)

519
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,310
(One, two.)

520
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,860
(One, two.)

521
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,209
(Wrong.)

522
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,380
(Your hand needs to be higher.)

523
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,359
(One, two.)

524
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,729
(That's right. That's it.)

525
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,900
(Again.)

526
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,940
Where did your brother go?

527
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,660
He left.

528
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,030
He needs some time

529
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,590
alone.

530
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,180
Aren't you leaving?

531
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,310
You might not be able to leave

532
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,510
if you don't leave now.

533
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,620
At least I can

534
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,639
replace one of the Yinshaluo people

535
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,100
and prevent another death.

536
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,080
Are you trying to repay your debt?
Or do you have a guilty conscience?

537
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,900
Wu Xie,

538
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,990
do you really think of yourself
as the savior of the world?

539
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,319
You're just impressing yourself

540
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,990
by doing so.

541
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,180
You don't need to do this
if you wish to cancel out

542
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,700
your brother's mistakes.

543
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,940
Don't you have any obsessions?

544
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,590
I do.

545
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,830
You knew that it was an obsession.

546
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,620
Why are you still trying to do it?

547
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,350
I just wish to bear
some responsibilities.

548
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,830
Isn't it the same for you?

549
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,230
All these years,

550
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,760
you've been bearing all the responsibilities
on your brother's behalf.

551
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,460
If you survive this time,

552
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,460
you have to learn how to be
responsible for your own life.

553
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,750
If you say that,

554
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,660
I'll leave for real.

555
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,460
Go ahead.

556
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,180
See yourself off.

557
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,510
Wu Xie,

558
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,310
you're truly different
from other people.

559
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,140
I've already decided to stay.

560
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,550
But I'm not doing it for anyone's sake.

561
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,140
I'm doing it

562
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,140
because I wish to bear
responsibilities for it myself.

563
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,020
I heard

564
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,500
that you formed a team behind my back.

565
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,460
What's with that?

566
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,540
You don't want to take me with you now?

567
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,420
You're all independent now, huh?

568
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,980
My legs will recover soon.

569
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,310
Now that she's leaving,
you should reserve a slot for me.

570
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,150
I already reserved the last slot

571
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,020
for you.

572
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,310
That's more like it.

573
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,710
You're my buddy indeed.

574
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,860
But listen,

575
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,350
the Yinshaluo Tribe is truly impressive.

576
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,380
They're not afraid of death at all.

577
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,049
All of them came to me

578
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,190
saying that they wanted
to join the team.

579
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,230
I said no way.

580
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,759
I asked them

581
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,830
if they had no family members
or relatives here.

582
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,409
One of them

583
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,710
had a beautiful wife too.

584
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,310
Look at the situation we're in.

585
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,460
You're still determined
despite your injuries, huh?

586
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,350
Do I look like that kind
of person to you?

587
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,060
You didn't see it for yourself.

588
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,239
They haven't weaned their child yet.

589
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,049
We can't just let
the child be fatherless

590
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,160
after his birth, right?

591
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
I told him that
he wasn't allowed to join us.

592
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,020
If you join us, your family
will be in terrible shape.

593
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,559
He was a burly man,
yet he cried on the spot.

594
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,049
Unlike the Zhang Family.

595
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,540
They're heartless and emotionless.

596
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,670
The men of Yinshaluo Tribe

597
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,079
cherish the warrior title

598
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,860
more than their lives.

599
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,500
That's right.

600
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,110
When they return to their families,

601
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,830
they're husbands

602
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,580
and fathers.

603
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,900
But I'm not envious of them at all.

604
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,670
I'm happy about the fact

605
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,710
that I can die together with you.

606
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,369
Are you sure you're not Zhang Haike?

607
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,380
That hurts.

608
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,310
Naive,

609
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,940
no matter how much you change,

610
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,849
to me,

611
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,380
you'll always be Naive.

612
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,279
As long as I keep calling you Naive,

613
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,559
I'm sure

614
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,310
you'll return to normal one day.

615
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,900
Let's go.

616
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,329
Now, we're seeking death for real.

617
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,750
Everything was meant to
build up to this moment.

618
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,580
There's no room for negotiation now.

619
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,790
What did you write

620
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,350
in the 100-year-old tavern?

621
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,639
I forgot. I forgot that I wrote
that I was going to face

622
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,049
the Night King with Naive.

623
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,670
It's either we die
or return alive together.

624
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,020
This storm is ferocious.

625
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,900
Therefore, we cannot hear each other

626
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,350
when we're inside.

627
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,079
I've come up with some simple gestures.

628
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,719
We need to learn this
as soon as possible.

629
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,110
Show me your hands.

630
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,750
The first gesture,

631
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,350
advance.

632
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,540
That's right. Be more determined.

633
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,639
The second gesture,

634
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,790
retreat.

635
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,009
We don't have a chance to retreat.

636
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,790
Forget about this. Scrap that.

637
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,630
No retreating allowed.

638
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,759
Spread to the left and right?

639
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,239
Look at the number of people we have.

640
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,239
Scrap that as well.

641
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,580
Be on standby?

642
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,500
Do we even have time for that?

643
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,580
Gather around!

644
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,060
Gather around!

645
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,790
Danger!

646
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,830
Danger!

647
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,279
Defeat the monster!

648
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,150
Come, let's take a picture.

649
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,159
I'll say "Yinshaluo Tribe."

650
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,889
You guys will say "Cheese."

651
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,119
Yinshaluo Tribe.

652
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,630
Cheese!

653
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,119
Yindan,

654
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,809
Granny said the scouts

655
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,849
never came back.

656
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,369
She wants you to locate them.

657
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,350
Let's go.

658
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,060
What's going on?

659
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,980
What happened?

660
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,380
Something's off

661
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,190
about the storm.

662
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,190
Our scouts

663
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,150
encountered strong winds

664
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,790
on their way there.

665
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,380
When I arrived,

666
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,350
most of them were
already swept away by the storm.

667
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,230
Granny.

668
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,380
I did everything I could.

669
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,460
But I only managed
to rescue a few of them.

670
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,750
Feng, check the data.

671
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,460
This is bad.

672
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,060
The wind speed has increased.

673
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,540
It's much faster than what we predicted.

674
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,230
Maybe something has happened
to the underground heat source.

675
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,460
How much time do we have left?

676
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,880
We have until tomorrow afternoon
at the latest.

677
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,009
The wind source will reach
the optimal detonation point by then.

678
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,230
Now, I can join
the suicide squad, right?

679
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,009
Yindan is injured.

680
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,310
I'll replace him.

681
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,809
Did you know

682
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,639
why I didn't choose you from the start?

683
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,790
I know.

684
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,350
You want me to leave the place alive

685
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,529
so that I can make it up to my regrets.

686
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,630
You're wrong.

687
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,350
It's because you can save more people

688
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,670
when you're alive.

689
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,190
If our operation fails,

690
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,159
you're the only one

691
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,230
who can take
all the information with you

692
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,750
and show the outside world
what happened here.

693
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,860
You are most familiar
with this piece of information.

694
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,380
You are

695
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,630
our last hope.

696
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,849
Tell everyone to get ready.

697
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,350
We'll depart tomorrow.
