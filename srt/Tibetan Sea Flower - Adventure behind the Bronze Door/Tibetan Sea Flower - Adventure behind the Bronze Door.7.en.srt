00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,230
Based on the information we have,

5
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,640
it seems like the Night King
that you have in mind

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
is some kind of invisible creature.

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,080
We're guessing

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,640
that it sheds these ball-like organs

9
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,080
that become visible after they fall off.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,150
But what exactly is Night King?

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,040
No one really knows much
about its biology.

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,830
So it's normal

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,640
to have conflicting views.

14
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,990
Once we get there

15
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,830
and gather more data,

16
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
we will have our answers.

17
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,160
As it stands,

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Mr. Wu has been chosen
by Mr. Zhang Qiling

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,510
to deal with the Night King.

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,920
Anjing Company is willing

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,640
to pay three million yuan.

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,550
As for the Zhang family,

23
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,440
we are prepared
to offer two million yuan

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
to rent the Heavenly Staff,

25
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,830
plus an additional two million yuan
as a service fee.

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,040
What do you all think?

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,920
The Denaxi people

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,480
sure are straightforward.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,710
But why are they getting paid

30
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,950
more than us?

31
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,790
Mr. Wang,

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,790
we can negotiate the price

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,370
if you have other bargaining chips.

34
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,790
You can discuss it amongst yourselves.

35
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,200
But we don't have much time.

36
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,070
What do you think about this?

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,920
This meeting could go on forever
if we keep talking like this.

38
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,640
We've pretty much obtained
the information we need.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,440
What's your take?

40
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,790
So far,

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,710
it seems like a real meeting.

42
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,200
It means
they can't overpower each other.

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
This balance could last for a while.

44
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,510
So we are safe for now.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,270
Also,

46
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,270
I don't think their disagreement
can be easily resolved.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,440
Feng wants to study Night King,

48
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,920
and Zhang Haike wants to kill it.

49
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,320
If we let them keep talking,

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,830
they might end up fighting.

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,550
So, we need to find an excuse

52
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,950
to get them to reach
some basic agreement.

53
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,640
Then we can make our exit.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
How do we wrap this up?

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Denaxi people are known

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,770
for taking their time in meetings.

57
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,360
They are very patient.

58
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,270
Just watch me.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,550
Mr. Wu,

60
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,200
how did the discussion go?

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Any conclusions?

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,830
It's settled.

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
No issues, we agree.

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,200
You guys make the final decision.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,080
We're good with it.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
I accept the earlier proposal.

67
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,440
You can have the key,

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,270
but Night King must be captured alive.

69
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,640
That's my bottom line.

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
Night King has to die.

71
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,080
That's my bottom line.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,710
We need to study Night King.

73
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,270
Great.

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,800
Then there's only one solution.

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,830
We're hungry.
So we want to grab some food.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
You guys can sort this out

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,830
however you see fit.

78
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,000
After all, you've tapped our phones.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,440
Am I right?

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,370
Call us when you're done.

81
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,270
Let's go.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,640
No one can leave this room

83
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,080
until we reach an agreement.

84
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't draw your guns.

85
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,710
Let's all calm down, okay?

86
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,680
Weren't we invited here
to discuss cooperation?

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
Cooperation, by definition,

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,710
means sitting down

89
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,270
and working together.

90
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,560
Let's enjoy the peanuts.

91
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,320
We will stay.

92
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,680
Put down your weapons.

93
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,470
Thank you so much.

94
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,150
Any ideas, Mr. Wu?

95
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,640
Here's how I see it.

96
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,470
The one thing we all know for sure

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,710
is that Night King

98
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,080
is a terrifying creature.

99
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,120
You want to kill Night King.

100
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,200
But you want to capture Night King alive.

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,030
But no matter

102
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,390
which side wins,

103
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,880
the first couple of things
we need to do are, one,

104
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,800
get the key and find the Heavenly Staff,

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,030
and two, capture Night King.

106
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,070
That's correct, right?

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,910
First, we can work together

108
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,590
to complete those steps.

109
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,800
I don't oppose that.

110
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,950
But how do we settle

111
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,710
who gets Night King?

112
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,800
That's easy.

113
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,950
Once we reach the snowy mountain,
we'll draw a line in the snow.

114
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,830
Then, all three teams will set out
from that line at the same time.

115
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,300
Whoever gets to Night King first,

116
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,080
keeps Night King.

117
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,800
It's like a game.

118
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,790
Can we end the meeting now?

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
That was impressive of you.

120
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,560
Just okay.
This is what I call delayed conflict.

121
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,240
I think the information we got

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,320
should make you happy.

123
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,000
Does it?

124
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,180
I find what those foreigners said
pretty interesting.

125
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,830
Wu Xie.

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,440
Your quick thinking during today's
negotiations was impressive.

127
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,800
Better than expected.

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,150
I'm glad you are satisfied.

129
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,200
The intel is good.

130
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,640
You are a bit sneaky.

131
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,070
You're flattering me.
I'm just looking out for myself.

132
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Please don't rely on me.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm only here

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,270
to uncover Qiling's past.

135
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,440
I don't want any part

136
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,710
in your conflicts.

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,080
Did I make myself clear enough?

138
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,640
It is too late now.

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
You're already caught in the conflicts.

140
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,470
Naive here was born

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,510
to be at the center of the storm.

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,240
Go and get some rest.

143
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's go.

144
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,560
Haike,

145
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,440
are you sure about this?

146
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,430
Are you really serious
about working with those foreigners?

147
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,120
Why can't we just fight and take the key

148
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,590
from them in the meeting room?

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,870
After all, it belongs
to the Zhang family.

150
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,930
Wu Xie has a unique constitution.
We've gone through a lot to find him.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
So we need to be cautious

152
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,590
to gain his trust.

153
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,270
Once his safety is ensured,

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,710
we'll grab Feng's key.

155
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,080
So, do you have a complete plan?

156
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,910
Don't you trust my strategy?

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,120
Is it worth it?

158
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Can't we

159
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,510
just be free like everyone else?

160
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,590
Everyone has their own thoughts.

161
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,310
I don't want to escape.

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,460
Then I'll go with you.

163
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,870
You don't have to get yourself involved.

164
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,710
You're my only brother.

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,400
Do you believe

166
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,920
what was said today?

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
The story is quite interesting.

168
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,560
One moment, it's fighting Night King,

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,280
the next it's
about biological disasters.

170
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,160
What do you think

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
Night King really is?

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,520
Forget about what Night King is.

173
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,280
If you ask me,

174
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,350
if the Zhang family and Feng
can't handle it,

175
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,470
do you think Qiling would leave it to us?

176
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,870
If Zhang Haike tricked you once,

177
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,370
he can trick you over and over again.

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,080
Fatty,

179
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
I've been deceived so many times

180
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,970
that I have developed
an instinctive response.

181
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,750
Trusting my instincts seems
more reliable.

182
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,350
All right.

183
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,990
It's just the two of us now.

184
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,550
Let's talk about how to make our escape.

185
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,870
Should we split up or run together?

186
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
You're more important.

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,110
You should go first.

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,990
Pretend to be two people

189
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,400
while I hide.

190
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,920
When they think we both ran off,

191
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,990
they'll chase after us.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
By that time, I'll make my move.

193
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,710
Fatty,

194
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,040
let me mentally prepare myself for this.

195
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,400
I can't bear to leave Yu Da's scrolls.

196
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,630
Give me a moment to let go.

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Once we're gone,

198
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,450
Zhang Haike and his crew will probably
burn this whole place down.

199
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,210
- What should we do then?
- Zhang Haike is just trying to scare you.

200
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,470
Even if I urge him to do it,
would he really do it?

201
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,230
If Qiling finds out about this,

202
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,800
Qiling will take care of him.

203
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
Fatty,

204
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,830
the way you just broke it down for me

205
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,320
made me feel at ease.

206
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,950
For some reason, I feel calm now.

207
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,520
Let's go.

208
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,680
I didn't expect this trip
to be so short.

209
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,470
I can hardly believe it myself.

210
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you need a hand?

211
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
Wait, stop packing.

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
No, we're not going to wait anymore.

213
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,990
We must leave. Don't change your mind.

214
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
Fatty, listen to me.

215
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
After the meeting ended,

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
I took a closer look.

217
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,870
The entire spiritual retreat
is surrounded by those foreigners,

218
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,720
plus there are so many members
of the Zhang family.

219
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,070
Do you think we can really escape?

220
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,990
Even if we manage

221
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,800
to get out of the spiritual retreat,

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,040
there's still
the snowy mountain outside.

223
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,990
We're such big targets

224
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,950
that they'll easily catch us again.

225
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,230
So I think

226
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
we need to find a way
to get down the mountain first,

227
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,930
and then we make our escape.

228
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,280
Then you can't be yourself,

229
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
only we can make it out.

230
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Explain.

231
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Xinyue Hotel.

232
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Do you still remember?

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,870
Remember what big shots
we were back then?

234
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,280
No one dared to look down on us.

235
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,440
They must've thought
we were really something

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
to make an entrance like that.

237
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,630
You've got to make them think

238
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,830
you owned this whole world.

239
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,870
Then you can start giving orders, right?

240
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,830
Like, open the door,

241
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,630
get out of the way, or lead the way.

242
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
It doesn't matter

243
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,080
if it's real or not, right?

244
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,280
(We will just put up an act.)

245
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,520
(You should act as the leader)

246
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,800
(and demand unified management.)

247
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,110
Every group needs a leader.

248
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
So we need a leader.

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,160
Indeed,

250
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,590
he's the specialist appointed by Qiling

251
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,040
to deal with Night King.

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,040
There's no one else but him.

253
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
Since this is Qiling's request,

254
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,440
I won't refuse.

255
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,950
I have no objections.

256
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,230
I agree. So, no problem.

257
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,350
(Before we set off,
you should ask everyone)

258
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,950
(to go down the mountain
for a team-building activity.)

259
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,320
(First, it is to break down barriers.)

260
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,590
(Second, to showcase skills.)

261
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,470
We'll demonstrate our unique skills
to everyone.

262
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,630
Yes, we'll show them

263
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,280
one skill.

264
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Or two skills.

265
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,830
(Once we're down the mountain,)

266
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,590
(use the excuse of testing marksmanship)

267
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,870
(to demonstrate long-distance shooting
with an air gun.)

268
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,830
(Keep as far
from the crowd as possible.)

269
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,590
Move a bit.

270
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,350
Keep moving.

271
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Excuse me, folks.

272
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,990
Make way.

273
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,800
Don't harm innocent people.

274
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,280
(When the distance is right,)

275
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
(we'll make a run for it.)

276
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,080
How far

277
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,680
do you think

278
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,630
they'll start running?

279
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,630
Twenty meters.

280
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,040
Twenty-six meters.

281
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,230
Thirty meters.

282
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,920
One hundred meters.

283
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,950
Thirty-one meters.

284
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,080
Thirty-three meters!

285
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,230
Stop!

286
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,630
Don't run!

287
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,110
(When I was tracking the Zhang family,)

288
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,350
(I already mapped out the terrain here.)

289
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Get out of the way!

290
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,590
What's your problem?

291
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,080
Watch where you're going.

292
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,800
(The streets here have
many intersections.)

293
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
(So, we have a chance.)

294
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,710
You, go that way!

295
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,110
Where did they go?

296
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,680
I don't know. They are probably nearby.

297
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,280
Did you see them?

298
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,230
Over there!

299
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,800
After them!

300
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,800
Let's go.

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,350
Run.

302
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,470
Hurry.

303
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,920
Not this way.

304
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,080
Come this way.

305
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,470
Hurry.

306
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
Land Deity?

307
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Hurry!

308
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
There is no one here.

309
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Come on, let's go.

310
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,870
The lights are blinding me.

311
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,040
Oh, sorry about that.

312
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,080
Mr. Yu Da,

313
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,470
what are you doing in here?

314
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,200
Why are you here?

315
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I asked you first.

316
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,560
Yeah, he asked you first.

317
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,630
I came down the mountain
to buy something.

318
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
I saw you two on the run.

319
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,400
What are you running for?

320
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,800
Someone is after us.

321
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,350
Yes, bad guys are after us.

322
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,040
Did you see us?

323
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,230
How did you end up within this wall?

324
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,470
When fate arrives,

325
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,990
it just happens.

326
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Come.

327
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,160
I'll take you out of here.

328
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,110
Fate.

329
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,160
Mr. Yu Da,

330
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
how did you find this place?

331
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,230
When I was young,
I secretly came down here for a feast

332
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,560
and discovered this secret passage.

333
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,350
Even practitioners are this poor.

334
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
Fate follows its own path.

335
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,440
If you can't break it, you'll hold on.

336
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,630
Once you break it,

337
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,990
the heart is free from everything.

338
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,390
I learned something new.

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
If you go out from here,

340
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,430
there's a bus station outside.

341
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,910
Once you get on the bus,

342
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
you'll be free.

343
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,670
We'll part ways here.

344
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,720
As expected from a master.

345
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Seamless connection.

346
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,520
It's fate.

347
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,910
It's fate, indeed.

348
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,670
Yes, it's fate.

349
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,350
Come on.

350
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,110
Okay.

351
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,800
Thank you, Mr. Yu Da.

352
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,830
There is one more thing.

353
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,430
I found Zhang Qiling's memory.

354
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,830
What?

355
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,720
I said I found Zhang Qiling's memory.

356
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,240
You found it?

357
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,910
I placed it in Zhang Qiling's room.

358
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,830
It's up to you
whether you are going to see it or not.

359
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,240
What are you doing?

360
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,350
Naive, time to go.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,870
Sorry about that.

362
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,280
Also,

363
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
the young girl with you

364
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,390
is asking about the scrolls.

365
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,800
If you don't want to look at it,

366
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,800
I'll give it

367
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,630
to that pretty young girl.

368
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
I'll get going now.

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,670
Why are you telling me this
when I'm about to leave?

370
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,720
Let's have a hotpot when we get back.

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm sure Yu Da

372
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,630
is Zhang Haike's pawn.

373
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,080
See how sneaky he is.

374
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's go.

375
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,080
There are empty seats. Come on.

376
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,430
We're lucky they have empty seats.

377
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,430
Come on, let's go home.

378
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,290
What are you thinking about?

379
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,560
Going back is just a trap.

380
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,720
We barely made it out.

381
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,240
Now you want to go back?

382
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,240
Don't say anything.

383
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
Hurry up, get on the bus.

384
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,520
Fatty, I still want to go back.

385
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
Qiling might leave

386
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,240
important information in the scroll.

387
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,430
I don't want to miss it.

388
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,040
And if they burn it...

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,870
Naive,

390
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,110
you can be naive,

391
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,720
but don't be foolish.

392
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,480
Why did the scroll only appear now?

393
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,910
Why did it appear right after we ran?

394
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,960
Don't you think that's suspicious?

395
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,670
This scroll has turned you

396
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,040
into a fool.

397
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,390
What nonsense scroll?

398
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,670
It is obviously a trap.

399
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,560
If it were a trap,

400
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,350
Yu Da wouldn't have let us escape.

401
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
After all these years,

402
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,280
we finally got

403
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
some information about Qiling.

404
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,630
If we leave now,

405
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,430
it will fall into Zhang Haike's hands.

406
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,040
All our years of research on Qiling

407
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,150
will be for nothing.

408
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,270
Are you getting in or what?
Can we leave now?

409
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,520
Wait for a while.

410
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,040
Stop messing around.

411
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm begging you.

412
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,800
Come. You can sit on my lap.

413
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,720
Come on.

414
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,800
Let's go home.

415
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,070
Fatty, I want to take the risk.

416
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,480
If it doesn't work out, I'll find a way

417
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,870
to escape
after looking at the scroll.

418
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay.

419
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,590
Go ahead and take that risk.

420
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,390
Have fun, then.

421
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Let's go!

422
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,040
Fatty.

423
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,320
All the best of luck.

424
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,520
What are you doing?

425
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,720
Let's go.

426
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,910
Go?

427
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,110
Where to?

428
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,000
Back up the mountain.

429
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,720
Then?

430
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,800
Look at the scroll.

431
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,590
Can you not look at it?

432
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,830
Are you going to look at it, then?

433
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,190
I can accompany you.

434
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,000
For Qiling.

435
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
Why are you giving it to me again?

436
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
For Qiling.

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,670
Let's go.

438
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,190
Those two useless pricks

439
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,910
really ran away.

440
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,720
Why are we still looking for them?

441
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,000
Haike,

442
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,670
let's just go on our own.

443
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,760
Don't just walk by.

444
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,240
Don't miss it.

445
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,390
Huge clearance sale.

446
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,390
Just two yuan,
everything for two yuan.

447
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,590
Don't just walk by. Don't miss it.

448
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,870
Huge clearance sale.

449
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,800
Just two yuan,
everything for two yuan.

450
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,350
Don't just walk by. Don't miss it.

451
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,320
Huge clearance sale.

452
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,320
Just two yuan,
everything for two yuan.

453
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,720
Welcome! A warm welcome.

454
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,800
Don't just walk by. Don't miss it.

455
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Stop the tractor!

456
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Don't just walk by. Don't miss it.

457
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,830
Out of sight, out of mind.

458
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,910
Seeing a bunch of fools.

459
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,870
Huge clearance sale.

460
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,720
Just two yuan,
everything for two yuan.

461
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,240
Master,

462
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,910
do you think taking them with us

463
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,830
will hold us back?

464
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,630
Fatty,

465
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,320
since they've waited

466
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,000
for us so long,

467
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,870
let's give them another chance.

468
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,110
Should we?

469
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,320
Our escape this time

470
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,960
is to show you

471
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,350
that we have absolute strength.

472
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,080
Absolute strength.

473
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,000
Whatever we want to do,

474
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,630
you can never stop us.

475
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,800
No one can.

476
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
If you run,

477
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,830
you'll face the consequences.

478
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,960
Are you telling me what to do?

479
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,480
Fatty,

480
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
I'm hungry.

481
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,590
The master is hungry.

482
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,970
Who is going to arrange the meal?

483
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,280
If Mr. Wu wants to have a meal, fine.

484
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,430
You can also have the money.

485
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,670
Since you're the leader,

486
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,960
you must have a plan for dealing
with Night King.

487
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,000
After the meal,

488
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,800
you can tell us about it, right?

489
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,520
No problem.

490
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,320
No problem.

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,830
No problem.

492
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,480
No problem.

493
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,960
No problem.

494
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,480
No problem.

495
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,520
(In the newly obtained scroll,)

496
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,110
(I finally saw the subsequent
of Qiling's survival training.)

497
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,870
Why are there so many bodies?

498
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,800
What happened here?

499
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,560
The index and middle fingers
of this hand

500
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,800
are longer than those
of an average person.

501
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,370
This is a characteristic
of the Zhang family members.

502
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,110
It really is one of their own.

503
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,080
How did they die?

504
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,630
The cause of death is a broken neck.

505
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,240
This is the signature fighting style
of the clan.

506
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,280
Are you saying

507
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,430
this Zhang family member was killed
by their own people?

508
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,430
So, the family members

509
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,240
were killing each other here?

510
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,670
It's the same with this guy here.

511
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,910
This one too.

512
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,590
What happened here?

513
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,560
I get it now.

514
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,870
This is likely a scene of internal conflict
of two factions from the Zhang family.

515
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,190
How so?

516
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,430
Look here.

517
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,280
There's a thick layer of plaster

518
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,190
on the side wall's sealing area.

519
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,000
This means
the Zhang family members inside

520
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,480
wanted to seal off the entrance.

521
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,630
Meanwhile, members on the outside
were pulling bricks out.

522
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,910
So I'm guessing that there were two factions
of the Zhang family inside.

523
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,800
Let's call them Faction A and Faction B.

524
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,240
For some reason,

525
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,300
they ended up fighting each other
in the stone hall.

526
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,710
The conflict was extremely brutal.

527
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,430
In the end, Faction A killed all
of Faction B's people inside.

528
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,470
But there were more of Faction B's
people outside trying to get in.

529
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,520
Faction A then sealed the entrance.

530
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,630
How could this be?

531
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,110
During the landslide

532
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,350
at Zhang Family Castle,

533
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,800
were our ancestors engaged
in internal strife?

534
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,800
What triggered their conflict?

535
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,480
Why did it have to happen
during the landslide?

536
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,240
There must be a secret here.

537
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,240
Maybe there's a rare treasure.

538
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,720
Where's that punk?

539
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,320
He was here just now.

540
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,560
Darn it.

541
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,720
That kid got there first.

542
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,150
What kind of place is this?

543
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,240
It's really eerie.

544
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,350
This should be the dungeon
from back then.

545
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,480
It might be used to imprison

546
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,190
and punish clan members
who made mistakes.

547
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,240
Why are there so many jars here?

548
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,040
The jars have bloodstains.

549
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,390
These jars were used to store blood.

550
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
It looked like a lot of blood were used.

551
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,190
Haike,

552
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,800
there's a brazier.

553
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,040
Light it up.

554
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,630
That punk is over there.

555
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,830
Jinx.

556
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,350
Show me

557
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,320
what you found.

558
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,150
These are also members of the family.

559
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,400
The situation is the same as before.

560
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,870
Their necks were also twisted
in the same way.

561
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,070
They were also killed
by their own people.

562
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,190
If we look at their posture and attire,

563
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,480
they were wearing protective goggles
and masks.

564
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,720
It's likely to assist
in underwater operations.

565
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,480
They are all still connected by ropes.

566
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,910
I assume it was to help
each other underwater.

567
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,560
It seems

568
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,320
they intended to enter this pool.

569
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,240
There must be something below this pool

570
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,870
or a passage leading somewhere else.

571
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,830
This is the Zhang Family Castle.

572
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,390
There's definitely more to this place.

573
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,070
There must be other hidden areas.

574
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,390
Am I right, you punk?

575
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,830
The bodies here look a bit strange.

576
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,110
The bodies here are all

577
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
from the same family.

578
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,480
But they didn't die the same way.

579
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,080
They didn't die from broken necks.

580
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,390
The only wounds they have

581
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,430
are on their wrists.

582
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
They were bled out.

583
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,560
I recognize those cuts.

584
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
The Zhang family leaves these marks

585
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,150
when they draw blood.

586
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,080
Draw blood?

587
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,560
I've heard

588
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,280
some members of the Zhang family
have a special kind of blood

589
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,670
that can repel bugs.

590
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,280
In areas overrun by venomous bugs,

591
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,280
they'd use their blood
to pass through safely.

592
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,560
The way they bled themselves matches

593
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,590
the wounds on these bodies.

594
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,590
So, the clan members locked them up here

595
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
to harvest their blood?

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,390
For what?

597
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,870
Are there bugs around here?

598
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
There's none here.

599
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,430
Maybe they're in the water.

600
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,670
So,

601
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,320
they used the blood

602
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
to pass through the pond?

603
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,830
That's just a legend.

604
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,480
It might not even be true.

605
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,560
But let me take a wild guess.

606
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,910
Earlier,

607
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,800
we thought outsiders took advantage

608
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,560
of the landslide to raid the place.

609
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,320
But

610
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
what if

611
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,280
it wasn't the outsiders?

612
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,470
What if it was someone
from within Zhang Family Castle?

613
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,430
What do you mean?

614
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,870
The Zhang Family Castle was where
the Zhang family gathered their wealth.

615
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,320
They must have accumulated
a lot of treasure

616
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,960
and hidden them deep inside.

617
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,070
Somewhere that is
normally impossible to reach.

618
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,630
But after the landslide,

619
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,560
the castle's defenses were compromised.

620
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,870
An insider might have seen
an opportunity

621
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,150
and launched an attack.

622
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,630
But the guards found out.

623
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,080
So

624
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,390
one group blocked the entrance

625
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,240
to stop more guards from coming in.

626
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,670
Meanwhile, another group

627
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,360
started draining blood
from their own people

628
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,150
to get into that pond.

629
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,760
That makes sense.

630
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,960
So, there really were traitors
back then.

631
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,280
They were willing to take the risk
to kill their own.

632
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,190
They drew their blood

633
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,630
to get inside at all costs.

634
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,830
Whatever's under that water
must be incredibly important.

635
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,630
Do any of you possess
that special blood?

636
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,560
It doesn't matter if you don't.

637
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,910
Even if there were bugs,

638
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,800
they would be dead from hunger by now.

639
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,800
Let's go

640
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,870
and check it out.

641
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,920
Don't be reckless.

642
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,880
Just here alone,

643
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,270
so many Zhang family members died.

644
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,520
It'll be even more dangerous down there.

645
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,270
We need to figure out exactly

646
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,790
what happened here

647
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,710
before we make a move.

648
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,040
I can tell you what happened.

649
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,710
I was here

650
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
when it all happened.

651
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,230
You've been here?

652
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,070
This place is the scene
of the clan's internal conflict,

653
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,960
one that none of us knew about.

654
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,040
What does that tell you?

655
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,080
That means this part of history
must be a taboo in the clan.

656
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
You brought us here.

657
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,440
Do you really think
the clan will let us off?

658
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,440
He's up to something.

659
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,490
He's trying to get us killed.

660
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,570
Let's grab Jinx and take him back
to make up for this.

661
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,480
Stop fighting.

662
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,840
We need to figure it out first.

663
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,960
Enough!

664
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,920
We came here of our own free will.

665
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,190
It's not his fault.

666
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
Besides, you guys can't even beat him.

667
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,480
This fight is going nowhere.

668
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,560
We should focus on getting
to the bottom of this.

669
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,630
Don't let him trick you
while you do his dirty work!

670
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,880
Punk,

671
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,630
what exactly happened here?

672
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,110
If you want to know what happened,

673
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,270
you first need to know

674
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,920
the other name for this place.

675
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
Zhang Family Castle is just

676
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,590
what the clan calls it.

677
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,000
The real name of this place

678
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,520
is Sifang City.

679
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,230
Sifang City?

680
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,270
Are you saying this is Sifang City?

681
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,360
The place where that big event happened?

682
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,790
What event?

683
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,360
I've heard
the older generation talking about it.

684
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,920
It is said that Sifang City is where

685
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,410
the previous patriarch
was assassinated.

686
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,630
Many years ago,

687
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,710
a group of Zhang family traitors plotted
to kill the patriarch.

688
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,360
The battle was brutal.

689
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,270
Many clan members died from it.

690
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,710
This room

691
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,590
was where the traitors set up

692
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,230
their ambush

693
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,670
to chase down the patriarch.

694
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
The pool here was filled
with venomous bugs,

695
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,850
which was impossible to cross.

696
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,110
They captured

697
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,100
some kids with special blood
from the Zhang family

698
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,080
to clear a path through the water.

699
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,440
You were here back then.

700
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,270
So you're saying...

701
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,190
They took my blood too.

702
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,440
You must have felt so helpless.

703
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,360
During all of this,

704
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,920
Sifang City was completely buried
in the landslide.

705
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,000
They had to give up
on the assassination.

706
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,230
I've heard about what happened next.

707
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,920
Sifang City was submerged,

708
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,970
and the patriarch died
in the deepest part,

709
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,480
along with the symbol of his authority.

710
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,150
The Heavenly Staff

711
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,920
was also buried along with Sifang City.

712
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,560
Heavenly Staff?

713
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,840
What's that?

714
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,110
I'm not exactly sure.

715
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,960
But I've heard

716
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,830
the Heavenly Staff has some kind
of special power.

717
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,790
If the patriarch had it,

718
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,310
he could communicate with spirits
and know everything.

719
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,970
The Heavenly Staff
is incredibly important to the clan.

720
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,750
Ever since we lost it,

721
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,150
our clan has been gradually declining.

722
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,110
If the Heavenly Staff is so important,

723
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,960
why hasn't anyone
from the clan come to find it

724
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,920
despite the decline?

725
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,080
Our ancestors had different views
on the Heavenly Staff.

726
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,440
Besides granting us power,

727
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,630
it also has harmful effects

728
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,590
on our clan.

729
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,190
What kind of effects?

730
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,670
Only the patriarch knows about that.

731
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,790
There are many weapons
from the Zhang family here.

732
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,360
If you take some
and head back the way you came,

733
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,520
you'll pass the test.

734
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,400
After you return,

735
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,190
don't mention you've been
to Sifang City.

736
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,310
As long as you keep quiet,

737
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,480
they won't give you any trouble.

738
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,000
After we take the weapons and leave,

739
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
what about you?

740
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,710
I need to go much deeper.

741
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,590
What I'm looking for

742
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
is very deep down.

743
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,520
You can't help me.

744
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
Only I can reach

745
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,110
some places.

746
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,070
What exactly are you looking for?

747
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,400
Is it the Heavenly Staff?

748
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You don't know much about this place.

749
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,000
Just take what you can and leave.

750
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,110
Don't go any further.

751
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,840
Or

752
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,190
you'll die.

753
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,520
What now?

754
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,110
Can we trust Jinx?

755
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,000
I don't care if he's telling the truth.

756
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,630
If we believe him, we will lose.

757
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,190
Why should I trust him?

758
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,630
I can't accept this.

759
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,190
If his goal is
to find the Heavenly Staff

760
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,040
and he happens to get it,

761
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,040
it could change everything

762
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,790
for the Zhang family.

763
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,920
So,

764
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,040
aren't we the participants?

765
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,520
But, the Zhang family

766
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,310
might not want him
to get the Heavenly Staff.

767
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,790
After all, it is the symbol
of the patriarch's authority.

768
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,670
Why wouldn't the Zhang family want
to get it back?

769
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,310
Don't let that jerk fool you.

770
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,670
He just wants
to take the Heavenly Staff for himself

771
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,880
and claim the credit.

772
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Think about it.

773
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,880
Such an achievement

774
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,790
could earn us a place
within the Zhang family.

775
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,150
I don't care what you think.

776
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,000
I want a piece of that share.

777
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,880
I can tell you're interested in him.

778
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,460
I'm sure you're going, right?

779
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,790
After all, he's our kin.

780
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,880
And knowing more information

781
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,480
will help us adapt to any situation.

782
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,190
Then I'll go too.

783
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,790
There are so many secrets hidden here.

784
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,590
I need to find out the truth.

785
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,190
What about you?

786
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,440
This is much more interesting
than the survival training.

787
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,560
