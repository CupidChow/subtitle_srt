00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 8=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,620
What's going on with that jinx?

5
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,010
He didn't even
respond to the bat whistle.

6
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,290
That punk's footprints
disappeared from here.

7
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,250
He must have entered through this hole.

8
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,039
Haike.

9
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,460
This hole is too small.

10
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,250
I think he can shrink.

11
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,940
What should we do?

12
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,549
There's another hole here.

13
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,940
Let's check this out.

14
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,770
This is probably
an abandoned warehouse.

15
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,250
Look for signs of that punk.

16
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,690
The Zhang family people is here too.

17
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,650
The Zhang family people is here too.

18
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,500
Here.

19
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,300
Look.

20
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,210
This should be
Sifang City's floor plan.

21
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,380
This symbol and this symbol

22
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,149
should represent explored

23
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,770
and unexplored.

24
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,620
We got in from here.

25
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,319
The place where that punk walked

26
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,940
hasn't been explored.

27
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,180
It's not here.

28
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,620
We went the wrong way.

29
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,450
These two holes
connect to two different places.

30
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,770
We got separated from him.

31
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,450
What do we do now?

32
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,949
There are only
dead people and junks here.

33
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,130
There's nothing valuable here.

34
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,180
We're no match for that jinx.

35
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,349
We don't know how to shrink.

36
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,949
What should we do now?

37
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,180
Look.

38
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,980
Why does the ancient city

39
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,380
look so strange?

40
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,799
It

41
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
looks like a scorpion.

42
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,620
What's wrong with you?

43
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,540
Do scorpions disgust you?

44
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,330
What happened to your arm?

45
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,239
Haixing.

46
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,380
Your arm.

47
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,500
What's this?

48
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,810
What is this?

49
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,570
What the hell is this?

50
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,199
Stop scratching it.

51
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,650
The black lines are still spreading.

52
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,420
It's a sign of poisoning.

53
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,690
We're not going to die here, are we?

54
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,679
Take this pill immediately.

55
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,860
It can stop the poison.

56
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,500
Parasites.

57
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,570
Looks like we got these lines

58
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,420
because of these parasites.

59
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,450
That punk said there were
poisonous bugs in the pool.

60
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,100
These bugs were in the pool.

61
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,010
They got in
through our eyes, mouths, and noses

62
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,650
when we're in the pool.

63
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,090
These bugs are
no thicker than hair in the water.

64
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,799
Once they enter the human body,
they may cling to the intestines and suck blood.

65
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,890
That's why we vomited.

66
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,759
At the same time,
toxins enter our blood vessels

67
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,469
making them black.

68
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,999
Zhang Haike. What's the point of talking
so much nonsense at such a time?

69
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,999
Shut up.

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,130
Isn't it because you said
the bugs were dead?

71
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,650
Say something helpful.

72
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,559
Find that punk.

73
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,100
He used to be a blood slave.

74
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,349
His blood
should be able to repel these bugs.

75
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,949
That punk's blood is special.

76
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,109
He's not afraid of bugs.

77
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,620
He must be able to save us.

78
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,580
This is our only chance.

79
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,010
But we don't even know where he is.

80
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,749
I called him with the bat whistle,

81
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,130
but he didn't respond.

82
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,890
Don't move.

83
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,460
It's also on your neck.

84
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,410
You too.

85
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,410
It's all over you.

86
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,380
What do we do?

87
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,399
At this rate,

88
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,170
we won't survive much longer.

89
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,650
He has to come to us.

90
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,770
We have to wreak havoc here.

91
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,829
Serious havoc.

92
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,679
We must make him think
if he doesn't stop us,

93
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,620
Sifang City will collapse.

94
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,410
He can't find
the Heavenly Staff he wants.

95
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,290
He'll come over.

96
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,860
What if he doesn't come?

97
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,250
Then we're doomed.

98
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
But I think he'll come.

99
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,410
We don't even know where that jinx is.

100
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,220
We must make a commotion

101
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,700
to lure him over.

102
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,100
The structure here isn't stable.

103
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,469
We brought explosives.

104
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,700
As long as we create

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,799
enough vibration nearby

106
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,130
to cause a collapse,

107
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,700
he'll come to stop us

108
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,650
no matter
which part of Sifang City he's in.

109
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,319
But

110
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,279
we also have to make sure

111
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,740
we won't get trapped inside.

112
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,469
According to the map,

113
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,050
this hole leads to Sifang City' sewers.

114
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,039
We need to go inside,
set up the explosives,

115
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,439
quickly get out,

116
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,519
and hide somewhere safe.

117
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,650
Haixing.

118
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,410
Stay here and wait.

119
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,229
If he follows the trail to find us,

120
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,279
he'll find this place.

121
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,980
Why should she stay?

122
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,100
Let's take turns. She just had her turn.

123
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,100
Hurry up. I'm dying.

124
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,980
Haike.

125
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,770
Don't worry.

126
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,159
This explosive

127
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,650
should be loud enough
for that punk to hear.

128
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,829
(The collapse caused by Zhang Haike)

129
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,530
(wasn't ordinary.)

130
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,989
(With the explosion,)

131
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,949
(the toxic gas in Sifang City's walls)

132
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,460
(were released.)

133
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,890
(Qiling knew)

134
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,399
(that even he)

135
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,760
(would not survive this toxic gas.)

136
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
(To save them,
he first returned to Ma'an Village)

137
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,650
(After about 30 minutes)
(to seek help from Ma Pingchuan.)

138
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,530
(That's how
the starting scene came to be.)

139
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,580
Are you okay?

140
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,170
You really came back.

141
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,890
It's effective.

142
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,770
I've recovered.

143
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,980
Where are the others?

144
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,130
Save my brother first.

145
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,010
We'll play it by ear
with Zhang Nian and Zhang Jiuri.

146
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,820
The toxic gas here has dissipated.

147
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,340
I wonder what's going on inside.

148
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,220
This is the Zhang family's symbol.

149
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,740
It must be Haike and the others.

150
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,679
Jiuri.

151
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,100
You finally came.

152
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm poisoned and I have no strength.

153
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,410
I can't carry these slabs.

154
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,290
Where's Haike?

155
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,050
Save me first.

156
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,860
Try harder.

157
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,380
You were so strong when you hit me.

158
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,999
Can he grab me instead?

159
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,389
Slow down.

160
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,970
See if my feet are still there.

161
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,450
Shut up. You're annoying.

162
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,410
Blood.

163
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,690
Drink it and save Haike.

164
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,799
Where are Zhang Haike and Zhang Nian?

165
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,300
Zhang Nian
didn't believe you would come,

166
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,589
so he walked inside.

167
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,890
I don't know about Zhang Haike.

168
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,410
Oh no.

169
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,450
What about Haike?

170
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,830
I'll use the bat whistle
to find their location.

171
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,380
Let's see whoever responds first.

172
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,340
Hey.

173
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,490
I knew you would come.

174
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,100
Where's my sister?

175
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,759
Your sister's safe.

176
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,020
They're behind me.

177
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,260
Where's Zhang Nian?

178
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,260
He's right down there.

179
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,380
His bag got stuck on a rock,

180
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,890
so he's hanging in the air.

181
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,890
We're all stuck on rocks.

182
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,490
Move one,

183
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,820
and the other will fall.

184
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,020
Besides, this rock is collapsing.

185
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,780
It's bottomless down there.

186
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,260
I can't hold on any longer.

187
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,410
Looks like only one of us can live.

188
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,820
Who will you save?

189
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,340
Okay.

190
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,540
I knew you'd save him.

191
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,860
The Zhang family
doesn't save those who are dying.

192
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,730
Good job.

193
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,650
Don't move.

194
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll rescue you.

195
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,210
Who do you think you are?

196
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,170
Who told you to pity me?

197
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,490
Who asked you to save me?

198
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,100
Hey, man!

199
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,970
Haike.

200
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,210
Hey.

201
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,130
Thank you for saving us.

202
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,300
Thanks, jinx.

203
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,130
What's wrong with you?

204
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,540
Who thank someone
and call them a jinx?

205
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,319
And you.

206
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,890
Give me a reaction.

207
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,720
There's something wrong with you two.

208
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,650
Since we work so well together,

209
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,820
we're a team from now on.

210
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,820
Since we're a team,

211
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,100
we should have something
that keeps us connected.

212
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,540
This are darts I found just now.

213
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,580
I wanted to use them as wilding's reward.

214
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,260
A scorpion?

215
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,060
I took a look just now.

216
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,780
Everything in here has collapsed.

217
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,170
It's dangerous here.

218
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,730
Let's talk after we get out.

219
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,860
The question now is where should we go.

220
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,380
Hey.

221
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,450
Well...

222
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,860
Can we go back the way we came?

223
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,690
The original path has been blocked,

224
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,970
but I know another way out.

225
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,829
That path is dangerous.
You need to follow me closely.

226
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,340
There's another path?

227
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,410
Why did you
make us dig a hole to come in?

228
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,020
You can only

229
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,589
go out through that path.

230
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,580
When has the Zhang family's
defense system ever failed?

231
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,410
Idiot.

232
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,380
Are you sure
you're not coming with us later?

233
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,589
Are you sure you want to

234
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,130
find Heavenly Staff alone?

235
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,389
Let's go together
since we came together.

236
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,189
Besides,

237
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,890
you only have one life

238
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,389
even if you're more skilled than us.

239
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,020
You can't get it alone.

240
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,690
But I heard from my male elders

241
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,650
that whoever gets Heavenly Staff

242
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,380
can become the patriarch.

243
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,349
What's the matter?

244
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,860
Do you want to be the patriarch too?

245
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,930
I think the punk is more reliable.

246
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,490
He saved the four of us alone.

247
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,580
Why would you want Heavenly Staff?

248
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,780
Do you really want to be the patriarch?

249
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,380
If you become the patriarch,
I'll support you.

250
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,060
Let's go.

251
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,759
Zhang Nian.

252
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,279
Are we looking for a way out
or Heavenly Staff?

253
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,820
Is it settled yet?

254
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,589
We're looking for Heavenly Staff,
of course.

255
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,279
Won't we have come here in vain
if we go out now?

256
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,970
What's the use of that dart?

257
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,020
The exit is in this hole.

258
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,100
Keep moving forward.

259
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,540
What's ahead? It's so cold.

260
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,020
This is the deepest part of Sifang City.

261
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,020
The patriarch brought me here

262
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,690
and went down with the rest.

263
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,410
They planned to make
a final death trap down there

264
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,380
to protect Heavenly Staff.

265
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,650
They left me up here.

266
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,170
Later, I found that the hole

267
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,060
leads to the outside,

268
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,490
and I survived.

269
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,490
Get out through there.

270
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,020
Don't go to other places.

271
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,340
You can still finish wilding

272
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,890
if you go back now.

273
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,300
What about you?

274
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,730
Haike, it's kerosene.

275
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,860
There's kerosene on this chain.

276
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,820
What are you looking at?

277
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,210
I don't want to owe you favors.

278
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,450
Since we came in together,

279
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,210
we must leave together.

280
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,620
What do we need to do?

281
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,730
The patriarch's ship is right ahead.

282
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,410
If they want to set a death trap,

283
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,730
they'll do it there.

284
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,970
Let's go to the ship

285
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,970
to find Heavenly Staff.

286
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,020
Remember.

287
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,100
The patriarch's death trap

288
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,020
must be extremely dangerous.

289
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,380
Act within your capabilities.

290
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,970
It seems there used to be a river here.

291
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,479
Only a layer of mud remained

292
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,210
after the water receded.

293
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,340
This should be the area
where Sifang City's war

294
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,970
took place.

295
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,589
Why are these jars under all this sand?

296
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,820
Don't touch them.

297
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,930
There's something dangerous

298
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,490
underneath these jars.

299
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,349
They must be traps

300
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,669
set by the patriarch.

301
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,580
They're used to resist foreign enemies.

302
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,340
This is rare.

303
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,060
It's the first time

304
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,490
you've listened to anyone but me.

305
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,580
Is the patriarch on this ship?

306
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,450
Not necessarily.

307
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,340
He could be anywhere in this area.

308
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,060
Let's search the ship first.

309
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,349
This ship is so broken

310
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,410
that it doesn't look like
there's any mechanism.

311
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,130
Here.

312
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,260
They were the people
who died in Sifang City's war.

313
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,970
Were they all killed in battle?

314
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,060
They have no obvious injuries.

315
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,890
They looked like
they died from poisoning.

316
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,410
They probably
committed suicide by poisoning.

317
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,580
Something's wrong here.

318
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,890
Let's leave immediately

319
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,300
after finding the staff.

320
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,690
There's something here.

321
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,450
Look at these ancient corpses.

322
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,700
They should be
the Zhang family's corpses.

323
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,220
Their two fingers are very long.

324
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,010
They seem to be protecting this thing.

325
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,450
Could the body

326
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,780
of the Zhang family's patriarch
be in here?

327
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,410
Open it and see.

328
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,660
Whose turn is it?

329
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,220
This needle is poisonous.

330
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,820
It's the mechanism.

331
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,570
We fell into a trap.

332
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,490
Don't move.

333
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,050
Look at the saber

334
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,780
and the dust on this box.

335
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,439
Something was activated

336
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,180
at the bottom of the deck,

337
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,439
causing the entire deck

338
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,050
to vibrate at a high frequency

339
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,220
and their positions to shift.

340
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,970
There's a defense mechanism
set up by the Zhang family here.

341
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,300
When he cut the sail just now,

342
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,789
all the mechanisms were activated.

343
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,149
That means we'll all die here

344
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,050
if we make one wrong move.

345
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,890
The dangers of the Zhang family's traps
are immeasurable,

346
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,700
but we can't die here.

347
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,879
I got it.

348
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,340
It's a weight mechanism.

349
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,090
This ship

350
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,700
is balanced front to back.

351
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,300
Once the mechanism is triggered,

352
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,090
the ship will begin measuring
the weight on the deck.

353
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,490
It is difficult

354
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,490
for ordinary people to feel it.

355
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,140
Once the deck begins to lose balance,

356
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,010
the defense mechanism will be triggered

357
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,450
and the people on board will be killed.

358
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,669
The whole ship is a trap.

359
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,300
Heavenly Staff is certainly not here.

360
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,749
Try to keep your balance
and find a chance to get off the ship

361
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,340
before searching around the ship.

362
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,260
Keep the ship balanced.

363
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,300
Don't let the bead roll.

364
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,340
I can get off the ship now.

365
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,300
I can get off the ship too.

366
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,860
Me too.

367
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,220
Don't move.

368
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,890
There's a mechanism inside.

369
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,660
It's a dead end.
I have to protect myself.

370
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,260
Zhang Nian.

371
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,860
Don't move.

372
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,490
