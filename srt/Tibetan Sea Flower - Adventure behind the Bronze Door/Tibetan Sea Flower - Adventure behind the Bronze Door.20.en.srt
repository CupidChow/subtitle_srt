=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 20=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,020
(Many years earlier)

5
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,750
I can't go on anymore.

6
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,110
Keep up.

7
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,320
Look.

8
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,510
The storm is coming.

9
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,518
If we can't make it over this mountain,

10
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,750
we are going to freeze to death
at the peak.

11
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,630
It's better to turn back now.

12
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,859
I'm taking my team back down.

13
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,169
Are you joining us?

14
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,720
You can't turn back now.

15
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,750
Oriental,

16
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,510
don't try to give any command

17
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,889
if you are out of your mind.

18
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,190
If we reach the peak,

19
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,190
we might freeze to death,

20
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,750
or we might not.

21
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,630
If the wind changes direction,

22
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,560
it might be warm up there,

23
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,400
and we wouldn't die.

24
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,030
But if we turn back,

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,600
that area

26
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,160
will be buried by the snow.

27
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,910
If you wish to stay alive,

28
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,750
you have to make it to the peak.

29
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,350
What if the wind doesn't change?

30
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,019
At least your body

31
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,280
could be discovered at the peak,

32
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,169
not under the snow.

33
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,280
I thought you'd never been here before.

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,510
How can you be so sure?

35
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,600
Boss,

36
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,320
what should we do now?

37
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,950
The oriental says

38
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,190
that if they stray from the path,

39
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,910
a spirit guide will appear
to illuminate the way.

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,790
We push forward!

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,120
Go! Go! Go!

42
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,019
We should go down the mountain.

43
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,070
Yeah, but

44
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,579
why are we up here?

45
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,139
I don't know,
but the Boss said to move forward.

46
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,190
The storm is not stopping.

47
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,830
You guys all right?

48
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,089
It's so cold.

49
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,800
It's so cold. We are freezing here.
We are about to die.

50
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,920
I think we made the wrong bet.

51
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,950
I'm sorry, children.

52
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,680
I should've taken you all
out of the mountains sooner.

53
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,950
Did you see that?

54
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,680
(After leading the group of the Denaxis)

55
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,750
(to avoid the storm,)

56
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,440
(Qiling walked into the depths
of the snow mountains alone)

57
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,440
(to continue his investigation
on Dong Can.)

58
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,680
(In front of an unnoticeable crack,)

59
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,150
(he sensed something unusual.)

60
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,200
(The Zhang Family's emblem)

61
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,710
(Inside the cave,)

62
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,390
(he saw a mural
of Night King Devours The Sky)

63
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,680
(and that Zhang Family's spy
named Dong Can.)

64
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,510
(He was curled up into a ball)

65
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,040
(and embedded in the wall.)

66
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,579
(It seemed Dong Can died)

67
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,800
(due to a great secret
hidden inside the snow mountains.)

68
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,560
(Why did Dong Can die?)

69
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,270
(What was that secret?)

70
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,680
(Qiling carried Dong Can's body
on his back)

71
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,560
(and traced the clues,)

72
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,440
(which led him
to Jila Spiritual Retreat.)

73
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,320
(The scroll)

74
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,320
(disappeared again.)

75
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,160
(Yet it doesn't provoke any anger
from me.)

76
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,680
(I hope I'm lucky enough)

77
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,230
(to see what happens next soon.)

78
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,920
(My hunch tells me)

79
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,440
(that the key secret of Qiling)

80
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,190
(will be revealed to me in no time.)

81
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,040
It's you?

82
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,950
How did you manage to find me?

83
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,139
Mr. Zhang Haike told Mr. Yu Da

84
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,350
that you are here.

85
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,110
Congratulations, honored guest.

86
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,470
Scrolls?

87
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,590
Did you come here alone?

88
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,529
Mr. Yu Da said

89
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,190
fate brings everything to meet.

90
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,259
And this is the fate

91
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,920
you won't miss out on.

92
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,760
So, did you get these

93
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,470
by chance again?

94
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,459
We found them

95
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,160
while cleaning the spiritual retreat.

96
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,259
Mr. Yu Da said

97
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,830
you would need them for sure.

98
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,190
Fine.

99
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,760
Whatever you say.

100
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,400
Mr. Yu also mentioned

101
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,230
that you need not be too moved.

102
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,920
You might be overwhelmed.

103
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,920
Our karma bond is still long.

104
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,350
Trying to change to another face
and hide again?

105
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,760
You are indeed bold

106
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,350
to hide in this place.

107
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,950
Where's Wu Xie?

108
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,520
You guys didn't tell Wu Xie.

109
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,230
You came here alone.

110
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,520
I knew you betrayed the Zhang Family.

111
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,520
Take my life if you can.

112
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,710
Then, we will be even.

113
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,760
The obstacle is settled.

114
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,710
We will enter the snow mountains tomorrow.
You all follow behind.

115
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,160
I will check in with you regularly
to confirm your position.

116
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,760
Don't worry.

117
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,870
Wu Xie has trusted us completely.

118
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,520
No problem.

119
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,040
After all these years,

120
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,470
I will definitely make it this time.

121
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,470
You are back.

122
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,070
Here.

123
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,800
How was it?

124
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,830
Any luck with the information
Qiling left?

125
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,680
How are things going on your end?

126
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,739
The bodies of the Zhangs

127
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,049
have been buried properly.

128
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,350
I'm waiting for Feng's results now.

129
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,470
Well,

130
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,219
they have already rested in peace.

131
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,830
We should carry on.

132
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,470
Cheer up.

133
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,760
We still have no news about Zhang Nian.

134
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,099
Zhang Haike won't be able
to find him either.

135
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,590
I guess this fellow

136
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,350
must be hiding somewhere like a coward.

137
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,640
Most of the records Wang Jinyuan made

138
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,040
have been burned.

139
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,070
The only section that remained

140
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,760
mentioned that Qiling was investigating
some secrets in the snow mountains.

141
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,710
What exactly are these secrets?

142
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,640
No idea.

143
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,190
But the Nose of the Zhang Family

144
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,049
died in the snow mountains because of them.

145
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,760
I feel that it's related
to the Night King.

146
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,019
Check them out quickly.

147
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,350
I need to sober up.

148
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,440
That old Yu Da

149
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,760
is like an NPC.

150
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,190
When you finish the mission,
he gives you some clues.

151
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,350
I believe

152
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,920
the key information

153
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,040
is all inside these scrolls.

154
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,110
I will tell you after studying it.

155
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,529
(This scroll)

156
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,350
(happens to continue the content
of Wang Jinyuan's scroll.)

157
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,320
(I finally saw the part
related to the secret)

158
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,040
(that led Qiling to enter the snow mountains.)

159
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,950
May I know who you are, honored guest?

160
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,040
How did you know my name?

161
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,400
Zhang Qiling.

162
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,139
I'm the current Deren.

163
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,950
At your command, patriarch.

164
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,560
Help me identify someone.

165
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,379
Who do you want me to identify, sir?

166
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,520
Dong Can.

167
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,870
Take a look at this.

168
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,160
Is this him?

169
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,070
It's him.

170
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,830
Dong Can's original name is Zhang Can.

171
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,649
He's one of the thirteen noses

172
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,470
from the Zhang Family
in the southwest region.

173
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,040
Why is he dead?

174
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,320
I found his body

175
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,680
in a cave in the snow mountains.

176
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,430
He was curled up into a ball

177
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,200
and embedded in the wall.

178
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,150
A ball?

179
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,630
On the wall,

180
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,590
there was this mural.

181
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,240
I haven't seen this before.

182
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,219
It seems like a kind

183
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,830
of special primitive religious worship.

184
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,769
Some ancient texts
in the scripture repository

185
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,329
may have its records.

186
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,070
I will look up for it quickly.

187
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,910
I need to know the last place
Dong Can stayed

188
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,760
before he died.

189
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,560
I'm going to find the clue
to his death in the snow mountains.

190
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,480
Dong Can came to this spiritual retreat
before entering the snow mountains.

191
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,419
The last place he stayed

192
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,280
was the guestroom.

193
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,520
Let me show you the way.

194
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:04,590
Let's go.

195
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,870
This painting seems to
have been left by Dong Can.

196
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,720
The lake in the painting,

197
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,590
where is it?

198
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,320
I have never seen a lake
as beautiful as this.

199
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,560
If I had to say where it is,

200
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,830
it could only be in heaven.

201
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,830
If it does exist in reality,

202
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,960
where would it most likely be?

203
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,320
The feature of this mountain

204
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,870
resembles Mount Gangreboge's.

205
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,739
But I have never seen the other side

206
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,369
of Mount Gangrengebo,

207
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,670
so I can't be certain of that.

208
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,480
But if this is it,

209
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,870
the lake is very likely in the inland
of the snow mountains.

210
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,800
But no one has ever been there before.

211
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,659
How could someone

212
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,800
draw the view there?

213
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,480
Dong Can went there before.

214
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,240
I should be able to find the cause
of his death there.

215
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,110
Find me two porters.

216
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,070
Don't worry about the money.

217
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,800
You want to enter the snow mountains?

218
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,240
That's a no-man's land.
It's very dangerous.

219
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,259
Even the most experienced caravan

220
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,870
wouldn't dare go there.

221
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,720
Understood.

222
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,320
I will be back again.

223
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,200
I will await you, Sir.

224
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,870
Thank you so much, Sir.

225
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,150
Continue. I'm fine. Go.

226
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,830
Sir,

227
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,760
can we rest first?

228
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,520
Judging by the weather,

229
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,520
the wind will stop soon.

230
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,960
Sir,

231
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,960
those who hired us in the past

232
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,670
were all foreigners.

233
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,070
Their eyes

234
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,910
were green

235
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,960
or blue.

236
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,830
It's rare to meet

237
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,150
a patron like you.

238
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,520
Did they travel this route, too?

239
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,070
They traveled all the routes found here.

240
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,830
The route we are taking

241
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,960
isn't the most difficult one.

242
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,219
But ahead,

243
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,049
where no one is to be seen,

244
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,520
is the most terrifying.

245
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,320
Then why did you come?

246
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,430
We are in debt.

247
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,670
What kind of dangers will we encounter?

248
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,320
Dangers?

249
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,259
In the snow mountains,

250
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,280
nothing is considered dangerous or safe.

251
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,480
Let me put it this way.
Everything around you is your enemy.

252
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,040
The sun, the wind, snow,

253
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,670
and rocks.

254
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,760
Anything can just kill you effortlessly
if things go wrong.

255
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,939
It doesn't include

256
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,350
all the ghosts inside the snow.

257
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,110
The dead in the snow

258
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,150
are those who get lost

259
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,150
and stuck here.

260
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,070
Ghosts?

261
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,590
Do you see this as a taboo?

262
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,760
Anything that moves

263
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,240
is taboo.

264
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,390
Humans are more terrifying than ghosts.

265
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,800
You can never tell with humans.

266
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,590
The living

267
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,040
are worse than the dead.

268
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,870
You!

269
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,480
It's better to throw away

270
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,280
useless things early.

271
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,430
They are too heavy

272
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,960
to carry with you.

273
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,350
Sir,

274
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,480
we can't continue the journey anymore.

275
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,259
This snow mountains is freaky.

276
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,430
I usually only hunt up to here.

277
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,040
My grandfather said

278
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,630
that in the depths of the snow mountains,

279
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,960
there's something that ghosts even fear.

280
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,720
If you want us to guide you further,

281
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,040
pay us double.

282
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,560
Sure.

283
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,280
Guide me for a while longer.

284
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,800
Once I find the place I want,

285
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,910
you are free to go.

286
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,040
People rarely walk that path.

287
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,430
It's strange.

288
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,960
Why is it so popular this winter?

289
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,280
Wait.

290
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,430
Those are dead people.

291
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,670
Sir,

292
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,560
those are dead bodies.

293
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,560
Sir,

294
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,939
judging by their posture,

295
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,800
they likely came from the mountains.

296
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,240
While resting here,

297
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,240
the temperature suddenly changed,
and gusts came,

298
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,520
so they froze.

299
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,200
Come from the mountains?

300
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,560
Is anyone living here?

301
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,150
It's not what you think, Sir.

302
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,390
Foreigners often came here.

303
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,849
But they only wanted

304
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,590
to cross these mountains

305
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,560
to get through this no man's land.

306
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,800
They didn't mean to explore anything.

307
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,480
That's the no man's land.

308
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,960
Anyone who enters there

309
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,430
never comes out.

310
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,760
I have no idea
how they managed to get in here.

311
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,430
These foreigners had
many valuables on them.

312
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,870
Anyway, they are dead.

313
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,150
Why don't we take their money
to pay off our debt?

314
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,739
Do you want to join us

315
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,390
in crossing the mountains?

316
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,870
Sir, who are they? Do you know them?

317
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,590
The Denaxis.

318
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,720
Some of the faces look familiar.

319
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,520
Sir,

320
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,049
they are all so well-wrapped.

321
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,960
Are they worth more than gold?

322
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,390
This line,

323
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,720
what does it mean?

324
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,320
The Night King of the snow mountains.

325
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,320
Sir, look.

326
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,870
Why are there people traveling here?

327
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,800
If someone lives here,

328
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,800
it must be by the lakeside.

329
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,329
Follow them,

330
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,040
and I might find the place I need to go.

331
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,800
Sir,

332
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,280
what's he doing?

333
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,830
Sir,

334
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,040
that person is waving at us.

335
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,630
Are you not going over?

336
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,150
He's not waving at us.

337
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,520
What's he doing then?

338
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,350
There's something

339
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,720
following them,

340
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,630
and we didn't notice it at all.

341
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,110
How did you know?

342
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,430
Is it behind that rock?

343
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,200
Under the snow.

344
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,480
Under the snow?

345
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,910
It has been moving down there.

346
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,609
I believe that person

347
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,560
was waving at us.

348
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,670
We...

349
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,630
What was that?

350
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,800
What was that?

351
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,240
It should be

352
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,760
a type of fish the locals keep here.

353
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,430
You don't need to follow me

354
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,320
for the rest of the journey.

355
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,110
This is your payment.

356
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,830
