=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 22=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,150
Thanks.

5
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,760
Drink it slowly.

6
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,200
You're awake.

7
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,720
Well? Are you feeling okay?

8
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,630
Haike?

9
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,200
Haike?

10
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,110
It's warm.

11
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,440
Never old to begin with.

12
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, it's forever young.

13
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,350
We were seeing hallucinations.

14
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,670
Powder from the hexagonal bell.

15
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,440
I saw an urn

16
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,160
containing the hexagonal bell powder
in the frozen lake.

17
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,630
The urn was cracked.

18
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,790
There were vibrations as you walked by.

19
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,670
Haixing!

20
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,809
Haixing! What's wrong?

21
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,230
Powder of the hexagonal bell

22
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,320
seeped into the air
from the cracked ice.

23
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,830
It was blown in the wind
along with the drift ice.

24
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,769
But the hexagonal bell

25
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,440
was the work of the Zhang family.

26
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,019
What was it doing here?

27
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,000
It wasn't the normal hexagonal bell.

28
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,160
That's why we couldn't
overcome the hallucinations.

29
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,320
The contraption must have been
a defense mechanism

30
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,950
the Zhang family set up
for the Yinshaluo people

31
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,040
to fend off outsiders.

32
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,790
I knew it.

33
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,390
They have a deep connection
with the Zhang family.

34
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,760
Hallucinogenic powder of this volume

35
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,859
was only recorded

36
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,790
in the Zhang family's
most confidential tomes.

37
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,440
But you overcame it.

38
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,049
The Yinshaluo temple

39
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,390
must be up here.

40
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,040
We caused a huge commotion out here,

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,830
but not a sound came from the inside.

42
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,390
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,790
I'll scout ahead.

44
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,760
Find a ladder!

45
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,619
Everything is gone.

46
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,680
There's nothing left.

47
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,379
My brother was searching outside.

48
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,830
He found something.

49
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,150
Judging by their appearance
and equipment,

50
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,320
they look like Feng's team.

51
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,830
Feng is quite dishonest.

52
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,440
He came here in secret.

53
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,030
He only worked with us
because his expedition failed.

54
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,470
These people

55
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,150
must have gotten hit by the powder

56
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,529
after taking a shortcut

57
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,729
and eventually died here.

58
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,760
Pity.

59
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,390
They froze to death.

60
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,320
This is a Denaxi notebook.

61
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,200
A year ago.

62
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,800
It says here

63
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,499
they came to this snowy mountain

64
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,390
for a special expedition.

65
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,120
The equipment they carried

66
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,760
was the latest at the time.

67
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,289
The difficulty level

68
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,680
of their trip was high.

69
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,209
Does the notebook say

70
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,769
what the goal of this expedition was?

71
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,030
Nothing so far.

72
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,000
But it does say

73
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,440
that after entering the mountain...

74
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,950
Halfway on their journey,

75
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,939
they were attacked
by a ball-shaped creature.

76
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,270
Many died in the attack.

77
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,760
Ball-shaped creature?

78
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,819
Isn't that

79
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,030
the golden sphere Feng mentioned
in the video?

80
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,619
It was more like a slaughter

81
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,760
rather than an ambush.

82
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,899
Many died before they even realized

83
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,440
what was going on.

84
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,920
The creature moved
at an incredible speed.

85
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,169
It was much faster

86
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,440
than what our naked eyes could see.

87
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,760
Even if they could react,

88
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,680
it was already too late.

89
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,390
The survivors

90
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,499
tried to analyze the logic

91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,150
behind the creature's attack.

92
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,209
When it attacks,

93
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,880
keep your eyes on it.

94
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,089
As soon as you lose sight of it,

95
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,390
you will die from
its indiscriminate attack.

96
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,590
This is unrealistic.

97
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,830
Everyone has to blink at some point.

98
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,760
Maybe whoever wrote this

99
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,360
exaggerated its behaviour

100
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,320
because they were too traumatized.

101
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,440
Nothing from our files
mentioned this situation.

102
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,920
That might be possible.

103
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,920
In nature,

104
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,320
many predators that ambush their prey

105
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,070
with the same logic.

106
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,200
Whoever blinks is as good as dead.

107
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,920
This baffles me.

108
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,630
The golden sphere is the eye
of the Night King.

109
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,030
How many eyeballs did he have?

110
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,150
It's no use.

111
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,950
The writings are all covered
in bloodstain from here on.

112
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,899
There is no way to read them.

113
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,920
There are two things we are sure of.

114
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,729
Some from the party

115
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,379
were attacked by the golden sphere.

116
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,729
As for the others,

117
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,120
they made it here

118
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,459
and died from the cold
after their hallucinations.

119
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,240
The situation might be

120
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,169
a lot more complicated

121
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,680
than expected.

122
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,979
The golden sphere

123
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,070
might show up again at any time.

124
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,830
We need a way to deal with it.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,280
What is the plan?

126
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,350
We split up.

127
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,680
At least we wouldn't get wiped out
at the same time.

128
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,499
When one team needs aid,

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,379
the other team can still rescue them.

130
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,110
Based on the notebook,

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,019
the golden sphere is blazing fast.

132
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,499
The other team might not
make it in time.

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,259
Then, the surviving team
must keep looking

134
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,689
for the Night King.

135
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,929
With so many golden spheres,

136
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,920
there could be a handful of Night Kings.

137
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,289
What if there is a team of them?

138
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,769
Then, there's nothing more we can do.

139
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,200
We're doomed anyway.

140
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,800
You're coming with me.

141
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,400
I stand by my point.

142
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,649
You are the patriarch's friend.

143
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,859
I must keep you safe.

144
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,040
I am pretty safe now.

145
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
You said the same thing earlier.

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,739
But I ended up

147
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,350
saving you and your sister.

148
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,280
Wu Xie,

149
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,680
luck won't always favor you.

150
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,979
You know what?

151
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,280
We have nothing but luck right now.

152
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,870
We don't need your brother.

153
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,289
However,

154
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,560
we appreciate the thoughts.

155
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,280
Naive, just accept it.

156
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,640
As for me, I take care of the elderly,

157
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,400
but reluctantly.

158
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,750
That settles it.

159
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,049
No objections.

160
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,710
Good.

161
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,139
It looks like they came here

162
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,710
earlier than expected.

163
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,110
You know these people.

164
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,400
I know who they are.

165
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,470
They are from another department.

166
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,950
Come clean.

167
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,800
You are raising some suspicions.

168
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,750
You have one minute to explain.

169
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,739
It was a year ago.

170
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,350
Without this team,

171
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,689
our company wouldn't have

172
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,990
considered buying off the assets
from your old friend Qiu Dekao.

173
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,099
A different department was in charge

174
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,499
of the last expedition.

175
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,449
Our department head's idea

176
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,950
was to work with the locals.

177
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,350
But the other department was desperate.

178
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,950
They came to the mountain alone.

179
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,649
After 30 seconds,

180
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,320
we lost contact.

181
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,259
I have no idea how they communicated.

182
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,219
But our company suffered

183
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,649
great losses because of this incident.

184
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,449
Ten seconds left.

185
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,520
Insurance alone was
an astronomical amount.

186
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,560
So,

187
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,070
the decision to buy off
Qiu Dekao's assets.

188
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,379
That's all.

189
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,070
You were saving that story for now?

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,520
I didn't know what to tell you.

191
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,710
No one returned.

192
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,019
We didn't know

193
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,590
where they met their demise.

194
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,350
If what you said was true,

195
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,750
when they came a year ago,

196
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,920
the trap in the frozen lake

197
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,990
must have been there much longer.

198
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,280
So,

199
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,160
why wasn't it mentioned
in Qiling's files?

200
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,400
Two things don't add up.

201
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,870
One, these people died on the lake,

202
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,070
but no one ever came
to collect their corpses.

203
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,070
Secondly,

204
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,219
it seems no one has visited

205
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,160
the Yinshaluo temple in ages.

206
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,929
We must hurry

207
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,440
to the Yinshaluo's village.

208
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,400
Perhaps

209
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,689
something happened there,

210
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,230
which we never knew.

211
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,320
There is a change in plan

212
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,590
for our journey.

213
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,680
It's getting dark soon.

214
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,040
The route to the village is perilous.

215
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,200
I suggest

216
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,409
we head out after daybreak.

217
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,110
Very well.

218
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,990
Let's go.

219
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,640
Hans.

220
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,440
What's on your mind?

221
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,040
Fatty, something is bugging me.

222
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,470
Look.

223
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,219
I captured this

224
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,710
from the video

225
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,040
Feng showed us.

226
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,040
Now, we play it frame by frame.

227
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,440
When they first entered the cave,

228
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,739
the golden sphere wasn't there.

229
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,560
Right?

230
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,950
One more thing.

231
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,680
Look at this frame.

232
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,619
Qiling's scrolls mentioned

233
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,139
something that seemed to be the bodies

234
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,280
of dead golden spheres under the snow.

235
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,160
Are you saying...

236
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,139
they are actually one?

237
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,990
It's nothing but a speculation.

238
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,750
If these golden spheres

239
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,710
are related to the Night King,

240
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,219
maybe

241
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,200
they are the Night King's
sensory organs.

242
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,200
The main body

243
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,619
might still be buried under the snow.

244
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,379
The Night King released
the golden spheres

245
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,160
to hunt his prey.

246
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,640
So, they really are his eyes.

247
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,560
What do we do now?

248
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,280
You are the Night King extermination
expert appointed by Qiling.

249
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,640
I know you will figure out a plan.

250
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,280
You're letting me shoulder
this responsibility?

251
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,449
You can shoulder

252
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,739
even the greatest responsibility.

253
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,920
Come on.

254
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,990
Godspeed.

255
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,520
We're gonna spend the night here.

256
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,110
Hans, you'll deal with it.

257
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,800
Hey!

258
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,280
Naive!

259
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,929
How are you doing over there?

260
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,680
Nothing yet.

261
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,400
Where could the Night King be?

262
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,649
How do we get it?

263
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,040
Only one way to do it.
I've informed the team.

264
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,219
We'll see if the plan works

265
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,680
when we face the Night King.

266
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,230
You could at least tell me.

267
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,689
Will it even work?

268
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,499
You'd make a fool out of yourself.

269
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,619
I'll talk to you later.
We're entering the valley.

270
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,950
Hurry up.

271
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,710
Fine. I'm on my way.

272
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,230
(All those years ago,)

273
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,899
(Qiling ventured)

274
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,750
(into the mountain like we do now.)

275
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,049
No snow here.

276
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,870
There is volcanic activities here.

277
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,400
The temperature is higher.

278
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,040
If the Yinshaluo people are
in the mountains,

279
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,640
they should be just up ahead.

280
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,350
What's wrong?

281
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,350
The Yinshaluo are up there.

282
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,870
Let's go.

283
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,230
We'll take a break here.

284
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,950
What went wrong?

285
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,310
Watch out!

286
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,750
Avalanche.

287
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,440
Just recently,

288
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,750
a catastrophic avalanche

289
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,470
buried the whole valley under snow.

290
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,550
That would be one huge avalanche.

291
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,920
All the snow on the mountain

292
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,689
would have to slide down

293
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,819
into the valley.

294
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,009
Maybe the mountains

295
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,200
got warmer.

296
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,840
The geological structure
of the mountains

297
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,030
must have changed a lot.

298
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,840
Or it could've been

299
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,840
some vibrations underground

300
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,400
that caused the avalanche.

301
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,080
Does it mean

302
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,510
the village of the Yinshaluo

303
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,169
was wiped out by the avalanche?

304
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,120
No way.

305
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,859
They've lived here for centuries.

306
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,920
They know the terrain
like the palm of their hands.

307
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,360
A mere avalanche won't
wipe them all out.

308
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,729
Maybe something came up

309
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,750
after they sent out the distress signal.

310
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,950
Check the area.

311
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,689
Take out the detector.

312
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,310
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,230
Cover yourselves!

314
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,360
Is this the device

315
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,969
you said could be used

316
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,059
to take down the Night King?

317
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,030
Yes.

318
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,059
We ran tests

319
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,160
on the rotting corpse
of a golden sphere.

320
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,489
We discovered that it contained

321
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,880
a special metal element.

322
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,969
We modified

323
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,710
the traditional detector

324
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,200
so that it could also

325
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,950
detect the Night King's presence.

326
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,160
Does that sound mean

327
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,470
the golden sphere

328
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,310
has shown up,

329
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,059
that the Night King might be nearby?

330
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,840
Yes.

331
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,120
Fatty.

332
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,950
Stay on high alert.

333
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,539
The Night King might be near.

334
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,409
It might show up.

335
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,030
Hurry!

336
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,360
Hurry!

337
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,510
Hurry up!

338
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,440
Cover me!

339
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,360
Dig it.

340
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,600
It should be safe.

341
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,929
Fatty, crisis resolved.

342
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,230
False alarm.

343
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,680
What?

344
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,030
You had me worried!

345
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,510
What's the deal with Feng's
stupid equipment?

346
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,080
Cut the chatter.

347
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,510
We found the Yinshaluo village.

348
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,779
But it was buried under the snow.

349
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,950
An avalanche?

350
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,880
Seriously?

351
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,840
Was it the Night King's doing?

352
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,200
No idea.

353
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,440
But always stay alert.

354
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,840
Stay safe.

355
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,550
We must reach the other mountain.

356
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,840
Why is that?

357
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,249
There are

358
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,880
a lot of human bones.

359
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,510
Judging by the slope

360
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,440
and the terrain,

361
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,059
they are the same

362
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,400
as Qiling's scrolls.

363
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,510
But his scrolls

364
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,640
never mentioned the human bones.

365
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,200
Perhaps they were exposed
after the mountain thawed.

366
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,099
Could those be

367
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,080
dead Yinshaluo people?

368
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,160
Whatever the case is,

369
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,550
we must check the place out.

370
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,539
Stay safe.

371
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,920
Let's get moving.

372
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,099
Moving on!

373
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,080
Fatty.

374
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,579
We are ready to move out again.

375
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,099
Keep an eye on our location.

376
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,449
Follow closely and stay on your toes.

377
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,750
For what?

378
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,640
You were the boy

379
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,640
who cried the Night King.

380
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,310
Don't be scared.

381
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,360
I'll protect you. Let's go.

382
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,680
Boss, there is something in front of us.

383
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,080
Okay, let's keep moving.

384
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,880
What is this thing

385
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,470
doing in a place like this?

386
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,680
Clear out the snow.

387
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,400
Take some samples and photographs.

388
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,400
Yes, sir.

389
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,470
Fatty.

390
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,840
We found something.

391
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,440
We need to stop and examine it.

392
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,750
Stay where you are
and wait for my update.

393
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,920
We can't wait.

394
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,160
We're running low on supplies.

395
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,790
We need aid from the main team.

396
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,710
Did you finish all the food?

397
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,579
Don't be a heartless fool.

398
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,160
Your shady boss didn't give us
an equal share of the supplies.

399
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,579
They finished theirs.

400
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,440
Fine.

401
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,440
Come and regroup with us.

402
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,920
We'll regroup here.

403
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,899
Then, we split up again
after resupplying.

404
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,030
All right.

405
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,990
Over here...

406
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,409
I found them.

407
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,840
We finally found them.

408
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,779
Let's clean them all out.

409
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,120
See if there is any useful information.

410
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,440
Okay.

411
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,920
What is this?

412
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,099
If it's a desert-broomrape,

413
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,120
we'll make a fortune.

414
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,470
Who locked it here?

415
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,840
If it's supposed to be a landmark,

416
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,270
what is it doing here?

417
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,120
I don't know for sure.

418
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,440
But the nearest settlement

419
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,299
to our path here

420
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,470
was the Yinshaluo village.

421
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,009
This thing

422
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,600
might be connected to the people.

423
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,990
They are clearing the snow.

424
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,200
We'll see if we learn more about this.

425
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,990
An eagle is here.

426
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,120
Where are you doing?

427
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,990
Taking a leak.

428
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,200
What's that?

429
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,950
This is my daughter.

430
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,400
I miss her.

431
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,539
Let us finish the mission.

432
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,440
Then, you'll be back home to see her
before you know it.

433
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,680
What's wrong?

434
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,470
Nothing.

435
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,840
Maybe my eyes were dazzling.

436
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,120
Keep your pecker up, soldier.

437
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,209
Could you tell your boss

438
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,819
to get rid of Wu Xie?

439
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,080
I don't want to be led by those people.

440
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,160
Not in the mood to pee?

441
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,790
I don't like being watched.

442
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm not watching you.

443
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,680
If you're not taking a leak, I am.

444
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:20,859
What?

445
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,710
Stay still.

446
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,990
Don't blink.

447
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,840
(Yunding Heavenly Palace)

448
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,550
What's wrong?

449
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,579
At the Yunding Heavenly Palace,

450
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,990
we saw similar items.

451
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,120
Like a form of deity worship
by ancient tribes.

452
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,080
Do you know what it is?

453
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,920
It's not important.

454
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,550
Feng.

455
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,360
Did you find anything there?

456
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,230
Yes.

457
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,859
The writings in the scripture are

458
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,539
characters of
the ancient Yinshaluo tribe.

459
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,710
It's different from the local language.

460
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,819
We can only get a rough translation.

461
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,160
But, we also found records

462
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,779
about the Night King.

463
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,009
Have a look.

464
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,750
Okay.

465
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,990
I'll translate it for you.

466
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,200
As the season where
the morning dew dries up,

467
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,400
the slumbering Night King

468
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,880
will slowly awaken.

469
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,950
Living things will perish.

470
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,920
The land will be desolate.

471
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,750
The Night King will open
a thousand pairs of eyes

472
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,470
to behold the world.

473
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,510
Whoever the eyes gaze upon

474
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,030
must be sacrificed to the Night King.

475
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,880
Any living soul who enters this way

476
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,840
will never return alive.

477
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,440
Hence, a marker is built

478
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,360
to warn whoever comes here.

479
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,600
The Night King will come
into our world very soon.

480
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,880
Do you think this monument

481
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,030
is a warning sign?

482
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,299
There is a word

483
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,209
that's very challenging to translate.

484
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,030
The rough meaning would be

485
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,470
"absolute silence."

486
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,680
"When the time comes,

487
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,160
absolute silence."

488
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,990
The Night King's arrival

489
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,440
will turn the place into hell on earth.

490
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,230
Absolute silence...

491
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,710
Even the circling eagle

492
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,750
has left.

493
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,080
Something is wrong.

494
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,619
The animals' senses are much sharper

495
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,640
than ours.

496
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,929
There must be a reason

497
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,360
for how they reacted this way.

498
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,030
The Night King will arrive soon.

499
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,550
Fatty.

500
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,680
Where are you? Come back here now.

501
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,950
Stay alert.

502
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,840
Fatty, where are you now?

503
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,169
Do you copy? Fatty?

504
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,600
We got something!

505
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,640
Boss!

506
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,200
It's under this...

507
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,299
Everybody, let's run!

508
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,539
Fatty! The Night King is here!

509
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,710
Run for your lives!

510
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,750
This can't go on forever.

511
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,310
One of us has to go.

512
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,270
I am younger.

513
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm not married yet.

514
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,790
It has to be you.

515
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,200
Quickly!

516
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,299
The Night King is coming!

517
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,600
Troop formation! Get ready to retreat!

518
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,470
Drone up! Watch out!

519
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,840
Set up your silencers!

520
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,440
Over here!

521
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,230
Fire!

522
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,750
Fire!

523
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,160
It's back!

524
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,360
Wu Xie!

525
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,080
What do we do now?

526
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,920
What's the plan?

527
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,689
There is a cave!

528
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,539
We'll go there!

529
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,120
Everybody, run into the cave! Quickly!

530
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,680
Hans, move!

531
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,030
We are doomed!

532
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,680
We have to go, come on!

533
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,739
This thing has eyes!

534
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,710
Where are the Zhang smoke bombs?

535
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,920
The sphere slows down
when it can't see well.

536
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,310
The old Zhang geezer gave us a handy tool.

537
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,489
Go inside the cave.

538
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,120
Wait, where is my brother?

539
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,480
I know my way here.

540
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,710
I'll look for him and Fatty.
Go inside the cave.

541
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,969
Quickly!

542
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,390
Move!

543
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,710
Run!

544
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,270
Let's go!

545
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,870
Let's go! Quickly!

546
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,870
Hurry!

547
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,350
Hurry up!

548
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,270
Hurry! Into the cave!

549
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,080
Into the cave! Come on!

550
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,379
I want to have a piece of it.

551
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,859
Let's take it back home.

552
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,680
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,160
Don't touch! The spheres seek revenge.

554
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,200
Fatty!

555
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,000
Fatty!

556
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,310
Fatty!

557
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,200
Fatty!

558
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,830
Fatty!

559
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,910
Fatty!

560
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,710
Fatty!

561
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,040
Fatty!

562
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,520
Naive!

563
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,520
Naive!

564
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,819
Are you all right?

565
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,259
Fatty, come with me.

566
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,230
Let's go!

567
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,480
Boss.

568
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,409
We need to blow down the entrance.

569
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,489
We cannot hold it any longer.

570
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,659
No! Wu Xie is still outside!

571
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,160
We need to go rescue him.

572
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,449
Why don't you move?

573
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,160
I gave you an order!

574
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,129
You overestimated him.

575
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,520
You want us all to die just for him?

576
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,750
We won't get the Night King without him.

577
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,739
You overestimate his value.

578
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,040
I'm not going to send any more of my men
to be a meaningless sacrifice.

579
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,160
I'll go with you.

580
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,430
You are agile.

581
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,520
Stay and guard the entrance.

582
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,350
Move!

583
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,129
Come with me!

584
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,160
Feng?

585
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,790
The golden sphere
isn't the Night King's organ.

586
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,899
It's a bug.

587
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,779
A bug?

588
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,859
No way!

589
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,129
This place is too cold!

590
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,699
The cold would've
frozen the bug to death.

591
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,449
Is the golden sphere an organ,

592
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,859
or is the Night King a bunch of bugs?

593
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,409
The smoke is dissipating. Move!

594
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,259
Let's go!

595
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,969
Run!

596
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:08,830
Move!

597
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,960
Quick!

598
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,120
Haike!

599
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,750
Detonator.

600
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,480
Take cover.

601
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,390
Wait!

602
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,699
Someone is still out there! Wait!

603
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,859
We can't wait!

604
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,160
We are all going to die here!

605
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,960
No!

606
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,560
No!

607
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,200
