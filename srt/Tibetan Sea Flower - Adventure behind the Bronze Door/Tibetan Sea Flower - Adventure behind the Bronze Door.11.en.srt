00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 11=
(This story is purely fictional)

4
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,670
I'll ask you three questions.

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,120
If your answers are satisfactory,

6
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,510
I will accept
that you're on the patriarch's side.

7
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,289
If I'm not happy with your answers,
then I'm sorry.

8
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,840
I will take these secrets to my grave.

9
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,360
Here's the first question.

10
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,200
All these decades, I've been here

11
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,440
preserving the patriarch's memory

12
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,550
and all the secrets behind it.

13
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,480
They all say I'm stubborn.

14
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,440
But I still stay committed to it.

15
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,990
What's the purpose of me doing all this?

16
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,480
I think the purpose

17
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,040
isn't for others to judge.

18
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,689
Honestly,

19
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,230
I don't really know

20
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,769
what the purpose of my actions.

21
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,880
But if I didn't do them,

22
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,270
I would feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

23
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,270
My second question.

24
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,160
The patriarch hasn't returned
after so long.

25
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,200
Are these memories

26
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,720
that important to him?

27
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,510
Over the years,

28
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,670
he's kept experiencing Tianshou

29
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,510
and losing his memory.

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,270
He doesn't even know who he is.

31
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,270
In all the years I've known him,

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,110
he's been searching for his past self.

33
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,790
Over these years,

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,360
I wonder if what I'm doing now

35
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,459
matters to him at all.

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,760
Even if it does,
I won't believe it myself.

37
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,040
If it's not important,

38
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,489
then

39
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,579
why did he entrust

40
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,160
such an important task to me?

41
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,390
The third question.

42
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,040
So, what do you see

43
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,920
when you look at me now?

44
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,070
A version of myself decades later.

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,520
Now, I've given you the clue

46
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,160
about the key.

47
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,430
The address is behind it.

48
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,299
So, the key

49
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,670
is right here.

50
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,160
Patience.

51
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,520
Once you get in,

52
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,329
you'll naturally find the monster box

53
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,480
and the mud hut.

54
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,550
Monster box and mud hut?

55
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,600
You will know when you enter the place.

56
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,670
So did I answer

57
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,790
the three questions correctly?

58
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,040
You can't just make up

59
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,630
or deceive

60
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,080
about things like feelings.

61
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,990
Especially when it concerns the patriarch.

62
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,480
Young man,

63
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,550
play that song again. I like it.

64
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,280
Okay.

65
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,310
Is it really that simple?

66
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,550
The truth is,

67
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,230
my days are numbered.

68
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,550
I've reached my final chapter.

69
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,280
Naive,

70
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,190
does this count as a natural end?

71
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,870
At least, he knows

72
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,160
someone will keep waiting on his behalf.

73
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,190
When people die, they're gone,

74
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,110
just like a wisp of smoke.

75
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,360
If I die,

76
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,310
will I just be a wisp of smoke too?

77
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,160
That's something for after you're gone.

78
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,400
We don't even know where they go.

79
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,550
I only know

80
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,430
the end

81
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,430
of living people.

82
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,790
I don't want to know.

83
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,510
Wang Jinyuan's ashes
have been taken care of.

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,560
According to our tradition,

85
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,910
it'll be handed over
to the clan tomorrow.

86
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,200
He waited for so long.

87
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,110
He gave me this.

88
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,510
The key should be here.

89
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,449
I didn't expect

90
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,379
you to actually find out

91
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,390
where the key is hidden.

92
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,440
This is what we found on him

93
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,150
when we collected his remains.

94
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,440
I think it was drawn at the same time
with the sketch given to you.

95
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,809
I think he was afraid
someone might find the location.

96
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,729
So he kept

97
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,720
a lot of sketches with him.

98
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,179
Among these sketches,

99
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,609
only one of them is real,

100
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,539
which is the one he gave you.

101
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,510
The rest are fake.

102
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,379
After the patriarch defeated Night King

103
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,729
and left the snowy mountain,

104
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,089
he came here to recover

105
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,800
and met Wang Jinyuan.

106
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,209
When Wang Jinyuan was young,

107
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,390
he was a folklore scholar.

108
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,609
He has a deep understanding

109
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,560
of the local history and culture.

110
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,299
After meeting the patriarch,

111
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,379
he quickly realized

112
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,419
the patriarch had many secrets

113
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,870
and was an endless source
of material to explore.

114
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,680
Later, the patriarch sensed he was
about to face the Tianshou fate again.

115
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,880
So, he had to hide
the Heavenly Staff and the key

116
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,510
before it took place.

117
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,849
So,

118
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,600
Wang Jinyuan suggested hiding them

119
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,019
somewhere underground in Niles.

120
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,080
There's underground space beneath Niles?

121
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,729
Niles experiences

122
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,150
frequent earthquakes.

123
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,200
Many city buildings

124
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,809
keep sinking underground

125
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,390
because of geological issues,

126
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,200
which create lots of ruins and voids.

127
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,510
The place is filled with trash and rats.

128
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,139
The space is vast and complex.

129
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,390
The locals call it Old Niles.

130
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,960
Some people still reside
in areas closer to the surface.

131
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,440
As far as I know,

132
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,419
even the patriarch never reached

133
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,150
the deepest part of Old Niles.

134
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,659
Who lives in those houses

135
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,360
on the mountain?

136
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,270
The old monsters.

137
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,910
Old monsters?

138
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,609
The oldest

139
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,929
and purest-blooded members

140
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,659
of the Zhang family in Dejia

141
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,200
are living in seclusion there.

142
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,230
Then why can't they help fight
the Night King?

143
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,320
Oh, I forgot.

144
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,480
The responsibilities of the Zhang family
no longer concern them.

145
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,910
Can I visit them?

146
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,510
Maybe I could gather more information.

147
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,019
Besides, I've said this before.

148
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,019
I came here for Qiling's memory.

149
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,990
I don't want to miss any chance.

150
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,720
That forbidden land has its own laws.

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,110
You can only go to the back of the mountain
after being acknowledged by them.

152
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,059
If you go without it,

153
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,440
you'll be killed instantly.

154
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,510
They don't like to be disturbed.

155
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,200
Even someone sent by the patriarch?

156
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,360
They're the ones

157
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,080
who drove the patriarch to this state.

158
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,960
We can only depend on ourselves.

159
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,080
Don't you want to know
about the patriarch's past?

160
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,030
I know a place

161
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,480
he once went to.

162
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,610
(Centenary Tavern)

163
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,870
What do you like to drink?

164
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,209
Same as usual.

165
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,390
Okay. And you?

166
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,750
Same as him.

167
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,019
Same as him.

168
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,030
Okay.

169
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,270
Bring him a glass of Ayla.

170
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,750
Okay. Hold on.

171
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,899
The man with the hat

172
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,600
who is sitting at the bar

173
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,089
came in right after us.

174
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,360
Something's off about him.

175
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,030
He's one of Feng's men.

176
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,800
So, do we have to stay here?

177
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,630
Didn't you ask me

178
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,230
what to do about the last key?

179
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,230
What should we do?

180
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,320
Keep guessing.

181
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,270
Please.

182
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,750
Ayla will take some time.

183
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,270
Okay.

184
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,899
Ayla is a special drink here.

185
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,680
It's the patriarch's favorite.

186
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,539
Then why don't you get me some?

187
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,779
I'd like to try it.

188
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,840
I noticed you seem to enjoy testing
how well I know your patriarch.

189
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,200
Do I?

190
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,910
If you still have any grudges,

191
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,910
why did you come to us?

192
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,609
I just want to know

193
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,910
why you were chosen.

194
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,720
Postcards, please?

195
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,360
Okay.

196
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,320
Here you go.

197
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,110
Okay.

198
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,360
Send one to my friend.

199
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,609
You might as well write your last words

200
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,230
while you're at it.

201
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,150
There's not enough space for that.

202
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,480
Are you really going to write?

203
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm not like Qiling

204
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,270
who makes the people around him worry.

205
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,659
Okay.

206
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,360
Go ahead and write.

207
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,600
The sister will get the cloud postcard.

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,209
The brother will get the mountain.

209
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,320
Write what you want.

210
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,750
I'm writing

211
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,990
to Naive's third aunt.

212
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,270
I hope this postcard finds you well.

213
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm off to fight the Night King with Naive.

214
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,059
You know, in this life,

215
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,110
you'll have to pay
for your actions eventually.

216
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,480
Why aren't you writing?

217
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,080
We have no one
to send these postcards to.

218
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,030
The Zhang family sure is hardcore.

219
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,030
I thought you were living
with the whole generation.

220
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,390
It turns out you have no such concerns.

221
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,990
That's cool.

222
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,200
Did you discover something?

223
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,440
It's the mark left by Qiling.

224
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,360
It looks like he was here.

225
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,440
What does it mean?

226
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,510
It has no special meaning.

227
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,080
Only to prove he was here.

228
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,720
Like "I was here"?

229
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,200
He often suffers from memory loss.

230
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,910
So he's used to leaving a mark

231
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,720
to prove he's been here before.

232
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,840
(Feng is in Dejia.)

233
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,910
Aren't Zhang Longban
and the rest coming along?

234
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,150
Considering the danger, more people joining
might not be a good thing.

235
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,150
If it weren't necessary,
he shouldn't have joined this mission.

236
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,190
Things can't be done without me.

237
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,760
This is the place.

238
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,150
Number 112, Ramil Street.

239
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,080
This is the place.

240
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,470
11083?

241
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,040
What does this mean?

242
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,539
So

243
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,190
this is the entrance to Old Niles?

244
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,409
I told you

245
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,240
that Old Niles has sunk underground.

246
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,409
Many sewers

247
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,110
have collapsed over the years,

248
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,240
which connects

249
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,470
to the old city area.

250
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,760
Your approach is starting
to resemble Qiling's more and more.

251
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
There are a lot of tunnels down here.

252
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
Stay close and don't get lost.

253
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,670
Let's go.

254
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,080
Why are there so many statues here?

255
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,630
It also looks like people
have come here to pay their respects.

256
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,760
Hey, tour guide.

257
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,800
Excuse me?

258
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,840
Tell us about it.

259
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,630
Where are your manners, kid?

260
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,470
The locals believe

261
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,889
that souls can't leave

262
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,600
if they die here.

263
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,280
So they use these statues
to honor the dead.

264
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,280
Each statue represents a life lost.

265
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,259
The families of the deceased

266
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,040
would come here
to pay their respects every year.

267
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,360
It looks like

268
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,040
a lot of people have died here.

269
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,110
How did so many people end up dead here?

270
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,280
The sewers of Niles connect

271
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,430
with the ruins of Old Niles.

272
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,800
Many people scavenge for trash
in the sewers.

273
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,710
But this place is too dangerous
and complex.

274
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,800
Odd rumors keep spreading.

275
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,059
If you can't get out,

276
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,710
you can only die here.

277
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,849
Hiding the key here

278
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,430
is indeed very secure.

279
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,430
The patriarch is truly a genius.

280
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,360
Be careful.

281
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,600
We're about to become the Ninja Turtles.

282
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,240
Which character do you want to be?

283
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,649
Michael Angelo?

284
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,939
Leonardo da Vinci?

285
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,240
What's the other one?

286
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,760
Benbo'erba?

287
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,699
So, are you saying

288
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,129
Qiling wants us to turn into turtles

289
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,779
and swim over to find him?

290
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,059
You've got some nerve

291
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,459
to mock him while he's not around.

292
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,520
Wait until he comes back,
I'll tell him everything.

293
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,539
The Ninja Turtles
can always change shapes.

294
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,760
Fatty,

295
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,760
things might get
more dangerous up ahead.

296
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,609
Don't touch

297
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,110
anything unnecessarily.

298
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,299
You heard him, right?
Don't touch things unnecessarily.

299
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,369
I meant you.
You're always curious about everything.

300
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,219
- Just don't touch anything unnecessarily.
- Okay.

301
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,499
I'll touch only what's necessary.

302
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,219
Only I can decide what's necessary.

303
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,889
I've got two three-bamboo tiles.
If I see another one, how can I leave it?

304
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:16,120
Then I'll give you another three-bamboo tile.

305
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,369
Are you going to challenge me again?

306
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,979
Are you done bickering?

307
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,240
Can you keep quiet?

308
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,240
What are you looking at?

309
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,320
A strange object.

310
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,760
In my experience,

311
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,040
if you come across something like this,

312
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,219
just ignore it

313
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,470
and keep moving.

314
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,950
My constitution is a bit unusual.

315
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,800
Have you heard about it?

316
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,950
Yes, it's legendary.

317
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,699
I'll do what you say.

318
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,129
Don't be curious about that.

319
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,809
Let's keep moving.

320
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,390
That thing looks ominous.

321
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,080
Finally,

322
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,800
I can straighten up my back.

323
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,710
Which way should we go?

324
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,150
Fatty.

325
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,630
Fatty.

326
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,110
It's the mark left by Qiling.

327
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,950
It should be this way.

328
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,329
Let's go.

329
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,430
Okay.

330
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,560
It's Qiling's mark.

331
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,040
Didn't expect you to need a hand.
Your skills are pretty average.

332
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,950
Let's go.

333
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,280
This way.

334
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,910
We've been walking for ages.

335
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,710
Why aren't we there yet?

336
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,840
The statues are lesser here.

337
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,430
That means fewer locals come here.

338
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,110
Probably because it's getting
more dangerous ahead.

339
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,240
That's why they don't dare
to come here.

340
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,520
It could be the wind.

341
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,710
What wind?

342
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,190
I can't feel any wind.

343
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,870
Naive.

344
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,129
It's the mark left by Qiling.

345
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,320
I've never seen this before.

346
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,390
It's a mark showing danger.

347
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,520
From here on,

348
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,600
we need to be extra careful.

349
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,320
Shouldn't we stay here for a bit

350
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,080
to show some respect to Qiling?

351
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,470
Don't worry.

352
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,040
We'll keep you safe

353
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,710
so long you don't pull any tricks.

354
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,280
I don't have to come, you know.

355
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,459
These marks were all left by Qiling.

356
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,809
You Zhang family members
can just follow the marks.

357
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,110
You don't need me at all.

358
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,889
Maybe the patriarch
had a deeper meaning behind this?

359
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,040
Or maybe you don't know
your patriarch that well.

360
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,889
We don't need
to understand the patriarch.

361
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,240
We only need to trust him.

362
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,360
Your sister doesn't seem
to agree with you.

363
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,840
She's going through a teenage phase.

364
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,710
What?

365
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,870
Her teenage phase lasts until now?

366
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,080
Must be nice to be young.

367
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,240
Haike.

368
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,320
What is this place?

369
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,870
Why are there so many danger signs left
by your Zhang family?

370
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,630
This should be

371
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,670
the place where the Zhang family
of Dejia used

372
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,129
to do their wilding back in the day.

373
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,600
Aren't your wilding supposed
to be doing good deeds?

374
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,870
There can't be a bunch of old ladies
waiting to cross the road here, right?

375
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,939
I heard the wilding
for the Zhang family here

376
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,320
is different.

377
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,760
They were trying to reach
the deepest part of the old city

378
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,710
to retrieve some kind of token.

379
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,299
No one knows
what this so-called token is.

380
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,979
Even now,

381
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,520
the guys at the back of the mountain
can only accept the ones

382
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,329
who manage to bring out the token

383
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,870
as the true Zhang family.

384
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,200
They're the ones who are qualified
to enter the back mountain.

385
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,150
That's why Qiling hid

386
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,320
the key nearby.

387
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,520
Maybe those people on the back mountain

388
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,840
aren't as cold-hearted as you think.

389
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,329
No,

390
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,600
they're not reliable.

391
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,849
You've already met
the Zhang family members

392
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,360
who are willing to fight Night King.

393
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,849
There's a mark here.

394
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,520
It's different
from the ones we saw just now.

395
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,040
I think I've seen this statue

396
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,320
from somewhere before.

397
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,670
It looks like something
from Wang Jinyuan's clues.

398
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,000
We found it.

399
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,110
It's here?

400
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,649
Judging by the style,

401
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,430
it seems like something
from the Kumuli period.

402
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,129
The Kumuli period was

403
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,110
when the first earthquake happened.

404
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,889
The structure is unstable

405
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,000
and could collapse again at any moment.

406
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,499
The key is inside.

407
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,950
Are you bold enough to enter?

408
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,560
This mark indicates

409
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,000
we should go straight ahead.

410
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,950
But now, there are
too many fallen rocks inside.

411
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
We'll have to figure out
how to move them.

412
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,800
The structure here is unstable.

413
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,600
So be very careful.

414
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,110
If it collapses,

415
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,760
we won't find anything.

416
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,649
Naive,

417
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,609
don't get in their way.

418
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,110
Back off a little.

419
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,630
Step back.

420
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,710
After you, old man.

421
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,939
Leave some footprints.

422
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,299
So Feng can follow.

423
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,219
All the best.

424
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,600
You're always making a fuss.

425
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,000
Wait.

426
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,430
What happened?

427
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,520
Untie it for me.

428
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,470
Where are you going, Dr. Zhang?

429
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,430
Get Dr. Donny to cover for me.

430
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,849
Go to get Dr. Donny
to take over the surgery.

431
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,910
Got it.

432
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,240
Scorpion?

433
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,539
(Zhang Nian)
(From now on, we're the Scorpion Team)

434
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,739
(that shares the ups and downs.)

435
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,950
(- Great.
- Okay.)

436
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,729
Jiuri,

437
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,569
(Zhang Jiuri)

438
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,800
It's been a long time.

439
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,760
I don't want to talk about the past.

440
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,910
Get lost.

441
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,800
Aren't you interested

442
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,680
in Zhang Qiling?

443
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,979
Can you forget

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,430
who caused your parents' deaths?

445
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,680
Zhang Qiling's friends are here.

446
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,590
Do you still remember this object?

447
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,680
I found these darts earlier.

448
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,939
It was meant

449
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,720
to be a trophy
from our wilding training.

450
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,390
(The patriarch will definitely return.)

451
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,470
It used to be our token in the past.

452
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,510
But Zhang Qiling ruined

453
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,760
everything.

454
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,720
Even if we change our appearances,

455
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,760
do you really think

456
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,320
you can start a new life?

457
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,990
I keep this scorpion with me
all the time.

458
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,680
Every time I see it,

459
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,419
it feels like I'm back

460
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,950
to that moment.

461
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,160
I will get my revenge on Zhang Qiling.

462
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,430
I know you don't want to talk
about the past.

463
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,760
But what about now?

464
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,129
At this point, you can't even get close

465
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,320
to finding Zhang Qiling.

466
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,870
The guy named, Wu Xie, came here

467
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,990
to take the Heavenly Staff left by Zhang Qiling
to head to the snowy mountain.

468
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,640
You know what's

469
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,680
in the snowy mountain.

470
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,120
With that staff,

471
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,990
killing Zhang Qiling

472
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,160
would be possible.

473
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,720
This is the closest

474
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,360
I've ever been to revenge.

475
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,910
Success

476
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,070
or failure

477
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,510
depends on this one action.

478
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,430
You've really changed

479
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,689
a lot compared to before.

480
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,430
Whether I kill Zhang Qiling or not
is my business.

481
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,030
It's got nothing to do with you.

482
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,550
Crazy.

483
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,870
It really stinks here.

484
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,430
It's a rotten smell.

485
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,320
Be careful.

486
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,510
Watch your step.

487
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,840
If the ground beneath you is unstable,
don't move.

488
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,390
I'll take care of it.

489
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,590
Be careful.

490
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,390
What did you see?

491
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,240
Everyone, be careful.

492
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,510
What are these things?

493
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,430
These are special puppets
from the South Asia.

494
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,590
They were used
in traditional magic performances.

495
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,120
Magic trick props?

496
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,360
Was there a magic show going on

497
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,720
when the collapse happened here?

498
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,470
It's possible.

499
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,320
From the look of them,

500
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,289
they were probably performing

501
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,200
some legendary hero story.

502
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,320
It's said

503
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,289
that the king of Kumuli

504
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,360
was very fond of traditional magic.

505
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,419
To please the king,

506
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,870
people from the village imitated it.

507
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,390
Let's make a move.

508
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,430
Why is there a maze here?

509
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,390
The performances were done
in spaces like this.

510
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,280
A complex environment

511
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,070
can create many magical visual effects,

512
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,769
making people think

513
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,320
the performers really
had magical powers.

514
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,160
So many paths.
Which one should we take?

515
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,760
There are no marks left
by Qiling here either.

516
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,339
You have chemistry
with the patriarch, right?

517
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,510
You choose.

518
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,390
This one.

519
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,030
What kind of performance

520
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,240
were these puppets used for?

521
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,240
Wu Xie.

522
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,200
These puppets are props
for magic performances.

523
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,030
They probably used these puppets

524
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,280
to create everyday life scenes

525
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,510
in their performances.

526
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,169
Nothing special behind it.

527
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,360
Look.

528
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,910
There are more over there.

529
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,320
Why is there another one?

530
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,510
Wait.

531
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,360
Don't tell me
it's the same one from earlier.

532
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,280
But that's impossible.

533
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,360
