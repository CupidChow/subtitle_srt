=Adventure behind the Bronze Door=

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,900
(Adapted from the original novel
"Zang Hai Hua" by Nan Pai San Shu)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,180
(This story is purely fictional)
=Episode 13=

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Hans.

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,730
Boss,

6
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,250
there are footprints.

7
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,010
Five, check in.

8
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,570
All clear.

10
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,960
Move forward.

11
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,080
The old town is up ahead.

12
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,760
Boss,

13
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,240
looks like Wu Xie
and the others got in already.

14
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,520
OK. Let's just keep following their tracks.

15
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,290
Moving in.

16
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,570
There's nothing here.

17
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,050
Qiling's mark.

18
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,850
This mark

19
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,330
means extreme danger.

20
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,050
Why are you so nervous?

21
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,450
What's down there?

22
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,850
I've never been here before.

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,450
This mark indicates

24
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,080
it's ten times more dangerous.

25
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,640
We need to be extra careful.

26
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,300
Ten times more dangerous?

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
You can go first.

28
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,050
It looks safe.

29
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,970
We can finally relax after that scare.

30
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
It looks like

31
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,440
Qiling

32
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
was trying to copy my humor

33
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
in dangerous situations.

34
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,090
But he didn't quite grasp it.

35
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
That was close.

36
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,970
It looks like I've discovered

37
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,920
a hole.

38
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,240
Let's see how deep it is.

39
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,800
It's about twenty meters.

40
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
Why does it have

41
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,050
a high ceiling down here?

42
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,830
This place experiences
frequent earthquakes,

43
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,090
causing some areas to sink.

44
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,210
Boss.

45
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,090
Light sticks.

46
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
Looks like they got lost.

47
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,730
Hans,

48
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,320
look at this.

49
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,880
They use this fishing line trying
to find a way out of the maze.

50
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,090
They're probably
still trapped here somewhere.

51
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,560
Let's split up and search
for them separately.

52
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
Have them report

53
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
their position every five minutes.

54
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,240
Let's clear it up four by four.

55
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,090
Each group will pick a passage.

56
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,570
- Report every five minutes.
- Roger.

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go this way.

58
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,000
Four of you with  us.

59
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
You owe me a hotpot.

60
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
This mural seems

61
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,610
to depict a war.

62
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,410
But it's a little strange.

63
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,410
Many of these Kumuli soldiers

64
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,210
died tragically in battle.

65
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,530
The survivors

66
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,770
were releasing arrows in the direction
where the soldiers were advancing.

67
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,240
What's that up there?

68
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Who were they fighting?

69
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,210
The mural is probably incomplete.

70
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,410
It shouldn't be.

71
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
The creation of ancient murals

72
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,630
follows the aging process,
outlining, and refining the details.

73
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,090
In modern terms, it means the first step
is sketching the draft,

74
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,170
the second is outlining,
and the third is coloring.

75
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,320
Now, the whole mural
has such detailed coloring.

76
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,080
This mural can't be incomplete.

77
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,560
Could their enemies be invisible?

78
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,560
The more invisible the enemies are,
the scarier they are.

79
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Night Lady?

80
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,530
Zhang Haike, you mentioned before

81
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,960
that the Night King

82
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,530
is an invisible creature in legends.

83
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,080
Could it be

84
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,050
that their enemy is Night King?

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,290
You mean the Kumuli might be connected
to the Night King?

86
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,200
Since the clues

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
from that punk led us here,

88
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,290
it must be related
to fighting the Night King.

89
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,290
The Kumuli dynasty was very short-lived.

90
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,320
But there's no record or evidence

91
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,560
of the Night King

92
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,720
in their remaining documents or ruins.

93
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,010
Aren't we seeing it now?

94
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Enough talking.

95
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,960
We've reached the entrance.

96
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,250
Let's go in and check it out.

97
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,130
Three male guests have arrived.

98
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,370
Once we're inside,
don't touch or move anything.

99
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,530
Since the patriarch left
the dangerous marker,

100
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,680
we must stay extremely alert.

101
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,960
What's that smell?

102
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,290
Do you guys smell

103
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,600
something strange?

104
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,890
It's a rotting smell

105
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,250
mixed with old herbal medicine.

106
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,130
Is it coming from inside?

107
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,170
Let's take a look inside.

108
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,840
There's nothing here.

109
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
The weird smell is getting stronger.

110
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,410
It seems to be coming from above.

111
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,410
Why is the ceiling here

112
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,440
so much lower than the hallway outside?

113
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,440
This place feels a little creepy.

114
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,600
I can't even see the end of it.

115
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,250
Naive,

116
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,720
give it some light.

117
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Let's see how big this place is.

118
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,410
Fatty, get over here.

119
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,050
It's black and huge.

120
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,050
What is this?

121
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,560
Is it floating in mid-air?

122
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,320
Fatty,

123
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,250
it's a house.

124
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
It's a house suspending mid-air.

125
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,130
So, it's not the ceiling after all.

126
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,490
This King of Kumuli

127
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,490
was a bit mad, huh?

128
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,770
Why would he build a house

129
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,200
and then hang it up?

130
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,600
I have no idea.

131
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,530
But whatever is inside
must be something really special.

132
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,320
Something really big?

133
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,490
Like a plane?

134
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,660
Or maybe a dinosaur?

135
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,890
No, none of those.

136
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,960
You're the smart one, Naive.

137
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,320
Come on, help us figure this out.

138
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Look over here.

139
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,410
Isn't that me?

140
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,200
So, Night King is plump too.

141
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,890
The walls are all about Night King.

142
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,890
This must be the Night King's house.

143
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,720
(The Night King's house?)

144
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,720
(A monster box?)

145
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,170
I get it now.

146
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
The monster box
that Wang Jinyuan mentioned

147
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,770
is probably this thing.

148
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,290
When he first saw

149
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,200
this thing,

150
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
it was covered with Night Kings.

151
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,560
But he didn't know

152
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,370
the term for Night King.

153
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,490
So he just called it

154
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,770
a monster box.

155
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,050
Well, our idea of a box

156
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,680
is very different.

157
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,560
I bet that punk hid the key

158
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,530
inside this house.

159
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,010
Whatever is inside

160
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
is definitely connected to Night King.

161
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,440
What could that be?

162
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,530
The most likely explanation

163
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,080
is that the Night King itself.

164
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,050
In all the scrolls and murals

165
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,080
I've seen,

166
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,530
Night King may be invisible,

167
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
but it always occupies
a large empty space.

168
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,200
It seems like it's enormous.

169
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,320
Maybe the Night King

170
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,050
is inside this house.

171
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,250
The Night King?

172
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
He must be huge, then.

173
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,370
What is this Night King, anyway?

174
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,050
Why would the Kumuli people
build a big house for it?

175
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,200
Is it really inside?

176
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,440
What's the purpose of the house?

177
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,490
The big question is,
if Night King is in there,

178
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,130
is it still alive?

179
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm just guessing.

180
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,050
If we want to know what's inside,
we'll have to go in and take a look.

181
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,320
The key's inside.

182
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,010
Of course, we're going in.

183
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,130
But there might be traps set up

184
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,440
to protect it.

185
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,530
Here comes the tool master.

186
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,800
Fatty, are you planning
to pick the Night King's teeth

187
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,450
with that crowbar?

188
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,590
We need to do something,
even if it's pointless.

189
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,290
As long as it's noticeable.

190
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,970
Since it's a house,

191
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,560
there should be a door.

192
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,400
Let's look around

193
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,930
and see if we can get in.

194
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,080
We kept walking straight ahead.

195
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,880
How come we circle back?

196
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,640
Apparently, they also circled back.

197
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,360
The fishing line ends here.

198
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,400
Where are the puppets?

199
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,400
Hans, something must be wrong.

200
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
Tell them to draw back.

201
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,490
All units, pull back.

202
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,210
Unit A, do you copy?

203
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,050
Unit B, do you copy?

204
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,970
We shouldn't wait any longer.

205
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,050
Let's blow this place up.

206
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,770
Fire!

207
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,250
There's something there!

208
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,010
Their number is increasing!

209
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,450
Fire!

210
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,120
Don't let them come any closer!

211
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,360
Hans!

212
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,800
Move back! Move back!

213
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,770
Fire!

214
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,050
Direction at six o'clock!

215
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,400
Take them down!

216
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,640
It's coming.

217
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
I got one!

218
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,360
There are snakes hidden in these puppets

219
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,600
that can control them
to attack and kill.

220
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,400
It's best not to touch them.

221
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,290
How did you end up here?

222
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
We can catch up later.

223
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,210
If you want to live,

224
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,930
follow me.

225
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,640
Hans.

226
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,930
This way! Quick!

227
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,290
Go! Go! Go!

228
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,010
Back up!

229
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,640
How did you find this place?

230
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,690
You don't need to worry about that.

231
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,560
Mr. Feng.

232
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,290
When I helped you get the first key,

233
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,290
we already made a deal.

234
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,080
Once you arrived in Dejia,

235
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
we would work together

236
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,010
to deal with Wu Xie

237
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,400
and the Zhang family.

238
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,210
However,

239
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,640
I haven't heard from you
for a long time.

240
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,880
I wonder if you think

241
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,080
you could grab all the keys yourself

242
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,320
without needing my help.

243
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,400
Thank you for finding that key for me.

244
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,970
But you weren't very honest
during our last cooperation.

245
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,210
I'm afraid

246
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,930
it'll be hard for us to work together
without problems.

247
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
You know what?

248
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,640
You need me now.

249
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,840
Without me,

250
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,530
do you think
you can get out of this place?

251
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,050
Do you know

252
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,450
Zhang Haike deliberately gave away
his location?

253
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,400
It was to lure you in

254
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,560
and steal your key.

255
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,250
As you move forward,

256
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,120
there will be many more traps
along the way.

257
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,450
This whole situation

258
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,640
is a setup to trap you.

259
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,930
But don't worry.

260
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,080
I've already sent people to handle it.

261
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,800
The enemy of an enemy

262
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,160
is a friend.

263
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,730
We have a common enemy now.

264
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,290
If we don't work together,

265
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,800
we'll be at the losing end.

266
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,010
Then Wu Xie and the Zhang family
would reap the benefit.

267
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,080
Don't you agree?

268
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,490
Mr. Feng.

269
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,470
I look forward to a smooth cooperation.

270
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,800
Let's go.

271
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
So far,

272
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,770
we haven't even found
the door to the house.

273
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,640
This house

274
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,530
is completely sealed.

275
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,290
Who would build a house without a door?

276
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,010
How are we supposed to get in?

277
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,320
I've looked around.

278
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
This house is built
in a very unique way.

279
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,800
It uses traditional joinery techniques.

280
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
While ancient buildings used joinery,

281
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,010
I've never seen
a house completely sealed like this.

282
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,450
It's more like

283
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,360
a sealed giant box

284
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,120
that was built in the shape of a house.

285
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,210
What on earth is this place?

286
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,970
Is Night King really inside?

287
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,450
I heard about a special sealing technique
used by the Zhang family.

288
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,250
No matter how big the building is,

289
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160
once it's sealed with joinery,

290
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,690
there's no way to open it.

291
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
The Zhang family

292
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,930
only uses this method

293
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,320
for extremely terrifying things.

294
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,600
It's to keep whatever is inside

295
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
from changing or escaping.

296
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,080
You're from the Zhang family.

297
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,530
Do you know how to open it?

298
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,690
I've already said
there's no chance of opening it.

299
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,290
Your skills seem

300
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,840
to fail at critical moments.

301
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,370
Why are you walking away
when you can't answer me?

302
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,560
Zhang Jiuri!

303
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,800
Do you have a death wish?

304
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,930
What's your problem? What triggered you?

305
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,560
Long time no see.

306
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,450
Your skills have improved.

307
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,530
Zhang Jiuri,

308
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,880
why are you here?

309
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,050
Who were you expecting?

310
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,530
Did you stay here

311
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,120
to ambush Zhang Nian?

312
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
He even teamed up with a foreigner.

313
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,250
It looks like they're all targeting you.

314
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,560
Zhang Nian is here too?

315
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,690
So,

316
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,120
are you surprised?

317
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,320
- Zhang Nian?
- Zhang Nian?

318
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,250
You're so emotional.

319
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,050
My speed is only second to Zhang Qiling.

320
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,880
How could you get distracted?

321
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,290
What did you find?

322
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,730
There's a scuff mark here.

323
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,360
Run!

324
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,800
After all my years in the field,

325
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,600
this is really embarrassing.

326
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,490
This is the first time

327
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,360
I've seen
a fully automatic convertible house.

328
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,730
How did you discover it?

329
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,080
I just guessed.

330
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,770
Earlier, I noticed the scuff marks
on the ground.

331
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,730
So I guessed

332
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,840
someone must have entered
this house before.

333
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,160
But to open such a large house,

334
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,930
there must be
a unique internal mechanism.

335
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,400
The mechanism and its components

336
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,800
have a certain weight.

337
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,210
So it causes the house suspended
in mid-air

338
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,730
to tilt slightly.

339
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,320
So I used a steel ball

340
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,640
to locate the heaviest part
of the house.

341
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,210
Then I searched around

342
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,450
and found the mechanism

343
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,800
by accident.

344
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,160
Get that? That's my way of doing things.

345
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,730
Naive has never

346
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,600
let anyone down before.

347
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,530
He was lucky.

348
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,930
Exactly, it's infuriating enough.

349
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,880
Let's go.

350
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,930
