8
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,093
Show your face.

9
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:04,812
That is an order.

10
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,173
It is my pleasure...

11
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,973
to greet my king.

12
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:01,932
Kim Si Yeol.

13
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:05,012
You are...

14
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,452
the watchman?

15
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:15,533
You were so close and yet...

16
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,892
I did not recognize you.

17
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:23,452
We must get out of here.

18
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:34,413
(Episode 11)

19
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,612
Then Snowflake is among us?

20
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,092
It was not just a rumor?

21
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,292
It is the truth.

22
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,373
Listen, everyone.

23
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,533
Snowflake is among us.

24
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,052
Snowflake is here?

25
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,933
If you are Snowflake,

26
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:26,732
why did you hide your identity?

27
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,452
People were killed.

28
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,852
Why did you not appear sooner?

29
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:45,732
It has been eight years.

30
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,413
I have been curious...

31
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:50,892
ever since...

32
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,533
I first met you.

33
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,012
Have you followed me since then?

34
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,572
Yes.

35
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,093
I have lived my life...

36
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,653
shadowing yours.

37
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:15,093
- Over there. Go after him! - Yes, sir.

38
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,863
I caged you in.

39
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,743
You could never have strayed far from me.

40
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,183
That is the fate of a watchman.

41
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,933
Do not concern yourself.

42
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:08,412
I heard a watchman is freed when his master becomes king.

43
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,412
That will happen soon.

44
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,012
For that to happen,

45
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:17,532
you must stay alive and safe.

46
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:18,933
I know that.

47
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:21,933
If I fall,

48
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:24,813
so will you.

49
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:33,853
I am not here...

50
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:36,813
as the deposed heir.

51
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,252
What is he saying?

52
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,052
Why is he here, then?

53
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,253
- What does he want? - What will he do?

54
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:45,253
Just because I have royal blood,

55
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,613
I will not rule over you.

56
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,892
It is not one's birth...

57
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,693
but one's will that changes the world.

58
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:00,652
So that your resolve to end the King's tyranny...

59
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:02,373
will not break,

60
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:06,933
I will lead the way and take the brunt of the attacks.

61
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,212
That is...

62
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:11,652
the reason...

63
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,212
I stand here today.

64
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:12,532
The watchman. He did this.

65
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:25,532
Simple, sharp strikes to the vital points.

66
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,853
What did Jong Soo say before he left?

67
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,772
That he would find someone.

68
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:43,092
The deposed heir, maybe?

69
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,412
I cannot tell how much...

70
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:56,733
Jang Tae Hwa knows.

71
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:02,892
I took care of the friend who reported you.

72
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:05,772
You knew?

73
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,772
Yes.

74
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:10,772
I had been...

75
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:13,733
watching him in secret.

76
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,532
- Come along. - Yes, sir.

77
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:38,812
Who are you?

78
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,253
Who are you?

79
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,253
(Garden of Flowers)

80
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,692
Act as usual when we are here.

81
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,652
You cannot let them realize who you are.

82
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,892
- Of course. - Especially...

83
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,583
Dan O.

84
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:12,093
Do not worry. Hiding things is my specialty.

85
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,772
Did the deposed heir show himself?

86
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,493
Lord Sin. How did you find out and decide to come here?

87
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,772
Nothing in Hanyang happens without my knowing.

88
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,853
Even more so about the deposed heir.

89
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,812
Did the watchman do this?

90
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,373
Yes.

91
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,093
It is the same as eight years ago.

92
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:00,612
All these men are dead,

93
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,343
so yet again, no one is left who knows...

94
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,652
Snowflake's face.

95
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,853
(Garden of Flowers)

96
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:23,092
It is still very early. Where did Yu Ha go?

97
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,093
He left in a rush, saying that he had to study.

98
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,692
He surely is a model student.

99
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,093
I should study harder to catch up.

100
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,583
Before that, eat well first. You need energy to study.

101
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,223
San, are you all right?

102
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,343
Dan O was hungover all day.

103
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,651
I know you two are close,

104
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,891
but it is not appropriate for a man and a woman to get drunk together.

105
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:56,853
I did not drink with San.

106
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:58,292
You did not?

107
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,532
Then what did the two of you do together?

108
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:17,892
I just assumed you two had drinks together.

109
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:21,532
My gosh. He carefully carried you home on his back...

110
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:24,133
as if you were a newborn baby.

111
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,732
No, I was not that careful.

112
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,573
Come on. You were very careful, as if she were a precious baby girl.

113
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,652
San is very strong.

114
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,812
Besides, she is much heavier than a newborn baby.

115
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,811
Well, I will go and get more side dishes.

116
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:44,333
- Oh, but... - We have plenty of food here.

117
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:47,692
If you bring too much food, the table will collapse, Dan O!

118
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,853
Your legs will break before that happens, Si Yeol.

119
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,892
San.

120
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:10,613
Please leave.

121
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,692
Leave and go far away.

122
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:20,532
No.

123
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,532
Do not go anywhere.

124
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,812
Do not leave. Just stay by my side.

125
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:52,253
I cannot enter the palace easily.

126
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:53,891
I am trying to figure out a way,

127
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:55,453
so you must be very careful until then.

128
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:56,812
I know.

129
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:00,292
Oh, right. Dan O already knows everything.

130
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,292
She knows who you are.

131
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,692
I overheard your conversation in the bamboo grove the other day.

132
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,373
"I still cannot believe it."

133
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,573
"That you are Lee Seol, the deposed heir."

134
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,172
That is what Dan O said.

135
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,652
No matter the circumstances,

136
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,292
do not hurt Dan O.

137
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,812
I will never dare to hurt the lady my king is in love with.

138
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,052
I am not that foolish.

139
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,133
Hold on.

140
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:34,532
What did you say? "Love?"

141
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,772
Am I wrong?

142
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,732
That night, Your Highness and Dan O, who was drunk...

143
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,213
Do not tell me you saw that too!

144
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,012
How could I not have seen it?

145
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,373
In that open yard,

146
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,332
you two expressed love for each other.

147
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,253
From now on, you should keep your distance.

148
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,333
Your eyes are as quick as your mouth.

149
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,573
If I keep my distance, I cannot protect Your Highness properly.

150
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:57,332
I cannot allow that.

151
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,253
What, then? You will keep watching me?

152
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:00,932
And everything I do?

153
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:03,652
I suppose...

154
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,531
you plan to do a lot of things.

155
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:09,372
No, that is not what I meant.

156
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,532
All right. I will leave you alone when the need arises.

157
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,532
You need not explain what happened.

158
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,932
When you are drunk, you cannot think straight,

159
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,213
and it is natural to do silly things.

160
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,133
Oh...

161
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:04,292
If you wish to pretend nothing ever happened, sure. I do not care.

162
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:21,532
I do not want that.

163
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,412
No.

164
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,573
I cannot pretend...

165
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,012
that nothing ever happened.

166
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:45,892
What did you say?

167
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,892
Seol has been arrested?

168
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,453
They are interrogating him now.

169
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:52,772
Your Highness.

170
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,373
The precious grandson of yours you have been waiting for.

171
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,493
Are you here to check if it truly is him?

172
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,052
Have a look at him, Chief Eunuch.

173
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:29,412
Is this man...

174
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,172
truly Lee Seol?

175
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,253
No, he is not.

176
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:52,093
I have seen Lee Seol as an adult, and this man...

177
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,692
looks nothing like him.

178
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:01,292
Your Majesty.

179
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:04,973
Lee Seol was spotted by the west riverside.

180
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,452
What did you say?

181
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,492
Would Your Majesty like me to return to the palace as a eunuch?

182
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:25,452
There is no way of knowing how Lee Seol will approach me.

183
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,783
Your task is to identify him.

184
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,303
I will do my utmost, Your Majesty.

185
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:34,093
The Palace Guards will be sure to protect you inside the palace walls.

186
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:36,543
Please put your worries to rest, Your Majesty.

00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,543
I keep missing the mark for I have too much on my mind.

189
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,412
You should take a shot.

190
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,652
What are you waiting for?

191
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,783
Take a shot.

192
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,303
Yes, Your Majesty.

193
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,783
This is what I expect to see if Lee Seol were to return to the palace.

194
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,892
Besides, he is around your age.

195
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:34,972
Your Majesty.

196
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,573
Master Jang Tae Hwa is here.

197
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,093
I heard you lost Lee Seol yet again.

198
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:57,023
I must take your life to quell my anger.

199
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,053
I, Jang Tae Hwa, dare ask Your Majesty for a favor.

200
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,093
Until I rip Lee Seol to pieces with my own two hands,

201
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,133
I cannot rest in peace even if I die.

202
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,853
While chasing the deposed heir,

203
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:15,972
I lost my only son...

204
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,023
and all my men.

205
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:22,783
Your Majesty, please allow me...

206
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,333
a chance to redeem myself.

207
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,412
Do not tell me you are back as a eunuch.

208
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,491
Who am I to object...

209
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:49,023
when I am powerless against His Majesty?

210
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:51,543
Chief Eunuch,

211
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,692
do you find this situation amusing?

212
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:58,023
Being of lowly birth means I can die at any second.

213
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:01,452
I would feel less wronged if I were at least entertained.

214
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,452
Do you regret it?

215
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,652
When I informed against you to Yukinhoe decades ago,

216
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,133
if you had found and killed me,

217
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,931
I would not have been an issue for you.

218
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:16,932
No.

219
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,053
You are the one...

220
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,732
who brought about this situation.

221
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:27,412
When you and Master Jang came to Garden of Flowers,

222
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,813
I figured I would be captured. However...

223
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,303
You did not identify me.

224
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:36,452
Why you chose not to...

225
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,543
does not matter to me.

226
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:43,652
But could one ask you to assist me like you did that day?

227
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,783
(Buyounggak)

228
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,252
It has been so long, Scholar Kang.

229
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,613
You seem gaunter than before.

230
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:04,212
I have been busy.

231
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:16,293
Are you going to keep following me?

232
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:19,533
You suggested before...

233
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,573
that I come to you for help.

234
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:27,333
Do tell, then. What matter can you not resolve on your own?

235
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:30,492
I am lonely.

236
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:35,652
Could you perhaps share it with me?

237
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,252
A day of yours, that is.

238
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:42,813
For some reason, when I am with you,

239
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:44,892
even Buyounggak...

240
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,932
becomes bearable.

241
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:53,412
I see you are already here.

242
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,972
The kisaeng earlier is the daughter of Lord Im Ji Guk?

243
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,411
I heard he was a compiler at the Office of Royal Decrees.

244
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:18,652
Did you know him?

245
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:19,932
I did.

246
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,212
After you escaped Yukinhoe alive,

247
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,172
the royal court was in shambles.

248
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,171
Scholars appealed to His Majesty...

249
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,093
for your execution to be revoked.

250
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,212
Lord Im Ji Guk was the one who led the movement.

251
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,853
Does the lady weigh on your mind?

252
00:23:46,212 --> 00:23:47,732
Unbeknownst to my knowledge,

253
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:51,333
I have done another person wrong.

254
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:55,172
I am afraid there is a more pressing matter to discuss.

255
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,013
Mokinhoe's recent activity has been raising red flags.

256
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:02,452
The leader of Mokinhoe announced himself as Lee Seol...

257
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:04,613
and stood before the scholars.

258
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:35,773
Chief Eunuch has found the deposed heir's watchman?

259
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,812
I told him that the watchmen...

260
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:40,692
are not aware of who they are serving.

261
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:45,013
I am now too old for this.

262
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,212
If only...

263
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,491
you could teach the students like before.

264
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:54,093
I would not be satisfied teaching other children.

265
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,773
It is all due to the fact I met my greatest student too soon.

266
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:02,252
I thought you said I was fussy and bothersome?

267
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:07,892
His Majesty who stands before me was the fussiest, was he not?

268
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:11,492
I am sick of you calling me that.

269
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:17,013
You should catch up since it has been a while.

270
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:41,853
Do you still train with these swords?

271
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:43,732
It is too heavy.

272
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:46,412
Who may you be?

273
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:50,133
When I was your age, I spent my days trapped at the temple.

274
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:52,452
It was depressing.

275
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,452
Well, I am in a generous mood today.

276
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:03,533
I will let one of you come to the marketplace with me.

277
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,293
Really?

278
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,492
Me! I want to go.

279
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,731
- No, me. - Me!

280
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:11,932
- Me. - I want to go as well.

281
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,652
The first one to successfully attack me...

282
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:17,853
will win.

283
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:21,293
Do you mean that?

284
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:20,773
I won, did I not?

285
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:29,133
Yes, this time around, you will be His Majesty.

286
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:31,293
Do you mean that?

287
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:35,533
Your Majesty, shall we head to the marketplace?

288
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:36,892
Sure.

289
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,732
More men have been guarding the palace lately.

290
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,013
His Majesty must be agitated.

291
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,052
The public has been aroused...

292
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:52,412
by the prophecy of a new king replacing the old.

293
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,612
The Governor of Pyeongan Province...

294
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:56,133
and the Army Commander of Gyeongsang Province...

295
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:58,092
voluntarily stepped down...

296
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,492
not being able to cope with outrageous commands.

297
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:02,451
What if we contacted those two first?

298
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:03,853
It is a smart plan.

299
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:05,532
We need their support...

300
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,853
if we are to fight His Majesty's men.

301
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,451
As soon as they hear you are alive,

302
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:11,452
they will bow down to you in a heartbeat.

303
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:14,333
We are choosing to flip the sky.

304
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:17,293
It is not a task one can easily engage in.

305
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:26,692
Here.

306
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:28,492
It is a hat.

307
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:31,613
Please try it on and see if it fits.

308
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,573
But this was not necessary.

309
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,252
I am glad.

310
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:52,133
I only guessed your size and was worried it would not fit.

311
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,492
Did you make it yourself?

312
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,692
The weather has gotten chillier.

313
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,892
I am sure it will help.

314
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:16,613
What did I tell you?

315
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,892
I said His Majesty might show his affection.

316
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,853
My warning was sincere.

317
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,492
I did not want you to become a royal concubine.

318
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,053
It is not like that.

319
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:30,053
Who could be spreading all these rumors?

320
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,732
We are living in a tumultuous time.

321
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,972
There is also a rumor about the deposed heir becoming king.

322
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,931
Affairs of the palace...

323
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:39,812
have been piquing everyone's interest.

324
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:43,053
Of course. Even a poster went up in the marketplace.

325
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:47,972
Do you wish for the deposed heir to be crowned as king?

326
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,133
You are seeking trouble.

327
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:51,732
What if someone heard you?

328
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:55,452
The deposed heir has stayed away all these years,

329
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:57,613
so would he actually show himself?

330
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:03,652
I cannot turn away from them...

331
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:06,573
just to save my own skin.

332
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,172
You saved my life.

333
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,652
I will not waste it in vain.

334
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,172
Do not worry.

335
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,252
- Scholar Jung. - Scholar Jung.

336
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:29,813
It is time you moved to Buyounggak.

337
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,372
When Lady Dan O marries the King,

338
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,212
she can no longer run Garden of Flowers.

339
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,931
What did you say? She will do what?

340
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,053
Have you not heard?

341
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,412
The word has spread right through Buyounggak.

342
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,252
Do not worry.

343
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,293
This Mae Wol will take her place...

344
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:47,491
and serve you every night.

345
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,892
That will not happen. You can return to your work.

346
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:56,692
You come to places like this also?

347
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:57,932
Oh, well...

348
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:00,892
I had a reason.

349
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:02,773
What is that hood you are wearing?

350
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:07,652
I am having a hard time keeping up with the new you.

351
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,013
Me, marry the King?

352
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:14,813
That is not true.

353
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:17,492
Are you sure?

354
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:20,853
Did the King not drop any hints?

355
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:26,333
No. He is not the type to open up easily.

356
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,613
He will not last much longer.

357
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:33,053
He will be brought down soon.

358
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:41,932
Have you...

359
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:44,613
joined those who read...

360
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,172
"The Secret Records of Samhan?"

361
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,333
Yes, I have.

362
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,732
I joined Mokinhoe.

363
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:57,732
So you must not...

364
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,133
get too close with the King.

365
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:02,813
Mokinhoe?

366
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:06,972
So that was it.

367
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,652
Leave, if you have nothing to say.

368
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:32,093
I have so much to say, I know not where to start.

369
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,732
I heard there is talk that Lee Seol leads Mokinhoe.

370
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,172
Do you believe that?

371
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,773
I wonder if they are just confusing the public.

372
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:47,932
Would I share my thoughts with a member of the Palace Guard?

373
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,652
If we were not friends, you would be at the Department of Justice now.

374
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:56,613
You could all be arrested.

375
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,773
Keep your voices down.

376
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,533
We were whispering.

377
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:11,212
You got into...

378
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,813
something that dangerous and kept quiet?

379
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:15,853
What if...

380
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:19,013
Dan O were to end up in danger?

381
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:22,212
I see a pot is calling a kettle...

382
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:30,932
So hot.

383
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,972
Dan O, I know how you feel.

384
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:35,932
A Palace Guard who protects a tyrant,

385
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:38,533
is worse than an ambitious reformer.

386
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:42,093
Do not fight each other.

387
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:45,412
You are all doing your own thing for a reason.

388
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,613
Since when were you so accepting?

389
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,093
You tried to stop me.

390
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:52,212
Do not worry.

391
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:56,293
No one at Garden of Flowers will suffer for what I do.

392
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,462
Your room is close to the other scholars',

393
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:27,852
so I thought we could...

394
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,093
speak in private in my room.

395
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,172
In private, just us two?

396
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:36,422
So...

397
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:38,652
San.

398
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:39,732
Whatever the topic is,

399
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,462
we can talk during the day.

400
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,613
You seem to think I am easy prey, but...

401
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:46,013
No.

402
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:48,013
This must be done today.

403
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:52,212
What is it you want to do?

404
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,462
I heard...

405
00:34:58,212 --> 00:35:00,372
many people wish for the deposed heir...

406
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:02,172
to take the throne.

407
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,053
If even Yu Ha joined the cause,

408
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:12,252
it must not be far-fetched.

409
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,732
Dan O.

410
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,332
I know what you are worried about.

411
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:25,493
But I cannot promise I will not do anything to put you at ease.

412
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,573
I will fail to keep it.

413
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:32,692
I know that.

414
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:36,212
What right do I have...

415
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,613
to stand in the way of the deposed heir?

416
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,133
I will put my faith in you.

417
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:57,852
You said you would not waste your life in vain.

418
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,013
Keep that promise at least.

419
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:05,292
Why did you change your mind?

420
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:07,852
You told me to leave.

421
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,292
If you have no choice but to go down that path,

422
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,533
I hope you will not be lonely at least.

423
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:22,053
I will be with you,

424
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:25,252
by your side.

425
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:45,462
Say it again.

426
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:50,292
The person the Queen Dowager met in secret was the Chief Eunuch?

427
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:53,692
Yes. I saw with my own eyes.

428
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,652
Did you hear what they said?

429
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:00,053
We had been sent away.

430
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,212
Oh, but when he left the Queen Dowager's presence,

431
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:08,732
he had something that looked like a bag of money.

432
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:12,732
You are excused.

433
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:23,093
The King beheaded Court Lady Kim who was...

434
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:24,942
the Queen Dowager's trusted servant.

435
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:28,422
She would have needed a replacement.

436
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:30,462
A bag of money...

437
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:35,772
Could she have put the Chief Eunuch in charge of funding the watchman?

438
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:40,372
To find Lee Seol through the watchman?

439
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,093
Only the Queen Dowager could come up with such an idea.

440
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:48,093
The watchman.

441
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,462
It is the perfect opportunity to catch you.

442
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:02,692
My lady.

443
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:22,973
Why are we here?

444
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,093
There are no scholars at all.

445
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,252
Today, forget touting...

446
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:32,942
and enjoy the scenery.

447
00:38:37,372 --> 00:38:39,172
The beautiful view of just one season...

448
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,053
that you have been missing.

449
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,772
The splashing sound is so clear.

450
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:27,852
Not as clear as your voice.

451
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:31,013
You have not used it much,

452
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:33,812
so it is clear...

453
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:38,212
and beautiful.

454
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,942
Fallen leaves are prettier than flowers.

455
00:39:58,942 --> 00:39:59,942
Do you not agree?

456
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:15,093
Write it all down.

457
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:17,852
Everything you have missed out on.

458
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:20,172
What for?

459
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:23,942
Will you make them happen?

460
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,692
There are many things I have never done either.

461
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:32,573
It will be very fun to do them together.

462
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:49,252
I understand the watchman is guarding Lee Seol,

463
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:52,973
but he is bound to get caught by you.

464
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:55,172
Do not be too disappointed.

465
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:03,462
As for Lady Dan O, I bet she has found something.

466
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:06,902
What do you mean?

467
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,613
I hear she has been frequenting the palace.

468
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:11,972
A while back,

469
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,573
she came to Buyounggak looking for a man with a red spot.

470
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:18,093
So I was wondering if she found out something.

471
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:24,902
I did not know that you were so immensely interested in Lee Seol.

472
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:28,533
I apologize if I overstepped my bounds.

473
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:36,053
I apologize, my lord.

474
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:37,942
I will go and get a dry cloth.

475
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,332
No way. Could Scholar Kang San be...

476
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,462
Why the long face?

477
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:24,533
I bet it is because of Dan O.

478
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,332
Right, Your Highness?

479
00:42:27,652 --> 00:42:30,812
You told me to keep talking to you casually at home.

480
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:33,942
Your Highness.

481
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:40,573
Do you think...

482
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:43,973
I can truly protect Dan O?

483
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:48,172
Even if war broke out, she would sell porridge and earn money.

484
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:49,462
Why are you so worried about her?

485
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:54,212
It seems that you and Hong Ju have gotten very close.

486
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,013
Yes.

487
00:42:57,093 --> 00:42:58,573
I have never met a woman like her in my life.

488
00:42:59,462 --> 00:43:00,692
I want to do everything for her.

489
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:04,252
Have you had a deep conversation with her?

490
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:07,212
It looks like she has been through a lot.

491
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:09,942
She is confined to the annex, all alone.

492
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:12,292
I am waiting for her to open up to me.

493
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:15,613
I am certain that she will tell me once she begins to trust me.

494
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,093
In any case, do not tell Dan O.

495
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,972
She will worry about Hong Ju going out.

496
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:24,771
I know. I can read the room.

497
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:27,013
Is that so? Yet you had no idea that I was the watchman.

498
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,731
How many times have we eaten together at the same table?

499
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,902
You are awfully slow-witted...

500
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:35,132
Your words are your weapons.

501
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:36,732
Spoken like a warrior with no fear.

502
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:43,612
My dear Lady Dan O said to come out and have some roasted chestnuts.

503
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:45,732
"My dear Lady Dan O?"

504
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,093
Do not call her like that.

505
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,933
It has been bothering me for some time now.

506
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:53,613
Your Dan O said to come out and have some roasted chestnuts.

507
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:55,332
Happy now?

508
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:57,013
Yes, let us go.

509
00:43:59,252 --> 00:44:00,772
Oh, hurry up and join us.

510
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:07,252
Try this. It is very sweet.

511
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:20,053
It is still steaming hot. Be careful.

512
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:29,973
Sweet and steamy.

513
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:35,133
Those darn chestnuts.

514
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:46,453
Yu Ha, your studies must be keeping you very busy these days.

515
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,133
Yes, indeed.

516
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:55,212
Your room is filled with books that are hard to get.

517
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,013
Hello?

518
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:00,053
Who is here at this hour?

519
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,093
Who might you be?

520
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:14,613
His Majesty has ordered you to visit the palace tomorrow.

521
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:18,413
My goodness.

522
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,852
(Garden of Flowers)

523
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:29,093
I am already excited,

524
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:32,172
thinking about us passing the exam and starting work together.

525
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,212
Yes, that would be fantastic.

526
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:37,053
Anyway, did you want to talk to me about something?

527
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:41,453
Oh, are you heading out to study?

528
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,532
If you are leaving,

529
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,013
your books will be so lonely in this empty room.

530
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:51,493
If there are books that you need, you can borrow them.

531
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:55,372
I appreciate that. I will take good care of them.

532
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:58,252
See you.

533
00:46:23,893 --> 00:46:25,732
(Book of Documents)

534
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:48,533
Yuk Ho, this book is...

535
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:53,053
This drawing. Did you draw this?

536
00:46:54,013 --> 00:46:55,093
No, I did not.

537
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:56,533
Are you telling me the truth?

538
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:58,251
What is the matter?

539
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:59,692
This is very important.

540
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:02,533
What is this?

541
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:05,413
I asked a physician I know to get me this rare tonic.

542
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:15,692
I will see you in the palace.

543
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:19,732
We shall find out why the King summoned you this time.

544
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:21,493
Do not worry.

545
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:25,133
I will get out safe and sound, just like I did last time.

546
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,893
You and Dan O talked for a while,

547
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:34,692
Your Highness.

548
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:37,372
San.

549
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:40,732
Spare me a moment.

550
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,652
Could we talk when I get home later?

551
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:44,972
I have to go in early today.

552
00:47:44,973 --> 00:47:46,093
It will only take a moment.

553
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,533
(Book of Documents)

554
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:06,292
Dan O told me...

555
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:09,652
that she saved...

556
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:14,133
a royal heir who hid in a kennel over a decade ago.

557
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:19,893
Did you draw this?

558
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:22,772
Are you truly...

559
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,332
Lee Seol, the deposed heir?

560
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,612
Yuk Ho, why are you being like this?

561
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:40,413
Dan O is like a daughter to me.

562
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,093
I cannot let her get hurt.

563
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:47,692
Your Highness, all of this happened because of you.

564
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:50,332
Your Highness.

565
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:52,453
Please, I beg you.

566
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:56,613
Please leave Garden of Flowers.

567
00:49:06,453 --> 00:49:07,692
Yuk Ho is right.

568
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,493
It is all my fault.

569
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:18,692
From time to time, I wonder...

570
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:23,093
what would have happened had I never returned to Hanyang.

571
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:25,093
Do not tell me...

572
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,372
you wish to give up now.

573
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,852
I suppose you wanted to leave early today to come here.

574
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,852
But what is this place?

575
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:59,133
A safehouse, which I bought many years ago.

576
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:04,652
If something happens to me,

577
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,573
bring Dan O and everyone else at Garden of Flowers...

578
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,573
to this house, safe and sound.

579
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:14,732
As your watchman, my job is to protect you at all times.

580
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:17,092
I am afraid I must decline your request.

581
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,652
It is an order, not a request.

582
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:23,613
You should never put my safety before your own life.

583
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,413
Protect everyone at Garden of Flowers at all costs.

584
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:31,732
That also includes you.

585
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:35,533
Also,

586
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:39,172
if by any chance...

587
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,613
someone shadows Dan O...

588
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:54,573
The awakened one will appear with the blizzard from the north...

589
00:50:55,372 --> 00:50:57,613
painting our world in pure white.

590
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:02,413
Are you adding a line...

591
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,652
to the "The Secret Records of Samhan?"

592
00:51:04,973 --> 00:51:06,893
The rumors are already spreading,

593
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:09,533
so we only need proof...

594
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:13,252
that the awakened one is the deposed heir.

595
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:16,772
What will you do if the real Lee Seol...

596
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,851
chooses to appear?

597
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:21,093
I believe our Lee Seol is fit to be king.

598
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,732
Unless the real Lee Seol proves to be better,

599
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:27,613
I will not change my mind.

600
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:32,252
So you wish to compare the two.

601
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:35,852
Lord Sin.

602
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:38,453
Please enter.

603
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:50,573
Hwa Ryung, you were here as well.

604
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:55,372
Let us sit.

605
00:51:58,212 --> 00:51:59,692
The hat suits you.

606
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:06,692
You must be busy planning for the big day.

607
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:10,212
If you need anything, do not hesitate to ask.

608
00:52:10,852 --> 00:52:12,093
I will help you in any way I can.

609
00:52:12,453 --> 00:52:13,453
Thank you.

610
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:15,332
Your Highness,

611
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:17,932
how close of a relationship...

612
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,572
do you have with the innkeeper at Garden of Flowers?

613
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:21,452
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

614
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:24,893
His Majesty has been summoning her to the palace often.

615
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:28,172
She was summoned today as well.

616
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:29,772
Do you know why?

617
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:33,893
His Majesty has his eyes on Garden of Flowers.

618
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,413
It could generate problems for you,

619
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:38,732
so please keep your distance from her.

620
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,013
Your Majesty,

621
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:06,893
I was hoping to ask you something.

622
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:08,933
Speak.

623
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:12,613
What are your intentions with Yoon Dan O?

624
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:14,772
Tonight,

625
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:19,013
I hope to have some fun with her.

626
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:38,133
Right.

627
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:39,652
Have a seat.

628
00:53:51,692 --> 00:53:53,212
I will ask you this...

629
00:53:54,372 --> 00:53:55,933
for the first and last time.

630
00:53:58,212 --> 00:54:00,933
Do you not intend to reveal Lee Seol's identity?

631
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:03,973
Reveal his identity?

632
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:07,852
Are you suggesting that I know who he is?

633
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:11,533
Even now, you choose to deceive me.

634
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:14,093
How could I possibly dare to deceive His Majesty?

635
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:18,372
You may question me numerous times, but all I will say...

636
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,893
is that I do not know...

637
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,053
who Lee Seol is.

638
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:34,573
Whether you know him or not...

639
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,533
does not matter.

640
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:43,332
All that matters is that Lee Seol knows you.

641
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,852
So enjoy.

642
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,573
Where else would you see...

643
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:54,013
a banquet this entertaining?

644
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,811
Change into plain clothes and follow me out.

645
00:55:31,812 --> 00:55:33,093
May I ask why?

646
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:34,772
You are to follow me.

647
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,332
A palanquin has been prepared for you.

648
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:48,013
I would at least like for the journey back...

649
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:50,252
to be comfortable.

650
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:15,172
An attempt on Yoon Dan O's life...

651
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,852
will force Lee Seol to appear.

652
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:19,573
If he does not,

653
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:21,252
just kill the girl.

654
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,053
(Bamboo Goods)

655
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:44,973
Who are you?

656
00:56:46,093 --> 00:56:47,093
Why are you doing this?

657
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,172
He is the watchman.

658
00:56:57,573 --> 00:56:58,573
Attack!

659
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:38,292
Halt!

660
00:57:51,573 --> 00:57:53,093
Why was the watchman after me?

661
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:54,732
Do not worry.

662
00:57:55,053 --> 00:57:58,613
I designed the attack to save you from His Majesty's trap.

663
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:02,053
I see.

664
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:23,933
I do not wish to lose more of my people.

665
00:58:27,732 --> 00:58:29,933
It is the only reason...

666
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:33,453
I wish to take the throne.

667
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,493
It is why nothing can be accomplished...

668
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:48,413
without you.

669
00:58:57,332 --> 00:58:58,332
Just for a short while,

670
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:01,212
let us be together.

671
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,533
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

672
00:59:56,332 --> 00:59:59,012
Your fate as well as your family's rest in my hands.

673
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,932
Dan O, you have to side with His Majesty.

674
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:02,612
Whenever my life is in danger,

675
01:00:02,613 --> 01:00:05,092
you will be the one to protect me.

676
01:00:05,093 --> 01:00:06,892
Your beauty is surely an issue.

677
01:00:06,893 --> 01:00:08,731
What I truly want is you.

678
01:00:08,732 --> 01:00:10,532
I wish you to be safe, Dan O.

679
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:12,972
His Highness will slay at least one of the two.

680
01:00:12,973 --> 01:00:14,771
Are you sure this is a path you can handle?

681
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:16,572
If Dan O is ever in danger,

682
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:18,811
reveal my identity.

683
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:21,453
Allow your grandson to greet you.

684
01:00:23,093 --> 01:00:24,171
Seol, is that you?

685
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,212
Yes, Grandmother.
