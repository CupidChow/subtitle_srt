8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,559
He goes that way. Chase him!

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,279
If you bring the watchman to me,

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,920
I will write off your debt.

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,438
Have you ever hurt a person with a real sword before?

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,478
I have injured countless men.

13
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,839
Are you the watchman?

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,319
Hello? Are you inside?

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,839
Rumor has it that...

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,318
a young female ghost lives in this house.

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,319
What about your sister?

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,639
You knew about her?

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,559
I knew long ago that she was no ghost.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,438
Run a new background check...

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,479
on all the scholars at Garden of Flowers.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,479
What is your real name?

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,518
Aim by sight for me.

24
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,519
I will draw the bow.

25
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,519
Now.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,958
He is here.

27
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,919
Your father left it for you.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,158
Do not tell the young masters.

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,238
Still, you cannot leave without saying goodbye.

30
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,318
I do not know if we should show up unannounced.

31
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,919
San and now you will not let this rest.

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,078
She cannot stay at the temple forever.

33
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,759
Garden of Flowers is yours.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,238
The fact that she is relinquishing it...

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,879
It means she is done searching for Lee Seol.

36
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,759
- Master Jang... - Master Jang?

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,120
I do not know for what reason,

38
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,839
but he is on his way here with his men.

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,559
I relinquished Garden of Flowers,

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,359
You kept something from me.

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,319
(Episode 7)

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,400
You have found Lee Seol.

43
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,680
Who is he?

44
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,719
This is your last warning.

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Answer me.

46
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,960
The watchman greets us.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,370
Attack.

48
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,370
Dan O.

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,240
My goodness. What was that about?

50
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,718
How did Master Jang find us?

51
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,239
We will explain later.

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,719
We should get out of here first.

53
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,639
There is a byway to the back.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,038
I will show you the way.

55
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,038
I apologize for only causing trouble.

56
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,639
All is well. Get ready to leave.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,080
You go ahead. I will check how things went.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
Come along.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,918
Dan O. What happened?

60
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,680
We must leave, Hong Ju.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
I waited to see you...

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,610
for a long time.

63
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,319
You tried to find the deposed heir? Is that true?

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,759
I had no idea this would happen.

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,719
I just wanted to keep Garden of Flowers.

66
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,199
How could you be so foolish?

67
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,318
I have seen countless people lose their lives...

68
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,719
as a result of their involvement in royal affairs.

69
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,480
It is all my fault. I am a useless older sister.

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,359
I am no help at all.

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,720
What is done is done, and it is in the past now.

72
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,800
Lady Dan O must have had no other option.

73
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,879
Who was...

74
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,639
that swordsman?

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,480
He appeared suddenly and saved you.

76
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,120
I heard the term...

77
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
"watchman."

78
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
I heard he is a warrior who protects the deposed heir.

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
I do not know the details.

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,879
Dan O.

81
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
You must be surprised.

82
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,920
She is my older sister.

83
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,800
Nice to meet you.

84
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,639
There is a reason for this.

85
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,800
I will explain later.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
So,

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
how did it look back at the temple?

88
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,479
Did Master Jang...

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,319
When I got back, they had already gone.

90
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,680
I see.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,680
Where should we go now?

92
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,720
We cannot return to Garden of Flowers.

93
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,360
We should leave Hanyang.

94
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,759
This trail leads to Namtaeryeong.

95
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,560
At least let us help you find a place to stay.

96
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,800
We can return then.

97
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,839
People will get suspicious if you are away for too long.

98
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,638
If Master Jang asks where I am,

99
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,600
say we parted at the temple and you do not know.

100
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,920
We will come to Gwacheon when things calm down.

101
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,600
Be sure to send word.

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,079
I will.

103
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,839
Oh, dear.

104
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
Ms. Naju.

105
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
Meet me here in a fortnight.

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,160
We must discuss where to go from here.

107
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,519
- Sure. - Okay.

108
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,559
Must she leave in such a hurry?

109
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,519
However fearful she is of Master Jang.

110
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,919
Have you heard?

111
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,879
Master Jang's only son died young.

112
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,330
His daughter-in-law also died not long after.

113
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,519
That daughter-in-law...

114
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,450
is Hong Ju.

115
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,330
She is a special girl they revived...

116
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,120
by separating her from society.

117
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,360
She is a woman...

118
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,090
who should not be living.

119
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,279
I have never seen such swordmanship.

120
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,120
He is called a slayer for a reason.

121
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,159
His skills have improved more than I expected.

122
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,559
There were two swordsmen.

123
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,480
There could be two watchmen.

124
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,600
Could one not be Snowflake?

125
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
If the watchman came to protect Snowflake...

126
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,159
The watchman kills all...

127
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,840
to protect just one, Snowflake.

128
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,039
So how come he did not kill anyone?

129
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,759
When he has the skill to kill ten in a single blow.

130
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,600
Then do you believe he let us live?

131
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,840
The slayer has stopped dropping bodies?

132
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,210
Or...

133
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,159
was he not the watchman?

134
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,840
For now, trace Yoon Dan O.

135
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,799
She is hiding something.

136
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,039
Yes, my lord.

137
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,360
Where were you all this while?

138
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,720
I thought you had all left without me.

139
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,919
Dan O.

140
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,519
Is she safe?

141
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,559
What?

142
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,240
I wonder how she is doing now she has nowhere to go.

143
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,679
You do not know?

144
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,120
How would I know?

145
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,960
I am sure she is doing fine.

146
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,480
What? I thought you went out to meet her or something.

147
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,759
(Garden of Flowers)

148
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,440
(Garden of Flowers)

149
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,519
I wonder if Dan O is doing well.

150
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,039
I wish to see her.

151
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,960
As you can see, soldiers in disguise are everywhere.

152
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,679
Where would you even meet her?

153
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,919
That heartless fool.

154
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,080
Is he not even worried about Dan O?

155
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,799
How could he be so calm?

156
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,159
What are you doing here?

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,159
Are you here to see me?

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes, I wish to talk to you about something.

159
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
What is it?

160
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,120
How will you threaten me this time?

161
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,399
Dan O said she was headed to Gwacheon.

162
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,279
I figured you would be worried.

163
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,759
I am not worried.

164
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,519
She is bright and clever,

165
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,360
so she will be fine wherever she is.

166
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
It was you, was it not?

167
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
The swordsman who showed up at the temple.

168
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,679
When you were shot by the poisoned arrow,

169
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,439
I noticed you had a real sword on you...

170
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
instead of the wooden sword you always carried with you.

171
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,559
So?

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
That swordsman had the exact same sword.

173
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,000
The swords that swordsmen use all look the same.

174
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,559
If you are done talking, let us go.

175
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,320
Have your feelings for her deepened that greatly?

176
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,678
You are willing to protect her...

177
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,120
even if it costs you your principles and your life.

178
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Yes.

179
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
It happened that way,

180
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,200
so protect Dan O in the best way that you can.

181
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,399
Just follow your heart...

182
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,799
for I will do the same.

183
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,119
(Capital District Office)

184
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,879
We observed them for over two weeks,

185
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,360
but none of the scholars did anything suspicious.

186
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,999
We must find Yoon Dan O...

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,159
to track down the swordsman.

188
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Continue to keep a watchful eye on them.

189
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
That reminds me.

190
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,360
I heard one of the scholars at Garden of Flowers...

191
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,200
was preparing for the military exam.

192
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,558
What was his name again?

193
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,039
His name is Kang San.

194
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,600
He is a skilled archer. He already passed the preliminary exam.

195
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Kang San.

196
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,080
I wish to know where he was born and raised. Find out everything.

197
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Look into it yourself, Jong Soo.

198
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,039
Yes, my lord.

199
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,719
(Liquor)

200
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,279
I would like some rice wine, please.

201
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,360
What if he has been arrested?

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
The soldiers came at him as if they were about to kill him.

203
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Dan O.

204
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,960
What are you thinking about?

205
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
What?

206
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, it is nothing.

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,440
By the way, Ms. Naju is nowhere to be seen.

208
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,159
Did she go somewhere?

209
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,799
She went to Hanyang.

210
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,039
What?

211
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Hanyang? What for?

212
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,039
Did something happen?

213
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
No.

214
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,240
To look for your spouse.

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,000
I told her to do it.

216
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Hong Ju.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,878
You cannot live like this for the rest of your life.

218
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,360
Even so, this is wrong.

219
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,558
What would you do if I got married?

220
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,720
I will go to Gwaneum Temple.

221
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,639
Only female monks reside there.

222
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,319
I told them my situation, and they said they would accept me.

223
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
That is absurd.

224
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,999
You did not even tell me...

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,039
You did not tell me that you were looking for the deposed heir.

226
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,559
Is that acceptable?

227
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,159
That is...

228
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,039
I am sorry about that.

229
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,080
So please do not do this.

230
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,600
I work at the tavern now,

231
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,678
so the three of us are fine even if we cannot live comfortably...

232
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,679
How much longer will you do this?

233
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,320
Do you wish to live in hiding forever...

234
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,320
while struggling to make ends meet?

235
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,879
I cannot let my sister live such a life.

236
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,480
Hold on.

237
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,600
Please take a good look.

238
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,879
Goodness, let me do my thing.

239
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,799
I bought it to give it to my future wife if I were to get married.

240
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,399
My goodness.

241
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,359
It has been a while...

242
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
since your daughter reached the marriageable age.

243
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Hold on.

244
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,240
You said you were not married.

245
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,159
I cherish her like my own child.

246
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,719
There was someone who wished to marry her.

247
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,759
Master Sleaze.

248
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,838
Oh, my. Is she the one...

249
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,759
who rejected Master Sleaze?

250
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,439
My gosh.

251
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,960
She did not really "reject" him, per se.

252
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,440
Anyway, how is Master Sleaze doing?

253
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,170
He got married a little over two weeks ago.

254
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,519
Then...

255
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,519
are there any other eligible bachelors?

256
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,599
Other than this family,

257
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,359
no one else would approve of her.

258
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,319
Come on.

259
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,199
She should be grateful that she would not have to do manual labor.

260
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,119
Kim, the old man who is over 60?

261
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,559
As his second wife at that?

262
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Come on.

263
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,799
So? What happened?

264
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,890
I researched thoroughly,

265
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,480
and you were right.

266
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,480
There is a family that adopted a female infant...

267
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
who was less than a year old.

268
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,000
Of course, they could not kill the baby.

269
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
She is Royal Consort Park's child, after all.

270
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,959
Since adopting the baby,

271
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,920
the family's financial situation has improved greatly.

272
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,799
They now have plenty of money...

273
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,650
and also own paddy fields that once belonged...

274
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,319
to Royal Consort Park's family.

275
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Your Majesty.

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,999
The Prince is less than 100 days old.

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
Such a young prince has never been appointed the Heir Apparent.

278
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,798
Also, Her Highness the Queen is still alive...

279
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,889
The Queen cannot conceive due to her chronic illness.

280
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,119
You are well aware of it.

281
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,000
You simply do not approve of Royal Consort Park's lowly blood.

282
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,519
Do you think I would not know what you ministers are up to?

283
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,999
The Heir Apparent will become the Crown Prince of Joseon,

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,359
then ascend the throne.

285
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,559
Please decide carefully, Your Majesty.

286
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,680
- Decide carefully, Your Majesty. - Decide carefully, Your Majesty.

287
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,359
Crown Prince! You are at it again!

288
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,479
You have been hounding me to produce an heir for over a decade.

289
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,359
Day and night!

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,359
I am sick of it.

291
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Or is this because...

292
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,240
the heir you want is someone else?

293
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,170
By any chance,

294
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,440
is it the name mentioned in those banned books?

295
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,439
Your Majesty, attempting to reinstate a deposed heir...

296
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,920
would be considered treason.

297
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,720
The thought alone terrifies us.

298
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,359
Please take back what Your Majesty said.

299
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,999
Even though the Prince was born of a royal concubine,

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,799
he is the only heir at the moment.

301
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,169
Even for the sake of restoring order in the royal court,

302
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,358
he should be appointed the Heir Apparent...

303
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,839
as soon as possible.

304
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,839
Minister of War.

305
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,599
You truly are my loyal subject.

306
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,439
Upon the appointment of the Heir Apparent,

307
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,599
Royal Consort Park will receive the first senior rank as well.

308
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,279
Anyone who is against it will be considered a traitor.

309
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,839
End of discussion.

310
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,200
Congratulations, Royal Noble Consort Park.

311
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,960
A royal noble consort.

312
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,440
When I first came to the palace, I was a court maid.

313
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,200
I put up with so much, and it feels like it was only yesterday.

314
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,359
As the mother of the Heir Apparent,

315
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,960
you certainly deserve it.

316
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,359
Thank you.

317
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,759
What did you want to talk to me about?

318
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,599
I must visit the Queen Dowager with the Heir Apparent.

319
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,799
It is about the Queen Dowager.

320
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,720
Were you aware...

321
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,079
that the Queen Dowager had been financially backing the watchman?

322
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,759
What did you say?

323
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,359
So you think I should send a spy to the Queen Dowager's chambers?

324
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,599
Even to send money to him,

326
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,079
someone must be in contact with him on a regular basis.

327
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,359
That person will lead us...

328
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,960
to Lee Seol's watchman.

329
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,359
And...

330
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,240
we will find Lee Seol too.

331
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,359
A court maid has already been set into play.

332
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,170
She has been instructed to report the Queen Dowager's orders.

333
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,839
I am not in the mood for the herbal tonic.

334
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,359
I will move up my schedule...

335
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,919
and head out for Onyang Temporary Palace today.

336
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,039
Be prepared.

337
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,079
We will escort you as soon as we are ready.

339
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,680
Here are the funds for the watchman.

340
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes, Your Highness.

341
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,440
You leaving the palace often...

342
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,839
will draw suspicion from His Majesty.

343
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,160
We must quickly find someone to take your place.

344
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,960
If the watchman is caught,

345
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,680
my Seol...

346
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,920
will not be able to survive.

347
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,119
(Buyounggak)

348
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,359
Currently, I am looking into Yoon Dan O's whereabouts.

349
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,279
Consider yourself heard. You are dismissed.

350
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, my lord.

351
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,920
The others have been dismissed, so make yourself at home.

352
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,318
I hear you have been helping Master Jang...

353
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,599
locate Snowflake.

354
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,599
Yes, that is correct.

355
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,920
To uphold the authority of the royal family,

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Snowflake must be executed...

357
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,598
to eliminate future trouble.

358
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,480
Killing Snowflake will not resolve the matter at hand.

359
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,358
Without an heir to the throne,

360
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,758
the royal bloodline will be discontinued,

361
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,640
so how will the order of Joseon be upheld?

362
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,160
A discontinued bloodline, you say?

363
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,359
But a prince was recently born.

364
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,999
His Majesty subsides his anxieties...

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
by believing in superstition.

366
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,518
This one time, he spoke...

367
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,039
of the Legend of Baridegi.

368
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,598
The great king from that myth...

369
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,240
was not able to produce a son.

370
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,039
But did you know...

371
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,199
that the great king tossed his seventh child into the river...

372
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,680
because she was born a girl?

373
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,278
Are you saying Royal Consort Park gave birth to a princess?

374
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,680
She is now Royal Noble Consort Park.

375
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,359
His Majesty elevated her status.

376
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,880
The court lady...

377
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,200
who assisted in the baby's delivery committed suicide.

378
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,720
The medical staff at the Office of Childbirth...

379
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,118
left the palace and cannot be located.

380
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,279
Could that be a coincidence?

381
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,839
Let me ask you this.

382
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,119
Have you truly...

383
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,359
not located Snowflake?

384
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,319
I lack knowledge regarding the matter.

385
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,599
If I had found Snowflake,

386
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,879
I would have reported it to Master Jang immediately.

387
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,359
Do not inform him.

388
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,759
Master Jang must not find Snowflake.

389
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,078
Are you saying...

390
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,839
A mere assistant magistrate should not hold that kind of power.

391
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,359
Snowflake is not to be used that way.

392
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,640
Does he intend to crown Snowflake as king?

393
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,079
It is for you.

394
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,160
Rather than an eunuch, you call yourself a tradesman.

395
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,799
Could it be that you trust me?

396
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,279
I do not.

397
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,400
However, someone as sly as you always finds a way to survive.

398
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,480
Cleverly weigh your options...

399
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,960
and side with the one...

400
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,680
you will benefit the most from.

401
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,400
Dan O, how have you been?

402
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,680
We meet again, Young Master.

403
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,599
All the doors need new handles.

404
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,519
What brings you by, Madame?

405
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,519
The place requires a lot of work done,

406
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,359
so I will be staying in the main building for now.

407
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,919
Did Master Jang put you up to this?

408
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,640
I am only doing my job as the Head of Buyounggak.

409
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,318
You must have been waiting for...

410
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,559
the young lady who used to live here.

411
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,279
I apologize for before.

412
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,319
It is all right.

413
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,519
All I wanted...

414
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,440
was a normal married life in a house like this.

415
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,480
Now, my life seems meaningless.

416
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,319
I was not born a kisaeng, you see.

417
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,400
My father...

418
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,559
left his government position to live closer to nature...

419
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,200
after the Crown Prince was robbed of his throne.

420
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,440
The King who now occupies the throne...

421
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,319
not only killed the Crown Prince...

422
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,799
but also gave orders to have the deposed heir killed.

423
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
My father...

424
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,519
wrote appeals to talk sense into him...

425
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,039
but was branded a traitor.

426
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,759
Your late father.

427
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,359
May I ask his name?

428
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,720
He was once the compiler...

429
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,000
of the Office of Royal Decrees who went by the name of Im Ji Guk.

430
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,680
What happened...

431
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,319
to your family?

432
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,799
My older brother...

433
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,319
was executed along with my father,

434
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,160
and my mother recently succumbed to an illness.

435
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,240
It is how I came to stay at Buyounggak.

436
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,559
I had no idea...

437
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,279
you had suffered so much.

438
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,319
We are heading out. Are you sure you are not coming?

439
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,559
Go ahead without me.

440
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
There being so many of us would not help anyway.

441
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,119
This is where we should part ways.

442
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,240
We must give him the slip.

443
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,439
Sounds good to me.

444
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,480
Let us rendezvous at the base of the hill.

445
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,680
My gosh.

446
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
Identify yourself!

447
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,799
I am with the Capital District Office.

448
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,279
There is something I must confirm, so step aside.

449
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,839
The Capital District Office?

450
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,599
That is too bad for you...

451
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,639
since this is not your jurisdiction.

452
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
Surround him!

453
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,119
Easy...

454
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,319
Boss, he ran off.

455
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,999
- Fall back. - Fall back.

456
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,039
Off we go.

457
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,278
My goodness.

458
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,599
What brings you all the way here?

459
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,279
Goodness.

460
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,079
This is where you live, Dan O.

461
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Are you doing well?

462
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,200
Yes, of course.

463
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,000
You look disappointed.

464
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,000
Were you hoping for someone else?

465
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,720
I am not disappointed.

466
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
I am startled and pleased.

467
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
Do not expect San.

468
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,119
He cannot visit.

469
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,759
Why not?

470
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,279
Did something bad happen?

471
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
As if.

472
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,720
I was unaware,

473
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,599
but he is a man after all.

474
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,559
He joked around with a Buyounggak kisaeng...

475
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,839
His next exam is coming up,

476
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,359
and he is busy training.

477
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,079
I see.

478
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,359
Here.

479
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
What...

480
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,279
Goodness.

481
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
My gosh.

482
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,359
Is everyone well?

483
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,480
Yes, everyone at Garden of Flowers is well.

484
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,200
Unlike before, it is now hustling and bustling.

485
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,359
Yuk Ho is worried about you.

486
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,799
Apologize to him for me.

487
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,519
I let him down.

488
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
I will tell him,

489
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,119
but he will be more concerned than let down.

490
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,799
He cared for you like a daughter.

491
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,960
Yes. That is why I feel worse.

492
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,440
Have you been doing well?

493
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,759
You asked that already.

494
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,119
I have been doing great.

495
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,839
I have not been too well.

496
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,640
I missed you, Dan O.

497
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,359
I did,

498
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,039
and it is good to see you.

499
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,119
I feel relieved...

500
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,359
to see you as well.

501
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,480
Will you stay in your room...

502
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,519
on such a lovely day?

503
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,119
Hello.

504
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,759
- How about a stroll... - That tune.

505
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,039
Where did you hear it?

506
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,960
The tune you just hummed.

507
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
I heard it just once long ago.

508
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,279
From a traveler at a tavern.

509
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,359
And you...

510
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,519
remembered it?

511
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,119
I did.

512
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,809
That day was the worst of my life.

513
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,840
Even the wine I drank tasted bitter,

514
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,880
and the man at the next table seemed to enjoy his.

515
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,039
So I asked him...

516
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,719
why he seemed so happy.

517
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,039
What did...

518
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the traveler say?

519
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,559
He said that soon...

520
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,880
he would marry his beloved.

521
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Forget about that.

522
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,559
Did you like the tune enough to ask about it?

523
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
No.

524
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,079
If you like it, I will sing it to you often.

525
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,480
I have a thing for the arts.

526
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,039
I can sing and dance.

527
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Shall we dance...

528
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Forget it.

529
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,119
Do not sing that tune again.

530
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,079
Oh, dear.

531
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,960
Master Jang wishes to speak with you.

532
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,119
Me?

533
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
What about?

534
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,289
Come to Buyounggak at 8pm.

535
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,639
(Buyounggak)

536
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,639
So,

537
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,519
how did you get into martial arts?

538
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,360
Does a warrior need a reason to pick it up?

539
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,480
To pass the state exam and serve the King.

540
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,809
That is the greatest honor.

541
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,039
I see.

542
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
I wish you luck at the next exam.

543
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,519
I am flattered by your kindness.

544
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,289
Why did you ask to see me?

545
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Have you...

546
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,559
heard of "Yukinhoe?"

547
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,960
This is the first I've heard of it.

548
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,920
It is a private group of young warriors.

549
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,039
All talented people our nation cannot do without.

550
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,880
Scholars have more authority,

551
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,289
but in turbulent times, it is the warriors...

552
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:38,289
who defend the people.

553
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,000
There is an opening,

554
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:43,289
and I am looking to fill it.

555
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,960
I think you would be a good fit.

556
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,329
I must refuse.

557
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,199
I am not yet...

558
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,599
good enough to be called talented.

559
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,639
You are too humble.

560
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,480
I heard you are a good archer.

561
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Next time,

562
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,480
we should go hunting.

563
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,809
San.

564
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,039
Fancy meeting you here.

565
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,238
Why are you in Hanyang?

566
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,079
To meet someone who will help me pass the exam.

567
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,719
Unlike you, I have poor skills...

568
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,840
and must try as best I can.

569
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,679
That is good to hear.

570
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,119
Yes.

571
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,039
It is so cold.

572
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:09,809
Dan O.

573
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,719
Can we leave her like this?

574
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,519
What can you do?

575
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,480
Get her a house?

576
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,159
I could.

577
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Forget it.

578
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:25,518
You were afraid that the bag of rice would offend her,

579
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,880
so you made me give it.

580
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,239
That was...

581
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,639
You do not miss a thing.

582
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,840
You did a good thing.

583
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,119
I checked the kitchen,

584
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,718
and they were out of rice.

585
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,719
They were?

586
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,809
Are they barely making ends meet?

587
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,118
Working at a tavern...

588
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,039
will not be easy, will it?

589
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,840
I am more worried about Hong Ju.

590
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
She never goes outside.

591
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:02,809
Yes.

592
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,809
He is Kang San.

593
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,239
How could I not recognize a childhood friend?

594
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,199
How long have you been close friends?

595
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,769
Ten-something years now.

596
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,920
We lived in the same neighborhood...

597
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,360
until San left for Hanyang.

598
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,639
Is that seat free?

599
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,840
Will you let me join?

600
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,039
I will raise the stakes.

601
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,809
Snack on this on the way.

602
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,239
Thank you.

603
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,599
Dan O.

604
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,400
If you could return to Garden of Flowers,

605
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,719
what would you do?

606
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,519
Are you still asleep?

607
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,719
I have a gift before I leave.

608
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,480
I saw them by the road.

609
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,960
Next time, we should walk together.

610
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,639
It is a beautiful scene.

611
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,039
No.

612
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,360
Do not bring things like this again.

613
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,199
My lady.

614
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,920
I will not see you again.

615
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,329
Let alone go on a walk together.

616
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,880
What does that mean?

617
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,920
I'm moving to a temple soon.

618
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:11,769
A temple?

619
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,079
Will you become...

620
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,039
a Buddhist nun?

621
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,360
Is this how a loyal subject would feel when ordered to drink poison?

622
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,289
I feel despair and rage, exactly half and half.

623
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,879
At this rate, you will burst into tears.

624
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,159
My heart has already shed tears.

625
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,768
I am choking up with tears.

626
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:49,840
I am fascinated.

627
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
You have not even known Lady Hong Ju for that long.

628
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:54,119
You have already developed such deep feelings?

629
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,159
You are clueless.

630
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,639
The length of time does not determine the depth of feeling.

631
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,639
What?

632
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,558
Had that been the case,

633
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,679
something would have happened between you and Dan O long ago.

634
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,159
Did something happen between you and Si Yeol?

635
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,329
You threw away the flowers he gave you.

636
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,119
Dan O.

637
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,960
Why are you picking so many flowers?

638
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,960
I should make a flower palanquin for your wedding day.

639
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,880
This will look pretty.

640
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,239
- How pretty. - Lady Hong Ju!

641
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,159
Lady Hong Ju!

642
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,400
Just because.

643
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,000
I was reminded of that day.

644
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,879
Hong Ju, that was...

645
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,079
What? It was an accident?

646
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:01,719
Yes, I know.

647
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,920
When my husband-to-be was breathing his last,

648
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,159
I was playing with flowers,

649
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,239
leisurely.

650
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,719
What a horrible accident.

651
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:30,078
- Gosh, please... - Please spare us.

652
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,328
- Look here. - Please do not hurt us.

653
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:34,880
- My goodness. - Please spare us.

654
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,288
Please do not kill us.

655
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,359
- This is not fair. - Gosh!

656
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,769
- My goodness. - Please let us go.

657
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,199
Please spare us!

658
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,960
- Please let us go. - Come on!

659
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,840
Why are you taking that child?

660
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,480
He is probably not even ten years old.

661
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,158
His Majesty has ordered us...

662
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,319
to execute everyone who has read "The Secret Records of Samhan."

663
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,719
So? Are you saying you will go ahead and kill that child?

664
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,039
We are simply obeying His Majesty's orders.

665
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,000
Do not make it so obvious, or you will be dragged away too.

666
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:21,639
What?

667
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,239
San was reading that book too.

668
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,440
I bet you told him about the book.

669
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,960
Go home alone. I have somewhere to be.

670
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
My lord.

671
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,280
My apologies for my tardiness.

672
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,960
Let us go.

673
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,480
(Buyounggak)

674
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,280
It was you.

675
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,519
The woman I saw at the temple.

676
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,239
Yes, that is correct.

677
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,639
Are you disappointed?

678
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,360
- A mere kisaeng... - I am just a little surprised.

679
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,679
I always dreamed of a world...

680
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,880
where people like you could have aspirations too.

681
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,279
Is that why you let yourself get involved in something so dangerous?

682
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,880
You are worried about me?

683
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,960
You are involved in it too.

684
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Do not hold any meetings for the time being.

685
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,760
A few scholars were arrested at the shop.

686
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, right.

687
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,960
About your inheritance.

688
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,039
The land you sold was not everything, right?

689
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,280
- How do you know about it? - Keep it intact.

690
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,719
It will become useful later on.

691
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,639
It seems like you know everything about me,

692
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:25,119
for some reason.

693
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,880
We go way back.

694
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,599
Not you.

695
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,320
Your father.

696
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,239
You mean Lord Jung Yoon?

697
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,400
No.

698
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,559
I am talking about your birth father.

699
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,960
It was a long time ago.

700
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,199
Did you say...

701
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:07,760
my birth father?

702
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,239
Yes.

703
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,360
Your birth father left this with me.

704
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,359
It is his will.

705
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,239
(Yuji: A will that expresses a person's dying wishes)

706
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
My lady.

707
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,440
My gosh.

708
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,079
Look, I found this on the floor.

709
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:50,919
Is this yours?

710
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,039
What is it?

711
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:56,880
What is this?

712
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,880
It looks like a very precious object.

713
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,480
It does, does it not?

714
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,519
It looks like...

715
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,799
Oh! Could it be some kind of lid?

716
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,239
Oh, maybe.

717
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,599
So it is yours, Dan O.

718
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,000
Did you not say you had lost it?

719
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:30,239
It looks like a dragon.

720
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,679
It looks very expensive. Where did you get this?

721
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,039
(Pyeong)

722
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,800
There is a dragon engraved on it.

723
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,840
Could this be...

724
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,199
The Crown Prince left it behind for his heir.

725
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,359
(Pyeong)

726
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,320
What is this letter here?

727
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,639
I must go. I am supposed to meet my nanny.

728
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,599
It is dangerous to leave now.

729
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:16,599
The soldiers might still be outside.

730
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,599
Lady Dan O.

731
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,199
Lady Dan O!

732
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,840
Lady Dan O.

733
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,800
Lady Dan O.

734
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:49,800
I thought you left without saying a word.

735
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,760
What is your name?

736
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,639
You are funny.

737
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,159
You are asking for my name just before you leave?

738
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,679
You saved my life.

739
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,280
Hence, I must know your name.

740
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,000
Yoon Dan O. That is my name.

741
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Take it.

742
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,079
One day, I will repay you for your kindness.

743
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,320
What is this?

744
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,400
It is a compass.

745
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,800
While traveling, one uses it to tell cardinal directions.

746
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,360
How can you give this to me...

747
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,000
when you will be the one traveling?

748
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:50,760
It is currently my most prized possession.

749
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,480
That is all I can give you right now.

750
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,519
Do not tell anyone I was here though.

751
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,119
Your family might suffer the consequences.

752
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,519
I blame myself for handing you that.

753
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Do not fret.

754
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But...

755
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:36,479
did you not see who left it?

756
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,000
I am afraid not. It was here when I got back.

757
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,199
Do you remember...

758
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,760
how it was at my father's funeral?

759
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:54,280
Of course I do.

760
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,280
No mourners came by to offer their condolences.

761
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,880
As a young girl, I only thought it was sad.

762
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,800
But as I grew older,

763
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,880
I began to realize how odd it was.

764
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,639
You see,

765
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,360
he passed away during the uprising.

766
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
The uprising?

767
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,519
As in the event that crowned the current King?

768
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:21,279
That is correct.

769
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Your father passed away on the day the deposed heir fled.

770
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,198
The Capital was blocked off due to the search,

771
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,638
and I could not send word to the Yoon Clan...

772
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,079
regarding your father's passing.

773
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:34,559
Then that boy...

774
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:39,839
- Can I get a bowl of gukbab? - Sure.

775
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,959
Get us some more liquor.

776
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Over here.

777
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,079
Maybe I have been working too hard lately.

778
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,679
I am seeing things.

779
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:13,679
Are you hurt?

780
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,320
You seem angry.

781
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,039
I am not.

782
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,320
Did I do something wrong?

783
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,518
Or my coming unannounced...

784
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,519
No.

785
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,280
It is all my fault.

786
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:57,799
I should have listened to you and not searched for Snowflake.

787
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,800
My actions...

788
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,280
endangered everyone at Garden of Flowers.

789
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:06,199
It is all my fault.

790
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,920
Dan O, you are not to blame.

791
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,639
Then whose fault is it?

792
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,759
Is it the Snowflake's...

793
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,960
when he was forced to run following a political war?

794
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,598
Or is...

795
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,880
the watchman to blame when he is willing to give his life...

796
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:24,800
to protect Snowflake?

797
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Dan O...

798
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,880
It was you at the temple.

799
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,960
If you were not the watchman,

800
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,519
you would not have risked your life by showing up.

801
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,238
Why do you not value your life?

802
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,239
Why do you always...

803
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,158
put yourself in harm's way...

804
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:44,760
It was not because I am the watchman.

805
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:49,639
Because...

806
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
it was you.

807
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,599
You were the reason I was there.

808
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,039
Thanks to your care of the Mokinhoe scholars,

809
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,639
everyone is well.

810
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,840
Good. I am relieved.

811
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,599
I am at ease knowing that you are on top of everything.

812
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
My lord,

813
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:40,360
the greater cause you wish to carry out...

814
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,280
Is it perhaps...

815
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,679
a rebellion?

816
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,879
To rectify our nation and the royal family,

817
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,199
we need a force strong enough to stand against the King.

818
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,920
Then there is someone...

819
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,679
you must meet.

820
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,039
Someone I must meet?

821
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
Could he be...

822
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,559
Hey.

823
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Are you home?

824
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:43,119
Where did Dan O go?

825
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,480
She went to work at the tavern.

826
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:50,079
Anyway, she is not home,

827
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,959
so please come back some other time.

828
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,400
But you are the one I am here to see.

829
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
I have never met a woman...

830
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,559
who disliked flowers.

831
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,039
You sure are different.

832
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:06,440
You are not like other ladies.

833
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,760
That is why...

834
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,239
I have come...

835
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,719
to develop feelings for you.

836
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,679
Who does he think he is?

837
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Do you not like me?

838
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,199
I do not like you at all.

839
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,800
Could one still ask that you do not become a Buddhist nun?

840
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:36,639
What...

841
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,239
What could he possibly want with me?

842
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,920
He is already here,

843
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,519
so ask him yourself.

844
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,960
First Vice-premier Sin, I hear you are one of...

845
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,960
His Majesty's most trusted and loyal subjects.

846
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,279
May I ask why you have been aiding Mokinhoe?

847
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,760
I only serve one entity...

848
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,199
and that is this nation.

849
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,760
It is now my turn to ask you this.

850
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,199
What is the reason you joined Mokinhoe?

851
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:14,559
Do you wish to take the throne and rule over the world?

852
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,480
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

853
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:53,199
I am terrified of the chaos that will be caused...

854
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:54,719
by His Majesty's madness.

855
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,279
A world where the poor and the lowly...

856
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,159
can also aspire and reach their goals.

857
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,198
I will make it happen for you.

858
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:02,319
Having the nation governed by a proper monarch.

859
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,439
That is my duty as Queen Dowager.

860
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,319
Letting her be...

861
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,999
is how we can catch Lee Seol and the watchman.

862
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,158
I cannot keep ruining her life.

863
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:13,159
What about your life though?

864
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,518
Take good care of Dan O.

865
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:16,359
I will always be there to protect her.

866
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,959
It seems as though Dan O was taken.

867
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,079
You must truly have found Snowflake.
