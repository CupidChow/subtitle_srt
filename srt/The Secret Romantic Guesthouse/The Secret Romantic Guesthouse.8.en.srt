(Episode 8)

9
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:54,636
It is now my turn to ask you this.

10
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:57,875
What is the reason you joined Mokinhoe?

11
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:01,036
Please tell me.

12
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,835
Do you wish to take the throne and rule over the world?

13
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:07,076
Would I dare wish to take the throne?

14
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:09,956
I never thought or dreamed of that.

15
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:14,036
So do not try to use me in your political strife.

16
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,316
May I not use you?

17
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,805
In return, you can use me freely.

18
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:25,795
A world where the poor and the lowly...

19
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,596
can also aspire and reach their goals.

20
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,676
Is that not the world Mokinhoe aims for?

21
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:34,075
I will make it happen for you.

22
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:39,555
There is one very rough but very quick shortcut.

23
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,396
That is the throne.

24
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:51,156
Innkeeper Yoon. How have you been?

25
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,756
Master Jang wishes to see you.

26
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,355
(Liquor)

27
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:06,355
Come quietly.

28
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,315
It was a pleasure...

29
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:29,206
having you to chat with.

30
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,076
Since I became a ghost,

31
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,516
I never talked with anyone other than family.

32
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:39,875
You must have been so lonely.

33
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:43,595
Dan O was always fearful for me.

34
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,875
For fear Master Jang would realize I was alive,

35
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,236
she hid me in the annex.

36
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,396
Is that why...

37
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,435
you will go to a temple?

38
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,676
Yes.

39
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:59,636
I cannot keep ruining her life.

40
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,315
What about your life though?

41
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,396
Having to spend the rest of it hiding in a temple.

42
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,435
Is that not pitiful?

43
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:23,076
(Liquor)

44
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,315
Hello.

45
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:29,396
I am here to see Lady Dan O.

46
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,476
I heard she worked here.

47
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,076
Do you know her?

48
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:37,396
My gosh. She is in danger.

49
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:44,676
San! Kang San!

50
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,236
Jung Yu Ha!

51
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,275
Are you all asleep?

52
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:54,554
Why are you making such a fuss in the middle of the night?

53
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,715
Yuk Ho. It seems as though Dan O was taken.

54
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,034
I went to the tavern to see her.

55
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:01,594
Men from the Capital District Office...

56
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:04,155
The Capital District Office? Is it Master Jang again?

57
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:06,755
What did you say?

58
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,435
This was found on you.

59
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,166
What is it?

60
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:37,635
A compass.

61
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,395
I heard it was useful on the road,

62
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,435
so I got it at a shop.

63
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,875
You must think I am stupid.

64
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,476
This is not a cheap marketplace item.

65
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,476
Pyeong, the name of a jade.

66
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,755
It is a special name only one person can use.

67
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:01,676
Lee Pyeong.

68
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,846
This belonged to the deposed crown prince.

69
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,726
How do the likes of you have it?

70
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,476
You must...

71
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,236
truly have found Snowflake.

72
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:30,796
Did you dare to toy with me?

73
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,395
Even if I told the truth,

74
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:38,875
you would not believe me.

75
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,395
You are already full of doubt.

76
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,755
Just kill me.

77
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:49,635
You would rather die?

78
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,596
Does Snowflake mean that much to you?

79
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,796
You will not...

80
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:57,315
believe what I say.

81
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,395
Then I will make you...

82
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,955
say something I will believe.

83
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,276
I will behead you...

84
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,476
and hang it for all to see for high treason.

85
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,194
Why are you all out here?

86
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:26,955
Why are you back so late? Something bad happened.

87
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,116
San. Try not to get too upset.

88
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:34,075
Dan O...

89
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,036
was taken.

90
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:52,195
We met...

91
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,435
as children.

92
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,395
I want the details.

93
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,035
If you try to trick me...

94
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,156
It was more than ten years ago,

95
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,635
on the night of my father's funeral.

96
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,555
Young Lee Seol hid in Garden of Flowers,

97
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,075
and I lied for him.

98
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,276
The compass...

99
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,555
was a token of his gratitude.

100
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,555
The day of Yoon Won's funeral...

101
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:20,195
It is the day...

102
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:23,916
the crown prince died and Lee Seol escaped.

103
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:26,755
If what you say is true,

104
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,116
Snowflake owes you his life.

105
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:34,036
Too much time has passed to say he owes me anything.

106
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:38,955
Then who was the man at the temple?

107
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,395
Was it Lee Seol?

108
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,356
I do not know.

109
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,995
I have never seen Snowflake since that day.

110
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:03,435
If I had found him, why would I keep him from you?

111
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,276
Who knows?

112
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:09,435
If you met him as a child, you might feel pity for him.

113
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:11,955
I am not stupid enough to hide a traitor.

114
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,314
Would I endanger myself...

115
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,036
for someone I met as a child?

116
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,635
Why are you here?

117
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,195
Halt!

118
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,315
Let him be.

119
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,634
You are Lord Jung Yoon's low-born son.

120
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,356
Why would the Capital District Office...

121
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,716
take a young woman?

122
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:45,674
If it were to get out...

123
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,635
This is too big an issue for you to get involved.

124
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,635
Return home.

125
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:51,635
I must get involved.

126
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,476
You took Garden of Flowers.

127
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,326
Is there still more you want?

128
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:09,206
You seem to care deeply for Dan O.

129
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:13,076
Seeing you rushed over, pale as a sheet.

130
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,835
Now I remember, you were at the temple too.

131
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:20,275
I will pay her debt. Release Dan O.

132
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:28,755
All this started with 100 nyang of silver.

133
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,275
I feel terrible.

134
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:15,076
It is a lot of money.

135
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,565
You gave it to Master Jang because of me.

136
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,755
Do not say that.

137
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:20,675
I did it for my own peace of mind.

138
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:22,675
Come.

139
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,755
I did not think you would release her so easily.

140
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:43,235
On top of that, you have handed over Garden of Flowers too.

141
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,875
Thanks to it, we now have our bait in the palm of our hands.

142
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,236
Letting her be...

143
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:52,476
is how we can catch Lee Seol and the watchman.

144
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:57,206
If Yoon Dan O saved Lee Seol's life,

145
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,836
he will surely show up again.

146
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,436
My gosh.

147
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,514
You were with Young Master Jung.

148
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:11,995
Gosh, thank you.

149
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:14,675
Where is Hong Ju?

150
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,076
She is in her room.

151
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,196
She could not sleep a wink.

152
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,316
She waited for you all night.

153
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,675
What took you so long?

154
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,556
I was waiting for you.

155
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,395
I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left.

156
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:35,155
Hong Ju.

157
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:38,915
Here, take this.

158
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:42,436
Come on.

159
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,356
I wanted to give it to you on your wedding day.

160
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,196
Hong Ju, wait.

161
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,635
You know,

162
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,316
we can now return to Garden of Flowers.

163
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,836
Yu Ha paid off the debt for us.

164
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,236
What a relief.

165
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,035
But you see,

166
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,316
nothing will change even if I go back.

167
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:24,875
I will keep living as a ghost.

168
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,076
I will be off, then.

169
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:34,356
Ms. Naju.

170
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:36,995
Please take good care of Dan O.

171
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,356
My gosh. I will.

172
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,356
You may go do your thing.

173
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,035
Please allow me to pour you one.

174
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,915
Take good care of him.

175
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:37,836
Then please excuse me.

176
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,236
There is something...

177
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:57,915
I need you to do in secret.

178
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:00,356
I will do anything. Please go ahead and tell me, my lord.

179
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:04,076
I need you to befriend Yoon Dan O.

180
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:18,395
My gosh. Those scoundrels at Buyounggak.

181
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:21,395
When did they take down the sign?

182
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,754
Yuk Ho, we are here.

183
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,155
My gosh, you are back.

184
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:32,995
Welcome back, Ms. Naju.

185
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,556
I truly missed your food.

186
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:37,475
Truly?

187
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,155
You have been eating so well.

188
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,795
You said the cooks at Buyounggak were incredibly talented.

189
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,395
Right, I bet.

190
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:47,755
You look like you have gained some weight.

191
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:50,836
This brat.

192
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,795
I suppose his lips have gotten chubby.

193
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,356
San is training.

194
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:01,915
I figured you would be curious.

195
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,316
Oh, I see.

196
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:07,675
Yu Ha.

197
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:09,436
Can we talk?

198
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:10,915
Yes, sure.

199
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:20,675
Well...

200
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:23,755
Did Lady Hong Ju decide not to return?

201
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:27,236
Yes. She is more stubborn than I thought.

202
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,515
She can get married.

203
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,596
She has someone by her side, yet we were looking in faraway places.

204
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,476
Lady Dan O?

205
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:44,556
It was part of the inheritance I received when my mother passed away.

206
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:47,076
I wished to do something good with it.

207
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,356
Anyway,

208
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,436
must you insist on paying me back?

209
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,915
Yes. I will pay you back, little by little.

210
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:55,874
With the rent...

211
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,555
and my pay from the tavern...

212
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,155
A hundred nyang of silver? It will take forever.

213
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,875
I may not be able to pay back a large amount at a time,

214
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,596
but eventually...

215
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:06,995
Sure.

216
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:09,675
You may pay me back little by little.

217
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,155
From time to time, whenever you can.

218
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:14,476
Whenever I can?

219
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:18,795
If I am lucky, I will get to see you twice a day.

220
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:42,556
When did you get here?

221
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,236
Why did you not say anything?

222
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,395
Why are you holding a real sword again?

223
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:50,236
What kind of dangerous task are you involved in?

224
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:22,955
Sit down.

225
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,286
You must be exhausted.

226
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,006
I am fine.

227
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,076
I bet...

228
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,766
you were very worried last night too.

229
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,286
- Because of me. - Worried?

230
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:41,155
Why would I be worried?

231
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,526
What?

232
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,076
Anyway, what are you doing here?

233
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,556
Can you be walking around in Hanyang now?

234
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,766
Well...

235
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,235
the thing is...

236
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,395
I have returned to Garden of Flowers.

237
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:54,915
That is good news.

238
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,875
But what will you do about Master Jang?

239
00:17:58,356 --> 00:17:59,635
It has all been sorted out,

240
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:02,395
thanks to Yu Ha's help.

241
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:03,675
Is that so?

242
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:06,915
I suppose Yu Ha helped you out a lot.

243
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,155
Do not worry.

244
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,596
I did not say anything about the watchman.

245
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:15,076
Do you still believe that I am the watchman?

246
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,475
You said the watchman...

247
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:30,356
was a shadow warrior that protected Lee Seol.

248
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,116
Stop being a shadow.

249
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:41,874
Can you not just be Kang San,

250
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,556
the scholar who is preparing for the military exam?

251
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:45,766
Forget Lee Seol.

252
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,395
Can you not protect yourself?

253
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:53,526
I will.

254
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,526
I am trying.

255
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,006
Believe me, I am.

256
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,116
Do not just try. Do your best.

257
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,555
- If you do not keep your word... - Then what?

258
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:06,796
I will resent you.

259
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,875
Until those bamboos flower.

260
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,675
You will think of me for that long?

261
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:20,006
It will take about 100 years for the bamboos to flower.

262
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:24,076
Do not laugh. I truly mean it.

263
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:29,526
When the right time comes,

264
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:32,526
I will tell you everything.

265
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,395
I will not hide anything from you.

266
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:37,395
You will hear everything.

267
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,076
That day will probably never come.

268
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:44,006
The day I pass the exam and receive the flower hat,

269
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,526
I shall return and tell you everything.

270
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,076
You see, passing the exam will not be that easy.

271
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,076
You are very arrogant.

272
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,596
It is certainly easier than clearing up your suspicions.

273
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,635
Oh, Ban Ya.

274
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,035
Why are you...

275
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,316
coming out of my room?

276
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:14,235
This was where I was staying...

277
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:15,836
during your absence.

278
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,355
I came by to collect my belongings.

279
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,475
I see.

280
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,155
- Do you have everything? - Yes.

281
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:25,006
I apologize for my unwilling intrusion.

282
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:27,005
That is preposterous.

283
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:28,475
I, for one, am happy to see you again.

284
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,076
I appreciate you saying so.

285
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,006
You can address me more casually.

286
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:37,076
Did we not agree to be friends should we meet again?

287
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,475
I could not possibly do that.

288
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:41,555
Not when I lack social status.

289
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,155
There is not much to friendship.

290
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:46,596
Chatting with one another and enjoying drinks...

291
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:47,875
make you friends.

292
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:49,596
Chatting and drinking?

293
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:54,316
That is something...

294
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:56,356
I would enjoy.

295
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,356
Visit Garden of Flowers often.

296
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:02,674
Are you sure?

297
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,915
Of course. You will always be welcome.

298
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:18,796
Your Majesty, I had a question to ask.

299
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:20,006
Ask away.

300
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,556
It is about the watchman.

301
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:26,195
Rumor has it that Queen Dowager funds the organization.

302
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,006
Is that true?

303
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,766
It is.

304
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:33,005
Why are you not putting a stop to it?

305
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,835
Some time ago,

306
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,955
I threatened Queen Dowager to reveal the watchman's identity.

307
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:40,315
As a response, she bit her tongue...

308
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,635
and tried to kill herself.

309
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,766
There was an uproar in the royal court.

310
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:49,475
I question Court Lady Kim of the Queen Dowager's chambers.

311
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:52,475
She has been leaving the palace...

312
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:54,915
quite often.

313
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:57,836
Court Lady Kim?

314
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:04,076
(Garden of Flowers)

315
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,435
Why is Yuk Ho not coming with us?

316
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,235
He must also need paper for the state exam.

317
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:12,316
He is not feeling well.

318
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,915
Anxiety eats him alive as the exam date approaches.

319
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,155
Is that so?

320
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:19,076
I knew there was a reason behind him failing his exams.

321
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,276
Hold on.

322
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,474
I see you hung the sign back up.

323
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,875
(Garden of Flowers)

324
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:30,836
How sweet of you.

325
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,195
You always go the extra mile for me.

326
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:35,516
What?

327
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,996
Let us go.

328
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:40,796
Him and his temper.

329
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:42,996
Let us go before he yells again.

330
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,395
The market is not bustling as usual.

331
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:55,675
I saw a new side of Yu Ha.

332
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:57,675
What do you mean?

333
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,516
He bought back the inn by paying off her entire debt.

334
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,315
Look at him.

335
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,955
He picked up that expensive yugwa as if it cost nothing.

336
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:09,516
The fortune he has is something we cannot challenge.

337
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,316
What a bummer.

338
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:13,116
If I were a woman,

339
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:14,516
Dan O and I would have fought over the same man.

340
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,515
Would that not have been fun?

341
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:17,756
Fun, my foot.

342
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:21,875
Yuk Ho and Ms. Naju have been frantically trying...

343
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,235
to get those two together.

344
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:27,355
I bet you they are already planning their wedding.

345
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:29,235
What? That is absurd.

346
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,276
Goodness.

347
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:32,915
That glare of yours could even burn wood.

348
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,036
Are you that against it?

349
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:38,234
Have some. Yu Ha bought them...

350
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:39,915
I absolutely hate it.

351
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,316
- Sorry? - What?

352
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,996
Do not eat if you do not want to.

353
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:50,796
You have been angry all day.

354
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,395
Tell me about it. What could be the matter with San?

355
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,795
Is it because he is bitter?

356
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,235
Sweets are a good remedy for that.

357
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,715
- Would you like a bite? - Shut it, will you?

358
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:06,516
What is going on?

359
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,155
What is it?

360
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:11,556
Let us see.

361
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:16,395
Goodness me!

362
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:20,035
What did they do to warrant an execution?

363
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:22,195
I heard they possessed a forbidden book.

364
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:24,356
My goodness.

365
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,076
I revised it like this. What do you think?

366
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:29,356
It should be fine.

367
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:33,835
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

368
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:34,915
All right!

369
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:36,954
My gosh, I cannot look.

370
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:38,996
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

371
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:53,915
His poor soul.

372
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,395
We should leave.

373
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,796
Come on.

374
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:04,955
(Garden of Flowers)

375
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:10,556
Do you still have it?

376
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:12,795
- Have what? - That book.

377
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:14,634
What if I still have it?

378
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:15,796
You saw what happened...

379
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,914
to those who possessed it.

380
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:18,996
I saw something all right.

381
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,155
A nation being clouded with lunacy.

382
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,316
That is why...

383
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,395
you should be careful not to get swept up in it.

384
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:40,395
His body has been taken care of.

385
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:44,475
Once the weather clears, we will rebury him someplace sunny.

386
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,955
When we do,

387
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:49,556
he will be able to have his belated funeral.

388
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,596
I highly appreciate it.

389
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:54,875
Thank you so much.

390
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,715
This is absolute madness.

391
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,195
Is he trying to paint all the people as traitors?

392
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:07,675
I am terrified of the chaos that will be caused...

393
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,155
by His Majesty's madness.

394
00:26:17,796 --> 00:26:19,235
You wish for me to take the throne?

395
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:22,835
You are also responsible...

396
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,756
for the chaos the nation is currently facing.

397
00:26:26,556 --> 00:26:28,474
I am clearly to blame...

398
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,076
for condoning an unrighteous monarch.

399
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:32,674
However, I cannot stand idly by...

400
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,076
and let our atrocious monarch ruin this nation.

401
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,195
What do you mean by that?

402
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,556
The child Royal Noble Consort Park gave birth to...

403
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,836
is not of His Majesty's blood,

404
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:45,555
and his not being the rightful heir...

405
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:47,675
will result in the discontinuation of the bloodline.

406
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:50,075
When the royal court finds out...

407
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,756
The royal family and the nation will be in despair.

408
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,874
But how does that lead to my taking the throne?

409
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,194
One born of royal blood should take his rightful position.

410
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:00,316
Moreover,

411
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,155
you have people who trust and follow you.

412
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,714
The people of Mokinhoe are unaware of my identity.

413
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:07,395
They will soon find out.

414
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:08,796
And they...

415
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,996
will clear your path to the throne.

416
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,516
I urge you to serve the noble cause.

417
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:25,036
The noble cause?

418
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:42,875
San, have you not seen Bok Sil?

419
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,755
I have not seen him for a few days.

420
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:46,836
I see you did not know.

421
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:49,315
Bok Sil also ran off in the middle of the night.

422
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:50,316
Just like you.

423
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:53,155
What? Bok Sil ran away?

424
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,835
But he has nowhere to go.

425
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,635
Maybe he is having an affair.

426
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:00,875
He and the dog next door have been enjoying their walks...

427
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:02,195
just like someone I know.

428
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:05,395
You just do not care, do you?

429
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:09,116
Never are you worried when someone goes missing.

430
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:25,356
Well...

431
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:30,635
I heard it was you who hung up the sign outside.

432
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:34,036
Why did you not tell me...

433
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:35,796
and let me believe otherwise?

434
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:40,356
It did not seem right for an inn not to have a sign.

435
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:47,756
By the way,

436
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:51,796
about Snowflake...

437
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:57,516
You have seen him, have you not?

438
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:58,836
What?

439
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,635
When you do see him, please relay a message for me.

440
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:07,915
Tell him that I apologize for not keeping our secret.

441
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,076
A secret?

442
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,356
You see,

443
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,356
Snowflake once came by Garden of Flowers.

444
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:26,356
Did he?

445
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,915
Back when we were young.

446
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,955
He was curled up and shuddering in that dog house...

447
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:39,195
afraid of being caught any time soon.

448
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,356
Then,

449
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:49,955
you were the one who saved his life.

450
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,756
I was the one who received comfort though.

451
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,276
On the day my father died,

452
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,235
Snowflake helped me endure the pain and sorrow.

453
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:06,675
It is why I feel terrible for losing the compass.

454
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,556
The compass?

455
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,116
Snowflake said...

456
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,875
he would give me his most prized possession.

457
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:22,516
I bet it was out of gratitude for saving his life.

458
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:25,915
I did not know then,

459
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,316
but I do now.

460
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:32,996
To an orphaned child, an heirloom...

461
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:35,996
means the whole world.

462
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,435
And he gave me his whole world.

463
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,155
That was a valuable thing,

464
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,036
and I lost it to Master Jang.

465
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:50,076
You did well.

466
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,715
That is what he will think.

467
00:30:58,395 --> 00:31:00,556
That is what Snowflake would have wanted.

468
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,116
I wondered sometimes.

469
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:09,316
Now that he must be a grown adult,

470
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,635
what would he have grown up to be?

471
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:14,316
What do you think?

472
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,915
Even as a child, he had strong features.

473
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,395
If he kept those as he grew up,

474
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,276
he would be quite pretty...

475
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:27,715
Oh...

476
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:30,516
Do not tell him that.

477
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,036
I can be so silly.

478
00:32:04,195 --> 00:32:07,356
You must have informed Lord Sin who I am.

479
00:32:08,836 --> 00:32:11,955
You passed me the Crown Prince's will.

480
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,516
If your identity becomes known,

481
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:17,036
your life will be threatened.

482
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:19,675
For your own safety,

483
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,596
you must take the throne.

484
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:25,195
I cannot usurp the throne for my own safety.

485
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:27,155
You grew up...

486
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:30,796
leading a sorrowful life among the public.

487
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,996
I believe in that sorrow.

488
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,036
You are...

489
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:40,316
the only one who can comfort the sorrows of the people.

490
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:43,596
When we next meet,

491
00:32:44,955 --> 00:32:46,516
bring your heirloom.

492
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:48,076
The heirloom?

493
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,076
The proof of your bloodline...

494
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:53,516
the Crown Prince left you.

495
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:02,915
How have you been?

496
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:05,475
What...

497
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:07,796
are you doing here?

498
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:09,875
Are you turning me away as soon as I arrive?

499
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,755
- Let me... - Men are banned.

500
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,756
You must leave.

501
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:16,915
Oh, dear.

502
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:19,275
I have never climbed such a rough mountain.

503
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:20,836
It took its toll on my ankles.

504
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,235
I cannot leave in this state.

505
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,076
Did you sprain it?

506
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,474
Stand up.

507
00:33:27,475 --> 00:33:29,875
No, I cannot. I just cannot stand.

508
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,195
It hurts.

509
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:34,036
Then for a while...

510
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:42,715
It hurts bad.

511
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:44,675
Can you help me?

512
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,195
Use this.

513
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,315
You are in pain, and yet you are smiling?

514
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:25,996
That outfit does not suit you.

515
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:29,956
You are no longer in pain.

516
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,956
Eat this and then leave.

517
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:33,076
But...

518
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,405
No.

519
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,795
I have no energy to lift a spoon.

520
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:41,516
I must lie down and rest.

521
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:44,556
Scholar Kim.

522
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:46,476
Think about it.

523
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:49,154
If I were to hike the mountain alone,

524
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:50,595
with a sore ankle, only to meet...

525
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:51,714
a pack of wolves...

526
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,885
Oh, no way.

527
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,445
You speak your way out of anything.

528
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,925
I do not want to imagine that.

529
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,596
How could I put you through such sadness?

530
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,275
You can rest a while.

531
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:08,076
A very short while.

532
00:35:08,596 --> 00:35:09,596
Okay.

533
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,235
She has no fear.

534
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,076
She came here to make some money?

535
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,516
What if she gets taken again?

536
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:52,956
Is that true?

537
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:56,714
Ban Ya spent her first night with a man from Garden of Flowers?

538
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:58,635
Yes, apparently.

539
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:00,795
What was his name?

540
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:02,925
Kang San, was it?

541
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:05,155
No way.

542
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,755
How could Young Master Kang sleep with Ban Ya?

543
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:12,795
I would live to see the body of such a handsome man.

544
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,445
It would be dreamy.

545
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:18,445
Are you back in Hanyang?

546
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,634
I heard you lost everything and got kicked out.

547
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:21,635
I am back now,

548
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:23,885
and I will not leave again.

549
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:26,155
What was that about?

550
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:27,715
See you.

551
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:41,996
Are you here this early in the day to drink?

552
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,076
I am waiting for someone.

553
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,076
Whether it be day or night, do visit.

554
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,235
I will be the first to serve you.

555
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:56,795
The truth is,

556
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,635
the other kisaeng know...

557
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:02,925
I spent my first night with you.

558
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,475
But they look down on me because you gave me nothing.

559
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,075
(Jeondu: Money or item given to praise a kisaeng)

560
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,476
You want something of mine?

561
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,635
It can be something meaningless.

562
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,516
Anything that you have on you.

563
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,195
Buy some new clothes.

564
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:29,076
Thank you.

565
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:35,076
So, what is your real name?

566
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:36,925
Ban Ya is your kisaeng name.

567
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:41,835
It is Im Seo Yeon.

568
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:45,355
Seo Yeon.

569
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,315
Your father named you well.

570
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:53,355
I will regain my nobility and my name as well.

571
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,036
That is my only wish.

572
00:37:57,556 --> 00:37:59,195
You will get what you want.

573
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:09,675
Young master.

574
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:12,834
Soo Hyang will pour you a drink.

575
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:13,835
Leave it.

576
00:38:15,036 --> 00:38:16,036
You there.

577
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,405
Yes.

578
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:19,795
Pour me a drink.

579
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:23,076
Did you...

580
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:26,075
say that to me?

581
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:27,076
Yes.

582
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:30,235
You are prettier than most kisaeng.

583
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:32,195
If cleaning is hard work,

584
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:34,036
shall I spend a night with you?

585
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:36,596
Young master.

586
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:38,675
She does not look it,

587
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:41,476
but she is of noble birth.

588
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:44,036
She is not of low birth?

589
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:47,036
You must be teasing us both.

590
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,835
Pour me a drink.

591
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:54,195
I will pay you handsomely for it.

592
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:55,925
Young lady.

593
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:04,996
Will one cup be enough?

594
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:06,835
Fill it up.

595
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:14,834
Are you out of your mind? What was that about?

596
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,235
I do not need your money, but you need to change.

597
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:21,155
You look like a baby that just wet himself.

598
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,996
I would say you lost.

599
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,675
You darn wench, you dare...

600
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:33,755
Who are you?

601
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,596
Are you her pimp?

602
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,195
Get lost. If I see you here again,

603
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:45,795
I will crush your useless head in.

604
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:47,076
Let go of me.

605
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,275
Let me see. Are you all right?

606
00:39:55,996 --> 00:39:57,076
San, behind you!

607
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,155
Get out of my way!

608
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,036
Oh, boy.

609
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,556
I heard you were badly hurt.

610
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:32,116
Please take good care of him.

611
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:35,036
He practices martial arts, so his body is his greatest asset.

612
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:38,275
Take your clothes off so that I can have a look.

613
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:48,925
What are you waiting for? He has to see your wounds to treat you.

614
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:50,996
So? You want to see it too?

615
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,194
- All right, then I shall... - No!

616
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,675
I will wait outside.

617
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,235
Do not worry.

618
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:06,476
Nothing is broken, so I will recover in no time.

619
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:08,755
Then I am relieved.

620
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,445
Why did you show up at Buyounggak and meddle in others' business?

621
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:14,996
"Others' business?"

622
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:17,884
You are suddenly talking as though we are strangers.

623
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:20,475
Oh, I see. You were not there to protect anyone.

624
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,834
You just wanted to have fun with your lady friends in broad daylight.

625
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:26,075
"Lady friends?" What in the world are you talking about?

626
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:28,885
Hold on. Your exam is tomorrow, is it not?

627
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,555
You wanted to spend time with the ladies the day before your exam?

628
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,635
How will you pass the exam?

629
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,755
The promise you made...

630
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,195
You must have forgotten it already.

631
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:44,235
Seriously, what are you talking about?

632
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:47,795
Do not be so cryptic. Elaborate so that I can understand.

633
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:53,076
Ban Ya...

634
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:57,155
I heard you were her first man.

635
00:41:59,076 --> 00:42:01,355
The kisaengs were talking about it. I heard everything.

636
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:02,715
What?

637
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,076
All I did was rescue her when she was in danger.

638
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:11,076
Then...

639
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:14,445
- what I heard earlier... - It is not true.

640
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:18,445
Do not worry.

641
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:22,444
I may not be able to buy you yugwa, but I will be sure to keep my word.

642
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:25,234
Yugwa? How random.

643
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:27,755
I will not fail the exam just because I hurt one arm.

644
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:32,235
I did not mean that you had to keep your promise right away.

645
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,834
When your shoulder is better...

646
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:38,404
Forget it. Someone splurged his silver coins to help you.

647
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:39,956
I could certainly use my flower hat.

648
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,405
Did he leave already?

649
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:02,516
Without saying goodbye?

650
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:20,275
What is all that?

651
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:22,556
Garden of Flowers.

652
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,155
I figured you would miss it.

653
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,516
I do not wish to return to Garden of Flowers.

654
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:34,996
You are very decisive.

655
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:37,235
You take after Dan O.

656
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,885
Dan O takes after me.

657
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:46,036
The sun will set soon. You should get going.

658
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,635
And do not come back here.

659
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:50,036
Fine.

660
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:53,195
You are kicking me out, so I shall leave.

661
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:04,436
Everyone is waiting for you.

662
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:06,795
Dan O,

663
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:10,436
Ms. Naju, and Yuk Ho too.

664
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:17,715
So...

665
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:20,355
if you change your mind,

666
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:22,835
come back anytime.

667
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,195
(Onyang Temporary Palace)

668
00:44:55,036 --> 00:44:58,076
Judging by how you are staying here,

669
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:01,996
I assume you are not feeling well at the moment.

670
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:04,076
How could I be in good health?

671
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:08,355
I lost two of my sons.

672
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:12,516
I could not stop my son from slaying his own brother before my eyes.

673
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,235
I am a horrible mother.

674
00:45:16,315 --> 00:45:18,996
Please do not say such a terrible thing,

675
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:21,116
Your Highness.

676
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:24,436
Is there something Your Highness would like this retired eunuch...

677
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:29,235
to take care of, in secret?

678
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:32,155
I suppose you have managed...

679
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,036
to survive all these years for you are incredibly quick-witted.

680
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:40,795
However, I no longer belong to the eunuch bureau.

681
00:45:41,315 --> 00:45:43,396
Your Highness' commands are not enough...

682
00:45:44,195 --> 00:45:45,916
to put me to work.

683
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,596
You will be compensated well.

684
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:53,876
I may be a failed mother,

685
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:57,476
but I will not be a failed queen dowager.

686
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:02,596
My son, Chang, will not stay on the throne for a long time.

687
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:05,755
Filling the vacancy left by a tyrant...

688
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,835
with a sage king.

689
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:13,315
That is my duty as Queen Dowager.

690
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:31,516
I hear you are still refusing to talk.

691
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:36,195
You are extremely stubborn, like my mother.

692
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:41,275
Say it, or you will die.

693
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:43,996
I even killed my own flesh and blood.

694
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,916
Slaying you would be a piece of cake.

695
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:48,675
I do not know.

696
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,396
I cannot tell you anything.

697
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:56,076
I cannot endanger the royal court...

698
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:20,835
(Garden of Flowers)

699
00:47:26,795 --> 00:47:28,556
I wish we had the state exam every day.

700
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:31,996
We can enjoy this feast only one day a year? It is such a shame.

701
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:35,355
Thank you for waking up so early to make all the food.

702
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,834
We will surely enjoy this.

703
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:37,955
Yes, Yuk Ho.

704
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,635
Enjoy the food, and good luck on your exam.

705
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:47,635
Why did you make chicken porridge?

706
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:49,436
What if the porridge brings bad luck?

707
00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:51,555
Goodness. That is a mere superstition.

708
00:47:51,556 --> 00:47:54,355
You must eat easily digestible food to do well on the exam.

709
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,155
Goodness me, Ms. Naju.

710
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:07,635
All bow to His Majesty!

711
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:22,155
We will now begin.

712
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:26,355
Yoon Gu Nam, get ready.

713
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:30,076
If we do one person at a time, this will take forever.

714
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:34,355
We should split them into teams and let them have group matches.

715
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:37,755
Your Majesty. If we do that without proper preparations,

716
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,834
many of them will get hurt.

717
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:43,075
Warriors who will lead this nation should not be so weak.

718
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:44,235
However...

719
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,396
I hate boring fights.

720
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:52,835
Do not play it safe.

721
00:48:52,956 --> 00:48:54,235
Those who lose...

722
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,596
will fail the exam.

723
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,995
Those who lose will fail the exam?

724
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:02,476
So we must tussle and fight?

725
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:06,075
I was excited when I heard His Majesty would be here.

726
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,355
Darn it. I did not see this coming.

727
00:49:13,436 --> 00:49:14,795
Good luck on your exam.

728
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:16,795
How about you win first place?

729
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,116
I will do my best.

730
00:49:19,195 --> 00:49:20,996
Thank you for making all the food.

731
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:23,195
You must be tired. Get some rest.

732
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:24,436
Okay.

733
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,315
Oh, my. You make that taffy look so appetizing.

734
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:30,675
You are playing favorites.

735
00:49:31,155 --> 00:49:32,794
So I can just enjoy the taffy...

736
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:34,395
while Yu Ha wins first place?

737
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,916
Do not be a disgrace to Garden of Flowers.

738
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:40,516
Everyone must pass the exam. You know that, right?

739
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,476
Here is what I think.

740
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:46,274
If a handsome man like me is smart too, that is not fair.

741
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,555
Try and pass the exam. Then we will talk about it.

742
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:50,835
Wake up, Dan O.

743
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:53,275
It is impossible for all of us to pass the exam.

744
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:00,755
Oh, dear.

745
00:50:02,596 --> 00:50:03,876
Here.

746
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:07,235
Relax. You have done this many times.

747
00:50:08,076 --> 00:50:10,436
I am not nervous.

748
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:11,794
I am fine.

749
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:13,516
I am totally fine.

750
00:50:14,195 --> 00:50:15,556
Spare a moment.

751
00:50:17,116 --> 00:50:18,634
If you fail the exam again,

752
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:20,635
the porridge would have been for nothing.

753
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:24,154
Ms. Naju, must you speak of such bad luck?

754
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,715
If you do not pass yet again,

755
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:29,075
I will be the one to blame for making the porridge,

756
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:31,195
so do not put any pressure on yourself.

757
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:33,076
All right.

758
00:50:33,956 --> 00:50:36,476
This time around, I will,

759
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:39,674
by all means, pass the exam.

760
00:50:39,675 --> 00:50:43,075
Stop talking for a moment and repeat after me.

761
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,235
Inhale.

762
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:45,635
Exhale.

763
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,995
I will see the scholars off...

764
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:58,595
and buy groceries on my way back.

765
00:50:58,596 --> 00:50:59,596
Sure, go ahead.

766
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:01,235
- We will get going. - Have a good one.

767
00:51:01,235 --> 00:51:02,235
We will head out.

768
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:03,235
- Off we go. - Shall we?

769
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:22,235
I wonder if he is doing well on his exam.

770
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:25,076
He should take it easy.

771
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:28,476
("Book of Documents")

772
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:36,876
("The Secret Records of Samhan")

773
00:51:37,516 --> 00:51:38,675
"The Secret Records of Samhan"?

774
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:41,715
Why is this here?

775
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,675
Possessing it alone could bring him trouble.

776
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:52,556
("The Secret Records of Samhan")

777
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:37,635
Move.

778
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,275
Catch!

779
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:49,675
Goal!

780
00:54:58,076 --> 00:54:59,155
Lift up your chin.

781
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,355
You do not seem well.

782
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,835
Are you injured?

783
00:55:07,315 --> 00:55:08,835
It is only a minor injury...

784
00:55:09,355 --> 00:55:10,755
and of no concern.

785
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,396
You managed to relieve my boredom.

786
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:33,835
For that, I will grant your request.

787
00:55:34,436 --> 00:55:35,835
Is there something you wish for?

788
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:37,876
There is.

789
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:40,436
May I dare to speak of it?

790
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:42,195
You may.

791
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,076
I wish...

792
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,396
to serve you in close proximity.

793
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:55,916
As a member of the Palace Guards?

794
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:59,275
Could there be a greater honor for a swordsman?

795
00:56:01,476 --> 00:56:03,476
I will serve you with sincerity.

796
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:52,956
You finished...

797
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,155
in first place.

798
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:00,715
Well...

799
00:57:02,195 --> 00:57:03,315
What did I tell you?

800
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:05,516
Someone with my talent cannot fail the exam.

801
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:07,076
Of course.

802
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,076
I knew you would pass.

803
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,956
You do not seem well.

804
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,396
Did you strain your shoulder?

805
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:21,275
I am all right.

806
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:23,996
Thankfully, the exam was not challenging.

807
00:57:30,635 --> 00:57:32,876
The other scholars are still taking the exam,

808
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:35,235
and Ms. Naju is out buying groceries.

809
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:36,436
I see.

810
00:57:37,315 --> 00:57:38,715
No wonder it was quiet around here.

811
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:43,916
Right now,

812
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:47,835
we are the only ones...

813
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,235
who are here.

814
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:56,076
You passed the exam in the first place,

815
00:57:57,476 --> 00:57:59,355
so it is time to keep your promise.

816
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:09,155
This.

817
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:13,835
What am I seeing?

818
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,675
If we meet again,

819
00:58:20,675 --> 00:58:21,996
I will tell you then.

820
00:58:23,355 --> 00:58:24,556
Back then,

821
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,795
I said I would tell you who I am...

822
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:31,956
when we met again.

823
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,036
More than a decade ago,

824
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:42,476
the terrified boy who hid in that dog house...

825
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:46,795
was me.

826
00:58:51,315 --> 00:58:52,315
I...

827
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:56,795
I am Lee Seol.

828
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:25,916
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

829
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:45,435
You cannot join the Palace Guards.

830
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:48,314
What if I cave to his threats and blurt out the truth?

831
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:50,955
Inform me as soon as you find out who Lee Seol is.

832
00:59:50,956 --> 00:59:53,714
You will be compensated with a government position.

833
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,354
Why are you being nice to me?

834
00:59:55,355 --> 00:59:56,955
Because I see myself in you.

835
00:59:56,956 --> 00:59:58,154
We have a lot in common.

836
00:59:58,155 --> 01:00:00,475
Thousands of people are dying at his hands,

837
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:02,395
and subjects who appeal to His Majesty...

838
01:00:02,396 --> 01:00:04,314
have their families annihilated.

839
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:06,194
Are you willing to keep letting this happen?

840
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:07,475
There is only one throne,

841
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:09,435
but the nation has three kings.

842
01:00:09,436 --> 01:00:10,754
My path leads to the palace.

843
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:12,714
That is why I have stayed alive,

844
01:00:12,715 --> 01:00:13,715
and it is also my duty.
