Lee Seol.

9
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:22,376
You dare to...

10
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:36,576
Your Majesty!

11
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,057
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:42,777
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,977
Your Majesty.

14
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,977
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty.

15
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:52,576
Your Majesty.

16
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:04,656
You must escape.

17
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:10,736
I will distract them. You should...

18
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,457
Get him!

19
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,777
Scholar Kim.

20
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:37,256
You are bleeding.

21
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,457
My lady.

22
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,856
Take just five steps back.

23
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:05,976
Kill him!

24
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:42,976
(Episode 15)

25
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:48,976
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,457
You, guard His Majesty.

27
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,696
- The rest, follow me. - Yes, my lord!

28
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:07,297
- Search thoroughly! - Yes, my lord!

29
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,736
Over here!

30
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,176
(Garden of Flowers)

31
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:04,947
I promise.

32
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,416
I will return before sunset.

33
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,577
I will not be broken.

34
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,616
I will come back to you safely.

35
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:30,976
- Find him! - Yes, my lord!

36
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:44,096
Lee Seol. If you assassinate the King,

37
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,616
I will have no reason to stand here again.

38
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,176
What are you thinking about?

39
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:07,056
Why are you here?

40
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,817
I told you to stay out of my business.

41
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:13,856
Is it not a pity...

42
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,096
to waste all you worked for thus far?

43
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:23,496
I did not accomplish anything. It was all Mokinhoe's work.

44
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,416
And now Mokinhoe will turn against you.

45
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,137
If the truth comes out,

46
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,697
you will become utterly alone.

47
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,137
That is not new to me.

48
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,937
My life has always been as such.

49
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,056
Let me remain with you, then.

50
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,217
I must...

51
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,817
remain by your side, at least.

52
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,377
Madame.

53
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,536
(Garden of Flowers)

54
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:39,976
Just like the snow melts,

55
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,337
Lee Seol will perish and disappear.

56
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,177
And that day draws near.

57
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,667
I made you wait.

58
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,896
My heart was already here with you,

59
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,427
but my feet could not keep up.

60
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,496
You are back, and that is what matters.

61
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,427
You did not disappear forever.

62
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,256
You returned alive.

63
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,547
Your Highness. You must get out of here.

64
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:05,896
Your Highness.

65
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,177
We must capture him at all costs!

66
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,937
I promise you I will never make you wait alone again.

67
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,256
So do not cry.

68
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,667
When I see you cry,

69
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,016
I feel like I am falling apart inside even though...

70
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,217
I am trying so hard to keep it together.

71
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,096
Are you badly hurt?

72
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,667
No.

73
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,547
It is just a minor injury.

74
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,616
Chief Kim!

75
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,855
The Palace Guards let their guard down.

76
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,776
They let His Majesty get attacked!

77
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,577
I am aware that there is no excuse for this.

78
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:40,217
Are you done treating him?

79
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,177
How come he is not regaining his consciousness?

80
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,136
The arrow was deeply lodged in his pectoral muscle,

81
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,896
so he lost a lot of blood.

82
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:52,057
His pulse is very weak at the moment.

83
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,736
Now, it all depends on his luck.

84
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,776
It depends on his luck?

85
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:00,976
Do something.

86
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,096
Bring His Majesty back to life, at once!

87
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,657
If you die such a horrible death,

88
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:12,577
I cannot go on with my life!

89
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,016
No, Your Majesty.

90
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:18,297
Your Majesty, please open your eyes!

91
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,776
How is His Majesty?

92
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,376
I shall go in and...

93
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,096
A mere assistant magistrate...

94
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:44,417
seeks an audience with His Majesty without permission?

95
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,937
Now, you do not even care to hide what you are truly after.

96
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,376
Do you not understand the situation?

97
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:56,976
As you can see,

98
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,217
the sun is setting.

99
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,096
Return safely.

100
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,096
The First Vice-premier said...

101
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,577
not to let anyone enter His Majesty's bedchamber.

102
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,976
The First Vice-premier and the Queen Dowager now side with Lee Seol?

103
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,457
And the Chief Eunuch is helping them?

104
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,616
We should not let the Chief Eunuch anywhere near His Majesty.

105
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,056
If His Majesty passes away...

106
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,537
With the Queen Dowager's announcement alone,

107
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,496
Lee Seol will be enthroned.

108
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:45,457
He is a traitor who tried to assassinate His Majesty.

109
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,417
Could you let him take the throne?

110
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,016
As long as I am alive,

111
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:53,256
the owner of the throne will not change.

112
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:56,057
I am counting on you.

113
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:59,217
Please protect His Majesty.

114
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,096
The pouch.

115
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,856
You must have accomplished your goal,

116
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,537
seeing how you returned in one piece.

117
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:39,817
I do not know yet.

118
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,217
My arrow did hit him.

119
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,177
But I should see what is going on once I get to the palace tomorrow.

120
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,016
Take care of yourself first.

121
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,337
Let me see.

122
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,256
- Are you not hurt? - No.

123
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,337
I suppose you are disappointed...

124
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,096
that I returned unharmed.

125
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,697
I am relieved.

126
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,256
I am truly relieved that you returned.

127
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,496
All right.

128
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,736
San.

129
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,537
You two.

130
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,337
I see that you are getting closer by the day.

131
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,096
We cannot call each other brothers,

132
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,337
but we should get along.

133
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,217
Right, younger brother?

134
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:29,657
He keeps doing this just because he was born a season earlier, Dan O.

135
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:31,736
- This is wrong, is it not? - I agree with you.

136
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,736
It is a bit much.

137
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,776
San.

138
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,776
You plan to go to work tomorrow, right?

139
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,697
It would look even more suspicious if I suddenly disappeared.

140
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:46,856
It will be fine.

141
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:00,697
Are you a warrior?

142
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,376
You have many scars.

143
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:11,616
I will be off, then.

144
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,015
Thank you.

145
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,016
No problem.

146
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:25,976
About what happened today...

147
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,937
Please do not tell anyone at Garden of Flowers.

148
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:32,776
Is that why...

149
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:35,457
you told me to be treated in the annex?

150
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,416
But we should tell the family...

151
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,376
I do not wish to stir things up.

152
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:45,856
Things have finally calmed down at Garden of Flowers.

153
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,976
Then tell me, at least.

154
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,577
Who sent the assassin?

155
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:55,856
If I cannot protect you,

156
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:57,896
what is the point of keeping it a secret?

157
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,135
I should just tell Dan O...

158
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,736
I am not sure either,

159
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,136
but I believe it was Master Jang.

160
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,177
You mean, Assistant Magistrate Jang?

161
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:10,627
Why does he...

162
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:13,576
want you dead?

163
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,867
His son, Jang Hyun.

164
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:20,056
He was...

165
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,256
my fiancé.

166
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:42,976
Did you just say...

167
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,336
you were engaged...

168
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:53,657
to Assistant Magistrate Jang's son?

169
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,417
Yes.

170
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,576
The day before our wedding,

171
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,016
he was stabbed to death.

172
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:16,336
You could not even lay a finger on Yoon Hong Ju?

173
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:18,816
That is unacceptable!

174
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,897
She was with a man, and he protected her.

175
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,816
They seemed very close.

176
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:30,657
I will see you tomorrow,

177
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,016
after the long night, Lady Hong Ju.

178
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,457
His swordsmanship was very impressive,

179
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,295
even though he looked like a nerd.

180
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,417
So he knows how to fight with a sword?

181
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,417
Could he have been...

182
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,055
hiding his real identity?

183
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,937
He hurt his arm,

184
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,177
but he could still make such fast attacks with his sword.

185
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,937
If he were after our heads,

186
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:09,976
we probably would not be alive now.

187
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,776
Such impressive swordsmanship...

188
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,256
Could he be...

189
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,016
What is the matter, my lord?

190
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,627
Find out everything you can about him.

191
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,417
Forget about Yoon Hong Ju for now.

192
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,937
I must kill him first.

193
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,736
Yes, my lord.

194
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:03,457
You seem to be in a good mood on this gloomy day.

195
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,177
Is it that obvious?

196
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,536
In two days' time,

197
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,217
I will wed the woman I love.

198
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:18,897
Lucky you.

199
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,417
As for me, I am stuck in this temple studying.

200
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:27,576
How about a drink?

201
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:30,536
Here.

202
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,256
May I ask about that ornament?

203
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:43,937
You were constantly playing with it.

204
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,107
Is it not adorable?

205
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,177
My fiancée made it to wish me longevity.

206
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:55,256
She must be worried, seeing how I am a swordsman.

207
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:00,697
And on top of that, I have a huge mission tomorrow.

208
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,177
I see.

209
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,217
It sure is fascinating to converse with a swordsman.

210
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,387
I am only a low-level officer, though.

211
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:54,217
(Garden of Flowers)

212
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,177
A warm dish is the best on a cold day like this.

213
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:02,576
Dan O.

214
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:09,457
With this, find me a place to live somewhere secluded and quiet.

215
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:15,177
A place to live? That is quite unexpected.

216
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:17,937
I cannot spend my life hiding at the annex.

217
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,055
Living somewhere far away...

218
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,056
Hong Ju...

219
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:23,696
Lady Hong Ju, are you house-hunting...

220
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:25,657
even before the wedding?

221
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,056
Gosh. Do you like him that much?

222
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:31,256
You are right.

223
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:34,457
It would make a nice home for newlyweds.

224
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,576
Are you two already that close?

225
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:40,536
Close enough to be thinking of marrying Si Yeol?

226
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:41,776
Why do you ask?

227
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:45,016
Are you not fond of Si Yeol?

228
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:47,536
As if.

229
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:50,576
I am happy if you are.

230
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,535
You have had it rough all these years.

231
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,776
That is hardly true. The burden was yours to bear.

232
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:03,056
Who knew this day would come? I am delighted.

233
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,056
She wishes to move out?

234
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,377
Hong Ju must want to marry him.

235
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:23,937
Dan O, what about you?

236
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,575
What do you mean?

237
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:27,736
San...

238
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,296
His Highness will not reside in Garden of Flowers forever.

239
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:37,976
I know.

240
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,377
One day, he will take the throne.

241
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:43,536
What will you do when that happens?

242
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,536
There are too many bridges to cross,

243
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:50,496
and I have not thought that far.

244
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,256
As of now, I only wish for San...

245
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,776
to achieve his goal unharmed.

246
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:03,457
You should give it some thought.

247
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,417
It is time you did so.

248
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:08,736
Goodness.

249
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:10,177
Why are you suddenly...

250
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:13,296
telling me this?

251
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,775
You do not have to stay at Garden of Flowers...

252
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:21,536
if the only reason is to care for your family.

253
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:25,015
Hong Ju has found a life for herself,

254
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:27,576
and Ms. Naju has me.

255
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:29,937
Yuk Ho...

256
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,296
If...

257
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:37,897
His Highness wishes to welcome you as his wife...

258
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,897
and reside together at the palace,

259
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,496
go with him.

260
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:49,137
We have not spoken of such things yet.

261
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,055
If you wish to stay...

262
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,417
as the innkeeper of Garden of Flowers,

263
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:56,217
you will part ways.

264
00:24:57,657 --> 00:24:59,976
The weight of the crown is heavier than it looks,

265
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:04,296
and the palace walls are much taller than they seem.

266
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,657
Could you...

267
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:14,016
spend the rest of your life not being with San?

268
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:40,976
The office is quieter than usual.

269
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:43,016
Is there an issue within the palace?

270
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,097
- Drag him away. - Yes, sir!

271
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,937
What is the reason for this?

272
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:56,256
His Majesty was attacked at the hunting ground.

273
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,016
Why did you swap shifts yesterday?

274
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,255
What did you do after taking the day off?

275
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,816
It was to mourn my father at his memorial rite.

276
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:08,377
Was that wrong of me?

277
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:14,617
I know you have been conspiring with Chief Eunuch.

278
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:18,056
Speak only the truth.

279
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:19,576
Conspiring?

280
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,816
I do not understand what you are saying.

281
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,697
How could a sworn palace guard try to assassinate His Majesty?

282
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,177
My lord.

283
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,776
I heard you summoned me.

284
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:41,816
Is this yours?

285
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:48,937
What am I looking at?

286
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,657
It was left behind by the assassin.

287
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:08,657
What are you gazing at?

288
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,296
I do not know what it is.

289
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,776
You were the one who switched shifts with Kang San.

290
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:28,736
Yes, my lord.

291
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,377
I am suspicious of his whereabouts.

292
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,736
Relay any and every information you have on him.

293
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,816
We are in search of a traitor.

294
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,776
Lying your way out of this...

295
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:43,016
will lead you to your grave.

296
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:45,937
Well...

297
00:27:47,937 --> 00:27:49,016
You see...

298
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,137
Could you spend the rest of your life not being with San?

299
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,457
Kang San as the assassin?

300
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:28,177
That is preposterous.

301
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:33,376
If I had suspected anything,

302
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:35,857
I would have reported him to you sooner.

303
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:48,696
Maybe you should end the interrogation...

304
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:50,256
seeing how we do not have any evidence.

305
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:53,535
First Vice-premier Sin...

306
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:56,056
is frantically trying to blame the Palace Guards.

307
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,377
If word gets out about this,

308
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:02,177
the entire unit could be in jeopardy.

309
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:20,776
Now that you are no longer a palace guard,

310
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:23,256
I will not see you within palace walls.

311
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:24,736
Thank you.

312
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:27,176
If it were not for you,

313
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,697
losing my job would have been the least of my worries.

314
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:32,576
May I ask...

315
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,736
why it is that you helped me?

316
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,776
I might ask...

317
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:41,536
why you did not cut me yesterday.

318
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:44,177
You obviously had the chance.

319
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,377
Because the life I was after was not yours.

320
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:58,056
His Majesty is at death's doorstep,

321
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,697
but no one is shedding tears of true sorrow.

322
00:30:01,657 --> 00:30:03,097
How dreadful is that?

323
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,696
I did not want to lose a good friend...

324
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,697
by choosing to protect a monarch...

325
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:13,097
who has lost trust and respect.

326
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:21,097
(Buyounggak)

327
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:30,296
I heard the King passed out while hunting.

328
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:34,617
Is Master Kang safe?

329
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:36,177
Yes.

330
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:38,495
How did you hear of that?

331
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:40,097
This is Buyounggak.

332
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,056
We serve high-ranking officials.

333
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:43,937
Word travels so fast.

334
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:46,295
You seem unusually excited.

335
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,576
I am. Now Master Kang...

336
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,217
No.

337
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,496
His Highness can take the throne.

338
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:01,976
He should.

339
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:05,377
He has scaled so many mountains so far.

340
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,217
You seem unusually downcast.

341
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:12,056
Will you not move to the palace with him?

342
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:16,056
I thought you would be Queen.

343
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:17,617
I guess not?

344
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,296
What?

345
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:27,496
The love of a man and woman is like a soft, ripe persimmon.

346
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,897
It is only red and sweet for a while.

347
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,816
In the end, after time,

348
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,016
it falls from the tree.

349
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,016
Ban Ya.

350
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,256
We agreed to be friends, yes?

351
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:43,617
I guess?

352
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:45,657
Are friends...

353
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,776
allowed to hit each other?

354
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:50,417
To secure our friendship.

355
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:53,697
It is getting late. You should go home.

356
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:56,056
Go.

357
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:03,417
I risked losing face as Queen Dowager to come here...

358
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:06,736
and sit before you because we must prevent the fall...

359
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:10,056
of the King and government's authority.

360
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,296
It is a disgrace.

361
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:16,055
The Heir Apparent is not His Majesty's son?

362
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,417
The wicked Royal Consort Park...

363
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:21,376
deceived the whole court.

364
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:22,496
Watch your language!

365
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,216
Nothing has been proven yet.

366
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:27,216
You may be a high-ranking official,

367
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:30,417
but dare you say the Queen Dowager is lying?

368
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:34,097
We shall discuss this another time.

369
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,816
We can wait to resolve this...

370
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:39,576
when His Majesty recovers.

371
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:07,536
What kind of life did you lead so far?

372
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:09,576
Why would you want to know that?

373
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:11,576
Just because.

374
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:14,377
I was constantly on the run.

375
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:16,937
I wonder what your life was like.

376
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,617
I was not chased.

377
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:21,937
But I was abandoned.

378
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,617
I had no home, parents, or siblings.

379
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:29,857
I lived my whole life not knowing my real name.

380
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:33,697
While I lost everything,

381
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:37,816
you also...

382
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,016
Maybe that is why...

383
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:43,816
I wished for a world in which those with nothing could dream.

384
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:48,097
I am worried.

385
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:51,617
The Queen Dowager will be shocked to see us both.

386
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:55,377
I feel dreadful.

387
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:00,136
I caused her the pain of losing a child again.

388
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,096
(Chamcheok: When a child dies before their parents)

389
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:05,097
His Majesty is Grandmother's only living child.

390
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:07,417
You are her only grandson too.

391
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,296
The one she searched for.

392
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,056
I am not the only one.

393
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:12,506
There is you too.

394
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,097
Well,

395
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:17,816
she does not know of me.

396
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,657
You should tell her.

397
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,697
I am sure...

398
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:27,336
she will want to know how you grew up.

399
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:30,776
I should apologize first.

400
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,336
It might not work, though.

401
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,057
Yes.

402
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:00,546
This is...

403
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,736
the sword the Crown Prince treasured.

404
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,137
Yes.

405
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,177
Father left it to me.

406
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,376
I deceived you, Your Highness.

407
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:17,776
I will willingly accept any punishment.

408
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:21,177
It is my fault for not greeting you sooner.

409
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,097
Please do not be angry.

410
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:31,617
I am greatly disappointed and angered by your actions,

411
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,026
but...

412
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:38,217
you made those choices to stay alive.

413
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:44,736
You survived and showed yourselves to me.

414
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:47,697
I will forgive you for that.

415
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:50,896
Grandmother.

416
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,177
Seol.

417
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,137
I came back...

418
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,256
so late.

419
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,456
Thank you.

420
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,697
For not forgetting to come and see me,

421
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:25,217
however long it took.

422
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,896
Do excuse me.

423
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,546
I will let you talk.

424
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,657
Your name is Gyeom?

425
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:40,026
Yes.

426
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:43,177
I have a lot to ask you as well.

427
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:45,376
I will see you...

428
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:49,177
later on.

429
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,057
Are you leaving?

430
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:25,856
I should make way.

431
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,026
It was never my position to take.

432
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:32,177
But do keep your promise.

433
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:37,577
You said you would create a world in which the lowly and poor...

434
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,816
could also achieve their dreams.

435
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,177
You remembered that?

436
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,856
That promise is what brought me this far.

437
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,736
So please make that a reality.

438
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:54,816
Yes.

439
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,177
I will.

440
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:02,456
Please take good care of His Highness, my lord.

441
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:26,506
Are you...

442
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,416
well and healthy?

443
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:32,177
Yes.

444
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,026
I am.

445
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,217
Seol.

446
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:40,657
Will you look at me?

447
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:48,546
For not one moment...

448
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:53,336
were you in the wrong or responsible.

449
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:55,986
The King...

450
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:58,776
just...

451
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,376
paid the price...

452
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,697
for his actions.

453
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:10,577
I am...

454
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:16,577
so very pleased that you did not break or crumble...

455
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:20,936
and found your way back to me.

456
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:25,697
I apologize.

457
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,026
I am sorry this is how we meet.

458
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:57,617
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

459
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,936
Does seeing the boys...

460
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,217
remind you of the past?

461
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,336
I did not know then...

462
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,617
how many lives...

463
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:14,697
I would take and ruin with my two hands.

464
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,376
Do not think about the lives you took.

465
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:22,577
Think about the lives that you protected.

466
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,376
Right.

467
00:40:32,816 --> 00:40:34,577
I have managed to keep my king safe,

468
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,217
so I can finish my job soon.

469
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:40,657
Then soon,

470
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:44,776
I will not be able to see you anymore.

471
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:50,097
I no longer wish...

472
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:54,336
to carry a sword.

473
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,506
Si Yeol, are you not hungry?

474
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:11,296
I heard you did not have dinner.

475
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:16,026
I brought you some sweet potatoes.

476
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:26,697
I hope he is not ill.

477
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:29,617
I am sure he is okay. We should let him rest.

478
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:53,776
Oh, right.

479
00:41:55,506 --> 00:41:57,776
Do you not have something to tell me?

480
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,336
No, I do not.

481
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:04,577
Soon, you will leave Garden of Flowers.

482
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,856
Do you not wish to share your future plans...

483
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:10,577
with me?

484
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:13,776
My future plans?

485
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:18,776
She would stop at nothing to preserve...

486
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:20,986
her sister and Garden of Flowers.

487
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:22,336
Do you think...

488
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:26,256
the palace in which she can barely breathe suits her?

489
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:30,137
No, I do not have any plans.

490
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:48,816
I should not have asked.

491
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:51,416
Go inside and get some sleep.

492
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:01,617
What if someone sees us?

493
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,776
We will talk tomorrow.

494
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:06,697
Someone might see us.

495
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:24,506
Why are you staring at me so intently?

496
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,057
Do I have something on my face?

497
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,617
Seeing your face, I am reminded of our childhood.

498
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,026
Your clear skin...

499
00:43:37,546 --> 00:43:38,896
and large eyes.

500
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:41,617
You were cute.

501
00:43:44,816 --> 00:43:46,697
That day, you looked...

502
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:49,137
I still remember your grubby face...

503
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:52,697
and shabby clothes.

504
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,296
How could anyone look put together when they are being chased?

505
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,057
You no longer...

506
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:04,217
need to be on the run, right?

507
00:44:05,177 --> 00:44:06,177
Yes.

508
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:10,856
To tell you the truth,

509
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:13,856
I met the Queen Dowager last night.

510
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:17,816
Did you get to have a lengthy conversation with her?

511
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,577
You two finally met after so many years.

512
00:44:24,177 --> 00:44:25,856
She quietly held me in her arms.

513
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:29,456
She did not resent me.

514
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:43,057
Anyway, what is with Si Yeol?

515
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:45,816
Something must be up with him.

516
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:50,736
You think so too, right?

517
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:53,137
Yes.

518
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,097
What is the matter?

519
00:45:22,296 --> 00:45:23,456
What is bothering you?

520
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:27,016
What do you mean?

521
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,137
Everything is going well,

522
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,537
but you look frustrated.

523
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,097
Just because I am your shadow,

524
00:45:34,137 --> 00:45:35,776
it does not mean I must always follow you...

525
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,537
or smile when you smile.

526
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,017
That is not what I meant.

527
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,497
This was what you wanted too.

528
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:46,977
You said you wanted freedom.

529
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:50,336
"Freedom?"

530
00:45:54,177 --> 00:45:56,497
I should not have started this.

531
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:00,177
How dare I...

532
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:04,136
Si Yeol, what on earth happened that...

533
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,256
Please!

534
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:12,497
Please leave me alone.

535
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,296
Today is...

536
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:30,816
just one of those days.

537
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:35,456
When you just feel like...

538
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:38,856
kicking a stone you see for no reason.

539
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,376
You know, one of those days.

540
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:46,816
Yes.

541
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:49,137
I am sure...

542
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,816
you have one of those days too.

543
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:11,455
What is going on? What is with him?

544
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,617
Do not ask.

545
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:15,136
He will kick you in the shin.

546
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,856
He will kick me?

547
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,977
I asked you all to gather...

548
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:25,137
because I figured you should be informed of what would happen.

549
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:28,017
The four of us founded the Find Seol Gang...

550
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,177
to find Lee Seol.

551
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,137
I must say, you truly are impressive.

552
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:37,537
You deceived Dan O when you were Lee Seol.

553
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:40,177
He really is something.

554
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:44,016
He totally had me fooled. I thought he was the watchman...

555
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:47,097
Back then, you were dense and could not take hints.

556
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,977
I kept saying I was not the watchman, but you did not listen.

557
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,256
Anyway,

558
00:47:57,217 --> 00:47:58,936
who is the watchman?

559
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:02,776
Now, I know everything but that.

560
00:48:04,977 --> 00:48:06,697
I know nothing about him either.

561
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:08,416
I do not know who the watchman is.

562
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:10,936
I heard he was very scary.

563
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:14,057
People say he has killed...

564
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:15,416
Let us not ruin this happy day...

565
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:18,256
by talking about death.

566
00:48:19,537 --> 00:48:20,697
Over ten.

567
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:24,736
He has crushed the lives of more than ten people.

568
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,776
That is what I heard.

569
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,617
How is the King?

570
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,696
If he regains consciousness...

571
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:39,736
Do you think...

572
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:42,497
the situation could change?

573
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:45,776
The Queen Dowager is preparing an announcement...

574
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:47,856
to install a new king.

575
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:51,177
Once it is announced,

576
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:54,816
there will be nothing the King can do even if he wakes up.

577
00:48:56,177 --> 00:48:57,456
I am relieved.

578
00:48:59,256 --> 00:49:00,896
You can finally achieve...

579
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:02,976
what you had set out to do.

580
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,816
I should be there as the leader of Mokinhoe.

581
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:07,496
I cannot keep fooling them into thinking that I am Lee Seol.

582
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:08,736
Not yet.

583
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:11,896
I will tell them myself when the time is right.

584
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,776
Fine. Your opinion is what matters the most.

585
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:31,736
So? Have you found out anything about Kim Si Yeol?

586
00:49:32,296 --> 00:49:35,217
Every time we tail him, he knows. So we have been having a hard time.

587
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:38,017
There is an abandoned house in Namsan Village.

588
00:49:38,336 --> 00:49:40,815
I do not know what they are up to, but the innkeeper and scholars...

589
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:42,375
of Garden of Flowers are all there.

590
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:44,376
They must be close.

591
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,097
Anything else?

592
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:48,415
While asking around,

593
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:50,977
I met a physician who supposedly treated him,

594
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,456
but it did not lead to anything.

595
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:57,376
Okay. You are dismissed.

596
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:01,256
Wait.

597
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:05,856
Go fetch that physician.

598
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:07,816
I must check something with him.

599
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:13,697
You saw scars on his body?

600
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:17,217
Where, exactly?

601
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:20,977
On this arm, I saw an old stabbing scar.

602
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:24,017
There was an odd scar on his shoulder as well.

603
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:26,776
It was small and stumpy...

604
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:30,177
which could not have been made by an awl or arrow.

605
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:51,416
Was it close...

606
00:50:52,057 --> 00:50:53,177
to this shape?

607
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,577
Yes, it could have been made by a throwing knife.

608
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,815
I was wondering what could have made it,

609
00:50:58,816 --> 00:51:00,137
and the shape resembles that.

610
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,577
Kim Si Yeol.

611
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:27,177
Was it you all along?

612
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:32,776
You murdered my son...

613
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:36,497
and frolicked with his fiancée?

614
00:52:05,977 --> 00:52:07,456
If you also had not shown up today,

615
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:10,577
I would have been upset.

616
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:20,416
Did I make some kind of mistake?

617
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:24,736
No.

618
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:31,936
The mentioning of my fiancé...

619
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:36,057
must have upset you.

620
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:39,137
My lady.

621
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:45,256
From start to finish,

622
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:48,657
I am to blame.

623
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:52,736
To blame?

624
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:56,416
- What... - Like you said,

625
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:58,577
I thought I could forget the past...

626
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:02,697
and move into the future.

627
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:06,577
Did you know...

628
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:11,856
that some pasts are too bloody and clear...

629
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,057
to be erased?

630
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:19,577
Whatever it is,

631
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:22,856
we can get through it together.

632
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:27,416
We cannot be together, not even for a second.

633
00:53:31,017 --> 00:53:32,537
I did not realize that sooner...

634
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:38,057
being the fool that I am.

635
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:44,776
Scholar Kim...

636
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,577
Do not forgive me.

637
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:52,736
Resent...

638
00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:57,097
and loathe me.

639
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:02,977
You promised not to show your back.

640
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:06,697
You promised to stay in my life.

641
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:10,217
I cannot bear it.

642
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:14,736
I cannot laugh while sitting across from you.

643
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:19,537
Are you saying...

644
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,776
you have had a change of heart?

645
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:30,617
Yes.

646
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:38,697
And that was meant to be.

647
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:29,936
It seems as though I have located the watchman.

648
00:55:30,736 --> 00:55:32,497
Never let your guard down.

649
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:36,577
His swordsmanship will exceed that of any known man.

650
00:55:37,177 --> 00:55:38,217
We are at your service.

651
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,856
Yukinhoe is prepared to take your order.

652
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:44,097
We do not fear the watchman.

653
00:55:44,497 --> 00:55:46,256
Is it his head you desire?

654
00:55:46,816 --> 00:55:48,416
I desire two, not one.

655
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:50,977
The watchman...

656
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:53,177
is always around Lee Seol.

657
00:55:54,776 --> 00:55:55,776
Make preparations.

658
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:57,776
Tonight, we hunt.

659
00:55:58,296 --> 00:55:59,296
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

660
00:56:04,537 --> 00:56:07,776
Tomorrow at the morning assembly, I will relay your announcement...

661
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:11,177
regarding the dethroning of His Majesty...

662
00:56:12,137 --> 00:56:13,336
and the crowning of a new king.

663
00:56:17,896 --> 00:56:22,577
I entrust you with the delivery of my royal instruction.

664
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:26,896
You are...

665
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:30,577
to assist the heir apparent with the utmost loyalty.

666
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:44,057
Thus, the present King...

667
00:56:45,177 --> 00:56:46,697
will be deposed.

668
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,776
Why not hang it from a branch within reach?

669
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:24,856
I figured my wish would be heard better...

670
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:28,456
if I hung it as high as possible.

671
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,577
Gosh.

672
00:57:39,097 --> 00:57:40,097
All right.

673
00:57:42,256 --> 00:57:43,256
There we go.

674
00:57:48,776 --> 00:57:49,776
By the way,

675
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:52,296
I found it.

676
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:55,497
The small object that shines brightly.

677
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:59,537
Have you been looking for it this whole time?

678
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:01,736
Hold on.

679
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:04,256
How could you have found it, though?

680
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:08,976
I am well aware that there was no jade ring.

681
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:10,977
Gosh, you alarmed me.

682
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:13,336
I thought you had tripped into the pond again.

683
00:58:23,776 --> 00:58:24,776
Here.

684
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:29,256
This is my future...

685
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:33,697
and my one and only plan.

686
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:29,296
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

687
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:48,576
Not even once...

688
00:59:48,577 --> 00:59:50,536
have you taken my side.

689
00:59:50,537 --> 00:59:52,735
If only you had been a wise king.

690
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:54,935
Once we eliminate the shadow that protects him,

691
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,576
he will have nowhere to hide.

692
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:57,855
It is no longer my concern.

693
00:59:57,856 --> 01:00:00,136
I have already given up on my duties as the watchman.

694
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:01,815
I see that Hong Ju is still unaware...

695
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:03,335
of whom you killed.

696
01:00:03,336 --> 01:00:05,577
Scholar Kim, please say it is not true.

697
01:00:06,017 --> 01:00:09,736
Dan O, you will always be my home.

698
01:00:10,137 --> 01:00:11,815
I will confess, Your Majesty.

699
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:16,497
Jung Yu Ha is the deposed heir Lee Seol.
