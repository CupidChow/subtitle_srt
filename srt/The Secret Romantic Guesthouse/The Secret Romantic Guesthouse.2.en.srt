(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,940
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,819
(8 years ago)

9
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,779
(Episode 2)

10
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,580
Chief Eunuch?

11
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,139
Is it truly you, Chief Eunuch?

12
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,740
Yes, Your Highness. It is I.

13
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:43,940
Get on your feet.

14
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,740
I thought I would never see you again.

15
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,580
I can die happy now.

16
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,539
How have you been?

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,580
I am safe and well.

18
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,699
At the expense of many others,

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,979
I stayed safe and well.

20
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,940
Why would you say that?

21
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,899
You are the only hope for Joseon.

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,819
I received my father's keepsake.

23
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,500
I thought it had vanished. Did you have it?

24
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,779
We must go inside.

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,190
I cannot stay.

26
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,299
Why did you wish to see me?

27
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,979
I apologize, Your Highness.

28
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,979
Those who remain must find a way to survive.

29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,139
It is His Majesty's command that deposed heir Lee Seol...

30
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,220
be executed on sight.

31
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,539
I heard warriors change the world with their blades.

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,019
What are you changing?

33
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,978
What changes if you kill me?

34
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,019
To a warrior,

35
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,340
his master is his world.

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,340
Lee Chang's world will fade in time.

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,620
Watch and see how this world ends...

38
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,139
from the other side.

39
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,579
A watchman?

40
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,419
Stop!

41
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,270
That is enough.

42
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,499
Do not shed any more blood.

43
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,150
Who are you?

44
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,260
Hyun.

45
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:58,460
No, I cannot lose... No.

46
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,499
Hyun!

47
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,660
Hyun!

48
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,179
You young masters have had a spoiled life and know no fear.

49
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,580
We are from the Capital District Office.

50
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,259
We received a report that...

51
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,299
a traitor had hidden in one of the Hanyang inns.

52
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:40,259
A traitor? There is no such man in Garden of Flowers.

53
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,700
You should hope so...

54
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,019
if you wish the inn to stay standing.

55
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,579
Take a good, careful look. This is the last place.

56
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,659
I will.

57
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:28,979
What do you say?

58
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
He is...

59
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,820
not here.

60
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,580
- Are you sure? - Yes.

61
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,430
Show me your identity tag.

62
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,100
Is there a reason you cannot?

63
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,618
(Jung Yu Ha)

64
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,060
A Jung from Naju?

65
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,059
Is your father...

66
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,619
Ex-Inspector General Lord Jung Yoon.

67
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,779
The curfew bell rang long ago.

68
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,060
Does politics not care for day or night?

69
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:08,019
(Kang San)

70
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,300
You are not from Hanyang.

71
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,019
Where are you from?

72
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,779
Must I drag you to the Capital District Office?

73
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,460
I am from Jecheon.

74
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Jecheon?

75
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,619
In Jecheon, there is a village where the Jinju Kang clan lives.

76
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,699
The governor of Jecheon is...

77
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,820
Lord Kang Ki Gab.

78
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,940
He is an elder in my family.

79
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
I see.

80
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Excuse me.

81
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
What about me?

82
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
What is your name?

83
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,060
I am Kim Si Yeol.

84
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,220
I am Lord Kim Ho Ik's 14th...

85
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,060
Actually, no. Was it the 15th?

86
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,420
- Anyway... - Born of a concubine, I gather?

87
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,420
Yes, that is correct.

88
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,580
(Kim Si Yeol)

89
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,940
We searched every nook and cranny...

90
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,019
but did not find a single strand of hair that belongs to Lee Seol.

91
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,460
What do you think about this?

92
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,420
Let us wait and see.

93
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,300
We will catch him soon.

94
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Chief Eunuch.

95
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,300
I do not keep those who are not useful.

96
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:08,619
I cut them off.

97
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,019
You have already been castrated.

98
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,499
This time, I shall cut your head off.

99
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,060
If there is anyone who seems even remotely suspicious,

100
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,940
I will report to you immediately.

101
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Let us go.

102
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,580
"Garden of Flowers."

103
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,060
It will take hours to clean up this mess!

104
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Wait.

105
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,499
You do not have to see us out.

106
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,619
You will see us again anyway.

107
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,859
Who sent you?

108
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:43,300
I need to know, to pay off the debt.

109
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,100
We are from Buyounggak.

110
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:49,899
Buyounggak?

111
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,859
What if Garden of Flowers turns into a kisaeng house at this rate?

112
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,139
What?

113
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,259
They want 100 nyang, in silver coins! Where will she get the money?

114
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,378
It does not look like she is earning any money.

115
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,820
That is rich coming from someone who has not paid for his room.

116
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Look who is talking.

117
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,859
You were staying for just one night. How many days has it been?

118
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:26,979
Gosh.

119
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Darn you.

120
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,100
You are avoiding me for you have nothing to say!

121
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,859
All right.

122
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:48,779
Please.

123
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,340
All right. Let us eat.

124
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,820
Oh, my.

125
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,498
I suppose Dan O is not home now.

126
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,460
No, she stepped out.

127
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,139
Now, I know...

128
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,220
no one wants to stay at this inn.

129
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,460
Yes, join us and have some.

130
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:20,779
Well, eat up.

131
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,300
The dumplings are delicious.

132
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:27,139
My gosh.

133
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,220
If those scoundrels show up again, report them immediately.

134
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,619
Sure thing, Scholar Kang.

135
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,619
Ms. Naju, by the way...

136
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,139
How come Dan O is...

137
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:38,979
still unmarried?

138
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:42,619
Right.

139
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,340
She is a beautiful girl. She will look stunning in a wedding dress.

140
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,580
She lost her parents, so no one would arrange a marriage for her.

141
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,739
That is why she is still unmarried.

142
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,940
When you think it is late,

143
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,619
it is already too late.

144
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:02,138
Shall I find an eligible bachelor for her?

145
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,379
No need.

146
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,258
Well, there are many men here.

147
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,019
Why does she not look around her?

148
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,060
Look around her?

149
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,459
Gosh, you are hurting my feelings without saying a single word.

150
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
- No. When did I hurt your feelings? - When?

151
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Just now.

152
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,580
Those mean eyes.

153
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,178
Here, have another dumpling.

154
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,510
Well, this is...

155
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,139
Gosh, my stomach is upset.

156
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,619
You are such a dunderhead.

157
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,418
You are acting like a clueless horse.

158
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,540
A horse? What are you talking about?

159
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,019
What?

160
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,419
A crazy horse.

161
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,060
I would call him a colt.

162
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,698
What? This is...

163
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,418
Here, colt without reins.

164
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:59,419
Stop!

165
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:00,990
Stop, all of you.

166
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Today has been...

167
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,419
I am so hurt.

168
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,939
Eat up.

169
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,540
If you do not finish your food, Ms. Naju will be sad.

170
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,540
Goodness, this is...

171
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Let us eat.

172
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,990
(Buyounggak)

173
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,899
Would you like a cup of tea?

174
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,459
No, thank you.

175
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,859
There must have been some misunderstanding.

176
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,580
My father...

177
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
would never borrow money from a place like this.

178
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,219
Correct.

179
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:58,219
It was not Buyounggak who loaned him the money.

180
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Then...

181
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,340
who loaned him such a large amount of money?

182
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,270
Even if I tell you, there is nothing you can do.

183
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,300
Please just tell me.

184
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,379
It was Master Jang Tae Hwa.

185
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,659
What did you say?

186
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,580
I said...

187
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,510
it was Master Jang from the Capital District Office.

188
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Lady Yoon.

189
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,020
Did you know?

190
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,020
Poverty is like a cold.

191
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,179
You cannot hide it, no matter how hard you try.

192
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,179
Even if you do your best to look presentable,

193
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,699
you cannot hide the stitches...

194
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,580
on your torn sleeve.

195
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,899
What are you trying to say?

196
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,750
What I am saying is,

197
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,899
you are not capable of paying off such a huge debt.

198
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:02,859
So listen to me and hand over Garden of Flowers.

199
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,939
I cannot do that.

200
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:09,780
No matter what anyone says,

201
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,540
I will protect Garden of Flowers.

202
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,340
It will be taken away from you in the end.

203
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,510
Unless you have something bigger to offer.

204
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,459
You need physical evidence?

205
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Yes.

206
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,750
Words vanish the moment they are uttered.

207
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,510
How could I believe what I cannot even see?

208
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,990
Your father wrote that promissory note himself.

209
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,379
This is his handwriting,

210
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,459
but why...

211
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,658
He wanted to train younger students when he could not afford it,

212
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,990
so he borrowed money from me.

213
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,379
Since you are no longer a child,

214
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,060
you should pay off your father's debt.

215
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,419
Even so,

216
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,060
you cannot suddenly demand such a large amount of money...

217
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:27,619
Many years ago, I promised your father...

218
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,419
that I would...

219
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,820
write off the debt...

220
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,859
if his eldest daughter and my son got married.

221
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,580
They were engaged but never got married.

222
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,658
So the debt remains unpaid.

223
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,179
- That is because your son... - Shut it!

224
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,100
They were engaged, which makes her a part of my family.

225
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,019
If she wanted to remain chaste, she should have been at my house.

226
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,500
- But Master Jang... - However, your sister...

227
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:59,138
stayed at Garden of Flowers under the pretense of her illness...

228
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:00,500
and withered away.

229
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,419
That is why...

230
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,419
I do not consider your family to be my son's in-laws.

231
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,659
(Garden of Flowers)

232
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,459

(Garden of Flowers)

235
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,379
Gosh. San?

236
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,899
(Garden of Flowers)

237
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:13,980
There.

238
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:16,899
Check if it is leveled.

239
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,540
Could you let go of my shoulder?

240
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,740
- Is it straight? - Yes.

241
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,819
You should not creep up on people though.

242
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,899
Were you crying?

243
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,219
No, of course not.

244
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:48,060
You were crying all right.

245
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,379
Lying is like second nature to you.

246
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,020
Normally, others pretend not to have seen anything.

247
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
- But you... - Do not cry.

248
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,619
You should not cry.

249
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,659
It makes you look ugly.

250
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,300
(Garden of Flowers)

251
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,820
This is why you should never take in another human being.

252
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,859
You showed up out of the blue, requesting money.

253
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,580
It is not even chump change. You asked for 100 nyang.

254
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,339
Lend me the money, and I will pay you back.

255
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,100
No, I will not waste a single penny on you.

256
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,619
I loathed you from the very beginning.

257
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,780
From the second our father brought you, the lovechild, home.

258
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,340
Halt.

259
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,419
She is Royal Consort Park's mother...

260
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:47,580
and is here to help with postpartum care.

261
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,459
You went to escort her yourself rather than sending word?

262
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:55,619
Time was of the essence due to the birth being imminent.

263
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,379
Then...

264
00:25:58,619 --> 00:25:59,659
Keep moving.

265
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Wait.

266
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,260
Your Majesty, it is Eunuch Yoon.

267
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,740
Enter.

268
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,658
Your Majesty, Royal Consort Park has delivered the baby.

269
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,500
What about the child? Is the baby well?

270
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,780
Yes, Your Majesty. I congratulate you dearly.

271
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,219
You have welcomed a prince.

272
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,020
I do not see a son in your future.

(Garden of Flowers)

274
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:27,059
Is this not the marriage offer letter?

275
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,658
(Saju danja: a letter that contains...)

(the Four Pillars of Destiny of the groom-to-be)

277
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,139
What is the matter?

278
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,179
What is written on there?

279
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,540
Gosh, this is frustrating. Talk to me, my lady.

280
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,219
"I ask for your hand in marriage."

281
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,379
"It has come to my attention that you are in huge debt."

282
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:01,980
"Marry me,"

283
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,619
"and I will pay the 100 nyang in a heartbeat."

284
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,379
"From Master Hong."

285
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:12,740
Master Sleaze?

286
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,859
It is him.

287
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,260
The one with narrow eyes who follows you around.

288
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,379
How did he know about your personal debt?

289
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,980
I will return it, so give it back.

290
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,859
Leave it with me.

291
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,500
Hand it over.

292
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,260
I will not let my precious lady...

293
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,339
marry a man who is willing to buy a bride.

294
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,179
Precious? No one would agree to that.

295
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:38,859
Since when have I lived as a noblewoman?

296
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,419
To me,

297
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,379
you are the dearest.

298
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,419
So do not say otherwise.

299
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,820
I hear you.

300
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,459
But it will hurt his pride if I reject...

301
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,459
what is a formal proposal.

302
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
I am good.

303
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,659
Drink up while you can.

304
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:17,219
We might not get to drink her sujeonggwa again.

305
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,899
Who sent over that marriage offer letter?

306
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:25,740
A marriage offer letter?

307
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
Which family is it from?

308
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,300
Tell us already.

309
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,459
Men are better judges of other men.

310
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:36,580
Maybe later.

311
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,459
Judging by your worried look, the man must be ugly.

312
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,659
Of course. No one can go from living in a mansion to a hut.

313
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,859
You see such a handsome man all the time...

314
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,099
that the average man would not satisfy you.

315
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,539
Sure. I will agree to that,

316
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,139
so enjoy the rest of the sujeonggwa.

317
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,619
Wait. I thought you did not want it.

318
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:08,980
I changed my mind.

319
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,139
Are you off somewhere?

320
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,500
Yes, to the market. I just ran out of paper.

321
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,979
I have business at the market too. We should go together.

322
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,179
That sounds nice. I was too bored to go alone anyway.

323
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,300
Gosh, I am bored.

324
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,659
How can a day be this boring?

325
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,419
Would you like to come with us?

326
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,859
Sounds good. I have not been on a stroll for a while.

327
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,100
I doubt it has been a while.

328
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,659
Are you going too?

329
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,899
I have to attend business at the market too.

330
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:04,939
As in what? Do you need a carpenter to sharpen your blade?

331
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,619
Maybe I should sharpen something else.

332
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:11,419
As in what?

333
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:14,939
Anything, I guess.

334
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,540
I see fondness in your eyes.

335
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,020
What do you think I am fond of?

336
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,419
Garden of Flowers.

337
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:35,020
It does not seem like you want to leave.

338
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,419
Are we finally a family now?

339
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,300
I will check on some swords.

340
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,699
You can go without me.

341
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,340
Sure, go ahead.

342
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,980
Goodness, my lady. You came.

343
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,299
(Miscellaneous Goods)

344
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,659
Dan O is just like any other woman.

345
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,659
She is also distracted by the accessories shop.

346
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,060
Here.

347
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:12,060
I went the extra mile for these,

348
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:14,139
and the materials are all of good quality.

349
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:18,859
I am well aware of your skills, Lady Dan O.

350
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,060
Here you go.

351
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,500
Just five nyang?

352
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,780
This does not even cover the material cost.

353
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:32,139
It is made with only the best, such as coral and amber.

354
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,618
Why not give me ten nyang?

355
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,980
One hundred nyang of silver!

356
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:39,060
I will buy it off you for 100 nyang of silver.

357
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,540
If you will marry me.

358
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,939
You are bound to...

359
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:49,060
become mine, so why not just...

360
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:51,539
What makes you say that?

361
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,939
A woman steeped in poverty only has...

362
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,859
so many options.

363
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:57,379
Right?

364
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,780
Stop playing hard to get.

365
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:01,379
It will benefit us both.

366
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,740
- Who are you? - That is enough.

367
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,659
Not you again.

368
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,819
You failed to change your ways.

369
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,419
What a filthy sleaze.

370
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,500
How many men do you have wrapped around your little finger?

371
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,260
A woman of noble birth should be ashamed.

372
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:31,179
Darn you, Master Sleaze!

373
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,378
What? "Master Sleaze?"

374
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,459
Yes, you. Impolite and ignorant you.

375
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:40,419
I will say this only once, so listen up.

376
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,740
What is this chill that I feel?

377
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,139
The world might have changed a great deal,

378
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,419
but a woman should marry a human being.

379
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
What?

380
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Am I not human?

381
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,698
Rather than marry a beast,

382
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,340
I would throw myself into the sea as a sacrifice.

383
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,820
Why are you suddenly taking that tone with me?

384
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,580
Is this not how one should speak to a dog?

385
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,459
What? A dog?

386
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,378
(Miscellaneous Goods)

387
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,379
Your proposal...

388
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,819
just got refused.

389
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,219
Come along.

390
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,908
What a fool.

391
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,699
My gosh, how embarrassing.

392
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:35,619
Did something just happen?

393
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,100
Not at all. Let us go.

394
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,389
(Miscellaneous Goods)

395
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,739
It will be taken away from you in the end.

396
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,460
Unless you have something bigger to offer.

397
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,580
Something bigger.

398
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:05,500
Something bigger?

399
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:09,819
Take a good, careful look.

400
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,739
This is the last place.

401
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,298
My gosh. They caused such a ruckus.

402
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:57,818
They searched all the rooms...

403
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,979
and checked all the men's identity tags.

404
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,429
They came to my inn as well.

405
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,339
Who was that man with them?

406
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:07,659
He did not look like a Capital District officer,

407
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,540
but they moved together.

408
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,259
I think they said...

409
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:15,739
he was an eunuch who used to serve the king.

410
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,020
He has been to Buyounggak often since that day.

411
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:23,299
He drinks and frolics with the kisaeng every day.

412
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:24,869
A eunuch...

413
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:28,259
looking for a traitor?

414
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:44,819
Do you not want to know...

415
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,259
why Lee Seol returned to Hanyang?

416
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,179
When those who want him dead hide in every corner.

417
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:02,460
Lee Seol is giving me a warning.

418
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,060
He will soon be coming for the throne.

419
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,540
Your Majesty, this is a joyous day.

420
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,980
Do not concern yourself with such things.

421
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,500
Who knows?

422
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,979
He could be somewhere, quietly gathering forces.

423
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,138
Lee Seol is guilty of high treason.

424
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,299
If he has forces,

425
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,909
I will eliminate them all.

426
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,460
I trust you will do so, Lord Sin.

427
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:31,429
I need Lee Seol gone as soon as possible...

428
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,429
if my son's future is to be without worry.

429
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:16,869
Stop right there.

430
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,059
Why is it just you maids? Where is the court lady?

431
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,940
Court Lady Yoon was gravely ill,

432
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,869
- so she left the palace. - She was ill?

433
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,739
Are you sure about this?

434
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,579
Widows are fine to kidnap, but an unwed young lady...

435
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,020
She has no parents or siblings to rely on.

436
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,868
What problem could there be?

437
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:45,869
Fine, then.

438
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,940
Why did you creep up on me?

439
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,659
You startled me.

440
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,819
What were you thinking about?

441
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,659
I almost went hoarse calling you.

442
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:38,908
See? I am hoarse.

443
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,429
I bet it is the liquor.

444
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,059
You drink as much as you should study.

445
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,339
No wonder you go hoarse.

446
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,060
Are you nagging me?

447
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,779
I like the sound of it.

448
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,619
What is that?

449
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,060
It is Bok Sil, not "that."

450
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:57,138
"Bok Sil?"

451
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:58,779
Yes. Cute, is it not?

452
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:01,698
You have a kennel...

453
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,738
but no dog, so I got one.

454
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:04,819
Who asked you to?

455
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:07,539
You never pay rent on time, and you brought...

456
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
another mouth to feed?

457
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,139
Bok Sil, watch whom you bark at. This is your mistress.

458
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:17,020
"My lady, please take me home."

459
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,259
Bok Sil, I will let you off because of your name.

460
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
The name?

461
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,980
The dog I had as a child was called Bok Sil.

462
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,299
Was it really?

463
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:31,909
This is fate. You are meant to have Bok Sil.

464
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,429
My lady. I am yours now. My lady...

465
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:38,699
- Hey. - Yes?

466
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,460
This is my opportunity.

467
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,818
I hate getting wet. Carry me.

468
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:43,819
Okay.

469
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,940
You there.

470
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,100
Here is some advice. Do not cross.

471
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,428
Or you will end up in the afterlife.

472
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,219
You are out of your mind.

473
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,389
Come on.

474
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,980
- Go ahead. - Okay.

475
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:04,259
No, you cross first.

476
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,699
You lunatic!

477
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,139
You, cross the river. Lead the way.

478
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,219
Darn it.

479
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:25,429
Go ahead.

480
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,699
Oh, no. Hey, you.

481
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,020
We will get more men.

482
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,500
Where are you going?

483
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:39,259
Hey!

484
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,219
Where are you going?

485
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,219
Come back!

486
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,389
No, wait.

487
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:57,980
Young man. Please let me live.

488
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,219
I am the second son of Hong,

489
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,980
the richest man in Jungcheon.

490
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,500
What do you want?

491
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,219
I will give you anything.

492
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Wait!

493
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:11,580
Do you know who I am?

494
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,659
Do you not fear the consequences?

495
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,020
You will not get the girl you came for,

496
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,819
because I will pickle you instead.

497
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,460
I take back the offer of marriage.

498
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:39,869
I will not bother you again.

499
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:42,739
Please put in a good word to the young master.

500
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,580
I fear him so much.

501
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:47,299
What young master?

502
00:42:51,389 --> 00:42:53,460
What does it say?

503
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,500
Oh, here.

504
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,819
"The young master."

505
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
"The..."

506
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:06,389
Oh, okay.

507
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
Right. So...

508
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,940
My gosh...

509
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,699
Knowing Yu Ha's personality,

510
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:25,580
he would never opt for violence.

511
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,819
Si Yeol?

512
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,699
Then the two of them would have been pummeled.

513
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:34,909
That leaves...

514
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:45,540
He seemed highly skilled in martial arts.

515
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,380
Could it be...

516
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,139
Why are you staring at the ground as if it is your enemy?

517
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,380
Did you have to go somewhere?

518
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,338
Hold on. Did you not come home last night?

519
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,259
Must I tell you every single thing?

520
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:06,060
No, but I can ask.

521
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,819
Wait, San.

522
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:15,219
By any chance, was it you?

523
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,699
- What? - Master Sleaze.

524
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,900
You must have totally scared him off.

525
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:24,459
What? "Master Sleaze?" Who is that?

526
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,658
It truly was not you?

527
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:30,339
I do not have time to worry about someone else's marriage.

528
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,259
You must have seen everything at the market, for you to say that.

529
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,339
You are the only one in this house...

530
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,420
whom that jerk, Master Sleaze, would fear.

531
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,060
- I doubt that. - It is true.

532
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:46,980
Sure, whatever.

533
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:49,179
But...

534
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,899
why did you...

535
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,299
Do not get the wrong idea.

536
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,339
I did not do it for your sake.

537
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:58,460
- Then why did you do it? - That is...

538
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:05,860
Because of sujeonggwa. That sujeonggwa was delicious.

539
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,420
What?

540
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:31,860
Here.

541
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:33,900
Eat it on the way.

542
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,259
You did not have breakfast.

543
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:40,779
Thank you for this.

544
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:44,940
And this too.

545
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,540
Would you just accept it?

546
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,380
It is not that much.

547
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,179
I thought you could use that money to pay the interest at least.

548
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,860
I wish to stay at Garden of Flowers for a long time.

549
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,779
I will get it all sorted out...

550
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,500
so that you can stay with us for a long time.

551
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:26,419
Anyway, how did you know this came from me?

552
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,060
Come on. Who else if not you?

553
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,540
It was very obvious.

554
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,819
Yu Ha!

555
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,699
We should sweep more often.

556
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,580
You are very sweet.

557
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:38,219
You sweep the front yard when flower petals flutter down.

558
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:43,138
Then why not accept this?

559
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:44,819
I have a thing called shame too.

560
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,699
An inn owner cannot borrow money from her guest.

561
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,059
Am I a mere guest to you?

562
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,299
What I mean is, I must take care of things at the inn on my own.

563
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,659
I know we are close,

564
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,580
but I cannot rely on you every single time.

565
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:02,380
Right. I should have thought about how this could make you feel.

566
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,819
No, it is okay. I appreciate you wanting to help.

567
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,940
Anyway, where are you going?

568
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:12,419
Right, I am off to visit my family. I will be home late.

569
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,940
Oh, I see.

570
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,259
Have a safe journey.

571
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,420
I will see you soon.

572
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:34,139
You are here. Take a seat.

573
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,540
Chapter Three.

574
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,619
("Book of Documents")

575
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:47,500
("The Secret Records of Samhan")

576
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:51,540
"A young king calls himself a ruler and tries to rule the world."

577
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,500
"High treason in the first year of the young king's reign..."

578
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,219
"will cause a bloodbath."

579
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,338
"A young king?" Could it be...

580
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,779
I hear His Majesty finally has an heir after a dozen years.

581
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,259
The tyrant king's wish has finally come true.

582
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,900
Now that he has an heir, it is only a matter of time...

583
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:09,420
before he gets rid of the only obstacle.

584
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,980
Right.

585
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:14,380
To His Majesty, it is like a speck of dirt that he cannot stand.

586
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,699
I bet he wants it gone for good.

587
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,179
The other day when I was staying at Buyounggak,

588
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,859
some men from the Capital District Office raided the inn at night,

589
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,179
saying they were looking for a traitor.

590
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:25,699
Could that be...

591
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:27,499
I went to a tavern yesterday.

592
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,179
Some men were looking for a traitor there too.

593
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,020
It is him. They want to find Snowflake and get rid of him.

594
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:25,860
I am done for the day.

595
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:27,860
What?

596
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:30,139
- I am off too. - What?

597
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,739
Goodness. If I win 1 more round, I can pay my rent for 3 months!

598
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,980
Darn it.

599
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,299
Are you the lady of unmatched beauty everyone speaks of?

600
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:46,060
The owner of Buyounggak.

601
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,060
I heard you were staying at Garden of Flowers.

602
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,980
Correct. Word surely travels fast.

603
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,779
How are you enjoying your stay at Garden of Flowers?

604
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:09,500
I wish it were bustling and lively like this place,

605
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:11,540
but it is very quiet there.

606
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:16,540
I suppose they do not have many guests.

607
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,380
Not as many as you have.

608
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:21,579
However, it is quite an eventful place.

609
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,659
"Eventful?"

610
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,259
Three young scholars are staying at the inn now.

611
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:27,020
They are just small things.

612
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:33,500
What are the other scholars like?

613
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,580
You have to learn to live together and be mindful of many things.

614
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,900
Yes, indeed.

615
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,219
I must say, you seem keenly interested.

616
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,179
I beg your pardon? What do you mean?

617
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,100
You seem very interested in Garden of Flowers.

618
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,980
You seem deeply concerned.

619
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:11,060
Do not be anxious.

620
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,940
He has been living in hiding for over ten years.

621
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,580
He will not get caught easily.

622
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,339
That is why I must catch him.

623
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,339
At all costs.

624
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:27,940
So if Snowflake gets caught,

625
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:29,860
what will happen?

626
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,060
Since he is a traitor,

627
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:35,779
he will be brought to his knees before His Majesty, right?

628
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:38,500
Snowflake will not meet His Majesty.

629
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,580
I will kill him before that happens.

630
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,179
(Garden of Flowers)

631
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,338
Why did you take so long to get dressed?

632
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,380
What are you doing here?

633
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:07,500
I was waiting here to cheer for you.

634
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,298
Do not ruin things for me.

635
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:10,619
Move. I must get going.

636
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,460
Everyone here must pass the state exam, you know.

637
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,099
The reputation of this premium inn, Garden of Flowers,

638
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,819
all depends on you now.

639
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:31,179
I will think about it.

640
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:34,540
What are you talking about? You must pass the exam no matter what.

641
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,179
He will most likely pass the exam.

642
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:40,179
Her fingers would all melt if she had to make rice taffy again.

643
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,980
You made this yourself?

644
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,060
Of course. This is nothing.

645
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:49,739
As you know, I am an excellent cook.

646
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,860
Eat the taffy and pass the exam!

647
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,338
It is time.

648
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:18,540
Let us begin, then.

649
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:32,219
Now,

650
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:36,139
we will begin the first test of the special military exam.

651
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,380
Bullseye!

652
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,699
What brings you by?

653
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:29,299
We are here to look around our new place.

654
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:40,980
I heard it was spacious,

655
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:42,860
but the rooms are smaller than expected.

656
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,540
Small, my foot.

657
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,738
Besides, who said you could look around?

658
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:49,540
Do not be cranky.

659
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,940
This place will be owned by Buyounggak soon.

660
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,779
I wonder if you have found a new place to live.

661
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,020
My lady...

662
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,139
The place is too small.

663
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,219
Are we supposed to let them be?

664
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,859
Kisaengs are here as if it were their home.

665
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,299
Do not fret for I will handle this matter.

666
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,618
You do not have a solution though.

667
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:19,299
You know how it is, Ms. Naju.

668
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:22,179
I cannot give up on Garden of Flowers,

669
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,020
- so... - I know.

670
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:26,619
I know why you need to preserve it.

671
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,019
But still...

672
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,179
Exactly.

673
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:31,819
So please...

674
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,540
let me handle it.

675
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,819
You should get rid of me.

676
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,658
What do you mean?

677
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:45,060
I am too old and weak now...

678
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,019
to be worth much,

679
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,379
but at least...

680
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,100
- Ms. Naju. - My lady,

681
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:54,460
I was born into your family as a servant.

682
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,099
This is my destiny, so...

683
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,299
Ms. Naju,

684
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,860
you became my mother after my parents died.

685
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,819
It has always been that way.

686
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:07,659
So...

687
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,380
do not mention that ever again.

688
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:25,580
Zero points!

689
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:29,379
Next up is Sang Yoon of the Hwangsan Kim family.

690
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,420
Get ready.

691
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,100
Ride.

692
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,298
- My gosh. - Oh, dear.

693
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:40,659
Zero points!

694
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,860
Lord Sin, you are present.

695
00:57:49,659 --> 00:57:51,100
What brings you by?

696
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,580
You have your work cut out for you. May I observe?

697
00:57:54,699 --> 00:57:56,819
I would like to see the talent of the applicants.

698
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,259
Of course. Please have a seat over here.

699
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,860
Next up is San of the Jinju Kang clan.

700
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:18,219
Ride!

701
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:36,299
He will also fall off his horse.

702
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,580
Two points!

703
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:10,659
Ever since Hong Sim saw a ghost by the well,

704
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,618
men have been lining up.

705
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:13,739
I heard that as well.

706
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,940
It is all because of the resentment harbored by the female ghost...

707
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:18,980
who died as a virgin.

708
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:21,979
Will we get to see it at the annex?

709
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,980
Of course.

710
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,060
Come on.

711
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:28,699
What?

712
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,500
They cannot go there.

713
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:32,259
Wait.

714
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,460
Shoot.

715
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,339
It is kind of scary out here.

716
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:41,179
Should we leave?

717
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,900
We are fine. Just follow my lead.

718
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:50,219
What? Young Master.

719
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,419
See? It already worked.

720
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,420
Get out of here right now.

721
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,420
Sorry?

722
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,259
Do not look behind you.

723
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Young Master?

724
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:00,259
Keep your eyes on me.

725
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,420
Come this way.

726
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,060
Hurry.

727
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:05,860
Young Master, my goodness.

728
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,219
Did you miss us that much?

729
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,139
Goodness.

730
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,219
We had no idea.

731
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,219
What was that?

732
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,739
Out of my way!

733
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,980
Move.

734
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:02,219
- Help! - Run!

735
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:16,259
Is something up?

736
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,060
Where is she going at this hour?

737
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,020
Is anyone home?

738
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,420
I am here to see Master Jang.

739
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,980
Whose house is this?

740
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:21,060
I doubt you already have the 100 nyang.

741
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,380
I do not.

742
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:24,819
Then,

743
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:27,299
are you here to relinquish your residence?

744
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,940
I cannot relinquish...

745
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,500
Garden of Flowers.

746
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,460
What?

747
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,980
Instead,

748
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,699
I will let you have me.

749
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:46,979
A hundred nyang is enough...

750
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,619
to stuff my annex with kisaengs of my choosing.

751
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:54,619
I am not a kisaeng who sells her laughter.

752
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,580
I am far more valuable.

753
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,060
The audacity.

754
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,860
As if you can be of value to me.

755
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,460
What if...

756
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,179
I found him for you?

757
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,420
As if you knew who I was looking for.

758
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,540
I hear...

759
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,580
one calls him this.

760
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,380
Snowflake.

761
01:03:30,819 --> 01:03:32,259
The deposed grand heir that disappeared.

762
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,540
Lee Seol.

763
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,460
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

764
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,859
Dan O is searching for Snowflake?

765
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,019
Where did you say you were going?

766
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,139
Gwacheon-hyeon.

767
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,778
I must go there.

768
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,539
Let me accompany you, then.

769
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,618
You are the reason I came.

770
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:26,818
Because I was worried.

771
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:27,819
Because I do not wish you harm.

772
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,219
What do you say to marrying me?

773
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,218
Have you ever pictured his life?

774
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,380
Who could he have grown up to be?

775
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,298
What are you truly after?

776
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:39,379
I am the one who has the best chance of finding him.

777
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:42,258
Many have lost their lives in search of Snowflake.

778
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:43,259
Do not look for him.

779
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,460
Do not look for whom you are after.
