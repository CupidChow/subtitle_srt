00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,899

(Jung Gun Joo)

00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,139
(Ryeo Un)

4
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,389
(Kang Hoon)

5
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,098
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

6
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,058
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,059
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,459
(Episode 6)

9
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,699
I will ask just two questions.

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,218
Go ahead.

11
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:02,858
Explain a misunderstanding...

12
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:05,779
or do away with bad blood.

13
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:09,058
Your answer will decide...

14
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,228
whether you live or die.

15
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,258
Kim Si Yeol.

16
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:19,978
The son of a concubine born to Lord Kim Hong Ik.

17
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:22,498
That is not you.

18
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,459
What is your real name?

19
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,498
If Si Yeol is Lee Seol,

20
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,939
why question him at home and not at the palace?

21
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:55,258
If the watchman shows up, you must let me know.

22
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,218
"Give greatly to earn greatly."

23
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,578
(Give a lot to earn a lot.)

24
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,859
To bait the watchman with Lee Seol?

25
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,019
If we find him, we can find Snowflake too.

26
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,179
The watchman is always by Snowflake's side.

27
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,299
Do not look for him.

28
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,709
Do not look for whom you are after.

29
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:24,818
I was right.

30
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,778
Kang San is the watchman.

31
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,378
He guarded Snowflake all this while.

32
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,098
Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

33
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,098
Is that the name you wished to hear?

34
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,299
What a pity.

35
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,459
I am not he.

36
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:49,938
Kim Si Yeol.

37
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,739
That is my given name.

38
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:56,699
You truly are Lord Kim Hong Ik's son?

39
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,258
Your name is not in the family records.

40
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,419
A threat does not change the truth.

41
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,378
If you bring the watchman to me,

42
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,299
I will write off your debt.

43
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,378
Are you going somewhere?

44
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,378
Must I report that to you?

45
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,579
No, but...

46
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,579
- The truth is... - What?

47
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:00,938
Do you have something to say?

48
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,898
I am sorry, San. This is my only option.

49
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,419
If it is not urgent, then wait. Right now...

50
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,579
It is urgent.

51
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,498
I have something urgent to tell you.

52
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,179
Well...

53
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,018
Actually, I...

54
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,698
I lost a keepsake from my mother.

55
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,099
- A keepsake? - A jade ring.

56
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:32,539
It is very small, and it shines brightly.

57
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,979
- Where did you lose it? - What?

58
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,578
Oh, well...

59
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,458
In the pond.

60
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,378
It is the last thing my mother left me,

61
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:48,938
and I dropped it in the pond while cleaning.

62
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,419
How and what do you clean that you would drop that in a pond?

63
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,578
I have been preoccupied these past few days.

64
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,339
An urgent message about something suspicious.

65
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,858
Master Jang's residence...

66
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,018
is full of Capital District Office soldiers.

67
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,498
Soldiers?

68
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:47,258
They have abducted an unknown young master.

69
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,859
If I pass this to Master Jang,

70
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,099
San will die,

71
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,138
will he not?

72
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:28,938
Dan O.

73
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,419
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

74
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,018
Do not cry.

75
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,338
I told you not to cry.

76
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,979
How and what do you clean that you would drop that in a pond?

77
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,339
I will lose...

78
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,299
Garden of Flowers now.

79
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:34,577
You will be caught if you go now.

80
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,859
What do you mean?

81
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,219
Well...

82
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,458
Survey the situation first, before you...

83
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,739
Do you even know where I am going?

84
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,618
We shall find out...

85
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,018
how long your bravado will last.

86
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,698
Search the vicinity.

87
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,858
The fool will come.

88
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,938
- Yes, sir. Come along. - Yes, sir. Come along.

89
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,578
Stay in the back.

90
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,098
Aim by sight for me. I will draw the bow.

91
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,269
Have you shot before?

92
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,218
No. There is a first time for everything.

93
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,179
Miss and it will be over. Do not ruin our chances.

94
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,698
Do you have another option?

95
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:40,779
Your arrow will not even reach, let alone hit the mark.

96
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,659
Now.

97
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,058
He is here.

98
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,698
Over there. Go after him!

99
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,269
Halt.

100
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,538
I was wondering why the Capital District Office was empty.

101
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,389
Everyone is here.

102
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,217
The military officials...

103
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:12,338
from the Capital District Office are at Master Jang's residence.

104
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,858
If you go there,

105
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,379
you will find the man you have been looking for.

106
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,019
Lord Sin, what brings you here?

107
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,899
Who is he?

108
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,378
We were interrogating him as we suspected he might be Snowflake.

109
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:32,458
What do you mean?

110
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,818
How dare you interrogate a royal heir at your private residence?

111
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:38,458
A royal heir?

112
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,898
Snowflake was deposed and banished.

113
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,058
It does not change the fact that he belongs to the royal family.

114
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,779
I was simply...

115
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,977
trying to obey His Majesty's commands...

116
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,058
That is precisely what I am doing now too.

117
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,379
The Department of Justice will interrogate him.

118
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,698
- Lord Sin. - The royal court will be enraged.

119
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,139
How dare you decide what to do...

120
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,338
with such an important matter involving the royal family?

121
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,698
He could not have gone too far.

122
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,139
Thoroughly search the area!

123
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,139
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

124
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:12,938
That way.

125
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,899
Come along.

126
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:59,098
(Shrine)

127
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,578
How come you are not asking any questions?

128
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,419
You are not hurt, so all is well.

129
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,139
For now, that is all that matters.

130
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:15,659
Are you not afraid?

131
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,299
You do not know who I am.

132
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,779
I know who you are.

133
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,818
You are the watchman.

134
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,458
I am afraid.

135
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,019
I was terrified...

136
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,578
when I saw you in the palanquin the day you got hurt.

137
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,458
I thought I would never see you again.

138
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,458
So please,

139
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:58,139
do not get hurt.

140
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,338
- My gosh! - Goodness!

141
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,338
Oh.

142
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,659
Are you here to see Lady Dan O?

143
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,139
Is she in her room?

144
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,658
She is not back yet.

145
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,618
Did she not tell you where she was going?

146
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,057
She was not here...

147
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,259
when I returned from the field.

148
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,738
What is she up to that she is not back yet?

149
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,299
Is your arm okay?

150
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,259
It must be very uncomfortable.

151
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:00,179
No, it is fine.

152
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:02,299
Earlier, it was because of a strain.

153
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:06,818
Let me take a look.

154
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:09,139
If the wound is getting worse...

155
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:11,978
You need not look.

156
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,458
It is fine.

157
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,259
Let me have a look.

158
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,259
Goodness.

159
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,019
What are you doing?

160
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:43,978
Did you throw my favourite water-dropper...

161
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:45,218
in the water?

162
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:48,458
Yes, so it can play as much as it wants.

163
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,539
A fish should play in the water.

164
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,899
It is nothing special.

165
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,538
You asked me to find a very small object that shines brightly.

166
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,619
What is the matter?

167
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,379
Do you not like it?

168
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,829
I do.

169
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,458
I love it.

170
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,538
I love it so much.

171
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:29,738
All right, then.

172
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,589
Hold on.

173
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,258
Did you actually go into the pond because of the ring?

174
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,349
I stepped into it and only got my feet wet.

175
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,859
I could not find the ring though.

176
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,099
Next time, I will find the ring...

177
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,659
Oh, no.

178
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,698
This...

179
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,457
This is enough.

180
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,619
You said it was a keepsake from your mother.

181
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,778
I will be sure to find it once we go back.

182
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,659
Oh, it is okay.

183
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,419
If you could not find it,

184
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,829
maybe it is not there...

185
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,069
It is not there?

186
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,619
Oh, what I meant was...

187
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,498
I just do not want you to go to such trouble.

188
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:20,018
You know what I mean, right?

189
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,538
Lord Kim is here.

190
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,938
Goodness. What is going on?

191
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,977
We had to verify Kim Si Yeol's identity,

192
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:45,258
so we brought him here.

193
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,139
Are you all right?

194
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:02,978
Yes,

195
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:05,139
my lord.

196
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:20,298
What happened?

197
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:23,069
Is Scholar Kim all right?

198
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,619
Do not worry.

199
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,978
It has all been sorted out.

200
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,659
Lean on my shoulder.

201
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,589
We cannot get out of here right now anyway.

202
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,099
So get some rest.

203
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,139
I do not need rest.

204
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,179
You are the one who is hurt.

205
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:13,419
Would you like...

206
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,498
to lean on me for a while?

207
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,589
- Go ahead. - Forget it.

208
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,218
I said I was fine, but you keep insisting.

209
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,418
That must have hurt. Let me see.

210
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,829
No, I...

211
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,349
We should probably sync our lips...

212
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:52,778
What?

213
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:56,018
I mean, our mouths...

214
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:01,738
No, not like that. I meant we should get our stories straight.

215
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,059
So last night...

216
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,338
You want to keep it a secret.

217
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,297
Right. If we get caught coming back together...

218
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,659
You already have been caught.

219
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,218
Yu Ha.

220
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,059
You did not even send word about where you were.

221
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,538
It does not matter. I am glad you are safe.

222
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,099
What do you mean it does not matter?

223
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,899
Scholar Kim, you have returned.

224
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,937
Innkeeper Yoon,

225
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,579
it is not like you to address me as if I am of higher status.

226
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:44,298
Scholar Kim, did you say?

227
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:45,978
I humbly apologize...

228
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:54,339
I mean...

229
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,298
I am relieved...

230
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,258
to see you back in one piece.

231
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,059
You must have had a dynamic evening.

232
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,819
Was it with San or Yu Ha?

233
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,778
Let us grab a bite. You must not have had breakfast.

234
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:12,419
Will it be your treat?

235
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,498
I would prefer baeksuk to gukbap.

236
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,859
Then, I will leave you to converse.

237
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:26,099
(Garden of Flowers)

238
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,498
Why on earth is she being awfully polite?

239
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,298
I tripped while out for drinks.

240
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:39,778
Do not tell me...

241
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,099
you were out all night searching for Snowflake.

242
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,179
That was hardly the case.

243
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:48,697
I still have a few days...

244
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:50,538
before I have to relinquish the inn to Master Jang.

245
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,339
I see.

246
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:54,938
I apologize.

247
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:59,218
From now on, I will try my best not to let this happen,

248
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:05,379
so do not be concerned.

249
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,659
All right. I will catch you later.

250
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:12,339
By the way,

251
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:14,938
Dan O...

252
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:19,859
Could you make some time for me sometime?

253
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:23,498
What is it? You can tell me right now.

254
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:26,498
No, not right now.

255
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:31,379
How about later around 6pm at Gwangtong Bridge?

256
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,978
Sounds good to me. I will see you then.

257
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,258
Kim Si Yeol, that punk, was let go?

258
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,498
Is he truly Lord Kim's son?

259
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,859
His illegitimacy kept him off the family tree.

260
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,298
Lord Kim Hong Ik was questioned last night,

261
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,819
so where do we go from here?

262
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,379
What I know for certain...

263
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,778
is that someone came by to protect him that day.

264
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,899
(Gwang Pavilion)

265
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:17,619
- Eunuch Yoon. - Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,938
Where did you say this book was found?

267
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:24,258
At the laundry site for court maids and ladies.

268
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,778
Read it out loud...

269
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,619
as if you were reading this for your friends at the laundry site.

270
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:39,418
If you refuse,

271
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,538
I will have the other court laundry maids read it as well.

272
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:47,339
Read it!

273
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,899
"The nation of vast land..."

274
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,139
"and rapid current..."

275
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,339
"will welcome an extraordinary being."

276
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:08,457
"He will enter this world..."

277
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,899
"having received his calling from the skies and..."

278
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,218
Keep reading.

279
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:27,938
"And become King."

280
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,139
Do not show me mercy!

281
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,419
Who do you believe will be King?

282
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,659
Who comes to mind?

283
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,819
Who will sit on the throne?

284
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,099
Your Majesty, there are too many eyes.

285
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,059
Please do not show me mercy.

286
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:58,859
Of course. I will do as you wish.

287
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:03,419
Your Majesty, please!

288
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,938
Your Majesty, what is the meaning of this?

289
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,978
You are showing disrespect toward your mother.

290
00:27:19,298 --> 00:27:21,858
How dare you mistreat a court maid of mine...

291
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,859
That court maid of yours had the audacity...

292
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,339
to harbour the will to rebel.

293
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,498
The will to rebel.

294
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,379
The will to rebel?

295
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:33,339
But this court maid...

296
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,218
Your Majesty.

297
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:14,659
How many more must die...

298
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,738
for you to be at ease?

299
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,659
("Book of Documents")

300
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,698
(Mokinhoe)

301
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,419
(Buyounggak)

302
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,778
I already told you...

303
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:00,457
that I had no information on Snowflake.

304
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,258
That is not why I am here today.

305
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:06,619
I have come...

306
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,938
to relinquish Garden of Flowers.

307
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:13,218
Then,

308
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:16,419
you should have gone to Master Jang.

309
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,059
I had a favour to ask.

310
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,538
I heard that Buyounggak would take over the ownership.

311
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:26,018
The state exam is right around the corner,

312
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:29,099
so please allow the scholars...

313
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,659
to have a room of their own.

314
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:36,099
You are moments away from being homeless,

315
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,218
but your concern is only for the scholars.

316
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,619
I ask that of you.

317
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:58,659
Who could she be protecting...

318
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,579
that has made her this fearless?

319
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,938
How could you?

320
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:18,139
Oh, dear. That must have hurt.

321
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:21,458
You should watch where you are going.

322
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:24,938
All you care about is how to seduce men.

323
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,339
No wonder you tripped.

324
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,179
Seduce men?

325
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:29,899
You say that about me?

326
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,579
You managed to seduce three into staying with you.

327
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:35,579
Three very handsome young men.

328
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,099
Just the handsome ones.

329
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,497
You and us, we all smile at men to earn a living.

330
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,099
We are the same.

331
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:43,659
Oh, come on.

332
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,258
Let go! What are you doing?

333
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,018
Not you again.

334
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,017
I am no pushover!

335
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:56,217
Watch yourself.

336
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:57,818
You are just as lowly as us.

337
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,978
I know. But...

338
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,258
do you know...

339
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:04,339
what happens to lowly people who threaten a noble?

340
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:07,498
Do you want to get punished?

341
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,379
The magistrate would beat you silly.

342
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,579
Wait and see.

343
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:19,778
Wait and see.

344
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:27,778
I hope you understand.

345
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:30,819
They get jealous of young noblewomen.

346
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,218
Thank you.

347
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,659
It cannot have been easy.

348
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,379
Do not thank me.

349
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,778
I was a noble once, you see.

350
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,659
What they said stung.

351
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,339
Your name is Ban Ya?

352
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,139
The next time we meet, we should do that.

353
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:53,059
Become friends.

354
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,859
I asked you over for a drink.

355
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:04,139
Between two who survived.

356
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,419
You are still beautiful despite...

357
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,379
the dreadful hardships.

358
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,498
The prince cherished you so.

359
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,978
Why would you bring up the past?

360
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:34,419
I heard Master Jang owns Buyounggak.

361
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:37,139
A prince's woman...

362
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:41,218
now works for a lowly official.

363
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,738
Do not put too much faith in Master Jang.

364
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,498
He is not one to keep your secrets.

365
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,139
Is that now why you have hidden your identity thus far?

366
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,379
Am I wrong?

367
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:00,579
No?

368
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:08,619
(Mokinhoe)

369
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,777
(Flower)

370
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,859
(Yihwahoe)

371
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,859
"Plum" and "flower?"

372
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:30,899
Some even say...

373
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,859
snowflake-like flowers are blooming on the plum tree.

374
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,018
"Snowflake-like flowers?"

375
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,179
That must mean Lee Seol.

376
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:52,298
If Lee Seol is the Mokinhoe leader,

377
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:54,139
this is treason.

378
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,099
Minister of War.

379
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:01,258
Track down the Mokinhoe base and their leader.

380
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:05,457
Search the whole nation and uproot the traitors.

381
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,498
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:19,988
Is it because of that woman?

383
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,738
The reason you had me look into Jang Tae Hwa.

384
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:26,418
So, did you look into him?

385
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,258
There were some surprising facts.

386
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:31,338
Like what?

387
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,898
Garden of Flowers and Master Jang.

388
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,018
The two families were supposed to be in-laws.

389
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,468
- In-laws? - Yes.

390
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,298
Jang Tae Hwa's son died before the wedding took place.

391
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:45,508
That is what happened...

392
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:48,139
to Dan O.

393
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:50,468
Her name was Hong Ju.

394
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,738
Garden of Flowers' older daughter...

395
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,987
soon followed her fiancé and died.

396
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,099
"Older daughter?"

397
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,619
Dan O had an older sister?

398
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:01,737
You did not know?

399
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:02,738
I did not.

400
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:07,378
How did Master Jang's son die?

401
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,738
I was unable to find that out.

402
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:19,579
What should we do now?

403
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:22,698
Garden of Flowers was our only shelter.

404
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:27,579
Do not tell the young masters.

405
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:30,298
I do not want them to feel bad...

406
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,738
or uncomfortable.

407
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,019
Still, you cannot leave...

408
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,818
without saying goodbye.

409
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:38,139
Maybe later.

410
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:42,059
Very well. I understand.

411
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,698
The mistress leaves...

412
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,738
while the guests remain.

413
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,818
I am sorry, Hong Ju.

414
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,418
I had no choice but to hand over the inn.

415
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,139
To keep everyone safe.

416
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,179
I understand.

417
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,738
If that was your decision,

418
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,508
that had to be the best option.

419
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,059
Why are you setting out...

420
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,619
the winter covers already?

421
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:19,658
It helps a lot to wash them beforehand.

422
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:21,988
Why? So you can leave?

423
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,019
Why are you avoiding me?

424
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:38,738
Is it related to how you address me differently now?

425
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:43,099
Oh, right. I forgot to put the rice on the stove.

426
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:45,858
Yoon Dan O.

427
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:58,698
Yesterday,

428
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,338
I saw everything.

429
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:04,139
At Master Jang's home.

430
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,378
I know...

431
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,619
who you are.

432
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:15,378
What?

433
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:19,418
Do you think...

434
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,858
I am Lee Seol?

435
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,019
Yes.

436
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,508
I had no idea you were so mistaken.

437
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,099
I am not Lee Seol.

438
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,508
I was questioned at the Department of Justice.

439
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:42,817
If I really were Snowflake,

440
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:45,378
there is no way they would have released me.

441
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:49,898
You do not believe me.

442
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,338
So what will you do now?

443
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,898
Will you hand over Garden of Flowers to Master Jang?

444
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:01,858
No.

445
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,218
I am protecting the family that lives here.

446
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,858
So no one will get hurt.

447
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:11,218
Then...

448
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,059
what about your sister?

449
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,099
What?

450
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:16,988
The young lady in the annex.

451
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,338
You knew about her?

452
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,139
Since when?

453
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,948
I knew long ago that she was no ghost.

454
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:30,298
I wondered why you would be hiding her,

455
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,778
then assumed it was your sister who was presumed dead.

456
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:37,778
Excuse me.

457
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:44,579
Is Young Master Jung in?

458
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:47,659
Yu Ha left early in the morning.

459
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:30,778
Yu Ha.

460
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:32,659
Why were you running?

461
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:34,338
You missed me that much?

462
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,139
No.

463
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:39,898
Your mother.

464
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,508
Your mother is gravely ill.

465
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,858
She might not last through the night.

466
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,818
Hold on.

467
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:17,139
You have not patched that hole yet?

468
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:19,539
He who dances must pay the piper.

469
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:22,378
Since I made that hole, I should patch it up for you.

470
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,508
Just leave it.

471
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,508
I know it is warm these days,

472
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,019
but a woman's window must not have such a large hole.

473
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:33,948
I feel like I can finally breathe,

474
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,988
thanks to that little window to the world.

475
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,218
So please...

476
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,059
just leave it.

477
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,059
May I visit you from time to time to keep you company?

478
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,298
They say silence means "Yes."

479
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:01,059
I trust that is true.

480
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,579
Your father...

481
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:40,858
left it for you.

482
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:46,179
I heard it was something very precious.

483
00:41:49,988 --> 00:41:53,659
The rest is yours too.

484
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:56,468
Claim your inheritance.

485
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:58,858
"Inheritance?" What do you mean?

486
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,579
You took me in and took care of me all this time...

487
00:42:09,378 --> 00:42:10,619
It is over...

488
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,818
It truly is over now.

489
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:18,898
I was...

490
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:22,179
always afraid.

491
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:29,378
That you, who is not of the family's blood,

492
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,468
would cause trouble for us.

493
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,418
Yes. I was always grateful to you...

494
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,298
for taking me in...

495
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:42,019
even though you knew everything.

496
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:46,698
Now,

497
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:49,818
you must...

498
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:53,298
sever all ties...

499
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,778
with the family.

500
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:12,099
Mother.

501
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:15,378
Mother!

502
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,898
Mother!

503
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:19,818
Mother...

504
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,858
- How could this happen? - No.

505
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:31,218
Mother.

506
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:32,988
Mother.

507
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:36,298
How could you breathe your last in front of him?

508
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,659
You disgusting rat.

509
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:42,099
If you got what you wanted, get lost!

510
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:49,939
I implore you...

511
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,258
to please let me attend her funeral.

512
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,019
Please. I beg you, Young Master.

513
00:44:00,298 --> 00:44:01,939
How dare you. You were born to a mistress.

514
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,539
Must you insult my mother even at her funeral?

515
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,218
Get lost!

516
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:13,939
Mother...

517
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:17,338
Mother.

518
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,418
Mother...

519
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,539
No need to try.

520
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,539
You need not try to comfort me.

521
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:17,418
I am not even her child, but she kindly took me in and raised me.

522
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,218
I just feel horrible...

523
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:22,579
that I cannot even attend her funeral.

524
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:26,378
For the first time in a long while,

525
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,499
I was reminded of my father.

526
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,539
I found something.

527
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:37,939
What did you find?

528
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:40,539
A memory.

529
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:45,059
In the shape of a fish. It is very small and shiny.

530
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:47,818
What?

531
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,659
That tiny, shiny object...

532
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:53,459
instantly made me think of my father's face.

533
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,298
I had forgotten all about him for so long.

534
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,738
I am a terrible daughter, am I not?

535
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,218
No.

536
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,459
"You grew up to be such a strong woman. I am proud of you."

537
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:11,778
He will surely say that.

538
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:20,738
I am truly proud of you too.

539
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:28,539
Oh, right. I forgot to ask.

540
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,098
What?

541
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:31,658
You wanted to talk to me about something.

542
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,698
You said to meet you on the Gwangtong Bridge.

543
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,338
Oh, that.

544
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,139
Maybe another time.

545
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,298
We will talk another time.

546
00:46:57,459 --> 00:47:00,418
I heard his mother was gravely ill. Why is he already back?

547
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:03,218
Do not be so nosy.

548
00:47:22,898 --> 00:47:23,898
Jung Yu Ha.

549
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:28,019
I do not know how to comfort others.

550
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:31,059
- What? - That said,

551
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:34,298
how about we just have a few drinks together?

552
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,338
Let me.

553
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:00,218
Have some food too.

554
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,659
Your stomach will get upset.

555
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:06,338
What has gotten into you? You are looking out for Yu Ha?

556
00:48:11,418 --> 00:48:12,539
Pour me some too.

557
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:17,218
The wine.

558
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:18,979
You wish to drink?

559
00:48:19,218 --> 00:48:21,418
Dan O, you can drink?

560
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,059
Who cares? Innkeeper Yoon is an adult too.

00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:45,698
Have you seen Dan O and Ms. Naju?

565
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,179
No, I have not.

566
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:49,298
Yuk Ho is not here either.

567
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:07,139
Where is Dan O?

568
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:13,099
She said she would contact us once she found a place to stay.

569
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,099
Dan O is one decisive lady.

570
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:19,619
She did not even give us time to talk her out of it.

571
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:26,738
I was terrified...

572
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:30,418
when I saw you in the palanquin the day you got hurt.

573
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:33,019
I thought I would never see you again.

574
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:35,939
So please,

575
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:38,298
do not get hurt.

576
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,738
No way.

577
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,179
Was it for my sake?

578
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:57,019
It must have been chilly throughout the night.

579
00:50:57,939 --> 00:51:00,338
Because the room had stayed empty for years...

580
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:01,738
It is all right.

581
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:05,459
I hope you can let me stay until I find a place to live.

582
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:08,338

583

00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:23,818
Sure.

587
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,378
What are you doing here?

588
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,778
- Did you follow me here? - That is correct.

589
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:34,218
Tell me...

590
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,698
where Dan O is.

591
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:42,499
Do not be this way...

592
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:44,618
when I already have a headache.

593
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:46,258

(Capital District Office)

596
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:59,218
A message was sent from Garden of Flowers.

597
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,979
I will vacate the inn.

598
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:12,818
Garden of Flowers...

599
00:52:13,818 --> 00:52:14,858
is yours.

600
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:19,178
The fact that she is relinquishing it...

601
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,858
It means she is done searching for Lee Seol.

602
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:28,338
Yoon Dan O. That girl.

603
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:30,778
He made it clear...

604
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:33,539
that I was not to approach her.

605
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:38,539
I wonder why the watchman sought out Chief Eunuch.

606
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:41,897
- Pardon? - The watchman only comes out...

607
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:43,019
from the shadows...

608
00:52:44,698 --> 00:52:47,019
when his master is in danger.

609
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,099
I know of him.

She has found...

614
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,099
Snowflake.

615
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:09,059
How else...

616
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:12,698
would the watchman know Yoon Dan O by name?

619

will be in his possession.

620
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:30,778
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

621
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:41,858
What on earth?

622
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,298
The master bedroom is empty,

623
00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:47,059
and the young scholars are nowhere to be seen.

624
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:22,139
Find where Dan O is.

625
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:24,979
I must talk to her.

626

She cannot stay at the temple forever.

630

We must discuss her options.

631
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,257
I agree, but...

632
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:42,258
That reminds me.

633
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,258
Do not tell her that Master Jang ordered our rooms to be searched.

634
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:47,138
It will only worry her.

635
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,139
Of course.

636
00:54:48,698 --> 00:54:50,697
You would have been furious too...

637
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,179
if you had seen them ransack the place.

638
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:18,019
My gosh.

639
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,659
How did you find me here?

640
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:23,818
I asked him to tell me where you were.

641
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:27,698
I wonder how Ms. Naju is doing.

642

Ms. Naju?

643
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,218
She went to the stream for some water.

644
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,218
Have you both had breakfast?

645
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,738
No, we have not.

646
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,218
And on our way here,

647
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:41,539
Yu Ha kept complaining about how hungry he was.

648
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,059
Did I?

649
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,258
Are you hungry?

650
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:49,298
Wait a few moments, then. I should start cooking the rice.

651
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,019
Sure.

652
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,139
Are you not hungry?

653
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:12,939

Yu Ha's here.

656
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,059
All right. I will.

657
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,778
My lady!

658
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:25,139
My gosh.

659
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:26,499
We are in trouble.

- Master Jang... - Master Jang?

661
00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:30,618
I do not know for what reason,

662
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:33,378
but he is on his way here with his men.

663
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:36,898
It is nothing to be concerned about.

664
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:39,059
Stay here while I talk to him.

665
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,018
Be careful. If anything happens...

666
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,019
Do not worry.

667
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,738
You must stay inside though. You know that, right?

668
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:53,298
I know what I will do.

669
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:56,539
I will go meet Master Jang.

670
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,539
Ms. Naju.

671
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:20,898
Master Jang...

672
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,738
Master Jang?

673
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,019
What brings you by?

674
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:34,059
I am in search of someone.

675
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:35,738
What does this concern?

676
00:57:40,338 --> 00:57:42,258
I relinquished Garden of Flowers,

677
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:43,818
so why are you...

678
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:50,459
What is the meaning of this? What did she do wrong?

679
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:54,659
Young Master!

680
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,019
What is the meaning of this?

681
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:58,539
Dan O!

682
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:00,019
Do you not fear the skies?

683
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:01,218
That is enough!

684
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:04,258
My lady!

685
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,619
You had the audacity...

686
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:16,179
to keep something from me.

687
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:19,858
You have found Lee Seol.

688
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,099
Who is he?

689
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:37,298
This is your last warning.

690
00:58:38,499 --> 00:58:39,499
Answer me.

691
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:08,298
The watchman greets us.

(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

693
00:59:40,698 --> 00:59:42,897
The slayer has stopped dropping bodies?

694
00:59:42,898 --> 00:59:44,498
I have seen countless people lose their lives...

695
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,297
as a result of their involvement in royal affairs.

696
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:48,297
Are you saying you have not found Snowflake?

697
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:50,939
That person will lead us to Lee Seol and the watchman.

698
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:53,857
Cleverly weigh your options...

699
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:57,058
and side with the one you will benefit the most from.

700
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,217
You are not like other women,

701
00:59:58,218 --> 00:59:59,978
which is why I have grown to like you.

702
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,539
Have your feelings for her deepened that greatly?

703
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:03,218
You are willing to protect her...

704
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,099
even if it costs you your principles and your life.

705
01:00:05,378 --> 01:00:06,378
It happened that way,

706
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,738
so protect Dan O in the best way that you can...

707
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:10,378
for I will do the same.
