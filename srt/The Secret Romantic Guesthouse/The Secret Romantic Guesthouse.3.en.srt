00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,968
(Shin Ye Eun)

2
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,808
(Kang Hoon)

3
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,289
(Jung Gun Joo)

4
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,609
(Ryeo Un)

5
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:47,208
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

6
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:50,208
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,169
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,421
Who are you?

9
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,141
Are you asking for my name?

10
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,460
If we meet again, I will tell you then.

11
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,541
My name.

12
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,981
(13 years later)

13
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:05,381
Garden of Flowers guarantees a pass.

14
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,222
Come and stay at Garden of Flowers.

15
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:08,870
Big fish spotted.

16
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,582
Did you see my bag? It was over there.

17
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,700
There is an inn called Garden of Flowers.

18
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,510
It was you. You are the thief.

19
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:15,540
What...

20
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,581
My lady!

21
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:17,662
We meet again.

22
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,101
But look.

23
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:20,900
My cheek is still swollen.

24
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,510
Did something happen during the day?

25
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,901
You all seem to be around Yu Ha's age,

26
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,781
so I will address you by your names as well.

27
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:27,820
Our names?

28
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,302
Will I have an heir?

29
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:32,141
I do not see a son in your future.

30
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:35,222
There is something more important.

31
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,060
Your being.

32
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,941
I trust you will do so, Lord Sin.

33
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,540
I will eliminate them all.

34
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,501
If you lose Lee Seol again like before...

35
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,381
That will not happen.

36
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:46,742
You must have learned a lesson that day.

37
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,620
Hyun!

38
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,661
Garden of Flowers is the last inn on the list.

39
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:54,821
The deposed grand heir Lee Seol might be there.

40
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,661
Your father took out a loan before his passing.

41
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:58,820
A hundred nyang to be exact.

42
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,701
Who loaned him such a large amount of money?

43
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,260
It was Master Jang Tae Hwa.

44
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,941
It is the promissory note your father wrote.

45
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,742
What if I found him for you?

46
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:09,222
What?

47
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:10,941
Snowflake.

48
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,581
The deposed grand heir that disappeared.

49
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:13,912
Lee Seol.

50
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,381
(Episode 3)

51
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:19,782
A traitor you must search all of Jungchon for.

52
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:22,861
There can be only one.

53
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,942
The deposed heir who vanished.

54
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,342
Lee Seol.

55
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,541
You are your father's daughter.

56
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,662
You bluff so fearlessly.

57
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,261
However,

58
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,342
you have nothing to lose.

59
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:53,981
What?

60
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,502
You find Snowflake...

61
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,102
or take my Garden of Flowers.

62
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,782
You earn one or the other.

63
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,421
How am I to trust you?

64
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,421
I spent the past ten or so years running an inn.

65
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,662
No innkeeper in Jungchon knows as much as I.

66
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:14,701
If Snowflake is in Jungchon,

67
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:18,021
the one most suited to find him...

68
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,301
would be I.

69
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,581
Then...

70
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,021
you must know how many noblemen are staying at Buyounggak.

71
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,141
Yes. There are 59.

72
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,942
There are 51.

73
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:39,062
You bluffed your way too far.

74
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,502
More guests checked in yesterday.

75
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,622
I know well...

76
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,421
because we supply Buyounggak with refreshments.

77
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:52,861
I will give you one month.

78
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,821
If you cannot find Lee Seol by then,

79
00:03:58,182 --> 00:03:59,861
Garden of Flowers will be mine forever.

80
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,621
(Buyounggak)

81
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,181
My lord.

82
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:12,981
Okay.

83
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,582
- My lord. - Excuse me, my lord.

84
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,621
Who could it be?

85
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,061
You are...

86
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,142
Garden of Flowers' innkeeper.

87
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,262
What business do you have here?

88
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,060
Are you here to see me?

89
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,421
I heard you frequent Buyounggak,

90
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,301
so I came by, just in case.

91
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,262
You will find the deposed heir?

92
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:05,702
I was quite bored, and you just filled me with amusement.

93
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:13,861
You served Snowflake closely and personally.

94
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,381
You must know his features well.

95
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:19,781
If you were to tell me anything...

96
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,181
Have you even imagined...

97
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:26,541
where Snowflake could be and with what appearance?

98
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:31,262
He could be much closer than you think,

99
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,782
or much farther than you think.

100
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:38,582
No one can know for sure.

101
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,181
Wherever he may be,

102
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,381
I will find him.

103
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,782
Where was she at?

104
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,181
(Garden of Flowers)

105
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,142
What? You will go where?

106
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:20,981
To Gwacheon-hyeon.

107
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,702
It will take me a full day even if I were to leave now.

108
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,022
A two-day round trip?

109
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,222
We must eat Ms. Naju's food for two days straight?

110
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,981
My gosh. I really hate that thought.

111
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,262
Gwacheon is too far away.

112
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,822
And the roads are rough.

113
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,861
Yes, Yu Ha is right.

114
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,142
You cannot take the Namtaeryeong Pass on your own.

115
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:44,501
I must go. It is very important to me.

116
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,941
Let me accompany you, then.

117
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,662
The state exam is not far off.

118
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,981
You cannot waste your time.

119
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,222
It is too dangerous a trip to make alone.

120
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:00,262
I heard the district guards accompany travelers.

121
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,301
I will be back soon and safe.

122
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,582
You might not make it back.

123
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,021
- What? - So many...

124
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:09,981
lost their lives to a tiger.

125
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:26,741
I sent Ms. Naju on an errand.

126
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,941
Talk to her for me when she gets back.

127
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,621
(Sungnyemun Gate)

128
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,381
Wait.

129
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:48,981
There is one thing I did not mention yet.

130
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,901
What is that?

131
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,821
I heard a servant of the deposed crown princess' family...

132
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,432
lives in Gwacheon-hyeon.

133
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:59,621
His name is Muk Soe, I believe?

134
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,141
Thank you.

135
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,620
Thank you so much, my lord.

136
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,062
Do not thank me.

137
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,192
I am curious as to how this will play out.

138
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,192
So many lost their lives to a tiger.

139
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:26,621
My gosh.

140
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,741
Yu Ha?

141
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:53,501
Why are you...

142
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,861
I could not focus on my studies.

143
00:09:58,552 --> 00:09:59,741
I came out for a walk.

144
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,942
Watch out.

145
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,020
A snake...

146
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,660
Where? Where is it?

147
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,702
There could be one.

148
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,021
Why did you come this far when you are so timid?

149
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,222
I am not timid.

150
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,462
I was very slightly startled. That is all.

151
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,861
Hey!

152
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:26,342
Darn it.

153
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,432
You left me out? That hurts bad.

154
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:36,192
You are wearing that for a long trip?

155
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,312
I think my shoes have moved on to the afterlife.

156
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,552
You want to tag along as well?

157
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:45,661
Do not thank me.

158
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:49,942
My only joy in life is to travel the nation.

159
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,661
Why are you even here?

160
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:55,901
You should be studying.

161
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,741
What a nuisance.

162
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:04,462
Is she grateful?

163
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:06,582
Very much so.

164
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,702
Kang San talked about a tiger,

165
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:16,901
but that was all a lie.

166
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,661
I was told Gwacheon-hyeon was right on the other side.

167
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,422
Which way is it?

168
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,582
When did you get a compass?

169
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,661
I suppose you came prepared for this long journey.

170
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:37,941
- Gosh! - What is that?

171
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:39,061
- Oh, no. Bandits! - What is going on?

172
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,780
- Hey! - Bandits are here!

173
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,261
- Run! - Bandits!

174
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,981
Those fools.

175
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,182
You said you were headed to Gwacheon-hyeon, right?

176
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,500
This is a shortcut.

177
00:11:58,501 --> 00:11:59,581
Take this shortcut.

178
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:01,141
I see. Thank you.

179
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,861
But why are you helping us?

180
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,702
Well, that is...

181
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,021
That is because...

182
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:16,901
You seem quite flustered. This is all very suspicious.

183
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:22,581
Please excuse us. We have urgent matters to attend to.

184
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:24,102
- Come on, boys. We must hurry. - Let us go.

185
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,342
Come on! Quick!

186
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,861
Hurry!

187
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:28,901
Let us go.

188
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:38,422
Stop!

189
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,821
Oh, no. We took a wrong turn.

190
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:57,020
Boys, it is that mountain over there.

191
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,021
It is that mountain!

192
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,582
- Come on! - Hey, Bong Sik!

193
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,261
Hey, tiger.

194
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,542
Hello, Young Master.

195
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:24,981
Excuse me.

196
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,741
Do you know Muk Soe's father?

197
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:35,422
Excuse me.

198
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,341
Do you happen to know Muk Soe's father?

199
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,422
No, I do not know.

200
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,302
Do you happen to know Muk Soe's father?

201
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,222
I believe he lives in the upper village.

202
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:47,861
Thank you.

203
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:50,582
We found him.

204
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:53,741
Oh.

205
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,501
What is it?

206
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,901
I swear, I saw Kang San just now.

207
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,422
No way.

208
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,821
He has no interest in other people's business.

209
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:04,901
There is no way he came here.

210
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:06,861
You think so?

211
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:15,302
- How about this one? - Come and look!

212
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,421
- Hello. - May I have a look at this?

213
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:18,981
- Feel free to browse around. - How much is this?

214
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:20,741
- Only five nyang. - Come and look.

215
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:22,621
Come and have a look!

216
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,421
The woman and scholars who were here. Which way did they go?

217
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:35,621
Oh, I do not know.

218
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:40,222
See? I told you.

219
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:41,981
I told you it was Kang San.

220
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:46,222
Were you that worried about us?

221
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,582
You have a heart too, after all.

222
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:54,781
Worried, my foot!

223
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,421
Yuk Ho sent me.

224
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:00,501
He did?

225
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:03,141
Yes. He kept pestering me to follow you guys,

226
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,701
saying it could be dangerous.

227
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,780
He never said anything like that to me.

228
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,781
That is because you...

229
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:09,942
You cannot fight with a sword.

230
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,021
All you can do is spend money.

231
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:14,582
That is not even a real sword.

232
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:23,822
I bet you are here for you were worried about me.

233
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:25,342
Why would I be worried about you?

234
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:27,302
I am here because Yuk Ho...

235
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,501
Since when were you so obedient to him?

236
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,861
I always respect and obey my elders.

237
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:37,021
Then why did you hide?

238
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,821
You clearly had a reason to hide...

239
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:39,861
- Which one is better? - Correct.

240
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,781
You are right.

241
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,021
You are the reason I came.

242
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,422
Because I was worried.

243
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,582
Because I do not wish you harm.

244
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,981
Is that what you wanted to hear?

245
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,581
No, do not get the wrong idea!

246
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,822
Oh, boy. Which one? I want this one.

247
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:16,621
Hurry. The sun will go down soon.

248
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,272
You seem to be doing well.

249
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,821
You were banished from the palace.

250
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,141
Someone must be feeding you and taking care of you.

251
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,752
Is it Lee Seol?

252
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,861
Have you met Lee Seol?

253
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,381
Once I start talking,

254
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,941
I will meet my demise with Snowflake.

255
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,661
Hence, I cannot answer that question.

256
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,181
You still cannot abandon your loyalty?

257
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:53,271
The Crown Prince has passed away.

258
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,782
"Loyalty," you say?

259
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:57,901
I, No Sung Gil,

260
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,022
am not a loyal person.

261
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,421
I am a mere businessman.

262
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,302
Then you are making a miscalculated move.

263
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,302
Lee Seol will not spare you.

264
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,542
Well...

265
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,421
You never know.

266
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,141
Fine.

267
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,421
Then let me tell you...

268
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,621
what the future has in store for you.

269
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,900
- Your Majesty, please calm down. - Step aside.

270
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,512
We will need a witness when we find the deposed heir.

271
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,342
This is all I can offer you.

272
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:24,822
That is fine.

273
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:30,272
Even a young noble lady is looking for His Highness now?

274
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,542
Right.

275
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,272
His name is too mighty...

276
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,062
to be forgotten over time.

277
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:40,941
If there is anything you know,

278
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,141
please tell me.

279
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,381
Sure thing.

280
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,512
When His Highness was little,

281
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,381
he often stayed at his private residence...

282
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:53,661
until the day when that incident occurred.

283
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:04,822
Your Highness, you must get out of here at once!

284
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:06,782
- Come on. - Let us hurry.

285
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,420
Mother!

286
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,901
- You must go. - No!

287
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:39,620
Your Highness.

288
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,380
You must protect him.

289
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:42,941
Mother, no!

290
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:46,700
You must come with us. Please get up.

291
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,621
No, we must go!

292
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:53,542
- We must leave. - No, Mother!

293
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,582
- We must get out of here! - Mother!

294
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,421
After that incident,

295
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:02,272
his nanny raised him.

296
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:04,272
But...

297
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,221
how do you know that he was raised...

298
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,701
by his nanny?

299
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:14,621
Was it when he was 13 years old?

300
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,822
The nanny came to see me, saying she needed money.

301
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:20,701
Money?

302
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,302
She was planning...

303
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:26,621
to find a family who would adopt him.

304
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:31,621
They had to live in hiding because of those who were after him.

305
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:35,941
It was the best way to keep him safe.

306
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:37,700
Which family took him in?

307
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:40,701
That I do not know.

308
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,221
Knowing that fact could bring me trouble,

309
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:45,861
which is why I did not ask.

310
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,992
Is the nanny still alive?

311
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:54,502
An illness found her while she was on the run.

312
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,022
After arranging His Highness' adoption,

313
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:01,381
she died within ten days.

314
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:03,941
Then,

315
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:07,302
at least inform me of His Highness' facial features.

316
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:16,302
His bushy eyebrows...

317
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,901
resembled the shape of a delicate crescent moon.

318
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:23,062
And his big eyes were as clear as the sky.

319
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:28,701
He had a sharp but straight nose,

320
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,901
his lips were plump,

321
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,062
and the corners of his lips were turned upward.

322
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,701
So all in all,

323
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,220
he must be quite handsome.

324
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:45,062
That is correct. He was a good looking young man.

325
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:48,582
His most prominent feature though...

326
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,022
is his ankle.

327
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,661
He has a red spot above his ankle bone.

328
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,181
One that is crimson red.

329
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,381
Did your conversation go well?

330
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:18,941
Yes.

331
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,262
I put you all out and dragged you out of town.

332
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,221
Come on. Let me treat you to a meal.

333
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:27,822
But you do not have any money.

334
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,221
I have enough to buy some gukbap.

335
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,861
How about rice wine?

336
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,661
I would love some rice wine to go with the gukbap.

337
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,181
By the way, who did you come all this way to meet?

338
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:42,062
Well...

339
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,262
A friend of my father's lives here.

340
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,381
He befriended a servant?

341
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:49,661
Anyone can tell...

342
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:53,822
He befriended anyone regardless of their social status.

343
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:56,542
I know a creative lie when I hear one.

344
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:05,822
Goodness.

345
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,262
My gosh. You are back.

346
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,901
Why are you the only ones back?

347
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,261
Did something happen to Lady Dan O?

348
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,421
- Of course not. - Of course not.

349
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,102
She had business at Jungchon, so we parted ways.

350
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:34,301
Do not be concerned.

351
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,342
She returned safely from Gwacheon-hyeon.

352
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:37,901
Right.

353
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,102
My goodness.

354
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:58,542
San. You know something.

355
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,620
What do you think I know?

356
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:02,421
Why Dan O has been acting this way.

357
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,181
It was not like you to follow her to Gwacheon.

358
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:07,341
What if I knew?

359
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,782
Tell me.

360
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:11,101
I should also know why.

361
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:12,141
I am clueless.

362
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:14,542
But even if I knew,

363
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,621
I am not obligated to tell you.

364
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,701
(Buyounggak)

365
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:40,901
A red spot.

366
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:44,302
A red spot? Have you seen it before?

367
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:47,701
No, not me.

368
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:50,342
Can it be on the foot? What if it was black?

369
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:55,502
I know a scholar who has a red spot on his toe.

370
00:25:56,102 --> 00:25:59,180
It looked like a watermelon seed.

371
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,742
It has to be above the ankle bone.

372
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:04,302
Really? I am sorry we could not help.

373
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:05,582
Do not fret.

374
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:08,502
But tell me next time if you see who I described.

375
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,022
I will bring you more yakgwa.

376
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:11,941
- Sure. - Sure.

377
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:22,542
It is a red spot.

378
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:30,782
A red spot?

379
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:35,262
I have not come across a scholar with one. What about you?

380
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,661
Same here.

381
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,262
It is rare for a scholar to have a red spot on the skin.

382
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:42,901
Goodness.

383
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:45,102
Is it just me, or is this too flashy?

384
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:50,141
Are you giving and then taking?

385
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:55,461
Think long and hard.

386
00:26:56,302 --> 00:26:58,221
The first one who talks will get this.

387
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:01,782
What is the meaning of this?

388
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:16,822
Either way, I apologize for any inconvenience.

389
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:22,022
Last night,

390
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,502
you went to see Master Jang.

391
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,582
I already told you...

392
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,461
that I would not relinquish my inn.

393
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:34,701
As if being an innkeeper is that important.

394
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:36,621
It is hardly worth your life.

395
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:40,102
You have no idea...

396
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:44,221
how reckless and dangerous this escapade of yours is.

397
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:48,102
Do not look for him.

398
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,061
More than a few have lost their lives...

399
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:52,181
searching for Snowflake.

400
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:08,621
(Buyounggak)

401
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:29,062
You there. Inform the madame that Ban Ya is here.

402
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:32,822
Do not waste my time.

403
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:35,102
Chop-chop.

404
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,582
My lady, I thought you had already left.

405
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,420
I was just on my way out.

406
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:42,421
Sure.

407
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:46,981
Do not worry about it.

408
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,181
I am mistaken often due to how I dress.

409
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,581
If you are looking for the madame,

410
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,262
try the room at the far end after turning the corner.

411
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:12,861
It is you.

412
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:18,701
The lady of noble birth who became a kisaeng.

413
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,421
You cleaned up well though.

414
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:23,221
Maybe your hardships were minuscule.

415
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,620
Look at you all stiff.

416
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,302
She must still think she is of noble birth.

417
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:34,661
You pretentious snob.

418
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:41,541
Say that again.

419
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:42,582
You!

420
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:45,141
What was that?

421
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,582
Let her go.

422
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:02,022
Ban Ya, was it?

423
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,461
At your last kisaeng house, you could not serve flower tea...

424
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,582
and only caused trouble.

425
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:13,181
This is your last day being a menace.

426
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,700
You cannot do this to me.

427
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,022
What exactly are you anyway?

428
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:22,221
You are a kisaeng. It is time you accepted that.

429
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,381
I only agreed to take you in...

430
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,861
at Master Jang's request.

431
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,582
Cause a scene again, and I will throw you out barefooted.

432
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:36,262
Heed my warning.

433
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,901
Hey. How long have you been following me?

434
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,302
From over there.

435
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:03,262
You should have called out.

436
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,861
But you were ahead of me.

437
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:07,782
It is nice to walk together because it is less boring.

438
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:11,342
I walk fine on my own without getting bored.

439
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:16,102
San.

440
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,901
I bet you do not have any friends.

441
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,181
- What? - Gosh.

442
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,381
I do not have many myself,

443
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,661
but you...

444
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:31,542
There is a lot about me that you do not know.

445
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:35,822
By the way,

446
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:37,822
I heard you did well in the exam.

447
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,221
Si Yeol is such a gossip.

448
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,781
You owe it to my taffy.

449
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:44,981
Do not forget that...

450
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:47,541
I played a huge part in your passing the exam.

451
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,061
I have not even passed yet.

452
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:50,062
Come on.

453
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:54,021
You will so obviously pass, no problem.

454
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:55,022
What?

455
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:58,582
I bet even barbarians cower when you are around.

456
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,421
You are Joseon's greatest fighter.

457
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:12,901
What are you doing?

458
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:14,582
Hiding from Ms. Naju.

459
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,221
She left early to look for you.

460
00:32:22,582 --> 00:32:23,582
I see.

461
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,141
Why are you...

462
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,822
always out and about?

463
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,542
You even spent a whole day traveling to Gwacheon.

464
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:38,421
I have so much energy is why.

465
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:44,102
It does not seem to be making you any money.

466
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:49,221
Are you...

467
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:51,221
looking for someone?

468
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:52,582
What?

469
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,941
What on earth...

470
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:58,302
No. Who could I be looking for?

471
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,102
Here.

472
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,621
You have a healthy appetite.

473
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:51,582
My Bok Sil liked this as well.

474
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:58,701
Bok Sil.

475
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:05,022
Who are you?

476
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,262
I wonder how he is doing.

477
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:15,741
Why wonder about him when I am struggling?

478
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,502
Right, Bok Sil?

479
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,821
(Buyounggak)

480
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:26,821
I must find the court lady who served Royal Consort Park?

481
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,221
How, when she left the palace?

482
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:35,982
Then...

483
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:38,911
Keep moving.

484
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,781
Wait.

485
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:51,941
Something bothers me,

486
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,741
and I must confirm it.

487
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:56,741
Yes, my lord.

488
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:58,301
My lord.

489
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,431
Leave.

490
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,181
You asked to see me, Lord Sin?

491
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:41,431
A watchman, did you say?

492
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:47,982
That day, 8 years ago, he cut down 6 warriors.

493
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,431
Yes.

494
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:55,661
A shadow of a man who follows family tradition to guard royals.

495
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:58,701
Snowflake's watchman was especially skilled.

496
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:01,781
A young man as if possessed by an evil spirit.

497
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,062
He will have gotten better...

498
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:07,741
as he aged and gained muscle.

499
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:12,982
Your only son was one of the six who died.

500
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:16,942
An only son in the third generation in a row.

501
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,701
What are you truly after?

502
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:30,582
Is it Lee Seol?

503
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:33,062
Or...

504
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,341
the watchman?

505
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,661
The watchman is always close to Lee Seol.

506
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,582
When his master is in danger,

507
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,701
he appears without fail.

508
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:57,542
Finding him...

509
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,141
is like finding Lee Seol.

510
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,431
I do not care what happens to the watchman.

511
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:08,942
However...

512
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:12,341
I want Lee Seol alive.

513
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:56,341
Come on out. I saw you hide!

514
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:01,221
Long time no see, Ms. Naju.

515
00:38:02,102 --> 00:38:03,102
My lady!

516
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:05,102
I got back safely.

517
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:07,741
See? I was not hurt.

518
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:12,942
Why did you go as far as Gwacheon?

519
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,542
Well...

520
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:18,301
Master Jang gave me a month's time.

521
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:20,301
In return for completing a task.

522
00:38:21,221 --> 00:38:25,022
You are usually so smart, so why are you being so foolish now?

523
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,180
Where will you get that much money in one month?

524
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,661
I have...

525
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,341
an idea.

526
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,981
You just trust me and help.

527
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:34,982
My lady!

528
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,062
I would...

529
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:51,181
love to take another option if there were one.

530
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:55,502
But there are none.

531
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,341
My lady.

532
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:09,141
If Master Jang takes over Garden of Flowers,

533
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,261
what we tried hard to hide will come out.

534
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:23,341
My gosh.

535
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,261
She has a severe case of smallpox.

536
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,781
You do not watch to catch it.

537
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:38,871
I told you...

538
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:42,341
what a widow should do to make an example of herself.

539
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:43,911
Do you...

540
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,431
truly want the princess to take her own life?

541
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:53,821
This happened because she tried just too hard to stay alive.

542
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:22,701
We will all end up in danger.

543
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:26,301
I am not sure...

544
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:30,221
I can handle the aftermath.

545
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:32,821
I know that.

546
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,181
I get it.

547
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,621
But I get so afraid.

548
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,301
That you will get hurt.

549
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,701
Did you see Dan O?

550
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,741
I am so hungry.

551
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:05,870
You are all here.

552
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,022
I had made a late-night snack.

553
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:09,871
What snack?

554
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:11,431
I am fine.

555
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:12,821
Ms. Naju!

556
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:22,821
Thanks, but no thanks.

557
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,431
Snacking will make me sleepy, and I must study.

558
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:27,621
Very well.

559
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:28,982
See you.

560
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:39,300
You accompanied her all the way to Gwacheon.

561
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:42,062
My gosh. Thank you so much.

562
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:45,260
Thanks to you scholars,

563
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:47,911
I can put my worries to rest.

564
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:50,621
Oh, why...

565
00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:52,821
Why only me?

566
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:57,102
Must you express your gratitude in this manner?

567
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,062
Is it because you poured your heart into this?

568
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:00,982
I have never seen such a huge rice ball.

569
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:05,260
You see, I would like to study too.

570
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,341
You? As if.

571
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,871
Shall we eat inside?

572
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:16,871
I'm right behind you.

573
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:21,911
What?

574
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:30,181
Yes, this is it.

575
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:32,221
Eat slowly.

576
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:45,102
Dan O, are you not hungry? You should eat with us.

577
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:46,941
No, I am good.

578
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,821
Just leave the dishes outside once you are done.

579
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,701
By the way, do you not think Dan O has been acting a little strange?

580
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:12,981
I suppose it is because of the debt.

581
00:43:12,982 --> 00:43:14,701
She went all the way to Gwacheon, you know.

582
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:16,391
What is she up to?

583
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:19,141
I wonder too.

584
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,661
Kang San.

585
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:26,621
That look on your face tells me you know something.

586
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:34,821
Right, even Yu Ha has no idea. How would you know?

587
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:41,542
Do you think I am a nice guy?

588
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,181
Ouch, it hurts.

589
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:11,341
He has a red spot above his ankle bone.

590
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:13,422
It is crimson red.

591
00:44:18,862 --> 00:44:21,382
How can I check his ankle bone?

592
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:35,382
Is he tired?

593
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,661
Why is he dozing off here? It must be uncomfortable.

594
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,701
His bushy eyebrows...

595
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:59,542
resembled the shape of a delicate crescent moon.

596
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,701
And his big eyes were as clear as the sky.

597
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:08,341
He had a sharp but straight nose,

598
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,862
his lips were plump,

599
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:15,062
and the corners of his lips were turned upward.

600
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:17,781
It is as if he were describing San.

601
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:26,862
He has a red spot above his ankle bone.

602
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:06,862
What are you doing?

603
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:10,661
Nothing. I was not doing anything.

604
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:12,301
You were trying to undress me.

605
00:46:12,422 --> 00:46:15,581
Undress you? What are you talking about?

606
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:16,701
I saw everything.

607
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:20,902
You untied the strings and pulled this up...

608
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,942
Gosh.

609
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:09,062
Why did you have to talk such nonsense?

610
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:11,101
You are going to play dumb?

611
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:13,422
The strings came undone, so I was trying to tie them for you.

612
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:15,180
You had no idea.

613
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,301
You should never falsely accuse others.

614
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:22,022
Tie them already.

615
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:28,301
Oh, Yu Ha!

616
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:30,422
Are you busy today?

617
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:32,982
No, I am not busy.

618
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:37,661
You know Hwang's fabric store by the village entrance, right?

619
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:39,421
If you buy fabrics from that store,

620
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,102
they will make clothes for you.

621
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:44,781
You should get a new outfit. Autumn is just around the corner.

622
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:46,661
I have a lot of clothes.

623
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:48,422
I own six different outfits for autumn.

624
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:51,502
Oh, you do?

625
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,821
I need new fall outfits!

626
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,781
Why are you coming out of the dog's house?

627
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:06,341
Bok Sil loves me, you see.

628
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:08,621
Bok Sil keeps wagging its tail at me.

629
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,221
Do not tell me you sneaked out again at night to drink.

630
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,621
Do you have money to buy a new outfit?

631
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:17,902
You probably spent all your money on your drinks.

632
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,982
Of course, I am broke.

633
00:48:21,382 --> 00:48:22,621
But I have you.

634
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,341
When did you take those shoes? Goodness.

635
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:31,781
Kang San, join us.

636
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:34,102
Let us get some new clothes for fall.

637
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:38,062
Shall we?

638
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:47,701
Let me see.

639
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:00,301
I have to measure your ankle circumference.

640
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:02,102
May I remove your socks?

641
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:08,301
My socks? Is that truly necessary?

642
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,422
That way, the outfit will fit you perfectly.

643
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,942
Here, let me.

644
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:29,422
My goodness. Come on.

645
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,620
Stop it, will you?

646
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:35,942
Can we go?

647
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,821
At this rate, you will even measure our toes.

648
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:41,102
But I have to...

649
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:44,701
I trust that you can make sure it will fit me well.

650
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:47,661
Use this fabric for mine.

651
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:49,181
- Bye. - Sure thing!

652
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,701
Goodness. I need all the measurements.

653
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,382
- By any chance, - Yes.

654
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,101
have you seen a scholar with a red spot on his ankle?

655
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:02,661
A red spot? Well...

656
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:04,661
No, never.

657
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:06,301
Are you sure?

658
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,901
I heard this was...

659
00:50:07,902 --> 00:50:09,621
the most popular tailor shop among the scholars in Jungchon.

660
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:10,781
Yes.

661
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:13,701
I always check their ankles while taking their measurements.

662
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:15,942
If I saw one, I'd remember it.

663
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:20,582
If you ever see such a scholar, please let me know.

664
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:22,221
Sure, I will.

665
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:23,502
Great.

666
00:50:26,301 --> 00:50:28,740
(Linen)

667
00:50:28,741 --> 00:50:29,942
You guys.

668
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,701
You can head back without me.

669
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,502
I have somewhere to be.

670
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:35,820
You will be back soon, right?

671
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:38,382
Of course. I will be back before dinnertime.

672
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:49,982
See? Something is definitely up with her.

673
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:57,062
There is one way to find out.

674
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:21,422
You are the young scholars from Garden of Flowers.

675
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:24,942
We were waiting for you. We have a question for you.

676
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:32,062
Dan O's father borrowed a large amount of money from Master Jang?

677
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:33,621
Is that all?

678
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:35,741
Should there be something else?

679
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,181
There is something else.

680
00:51:37,781 --> 00:51:38,982
That is what my gut says.

681
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:41,301
Let us leave.

682
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:42,781
We have our answer.

683
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:44,741
May I ask...

684
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,382
why you are concerned?

685
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:50,741
If the inn shuts down,

686
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,341
you can always stay elsewhere.

687
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,221
Like my Buyounggak, for instance.

688
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:03,341
It is Lady Dan O you are looking out for.

689
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:08,582
Of course.

690
00:52:09,982 --> 00:52:11,181
That was the reason.

691
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,902
Men and their affection.

692
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,982
In order to save Garden of Flowers,

693
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:28,181
Lady Dan O struck a deal with Master Jang.

694
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:00,821
Dan O is searching...

695
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,621
for Snowflake?

696
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:11,221
(Garden of Flowers)

697
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:26,382
It is my unpaid rent.

698
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,422
I worked my magic.

699
00:53:33,942 --> 00:53:34,942
Could it be...

700
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,821
I won all that fair and square.

701
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,220
If you had studied with that determination,

702
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,820
you would have passed the exam in the first place.

703
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:44,620
If you do not want it...

704
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,741
I love it. I am over the moon.

705
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:49,341
If so,

706
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:51,180
how about you marry me?

707
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,781
Well...

708
00:53:54,701 --> 00:53:55,701
No.

709
00:53:59,382 --> 00:54:00,382
I was rejected.

710
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:18,542
You...

711
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:21,261
Why were you out so late?

712
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,582
I believe I was home before you today.

713
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:28,542
You know...

714
00:54:29,982 --> 00:54:31,701
You have been acting strangely today.

715
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,102
What do you mean?

716
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:38,382
That look in your eyes.

717
00:54:40,422 --> 00:54:42,141
You seem like a puppy who wants to poop.

718
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:43,582
What?

719
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,862
What brings you by though?

720
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:50,221
Stop looking for him.

721
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,621
- What? - Stop searching...

722
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,502
for him.

723
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:55,862
Gosh.

724
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,502
You are making no sense.

725
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:13,261
I must find him...

726
00:55:17,502 --> 00:55:18,862
in order to save Garden of Flowers.

727
00:55:22,582 --> 00:55:24,780
I am not aware of how much you know, but...

728
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,022
Does the inn mean that much to you?

729
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:30,422
More than your life?

730
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,862
Here.

731
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:10,942
Eat up already. You barely had any dinner.

732
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:15,781
Does the inn mean that much to you?

733
00:56:17,382 --> 00:56:18,542
More than your life?

734
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:22,661
Shoot.

735
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:24,741
What is the matter?

736
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,502
Does it taste that foul?

737
00:56:27,902 --> 00:56:29,261
Darn.

738
00:56:30,022 --> 00:56:31,902
I feel like I had a million sweet potatoes.

739
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,942
I only boiled them in water.

740
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,542
I wonder why.

741
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:40,942
That much is obvious.

742
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:44,181
I am a fool who cannot even cook sweet potatoes.

743
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:50,261
(Buyounggak)

744
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:06,341
You can leave it there.

745
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:20,141
Wait. Here you go.

746
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,301
What is this?

747
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:27,062
A scholar told me to give this to you.

748
00:57:27,582 --> 00:57:28,582
A scholar?

749
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:58,022
"If you wish to find Snowflake,"

750
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:01,220
"come to the deserted house by the tree of the guardian spirit..."

751
00:58:01,221 --> 00:58:02,422
"in Namsan Village."

752
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,382
Could this be Lee Seol?

753
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:26,301
I am ready to hear...

754
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:27,862
whatever you have to say.

755
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:32,542
This involves the watchmen.

756
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:35,462
What do you know about him?

757
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:40,862
Do not let him concern you.

758
00:58:41,982 --> 00:58:44,022
He is searching for Lee Seol at my request.

759
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,422
I apologize,

760
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:50,740
but not even the Palace Guards know about his whereabouts.

761
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:51,820
(Naegeumwui: the royal bodyguards of the kings of Joseon)

762
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:54,421
Do you not know where the watchmen are trained?

763
00:58:54,422 --> 00:58:55,422
I am afraid I do not.

764
00:58:55,902 --> 00:58:57,941
It has always been kept a secret.

765
00:58:57,942 --> 00:59:00,780
Someone must be funding them though.

766
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,862
The money is spent from the royal privy purse,

767
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:04,220
which is authorized...

768
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:05,502
by the Queen Dowager and not His Majesty.

769
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:09,382
Then even His Majesty would be in the dark.

770
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,422
That is correct.

771
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,780
The Queen Dowager is unaware of the details though.

772
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:17,181
She only authorizes the payment.

773
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:19,582
Do not...

774
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,062
look for them.

775
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,582
They reside in the dark.

776
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:27,982
Forcing them into the light...

777
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:32,141
might be your ruin, Lord Sin.

778
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,542
Of all the places we could meet...

779
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:02,902
Do not look for him.

780
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,220
More than a few have lost their lives...

781
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,502
searching for Snowflake.

782
01:00:27,102 --> 01:00:28,301
Are you him?

783
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:32,582
Are you Snowflake?

784
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:46,341
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

785
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:07,660
I will find Lee Seol no matter what.

786
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:09,220
And you will soon learn...

787
01:01:09,221 --> 01:01:10,780
just how crazy this task is.

788
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:11,781
Who knows?

789
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:14,942
We might end up stumbling upon him.

790
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:17,101
He could be the deposed heir Lee Seol.

791
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:18,780
You are the first.

792
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,101
Is meddling a talent of yours?

793
01:01:20,102 --> 01:01:21,340
Mind your own business.

794
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,581
All it takes is a shared gaze...

795
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:25,180
for romance to bloom between a man and a woman.

796
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,542
Is Yoon Dan O truly unaware...

797
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,181
of your identity?

798
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,022
I see it now.

799
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:34,741
Yoon Dan O, you are never going to give up.
