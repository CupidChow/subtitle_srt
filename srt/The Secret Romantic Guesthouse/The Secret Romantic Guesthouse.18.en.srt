(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,033
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,912
Carry out the execution!

9
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:16,393
Protect the King!

10
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,953
Protect the King!

11
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,072
Get him!

12
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:29,072
Over there! After him!

13
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,153
This is treason!

14
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,432
We are under attack!

15
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:43,033
We are under attack. There is a coup.

16
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,033
Hundreds of men entered via the West Gate.

17
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,873
They will be here soon.

18
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:50,513
You must flee.

19
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:56,033
The deposed heir's men infiltrated the palace too.

20
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:59,352
Even if I do leave, I will only do so after he is dead.

21
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,233
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,873
Step aside!

23
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,192
Your Majesty!

24
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,712
Step aside. You dare stand in my way?

25
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,393
Get out of here.

26
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:20,673
Kill us first.

27
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,483
Or you will never reach him.

28
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,152
- Escort the King! - Yes, sir!

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,432
- Let go! - You must get out of here!

30
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,832
Escort the King!

31
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:38,233
- Let me go! - Escort the King!

32
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:02,432
That way. The traitors went that way.

33
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,473
You are at a disadvantage!

34
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:39,473
Soon, an army will arrive to remove you.

35
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,832
You sided with the traitors?

36
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,193
I treated you so well.

37
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,673
It is time...

38
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,673
you step down from the throne.

39
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:50,752
Shut your mouth!

40
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,592
Even if it means I die embracing the throne,

41
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,832
I will not let Lee Seol have it.

42
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:58,233
Your Majesty, leave the palace.

43
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:59,752
I will handle him.

44
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:02,992
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,961
(Final Episode)

46
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,002
Get yourself to safety.

47
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,442
I will take Scholar Yoon.

48
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,692
Are you all right?

49
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,562
I am fine. You need not worry.

50
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,442
Grandmother.

51
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,812
You must get out of here, Your Highness.

52
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,281
We made a narrow escape,

53
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:49,721
but we cannot go further without the help of an army.

54
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,161
The army will be here soon.

55
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:56,132
Garden of Flowers' innkeeper will open the gates for them.

56
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,041
Dan O is here?

57
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,961
Yoon Dan O? What is that girl doing here?

58
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,202
Get her!

59
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,882
- Get her! - Yes, sir.

60
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,521
Darn it.

61
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,281
What are you doing over there?

62
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,322
Over there!

63
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:03,841
Kang San.

64
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:07,562
I never liked the look in your eyes.

65
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,882
Did you join the Palace Guards...

66
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,322
to plan this rebellion?

67
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:15,041
It is not a rebellion.

68
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,521
I am here to take my rightful place.

69
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,122
I am...

70
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:23,481
Lee Seol.

71
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,481
If you are Lee Seol,

72
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:36,122
who is the man we arrested?

73
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,242
Answer me this instant!

74
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,921
What are you plotting?

75
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,762
The King is trapped.

76
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:53,082
He will kill himself trying to kill Lee Seol.

77
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:54,322
Whether that is...

78
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:56,882
true or false,

79
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,961
I have no reason to let you live.

80
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:28,442
Are you all right?

81
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:02,761
We must go.

82
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:33,361
All is well.

83
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:36,761
As long as you are safe.

84
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,601
The Queen Dowager and His Highness are safe.

85
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,721
Well done.

86
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,641
We shall find the King as planned.

87
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:56,881
Yes.

88
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,562
As long as the army breaches the gate,

89
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,562
we will gain full control.

90
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:03,442
Dan O.

91
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:06,172
I need you to take the decree and open the gate.

92
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:09,121
Yes. I will do that.

93
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:17,202
They must have lost Yoon Dan O.

94
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,412
What is going on?

95
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,641
Did my men not give chase?

96
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,202
Have they not caught them yet?

97
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:28,802
Your Majesty. I think some of your men betrayed you.

98
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,682
I cannot tell who is a friend...

99
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,881
and who is a foe.

100
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:35,562
- My lord. - My lord.

101
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:37,532
- My lord! - Your Majesty.

102
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,532
- Your Majesty. - My lord.

103
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,442
Your Majesty.

104
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,361
You must flee now.

105
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,442
Kang San.

106
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:53,532
Was it him?

107
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,202
My lord!

108
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,721
It is him.

109
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,682
He is...

110
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,961
the deposed heir...

111
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:11,802
Lee Seol.

112
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:20,881
Say that again.

113
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,402
What did you just say?

114
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,361
The depo...

115
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,361
My lord!

116
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,562
There was a report of a revolt.

117
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,402
Keep the gates shut.

118
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,442
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

119
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:52,881
Open the gates.

120
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:02,402
The Queen Dowager's decree...

121
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,402
states the King will be replaced by her grandson, the rightful heir.

122
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,361
(I reinstate Lee Seol, the deposed heir...)

123
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,641
Where is His Majesty?

124
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,121
The deposed King...

125
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,682
is locked in his chambers as the Queen Dowager ordered.

126
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:23,721
My responsibility is great, and I cannot open the gates...

127
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,802
at the word of a court maid.

128
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:31,042
You two. Go and check the King's chambers.

129
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,042
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

130
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:48,241
What is it?

131
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,282
Where is the King?

132
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:54,761
The deposed King...

133
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,641
fled the palace.

134
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:59,042
He fled? Is that true?

135
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:03,121
If you wish to live a long, fruitful life,

136
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:04,881
it is best you leave too.

137
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,761
We should go.

138
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:13,481
Let us go.

139
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,322
An army is approaching.

140
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:33,322
What?

141
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,322
The decree is true.

142
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:38,641
The King has fled the palace.

143
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:43,361
A new king has been crowned, so accept his order.

144
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,001
Open the gates.

145
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,001
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

146
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,641
The gate is open!

147
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,601
Advance!

148
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,961
Your Majesty.

149
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:48,641
The rebels are searching the palace.

150
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,721
You must get away.

151
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,922
Save yourself and bide your time.

152
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,961
- The gate in the back... - I must face Lee Seol.

153
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,522
It is a losing battle.

154
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,042
As long as he lives, I will not have a future.

155
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:08,202
Lee Seol.

156
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:15,082
The rebels will lose heart once he is dead.

157
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,682
Flee with my men...

158
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:22,641
and distract the rebels.

159
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:25,601
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:35,001
The King's men are headed to the back gate.

161
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,042
What?

162
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,001
Follow me!

163
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,042
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

164
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,241
Find Lee Seol and tell him this.

165
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,761
That I will...

166
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:15,802
wait for him at the execution site.

167
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:17,522
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:31,522
Why are you here?

169
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,042
Do not resent me.

170
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,481
I also have a master to protect.

171
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,322
Were you Lee Chang's watchman?

172
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,162
Go.

173
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,442
This is my fight.

174
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:35,361
Where is the King?

175
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,361
He is...

176
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:39,042
waiting for you at the execution site.

177
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:50,641
Do not do this.

178
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,441
Must I take down my own instructor?

179
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,562
If you wish to protect the deposed heir, kill me.

180
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,972
As a watchman should!

181
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,441
Leave.

182
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,042
This is my last favour for you.

183
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:30,762
Kill me.

184
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,762
Let me live, and my sword will aim for the deposed heir.

185
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,401
I protect him...

186
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:41,401
not as his watchman but as his friend.

187
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,681
So as long as I live,

188
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,401
your sword will not reach him.

189
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:04,042
It is time you put down...

190
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,641
the fate that weighed you down.

191
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:35,252
Open the gate.

192
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:17,841
Kang San.

193
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,042
Are you truly Lee Seol?

194
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,082
That sword is...

195
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,282
Lee Seol.

196
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:46,841
You truly are him.

197
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,441
Now you recognize me?

198
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:54,601
I was around you for so long.

199
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,732
Who is the Lee Seol you wanted...

200
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,641
to kill so badly?

201
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,042
Does he even exist?

202
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:12,322
Do you remember?

203
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:16,972
When you were little, I made you a slingshot.

204
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,361
But you...

205
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:24,972
could not even kill a sparrow with it.

206
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,282
You wish to slay your own uncle when you are that tenderhearted?

207
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,002
That is why you have yet to slay me...

208
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,361
even though you have been hovering around me for so long.

209
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,641
And you are the one...

210
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,841
who made me...

211
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:49,762
come this far.

212
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,121
Do not get involved!

213
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,042
Are you here to avenge your father?

214
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:48,482
Shall I tell you how your father died?

215
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,722
Shut your mouth.

216
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:52,601
He breathed his last while begging me.

217
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,881
He desperately begged me to spare his son.

218
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:04,002
I will never ask you to spare my life.

219
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,161
That is the fundamental difference between the one...

220
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,802
who deserves to become King and the one who does not.

221
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:34,841
Over here!

222
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,881
Your era has ended.

223
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,282
I am not like the deposed king.

224
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,522
Surrender willingly,

225
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,641
and you will keep your life.

226
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:05,121
This nation is mine.

227
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:08,002
It is my Joseon that I secured...

228
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,441
with my bloodied hands!

229
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:49,802
You are just like me.

230
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:52,921
You slew your own uncle...

231
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,562
to take the throne.

232
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,042
You committed regicide to become King.

233
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,881
Lee Seol.

234
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,722
My name is...

235
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,282
all yours now.

236
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:03,282
A fake can never replace the real.

237
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:05,881
If I ascend the throne...

238
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,601
You said it was one's determination...

239
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:10,762
that could change the world, not one's origin.

240
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:14,042
- First Vice-premier. - As soon as I met Seol,

241
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,641
he sincerely implored me.

242
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:21,641
After thinking long and hard for several days,

243
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,401
I have finally made up my mind.

244
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,082
Gyeom.

245
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,361
I believe...

246
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:40,601
you should ascend the throne for the sake of Joseon.

247
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:51,401
Please allow us to talk in private.

248
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,601
Yes, certainly.

249
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,282
San.

250
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:10,322
I became the leader of Mokinhoe because...

251
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,361
I know.

252
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:14,282
It was because you were dreaming of a better world.

253
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,762
When I took a step forward to take down the King,

254
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,962
you were painting a better tomorrow with the people.

255
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:30,482
Hence,

256
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,802
it made me wish...

257
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,282
to see the tomorrow that you would go on to build.

258
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,441
A world where you can win without slaying anyone.

259
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,201
I trust that you...

260
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:52,681
can make it happen.

261
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,641
Gosh. Oh, boy.

262
00:28:04,242 --> 00:28:07,601
My gosh! Lady Dan O!

263
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,681
You came quickly. I thought you would arrive in the evening.

264
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:17,401
We ran here as soon as we received your message.

265
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,082
Anyway, where are the scholars?

266
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,482
- They are still at the palace. - My gosh.

267
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,282
Scholar Kim too?

268
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,161
Si Yeol left right away.

269
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:36,562
I heard he said to understand even if he disappeared without a word.

270
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,921
What? I understand if he had to leave,

271
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,601
but why would he disappear?

272
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:45,482
Exactly. As if he wishes to fall off the face of the earth.

273
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:52,322
(Capital District Office)

274
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,042
You must have been anxious.

275
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,282
I am sorry I took so long.

276
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,242
Go and get some rest.

277
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,762
Take us with you.

278
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:17,282
We ought to avenge the chief monk's death.

279
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:19,601
That is...

280
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,601
I already took care of it.

281
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:26,722
Then what...

282
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,161
should we do now?

283
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:44,601
Live.

284
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,242
Survive.

285
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:03,522
Then...

286
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,441
what about you?

287
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,282
Wait!

288
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:44,841
Just stay there...

289
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:48,962
and listen.

290
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,201
For as long as I live,

291
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,482
I will resent...

292
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,962
and loathe you.

293
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,201
So...

294
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:09,841
let me hate you as much as I want.

295
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:14,601
You must stay alive...

296
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,161
for me to hate you.

297
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,522
Just giving up on life...

298
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:33,002
It is such a cowardly thing to do.

299
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:16,962
Chief Eunuch.

300
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,002
What do you plan to do?

301
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:22,282
Once your coronation ceremony is completed,

302
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,121
I should leave.

303
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,242
I believe...

304
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,082
my job is done.

305
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:29,641
Yes, you may do so.

306
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,361
I heard you provided immeasurable help and support.

307
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,562
I was curious.

308
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,722
There is only one throne,

309
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,042
so I wanted to see...

310
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,522
what the two of you would choose to do.

311
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:43,841
And?

312
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:45,802
Is this what you expected?

313
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,522
It is...

314
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:52,762
easier to obtain power than to maintain it.

315
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,881
I thought the two of you would give in to temptations,

316
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:59,562
which would lead to tragedy.

317
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:05,042
We must not repeat such a mistake.

318
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:09,002
Please...

319
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:12,322
do not think that you took the throne...

320
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,722
on your own.

321
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,762
The throne cannot exist without the nameless hands...

322
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:21,282
like mine...

323
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:23,722
that uphold it.

324
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:07,002
(2 years later)

325
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,962
- This is the place. - Yes, this is it.

326
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:13,201
- I purposely came here. - Good thinking.

327
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,371
I heard the King studied here.

328
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,442
The King stayed at this inn in the past.

329
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,442
We should go in and soak up all the amazing energy!

330
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:23,562
(Garden of Flowers)

331
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,681
Oh, my.

332
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:27,891
There are so many of you here. I am sorry.

333
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:30,121
We have no vacancy at the moment.

334
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:32,241
Let me sleep in the servants' quarters.

335
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:33,962
I will gladly pay double.

336
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,201
I apologize.

337
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,281
So many people would happily sleep in the servants' quarters.

338
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:42,851
Gosh.

339
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:47,241
(No Vacancy)

340
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:49,891
- Oh, my. - Nice.

341
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,851
- It is the talk of the town. - I know.

342
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:57,411
It is still early, but people are already lining up out the door.

343
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,681
At this rate, we will become very wealthy in no time!

344
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,962
Right? Could you go get some side dishes?

345
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:02,962
Sure thing.

346
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:14,241
I could never get sick of this view.

347
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:16,641
Seeing this vast ocean.

348
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,201
Next time, let us come here just before sunset.

349
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:22,281
I hear it is very beautiful.

350
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,721
Let us not wait for the next time.

351
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,522
There is something I truly wish to do now.

352
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,082
Then you should do it,

353
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:32,641
whatever it may be.

354
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,891
Hey! My goodness.

355
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:11,761
I heard you passed the exam with the highest score.

356
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,411
I especially appreciated your honest, thoughtful advice for me.

357
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,641
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

358
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,761
Yuk Yuk Ho.

359
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,761
I hereby appoint you as a compiler at the Office of Royal Decrees.

360
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:25,922
I believe you will work hard to assist me.

361
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:30,082
I will assist Your Majesty to the best of my ability.

362
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:53,562
(Garden of Flowers)

363
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,891
Yuk Ho! You passed the exam, at last!

364
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,411
I did not just pass the exam. I received the highest score.

365
00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:01,201
You should be very proud of me!

366
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:02,851
Ms. Naju will be delighted to hear this.

367
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:04,411
Ms. Naju!

368
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:10,042
- We are so proud of you! - Yes!

369
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:16,371
(No Vacancy)

370
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,851
What did I tell you?

371
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,851
I said I would go hunt a wild boar for you...

372
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,962
if you passed the exam...

373
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,761
My gosh. You hunted this yourself?

374
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:36,761
I went...

375
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:38,601
and bought this myself.

376
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,002
I bought the freshest meat at the butcher shop.

377
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,601
I see.

378
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,641
Garden of Flowers is doing so well,

379
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,201
and you have successfully landed a great job in the government.

380
00:37:49,442 --> 00:37:52,082
These days, I just cannot stop smiling.

381
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:55,121
I am now a compiler in the Office of Royal Decrees.

382
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:57,962
From now on, you are to address me as such.

383
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,161
Yes, my lord.

384
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:01,371
Hello.

385
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,201
Oh, I invited her.

386
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,042
Seo Yeon, come and join us.

387
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:12,522
Congratulations, Lord Yuk.

388
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:19,721
Oh, right.

389
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:22,321
San, do you know where Si Yeol is?

390
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:25,562
I used to hear from him from time to time,

391
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,121
but I have not heard from him in a while.

392
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:32,002
I think he is wandering around aimlessly.

393
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:34,681
I wonder where he is now.

394
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,411
It would have been truly amazing...

395
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:40,442
to have him here too.

396
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,281
Does your heart still ache badly...

397
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,482
when you think of Si Yeol?

398
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,321
Dan O.

399
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:15,411
I already forgave him.

400
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,922
I am certain that he never wanted to live such a life.

401
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:26,121
His cruel, harsh fate...

402
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,042
is to blame.

403
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:38,281
So I forgave him.

404
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:42,002
But you see,

405
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:45,371
I...

406
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,891
I cannot forgive myself...

407
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,681
for forgiving him.

408
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:32,801
It delights me to see you looking happy and healthy.

409
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:35,761
You seem much more at ease too.

410
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,241
You helped me restore my identity, so it is all thanks to you.

411
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,522
I simply did what I had to do.

412
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:47,121
One by one, retrieve the things you lost.

413
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,482
The things I lost?

414
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:51,891
For example,

415
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:53,891
things like happiness...

416
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:55,922
and memories.

417
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,522
I see.

418
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,681
The moments we shared...

419
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:06,801
meant happiness to me.

420
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:08,962
I cherish the memories.

421
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,411
It has been a while. It is great to see you.

422
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,962
How have you been?

423
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,562
We have been well, Yu Ha...

424
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,411
I mean, Your Majesty.

425
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:42,281
You may call me by my name when we are alone.

426
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:46,042
No, I cannot do that. You are the King.

427
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:50,042
Oh, right. Yuk Ho told me...

428
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,121
that the two of you were planning to leave Hanyang soon.

429
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,281
We will leave as soon as we are ready.

430
00:41:57,922 --> 00:41:59,371
If it is because of me,

431
00:41:59,922 --> 00:42:00,922
do not leave.

432
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,371
I wish to keep my friends close.

433
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:07,962
I cannot stay, for Your Majesty's sake.

434
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,201
Your Majesty.

435
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:16,482
You are the sage king I had wished for.

436
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:18,922
It is why...

437
00:42:19,562 --> 00:42:22,321
I will never be a political threat to you.

438
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,241
It has been a dream of mine...

439
00:42:32,641 --> 00:42:33,962
to travel.

440
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:38,042
So when will you be back?

441
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:40,641
We do not know.

442
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,442
We plan to wander the land and anchor ourselves where we please.

443
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:51,201
You and Dan O should talk some more.

444
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:53,482
I will dismiss myself.

445
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:07,922
I heard you received a promotion.

446
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,562
Is it Assistant Officer Yoon now?

447
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:11,761
Thank you.

448
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:16,241
It would have been even better to serve alongside you.

449
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,442
Are things well with the Palace Guards?

450
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,482
We have been suffering from lack of sleep...

451
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,321
thanks to His Majesty working late into the night.

452
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:34,042
You actually paid back the 100 nyang.

453
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:38,161
Life has been rough for those living near Mount Sobaek.

454
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:39,641
The money will be spent to succor them.

455
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:40,922
Right.

456
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,442
But this is all thanks to His Majesty.

457
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,522
How is it my doing?

458
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,681
You are the sage king...

459
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:47,922
who once resided at Garden of Flowers.

460
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:51,082
Word has spread, and we are overflowing with guests.

461
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:53,121
That is a relief.

462
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,562
Not long ago, you were worried due to the lack of guests.

463
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,442
These days, I have been considering opening another inn...

464
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:03,482
and have been contemplating the best location for it.

465
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:09,562
There used to be days when we shared laughter and words.

466
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:11,402
Even I...

467
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:14,201
sometimes miss the days...

468
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:18,042
that were filled with our laughter.

469
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:23,882
Have you still not heard from Si Yeol?

470
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,402
No.

471
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:30,641
Your Majesty, the morning assembly will soon commence.

472
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:41,761
After you leave today,

473
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,241
chances are I will not get to see you.

474
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,281
Be well,

475
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,721
Yu Ha.

476
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:53,882
Dan O.

477
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:59,562
May I give you a hug?

478
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:03,962
Of course.

479
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,281
We will now be on our way.

480
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,442
Allow yourself to sleep at night...

481
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:37,922
and have days where you are at ease,

482
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,042
Your Majesty.

483
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,601
A king being at ease...

484
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,482
translates to his people suffering hardships.

485
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:50,801
San.

486
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:53,562
Wherever you are,

487
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,042
be well.

488
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:59,402
Sure. I will.

489
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,801
Let us go.

490
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,721
Head on without me.

491
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:55,402
Were you here to see His Majesty?

492
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,962
I heard you were leaving soon.

493
00:47:00,522 --> 00:47:03,962
That is right, and I plan to stay away from the palace.

494
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:07,681
It is how I will express my loyalty.

495
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:10,962
San of the Kang family.

496
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:15,201
In other words, you only wish to live by that name.

497
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,562
I will be here serving His Majesty.

498
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:21,601
Knowing that he has you...

499
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:24,281
allows me to be less worried.

500
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:06,281
Goodness, I said I would hang those to dry myself.

501
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:08,522
Please sit for some yakgwa.

502
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:10,801
- Later. Let me finish this first. - Sure.

503
00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:16,721
Here you go.

504
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:20,121
Goodness.

505
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:31,321
The moon is very bright tonight.

506
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:33,442
Come out from time to time...

507
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:36,281
and walk around the yard at least.

508
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:52,721
In the gentle breeze

509
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:58,161
When petals float with the wind

510
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:15,882
As they float along the moonlit path

511
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:20,641
They leave a scent that lingers

512
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:23,721
Gently and softly

513
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:25,922
- They fall - Young Master.

514
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:31,321
May I ask where you heard that song?

515
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,082
From a scholar I met on my way to Hanyang.

516
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,362
Why do you ask?

517
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:37,522
Where exactly?

518
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:40,002
Where is that scholar?

519
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:43,962
He said he was headed to the dock to catch a boat to Qing.

520
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:56,161
- Hurry, all. - Goodness.

521
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:58,241
Careful!

522
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,281
- My gosh. - There you go.

523
00:50:07,161 --> 00:50:08,761
Of course he would be gone by now.

524
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:06,442
(Garden of Flowers)

525
00:51:14,442 --> 00:51:17,241
(Garden of Flowers)

526
00:51:18,402 --> 00:51:19,482
You once...

527
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,281
told me...

528
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,681
that you were not the man you seemed to be,

529
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:31,281
but your feelings for me...

530
00:51:32,442 --> 00:51:34,641
were genuine without a doubt.

531
00:51:38,882 --> 00:51:40,402
Do you still feel...

532
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:43,761
the same way?

533
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,042
I do.

534
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:54,562
As time went by,

535
00:51:57,362 --> 00:51:58,962
the feelings only became clearer.

536
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:08,882
Then, let us step over the threshold together.

537
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:27,201
(Garden of Flowers)

538
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:36,042
All the lights are out.

539
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:38,121
Could they all be asleep?

540
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:52,962
Dan O, you were right about what you saw.

541
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:55,882
I saw the two of you at the marketplace on our way back.

542
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:00,121
You do not glow as you once did.

543
00:53:00,482 --> 00:53:02,002
Were the years harsh on you?

544
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,042
Welcome back.

545
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:06,522
Your room has always stayed empty.

546
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:09,042
As per the innkeeper's authority.

547
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,922
I am truly ashamed.

548
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:16,601
I know I had you worried.

549
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,002
What...

550
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:23,721
Bok Sil, is that you?

551
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:25,442
Hold on.

552
00:53:25,721 --> 00:53:26,721
Gosh.

553
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,042
It really is our Bok Sil.

554
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,842
He must have followed his owner back.

555
00:53:35,842 --> 00:53:37,522
He made it the same time you came back.

556
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:40,042
Now that Bok Sil is here,

557
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,161
the whole family is back together again.

558
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:43,161
You are right.

559
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:46,042
This is the Garden of Flowers I remember!

560
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:54,201
- Goodness. - Hey, Bok Sil.

561
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,241
Where were you all this time?

562
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:07,681
Forget it.

563
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,962
As if that is important. You being back is enough.

564
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:15,761
The royal family is no longer raising children to be watchmen.

565
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:19,601
Was that your request?

566
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:22,201
It was a cruel system...

567
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:24,161
that had to be abolished one day.

568
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:27,962
Thank you, San.

569
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,522
You have saved the children at the temple...

570
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:33,922
from a life like mine.

571
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:38,281
You should move forward now, do not look back,

572
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:41,161
step out from the dark shadows,

573
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:45,281
and live your own life.

574
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,562
When will you stop...

575
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:06,241
spending your nights only wrapped up in your work?

576
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,042
You should soon welcome a queen...

577
00:55:10,522 --> 00:55:12,281
and deliver an heir.

578
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,641
Your grandson is still fairly young.

579
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:18,321
At a young age is when you marry.

580
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:22,721
Please know that the selection process will begin.

581
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:25,281
The nation has only recently found stability.

582
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:27,042
For now, I would rather focus on my work.

583
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:29,321
Could there be...

584
00:55:29,922 --> 00:55:32,362
a young lady...

585
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:34,442
you still harbour feelings for?

586
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:43,241
They are pretty.

587
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,442
What are you up to?

588
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:54,082
Did you not want to enjoy these together?

589
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:56,601
No, you cannot look just yet.

590
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,922
It is a gift...

591
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:20,721
for my fiancée.

592
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:26,482
You are finally more yourself again.

593
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:34,002
(Garden of Flowers)

594
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:37,922
So that is combined with a stick.

595
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:39,962
And then...

596
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:42,761
Gosh.

597
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:45,962
It was not my intention to fool you.

598
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,882
But could one learn the words...

599
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:51,681
by copying them without knowing the meaning?

600
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:53,522
Like this.

601
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:56,321
"At that moment,"

602
00:56:57,842 --> 00:57:02,402
"the officer's lips captured Yeon Yi's."

603
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:10,362
"You are my everything."

604
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:12,362
Goodness.

605
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:14,601
My gosh.

606
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:18,201
Who knew that a novel could make one's heart skip a beat?

607
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:29,882
My gosh.

608
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:32,201
Goodness.

609
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:36,241
Take your time learning how to read and write.

610
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,922
You will forever have me as your tutor.

611
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:42,882
My gosh.

612
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:47,281
Goodness me.

613
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:05,522
I hope to be a benevolent King...

614
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,121
who truly brings comfort to the people.

615
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:17,522
Watch me as I achieve that,

616
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:19,962
Mother.

617
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:33,641
You must be delighted...

618
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:36,281
to see the last of your worries beaming.

619
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:44,362
The bride and groom will bow.

620
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:09,801
The bride and groom will vow to be happy.

621
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:35,761
They will now vow to serve one another.

622
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:41,042
(Garden of Flowers)

623
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:50,201
It is sad to see you go...

624
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:51,801
since we just reunited.

625
00:59:52,601 --> 00:59:55,281
Si Yeol, you only get to be newlyweds once.

626
00:59:55,562 --> 00:59:57,161
Do not be upset and enjoy it while you can.

627
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,161
Si Yeol?

628
00:59:59,002 --> 01:00:00,321
That is not how you address someone...

629
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:02,082
who is married to your wife's sister.

630
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,801
You are absolutely right.

631
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:07,442
San should know his manners.

632
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:09,281
One must address a family member properly.

633
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:11,121
You heard him,

634
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:12,641
San.

635
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:14,641
I should have headed out sooner.

636
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,402
They are absolutely right.

637
01:00:16,801 --> 01:00:18,161
You must formally address him now.

638
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:26,281
Brother-in-law. Are you happy?

639
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:29,562
San,

640
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:32,601
what was that? I did not hear you.

641
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:33,601
Brother...

642
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:36,002
That is enough.

643
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:46,402
I will look after Garden of Flowers...

644
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:49,201
like you have all these years.

645
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:54,922
Elevating my status was not necessary.

646
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,082
I am sorry it took me this long.

647
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,201
I wish you and Yuk Ho a happy life.

648
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:02,201
Goodness.

649
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:10,362
Please send a note when you land.

650
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,442
Yuk Ho.

651
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:16,801
We will head out.

(Garden of Flowers)

653
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:43,482
Do you not regret it?

654
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:45,281
Regret what?

655
01:01:46,562 --> 01:01:49,241
All that you gave up for a day of normalcy.

656
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:55,522
Not at all.

657
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:58,922
I have not regretted it, not even for a second.

658
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:03,002
All because...

659
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,522
I have you constantly by my side.
