00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,203
When everything is over,

10
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:57,684
then we can...

11
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,084
do what you wished.

12
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,804
You said you wished to travel far.

13
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:10,084
We can see the ocean.

14
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,213
No.

15
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:15,724
I will put my dreams aside for a while.

16
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,123
If the King leaves his post,

17
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,933
who will care for the people?

18
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:28,444
Be a good king.

19
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,204
You will...

20
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,043
become just that.

Dan O.

22
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,483
Do you believe I will be a good king?

23
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:42,724
You never broke...

24
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,403
any of the promises you made me.

25
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,004
As a child, you said...

26
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,804
you would tell me your name if we met again.

27
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:58,084
You also said you would come back unbroken,

28
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:00,804
and you did.

29
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:04,844
Would such a man...

30
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:07,883
fail to protect his people?

31
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:38,974
What...

32
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:49,043
You look like you saw a ghost.

33
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,244
I am indescribably pleased...

34
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:54,083
you regained your consciousness.

35
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:56,844
I shall get the royal physician.

36
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,844
You dared to collude with Lee Seol?

37
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:14,482
That is not true!

38
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,642
Would I side with a traitor if I valued my life...

39
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,244
I did not...

40
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,883
return from death's door to hear excuses.

41
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,083
What...

42
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,043
do you want for me?

43
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,323
Offer something up in exchange for your life.

44
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,724
All you can sell is the deposed heir Lee Seol.

45
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,482
Hand over Lee Seol...

46
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:51,004
and preserve the pathetic life of yours,

47
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,883
or become the most loyal of servants...

48
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,883
and be buried next to him.

49
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:04,244
You will be a loyal servant? So be it.

50
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,083
I know.

51
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,083
I will confess, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:17,043
Who the deposed heir Lee Seol is.

Dan O.

56
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,443
You will always...

57
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:45,243
be my home.

58
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,683
Do not forget.

59
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,923
That is another promise.

60
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:04,603
Where is he now?

61
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,043
Lee Seol...

62
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:10,803
Lee Seol...

63
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,363
resides at an inn in Jungchon.

64
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,404
At Garden of Flowers,

65
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,123
he lives among a few other young scholars.

66
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,284
Garden of Flowers, you say?

67
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,283
Owned by Yoon Dan O?

68
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,603
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,803
Jung Yu Ha.

70
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,123
He is...

71
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,724
the deposed heir Lee Seol.

72
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,043
What is your name?

73
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,803
I am Jung Yu Ha, a scholar residing at Garden of Flowers.

74
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,764
Is that the truth?

75
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,284
That Jung Yu Ha is Lee Seol?

76
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:12,123
I told you just what I know, without any lies.

77
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:17,043
Please spare me my life.

78
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:22,964
Yoon Dan O.

79
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,844
She sheltered Seol and insulted me.

80
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,404
The fake must be taken down...

81
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,724
for the real to stand a chance.

82
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:37,683
I will bring them in for questioning...

83
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,483
and show my authority.

84
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,363
(Buyounggak)

85
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,603
Running a large inn on your own...

86
00:06:58,563 --> 00:07:00,284
cannot have been easy.

87
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:03,363
Nothing in life is easy.

88
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,284
Being in charge of a place like Buyounggak...

89
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:10,884
is the best life a kisaeng like myself...

90
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,404
can have, people say.

91
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:17,884
It does not seem that great a life.

92
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:24,683
You must have been quite lonely also.

93
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,764
Then...

94
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:30,964
will you keep me company?

95
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:40,043
What will you do from now on?

96
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,923
My inheritance includes a house.

97
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:45,243
I think I will move there.

98
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,164
I might open a small school...

99
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,284
to educate children.

100
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:53,243
They will learn a great deal from you.

101
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:57,603
You have great knowledge and character to teach them of.

102
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,524
You seem to think...

103
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,363
I am much greater a man than I actually am.

104
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,243
I must try very hard to live up to your expectations.

105
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,003
The hood was very warm.

106
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,404
It is a farewell gift.

107
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,254
Will you leave soon?

108
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:59,443
The road will be long and arduous.

109
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,254
Will you...

110
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,004
come with me?

111
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,443
May I...

112
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:22,923
do so?

113
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:40,124
You will take the throne tomorrow.

114
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,644
So...

115
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:44,164
you are leaving in a hurry?

116
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:45,884
When the master comes to power,

117
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,613
the watchman must vanish.

118
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,404
I did not mean you should vanish.

119
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:54,683
I meant for you to find yourself.

120
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:58,963
What is it?

121
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:03,004
What is piercing your heart so cruelly?

122
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,723
I wish you well.

123
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,323
As your friend, I must know.

124
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,083
Can you not tell me?

125
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,254
What is the matter?

126
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,083
I can no longer...

127
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,203
Not even just one more day.

128
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,083
I can no longer stay at Garden of Flowers.

129
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:33,723
By any chance,

130
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,803
did something happen between you and Lady Hong Ju?

131
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,124
I have...

132
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,254
completely...

133
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,374
ruined her life.

134
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,404
What do you mean?

135
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:58,884
Do you remember?

136
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:01,644
Many years ago,

137
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:04,004
Yukinhoe was after you.

138
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:07,884
Assistant Magistrate Jang's son...

139
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,884
was a member of Yukinhoe.

140
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,884
The man I killed with my own two hands...

141
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,764
was Lady Hong Ju's fiancé.

142
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,244
Anybody inside?

143
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,004
You are...

144
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,323
His Majesty has recovered.

145
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,043
You mean, he regained consciousness?

146
00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,803
Yes.

147
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,004
His Majesty said to deliver this secret letter.

148
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,843
Jung Yu Ha at Garden of Flowers.

149
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,604
He is Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

150
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:30,443
That is why the watchman was at Garden of Flowers.

151
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,723
They were all in it together.

152
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,004
While I find the traitors in the palace,

153
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:46,164
capture him and bring him to me in secret.

154
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,563
Deliver this to the Chief of the Palace Guards.

155
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,524
We will go to Garden of Flowers at once.

156
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,563
You need not capture him alive.

157
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,323
Kill the watchman as soon as you spot him.

158
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,323
Then what about Lee Seol?

159
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,723
Lee Seol is also at Garden of Flowers.

160
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,524
Once we eliminate the shadow that protects him,

161
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,963
he will have nowhere to hide.

162
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,524
Scholar Kim!

163
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:33,963
(Garden of Flowers)

164
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,764
Do not forgive me,

165
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,004
my lady.

166
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:29,524
Si Yeol!

167
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,004
You are truly leaving like this?

168
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:38,963
Yes.

169
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:40,764
Are you sad?

170
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,723
I am too ashamed to even express my sorrow.

171
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,443
Is there a place where you can go?

172
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,164
A while back, I found a boat going to Qing.

173
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,803
You unsheathed your sword only for my sake.

174
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:02,764
Hence, all your guilt...

175
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,604
is my burden to carry.

176
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:08,604
So please,

177
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:11,683
do not point your sword at yourself.

178
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,484
It is my sin and my burden to carry.

179
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:17,923
Do not...

180
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,284
even think of sharing my burden.

181
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,203
Si Yeol.

182
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:23,843
I have a favour to ask of you.

183
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,124
Please protect Lady Hong Ju.

184
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,404
I believe Assistant Magistrate Jang...

185
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,963
has figured out that she is still alive.

186
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,043
Do not worry about that.

187
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:37,764
Just like I am keeping Dan O safe,

188
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:39,843
I will protect Lady Hong Ju too.

189
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,683
Go back inside.

190
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,963
Dan O must be waiting for you.

191
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,443
San.

192
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,084
Do not end up like me.

193
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:21,054
Do not become a monster.

194
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,404
Live as a decent man.

195
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,404
The watchman has left.

196
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,124
He said he was headed to Qing.

197
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,923
In a way, it is a good thing, is it not?

198
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:04,124
The shadow has finally been set free.

199
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,523
Right, that would be a good thing.

200
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:09,404
However,

201
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,923
he seemed to have entered a darker path, haunted by the past.

202
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:17,164
I thought I could protect my people...

203
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:21,243
if I just took down the King who had usurped the throne.

204
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:25,723
The watchman needs some time too.

205
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,644
I am getting a bad feeling for some reason,

206
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:32,084
as if everything I am trying to achieve will come crumbling down.

207
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,683
The throne will be all yours by tomorrow.

208
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:43,054
You need not worry.

209
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,814
It is so strange.

210
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:12,923
Hong Ju.

211
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,164
I mean, how could he?

212
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:20,404
How could his feelings change so easily?

213
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:33,884
I cannot believe this.

214
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:36,124
Who knew Si Yeol would leave like this?

215
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,573
Maybe he met another woman.

216
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:41,283
Otherwise, how could he leave Lady Hong Ju?

217
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:48,963
My gosh.

218
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:53,124
Search every nook and cranny.

219
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:55,002
What is going on?

220
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:56,844
Why are your armed soldiers here in broad daylight?

221
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,644
The scholars are not here.

222
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:14,243
The main house is also empty.

223
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:16,963
That only leaves one place.

224
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,723
Not the annex. That place is off limits.

225
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,963
You will be held responsible for your actions today.

226
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,003
Master Jang.

227
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,283
Please compose yourself and allow me to explain.

228
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,203
- My sister... - Yoon Hong Ju...

229
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:01,963
should already be dead.

230
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:06,003
She sins with every breath she takes.

231
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,814
Wishing to live should not be a crime!

232
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:12,683
- Dan O. - I was always afraid of this day,

233
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:14,963
but this has enlightened me.

234
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,124
I should not have kept her hidden.

235
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:20,164
Keeping her hidden when she is innocent...

236
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:22,334
is why she is being disgraced as a sinner.

237
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,814
You think she is being disgraced?

238
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:28,084
But I have not even started.

239
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:50,084
(Garden of Flowers)

240
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:59,324
My goodness.

241
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:04,604
Why are you both out here? Where is Dan O?

242
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,364
Scholar Kang, it is bad.

243
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:08,923
The ladies...

244
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:12,523
Master Jang took Dan O and Hong Ju.

245
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:14,763
Where?

246
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,563
Where are they?

247
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,124
At an abandoned house in Namsan Village.

248
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,002
Unless you, Yu Ha, and Si Yeol show yourselves,

249
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,923
- the girls... - Was he accompanied...

250
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,364
by six swordsmen?

251
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:30,203
Yes, he was.

252
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:32,364
What do we do?

253
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,164
You two should not stay here.

254
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:37,723
Do you know Chunhwawon, the inn in Jungchon?

255
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,324
- I do. - Find a man known as Kim Chi Woon.

256
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:42,844
He will be of help.

257
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:47,604
Scholar Kang, it will kill me if the ladies are harmed.

258
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:49,283
Please, my ladies...

259
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:51,884
Do not worry.

260
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,443
I will bring them home unharmed.

261
00:22:58,523 --> 00:22:59,604
Is something the matter?

262
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:07,963
(Garden of Flowers)

263
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:10,804
Where is Si Yeol?

264
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:13,003
He will only let them go if all three of us are there.

265
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,844
I am the one Master Jang wants.

266
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,523
You should stay here.

267
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,044
But Dan O is there.

268
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:21,404
If it were you, would you be able to stay put?

269
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:49,844
San.

270
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,404
Why is it just the two of you?

271
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:57,242
Where is Kim Si Yeol?

272
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,084
He has already left Garden of Flowers...

273
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:01,203
and will not come.

274
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,124
Let Dan O and Lady Hong Ju be free.

275
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,282
Then, we will talk.

276
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:07,523
That is out of the question.

277
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,483
You failed to meet the terms.

278
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:11,683
For that, you must pay.

279
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:31,124
I heard you were looking for me.

280
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:34,564
- Who... - Kang San sent us.

281
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:45,762
And Master Kang already went there?

282
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:47,283
If Master Jang knows the truth,

283
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,644
they will not make it out alive.

284
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,242
I am afraid I do not follow...

285
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,364
Kang San.

286
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,364
The fact that he is the son of the Crown Prince.

287
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:02,283
My goodness.

288
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,283
Gosh.

289
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:36,923
San!

290
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:51,124
These men are not a match for you.

291
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:03,884
You should get some sleep inside.

292
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,283
This is His Highness' safe house.

293
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:10,324
But I have a bad feeling about this.

294
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,324
Master Jang would not let the ladies go.

295
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:18,044
Not when he has discovered that Lady Hong Ju is alive.

296
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:21,523
Let us wait.

297
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:23,683
In a few moments,

298
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:26,483
they will return as if nothing ever happened.

299
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:30,084
I am also upset with you as well.

300
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,404
Why did you not tell me...

301
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:39,644
that Scholar Kang San was the Crown Prince's son?

302
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:41,124
Ms. Naju,

303
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,883
- that... - Because the information...

304
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:47,644
was too important and noble for the ears of a servant?

305
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:50,963
You still should have told me.

306
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:57,003
The ladies are all I have left in this world!

307
00:26:59,124 --> 00:27:00,404
This is why I kept it from you.

308
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,084
I did not want the person I cherish...

309
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:07,003
to be in tears.

310
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:10,324
My gosh.

311
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:12,283
It will be all right.

312
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,644
Goodness.

313
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:24,804
Are you hurt?

314
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,523
I am fine.

315
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,084
Are you all right?

316
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:37,003
Yes, I am fine.

317
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:40,644
Neither of you should have come here.

318
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,844
You knew it was a trap.

319
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:47,124
Yu Ha, what did I say about you staying back?

320
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,124
You should not have come with.

321
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,443
Read the room before you wish to joke.

322
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,124
Has Si Yeol been rubbing off on you?

323
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:00,483
Did Si Yeol...

324
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,564
really leave?

325
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,044
Yes. My guess is that he did.

326
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,283
Will we be all right?

327
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:13,482
Those men are clearly waiting for him.

328
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,523
I know.

329
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:19,404
It is why we must think of something else.

330
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,804
Will the watchman show himself?

331
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,203
Lee Seol is here, is he not?

332
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:36,364
There is no doubt in my mind that the watchman will appear.

333
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:09,604
I looked for you everywhere.

334
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:14,963
I have made my decision.

335
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,563
Please leave if you are here to stop me.

336
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,124
The situation is dire.

337
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,762
The ladies at Garden of Flowers were taken by Master Jang,

338
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,364
and His Highness went to rescue them.

339
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:29,364
However, only the watchman could save them all.

340
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:39,044
It is no longer my concern.

341
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:42,483
I have already...

342
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,124
given up on my duties as the watchman.

343
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:42,084
How long will you keep us here for?

344
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:43,364
Keep quiet.

345
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:45,923
Do not hasten your death.

346
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,804
Will you see His Majesty one final time?

347
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,763
I changed my mind.

348
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:35,364
I passed your message to the head of the Military Training Command.

349
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:37,923
He will bring his men if needed.

350
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,723
I need not worry, then.

351
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:44,324
As you have planned everything.

352
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:01,963
I will read out the Queen Dowager's notice.

353
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,963
"The one to calm the confusion in court..."

354
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,604
"and straighten out what is wrong..."

355
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:19,084
"is the one all believe and trust."

356
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:21,644
"Who else would that be but Lee Seol?"

357
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,324
"Therefore,"

358
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:26,364
"I reinstate Lee Seol, the deposed heir..."

359
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:35,644
How could this be?

360
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:59,084
The traitors are all in one room.

361
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,124
Arrest them.

362
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:02,763
Arrest them!

363
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:04,044
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

364
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:43,084
Did you also wish for me to die, Mother?

365
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,004
Shut the gates!

366
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:13,203
- Yes, my lord! - Yes, my lord!

367
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:26,843
Pour me a drink.

368
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,283
I could not go to work today.

369
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:30,973
I might as well get drunk.

370
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:34,803
They shut the gates so you could not get in?

371
00:34:35,243 --> 00:34:37,283
I worked in the Royal Infirmary for years,

372
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:39,243
and this is the first time.

373
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,323
I wonder if something bad happened inside.

374
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:46,973
I will bring more food.

375
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:00,203
It is Ban Ya. I will come in.

376
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,084
You seem rushed.

377
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:12,323
What is it?

378
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:14,203
The palace gates were shut.

379
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:17,604
I thought you would know something.

380
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:23,493
Did the assistant magistrate tell you to spy on me this time?

381
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:27,973
It is not that. I am only concerned...

382
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,933
I do not know who you are concerned about,

383
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:32,843
but we stay out of palace business.

384
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,124
- Madame. - Leave.

385
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:39,524
Now.

386
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,044
Shout, and you die.

387
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,164
Do not be a fool.

388
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:30,883
I must try something.

389
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,243
I must applaud your guts.

390
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:14,644
That got you to join the Palace Guard.

391
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:16,084
I told you.

392
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:18,323
Kim Si Yeol will not come.

393
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:25,604
The watchman does not accompany his master?

394
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,323
You expect me to believe that?

395
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:30,604
I cannot help it if you do not.

396
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:33,044
I told the truth.

397
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:35,933
If he will not come,

398
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,044
I have no choice.

399
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:40,283
You will all die.

400
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:43,973
Who knows?

401
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,933
Maybe that will make the watchman rush.

402
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:52,363
Whom shall I kill first?

403
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,564
Yoon Dan O.

404
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:58,564
She is a good bet.

405
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,644
There is nothing you can do.

406
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:09,563
Do not act rashly and lower the sword.

407
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:10,843
What you want...

408
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:13,243
is the deposed heir Lee Seol.

409
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:17,843
You need not...

410
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,883
sacrifice everyone to take him.

411
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:31,883
Is anyone home?

412
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,524
I am from Buyounggak. Is no one in?

413
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:04,124
I leave this letter in case you come back here, Si Yeol.

414
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:07,843
Assistant Magistrate Jang took Dan O and Hong Ju.

415
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,883
As soon as you read this, head to the hut in Namsan Village.

416
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:12,883
Yu Ha, San, Si Yeol.

417
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:16,493
All three of you must come together if the two are to be released.

418
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:17,803
Please go.

419
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:18,933
San!

420
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,323
San!

421
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,124
You are the owner of Buyounggak.

422
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,403
- Yes. - Why are you here?

423
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,323
Where is everyone?

424
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,323
I do not know.

425
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:36,973
Garden of Flowers seems empty.

426
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:39,803
You should leave as well.

427
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:41,403
It is dangerous to be here.

428
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:43,564
Excuse me.

429
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,683
Did something happen in the palace?

430
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:56,004
Did His Majesty recover?

431
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:00,723
Yes.

432
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:06,493
If you release them all,

433
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,124
I will come quietly.

434
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:11,644
No.

435
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,403
Please.

436
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:15,524
Do not do that.

437
00:40:31,524 --> 00:40:34,524
Lee Seol, the deposed heir you have been looking for.

438
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:39,283
I am Lee Seol.

439
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:49,564
Lee Seol.

440
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,564
Every single time,

441
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,493
you hide behind someone.

442
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,044
I already knew.

443
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:07,723
Jung Yu Ha.

444
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:10,723
You are Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

445
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,843
Did you hate me that much?

446
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:27,604
Enough to wish to kill your own son?

447
00:41:27,644 --> 00:41:29,044
Ever since I gave birth to you,

448
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:32,723
I have been suffering from regret every single day.

449
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,763
I should have whipped some sense into you long ago.

450
00:41:36,843 --> 00:41:39,363
I deeply regret not doing so.

451
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,644
Not even once...

452
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:48,802
have you taken my side.

453
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:51,283
If only you had been a wise king.

454
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,124
Then even if I cannot forgive you,

455
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,683
I would still think of you as my son.

456
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:09,564
This is your grave, Mother.

457
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:13,403
Do not even take one step out of this room.

458
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:16,124
King!

459
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:20,604
Just...

460
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:23,644
kill me.

461
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:27,763
You should stay alive to witness...

462
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:32,403
the death of your beloved grandson.

463
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,604
There must have been some misunderstanding.

464
00:42:44,883 --> 00:42:46,564
- He is... - Yes.

465
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:50,803
I am Lee Seol.

466
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:54,843
Hey, what are you doing?

467
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:57,203
I am also the leader of Mokinhoe.

468
00:42:57,683 --> 00:42:59,004
I planned to join forces with them...

469
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,403
to take the throne.

470
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:04,124
No. He is not Lee Seol!

471
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:06,564
Do not say anything else.

472
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:08,492
It is not like I will thank you for this.

473
00:43:08,493 --> 00:43:09,723
I can prove it.

474
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:12,083
The fact that I am Lee Seol.

475
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,203
Jung Yu Ha!

476
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:15,004
Please do not do this.

477
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:23,323
There is one way to find out.

478
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:26,403
When Lee Seol is about to breathe his last,

479
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:30,203
the watchman will appear out of nowhere.

480
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:37,933
I will tell you everything!

481
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,683
What are you doing here?

482
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:44,803
Leave at once!

483
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:54,124
I know Scholar Jung very well.

484
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,484
- He is... - Madame.

485
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,363
He is...

486
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:02,483
He is not Lee Seol.

487
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:04,563
We have already wasted too much time.

488
00:44:04,564 --> 00:44:06,484
We do not have time for your trickery.

489
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,164
Madame!

490
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:54,203
First Vice-premier.

491
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:56,924
I am deeply disappointed in you.

492
00:44:58,084 --> 00:45:00,723
I trusted you more than anybody else.

493
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:07,243
I saw you kill your own brothers but had to turn a blind eye to it.

494
00:45:10,363 --> 00:45:12,883
Think about how I must have felt in that moment.

495
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:18,403
I failed to slay you,

496
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:22,683
but someone else will. I am sure of it.

497
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:32,084
You are garbling nonsense at death's door.

498
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:37,203
I will rip you to shreds and scatter your remains all over the country.

499
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:41,124
Would you do that for me?

500
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:43,363
That was exactly what I wanted.

501
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:48,803
Then everyone in the kingdom will find out what their king did.

502
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,363
Darn you...

503
00:45:57,723 --> 00:46:00,323
I should rip your mouth out first.

504
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,484
No...

505
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:13,524
Stay with me, please.

506
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:48,444
The watchman.

507
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,084
To see your face,

508
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:53,843
I made sure to stay alive.

509
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:57,484
Today, I must see your face...

510
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:00,084
hidden behind that mask.

511
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:53,723
I knew it was you.

512
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:58,124
My wish has come true, at last.

513
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,524
What a sick twist of fate.

514
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,124
You and Yoon Hong Ju.

515
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:02,084
That girl.

516
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:05,964
Shut your mouth.

517
00:49:06,524 --> 00:49:08,484
I see that Hong Ju is still unaware...

518
00:49:12,203 --> 00:49:13,843
of whom you killed.

519
00:49:17,763 --> 00:49:21,243
You killed so many people, and one of them...

520
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:26,524
was my son.

521
00:49:29,004 --> 00:49:30,243
Yoon Hong Ju.

522
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:33,323
He was that girl's fiancé.

523
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:42,363
What...

524
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:45,124
Scholar Kim.

525
00:49:49,484 --> 00:49:50,604
It is not true, right?

526
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:00,924
How pitiful.

527
00:50:02,803 --> 00:50:05,084
She fell in love with the man...

528
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,363
who killed her fiancé.

529
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:28,803
Admit defeat,

530
00:50:31,084 --> 00:50:32,924
and I will at least let you live.

531
00:50:33,484 --> 00:50:34,484
Kill me.

532
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:37,883
She should witness...

533
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:42,044
what you truly are...

534
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:44,323
which is a bloodthirsty ghoul.

535
00:50:55,964 --> 00:50:56,964
Mother.

536
00:51:15,723 --> 00:51:17,484
Even until the last second,

537
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:20,803
I remain a worthless mother...

538
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:23,564
who only inflicts pain on you.

539
00:51:27,803 --> 00:51:30,363
You promised to be by my side.

540
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:34,044
But we finally met.

541
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:38,283
We finally met again.

542
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:41,283
You were a son...

543
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:46,444
whom this woman of lowly origin did not deserve.

544
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:51,803
Thank you for growing up to be a fine young man.

545
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:55,484
No.

546
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:59,924
No, you cannot leave me this way.

547
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:03,444
It...

548
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:06,044
It was a joy...

549
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:10,524
to have you in my life again. So please,

550
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:13,964
do not be in pain.

551
00:52:15,363 --> 00:52:16,363
Mother.

552
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,243
Mother, please.

553
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:20,604
- Please... - Gyeom.

554
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:23,683
My son.

555
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:26,843
Find...

556
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,323
happiness.

557
00:52:41,164 --> 00:52:42,164
Mother...

558
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,084
Mother!

559
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,004
Mother...

560
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:03,524
No...

561
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:10,403
No...

562
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:22,843
Scholar Kim.

563
00:53:26,843 --> 00:53:28,323
Please tell me.

564
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:33,403
It is not true, is it?

565
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,604
She wishes to know...

566
00:53:39,243 --> 00:53:41,004
whom you killed.

567
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:46,484
Please say it is not true.

568
00:53:48,964 --> 00:53:50,323
That it is all a misunderstanding.

569
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,124
That is all you need to say.

570
00:53:58,723 --> 00:53:59,723
Please.

571
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:14,243
I am sorry,

572
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:17,283
my lady.

573
00:54:29,763 --> 00:54:31,044
You must get to safety!

574
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:37,283
Chief of the Palace Guards is on his way...

575
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:38,403
with officers from the Department of Justice.

576
00:54:41,004 --> 00:54:43,124
My sword may not be as sharp as it once was,

577
00:54:45,084 --> 00:54:46,924
but I am still a strategist.

578
00:54:57,604 --> 00:55:00,164
Dan O, leave with Lady Hong Ju.

579
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:01,683
No.

580
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:03,763
I will not. Then what about you?

581
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:11,964
I will soon follow suit with the others.

582
00:55:25,524 --> 00:55:27,644
Hong Ju, we must go.

583
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:30,084
Hong Ju.

584
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:23,964
We must go.

585
00:56:24,444 --> 00:56:25,444
Come on.

586
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:28,924
Go without me.

587
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:30,403
There is no time for this.

588
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:32,083
If we stay, they will...

589
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:33,883
They think I am Lee Seol.

590
00:56:35,644 --> 00:56:36,723
If they capture me,

591
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:39,363
they will not waste their energy hunting you down.

592
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:41,243
What nonsense are you spewing?

593
00:56:42,004 --> 00:56:43,203
If anyone gets captured, it will be me.

594
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:44,964
Now, get up.

595
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,763
Even His Majesty would believe it.

596
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:49,803
That I am Lee Seol.

597
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:51,604
Yu Ha.

598
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:06,363
We do not have the time. Come on!

599
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:12,964
Come on. We must go.

600
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:42,243
Go without me.

601
00:57:42,883 --> 00:57:43,883
Yu Ha.

602
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,843
Take Madame's body with you.

603
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,004
Please.

604
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,803
This is wrong. It is nonsense.

605
00:57:52,044 --> 00:57:53,283
- We must... - Stay alive.

606
00:57:54,363 --> 00:57:56,283
You must live for us to have a future.

607
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:59,484
I do not wish to accomplish anything by sacrificing you.

608
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:01,363
So please...

609
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:02,683
Come and rescue me.

610
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:05,243
I will be waiting.

611
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,243
- How is that? - Yu Ha!

612
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:13,124
We must go right now, or we will all die!

613
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:42,403
Where is Yu Ha?

614
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:47,803
Let us go.

615
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:11,283
You are here for me, are you not?

616
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:14,564
Go ahead and arrest me!

617
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:53,563
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

618
00:59:53,564 --> 00:59:55,163
Blabber all you want.

619
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:58,563
But know that your voice will never be heard.

620
00:59:58,564 --> 01:00:01,923
I will rescue him. I should at any cost.

621
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:03,043
You disgust me.

622
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:04,242
How many lives did you take...

623
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:06,722
with the hands that once held mine?

624
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:07,723
Dan O, please.

625
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:08,723
I will not be a nuisance,

626
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:10,963
so please do not tell me to leave.

627
01:00:10,964 --> 01:00:13,643
What will you do to my grandson?

628
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,682
The execution of deposed heir Lee Seol...

629
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:17,564
will be my grand finale.

630
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:20,363
I may die, but my brother lives.

631
01:00:20,564 --> 01:00:22,883
And he will bring down His Majesty.
