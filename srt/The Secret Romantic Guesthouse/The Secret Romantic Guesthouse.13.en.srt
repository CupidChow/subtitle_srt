00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,937
(Shin Ye Eun)

(Ryeo Un)

3
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:31,138
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:38,257
(Jung Gun Joo)

5
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:44,097
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

6
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:47,017
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:49,098
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:55,977
Are you the leader of Mokinhoe...

9
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:58,617
by the name of Lee Gyeom?

10
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:01,937
Answer me.

11
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:05,617
Tell me why you did this.

12
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:09,257
I wanted to end the King's tyranny...

13
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,098
sooner than later.

14
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:15,298
Lee Seol.

15
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:17,897
Even At the cost of borrowing your name.

16
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,458
Do you believe you can take down His Majesty...

17
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:24,946
on your own?

18
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,776
So you seduced Mokinhoe with lies...

19
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:28,417
to try to take the throne?

20
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,777
However much times have changed,

21
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:35,858
a lie will never become the truth.

22
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:42,218
You must turn everything back.

23
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:46,897
I will not wait long.

24
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,697
Are you all right?

25
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:06,458
Why did Master Kang hold his sword to your neck?

26
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:08,897
We shall talk afterwards.

27
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,708
He wished to stop the King's tyranny?

28
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:27,267
He stole your name.

29
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:29,777
Whatever his cause, that is theft.

30
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:34,657
There is only one throne.

31
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:39,268
He will eventually threaten your life.

32
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,497
My father also...

33
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,897
died at the hands of a brother.

34
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,057
I do not want to...

35
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:51,138
repeat that tragedy.

36
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,138
Both he and I share a goal.

37
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,657
To remove the King and correct law and order.

38
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:00,897
Your Highness.

39
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:07,937
I will give Lee Gyeom an opportunity.

40
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,457
You might end up getting attacked.

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,978
My enemy's enemy could be my greatest ally.

42
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,538
Do you trust Lee Gyeom?

43
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,897
I wish to, at least once.

44
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,937
If he is the man I knew,

45
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,138
he will make the right choice.

46
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,978
It is your turn to sign it, Your Highness.

47
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:55,056
So you seduced Mokinhoe with lies...

48
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:56,617
to try to take the throne?

49
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:23,497
(Lee Seol)

50
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:49,457
Master Kang San is the deposed heir Lee Seol?

51
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,908
The reason he held his sword to your neck was...

52
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:02,178
He told me to turn everything back.

53
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:06,658
It is too late for that.

54
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,137
You know that.

55
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,418
The scholars have signed a pledge,

56
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,137
and you met the Queen Dowager.

57
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,457
I know that.

58
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,658
Whatever others say,

59
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,937
now you are...

60
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,257
Lee Seol.

61
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,098
(Garden of Flowers)

62
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:43,218
Yu Ha knows my identity?

63
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:47,017
Yes. I did ask him to keep it a secret.

64
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,338
Will it be all right?

65
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,577
Do not worry. Yu Ha will not say a word.

66
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,218
I do believe so, but...

67
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,377
You are never at peace.

68
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,057
I always...

69
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,017
cause you concern.

70
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:08,218
Do not say that.

71
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:12,377
I am relieved that we can spend time together like this.

72
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:32,817
So,

73
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,817
why do you not study for the state exam?

74
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:46,658
You are the only one to fail the first exam.

75
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,098
Dan O told me.

76
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,497
My dream is unrelated to the state exam.

77
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:55,738
If a young scholar does not take the state exam,

78
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,017
what else can he do?

79
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,137
I wish to forget about the past.

80
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,418
My future with you is more important.

81
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,418
Why do you always joke your way out of a question?

82
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,298
I wish to know about you.

83
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:15,738
I feel the same.

84
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,057
What do you wish to do?

85
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:25,538
I would like to...

86
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,497
live my life as myself.

87
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:34,257
Not as a ghost who must live like the dead,

88
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,377
but as Yoon Hong Ju.

89
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,738
With my own name.

90
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:50,218
That day will surely come, Lady Hong Ju.

91
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,377
You need not hide.

92
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,658
I saw everything.

93
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:32,457
The rice cake was tasty, so I thought I could share.

94
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:50,018
Do not glare at me.

95
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:52,857
I believe we agreed to keep each other's secret.

96
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:55,977
If this is...

97
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,697
just a fleeting fancy,

98
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,298
do not excite her too much.

99
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,138
I am concerned.

100
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:10,508
That she will get hurt again.

101
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:12,817
What if it is not fleeting?

102
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:20,056
I do not know how to explain it because I have never felt this way.

103
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:21,217
Are you...

104
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,538
serious about my sister Hong Ju?

105
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:27,268
Dan O.

106
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,268
Your sister is just as strong as you.

107
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,737
If you treat her as if she is a child by the water,

108
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,217
how can she venture into the world?

109
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,097
You are right, but still...

110
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,457
- My sister... - I know.

111
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:47,538
But she cannot...

112
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:50,778
live as a ghost forever.

113
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,178
What is the matter this time?

114
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,138
Did you know?

115
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,418
That my father had a secret child.

116
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,817
Did you find Lee Gyeom?

117
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:22,658
So you knew.

118
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:27,418
Tell me everything you know.

119
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,697
I heard Lee Gyeom had his own followers.

120
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,097
Are you speaking of Mokinhoe?

121
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:35,737
Yes.

122
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:39,217
And someone is helping Lee Gyeom.

123
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:40,857
Do you know who it is?

124
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,977
It is none other than the Queen Dowager.

125
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:50,418
The Queen Dowager believes that he is the deposed heir.

126
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,697
So the members of Mokinhoe were not the only ones he deceived.

127
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:56,298
You should watch your back,

128
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,538
or the impostor might take your place for good.

129
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,857
The truth does not matter.

130
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,378
If many people believe it,

131
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:11,138
something that is false can become true.

132
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,618
Scholar Kang.

133
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,977
What brings you to the palace?

134
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,618
I was told to attend the palace party.

135
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:36,736
I did not expect to run into you here.

136
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,897
(Naeyeon: A palace party where women are invited)

137
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,257
As if. You waited for him.

138
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,217
Gosh, we could have left sooner.

139
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,617
- We had to clean up because of her. - Exactly.

140
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,217
A coincidence? As if.

141
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:49,737
Do not act coy. It does not suit you.

142
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,378
Could you...

143
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:05,457
spare me a moment?

144
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,177
Now?

145
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,937
I waited for a while to see you.

146
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:13,737
The truth is, it is my birthday today.

147
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:19,378
Yet I had to entertain men and force myself to smile at them.

148
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,298
I did not want this day to be completely meaningless.

149
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,217
You should have some too.

150
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:01,817
No, I will pass.

151
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,457
Get some rest today.

152
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,378
I will let the madame know.

153
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,057
These are red bean rice cakes.

154
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,697
When my mother was around,

155
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,018
she made these for me on my birthday every year.

156
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:20,258
These will not taste as good as your mother's rice cakes,

157
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,298
but eat as much as you would like.

158
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:57,258
Scholar Kang.

159
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:01,658
Could you...

160
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:03,977
stop viewing me as a lowly kisaeng...

161
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,298
and think of me as a woman?

162
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:11,898
I know...

163
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:15,018
that I should know my place...

164
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,538
and understand that I do not have the right to love you.

165
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:22,658
However,

166
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,298
from the moment I first met you,

167
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,697
I could only see you, no one else but you.

168
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:33,498
I have...

169
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,937
always thought of you as a woman.

170
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:52,618
What are you doing?

171
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,057
It is just that...

172
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:05,577
my heart belongs to someone else.

173
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,977
Are you in love with someone?

174
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,298
By any chance,

175
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,498
is it Lady Dan O?

176
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:24,817
Yes.

177
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:32,298
I truly envy Lady Dan O.

178
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,658
I am certain that she is not always happy about it.

179
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,057
I have upset her many times.

180
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,977
I thought I heard thunder.

181
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,457
Why are you taking your anger out on the fabric?

182
00:15:57,618 --> 00:16:01,737
That cat went into someone else's kitchen.

183
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:04,418
So the cat is gone. That is a good thing, is it not?

184
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,097
It will no longer steal our food.

185
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,018
"Woman?"

186
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:20,538
Since when was he so good at flirting?

187
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:31,577
A noblewoman like you rarely gets to see a man's ankles,

188
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:34,977
but it is easy for a kisaeng like me.

189
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:41,298
Hold on.

190
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,018
What now?

191
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,217
Ban Ya could not have seen the red spot, right?

192
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,057
Goodness, I cannot study.

193
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:56,018
This darn cat is so loud.

194
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,257
Yuk Ho, what are you doing?

195
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:15,497
Why are you here?

196
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,977
Did you see the cat?

197
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,737
I think it went into the yard.

198
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,617
It came into the house, so I scared it away just now.

199
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,017
I see. I am glad it is gone.

200
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:28,737
Go back inside.

201
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:29,937
Okay.

202
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:33,977
Yes.

203
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:48,138
You may come out now.

204
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,017
I cannot get up.

205
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,377
Why not? Will you sleep out here, then?

206
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,378
No.

207
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:56,457
My legs fell asleep.

208
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,618
I have been squatting down like this for a while.

209
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:00,297
Gosh.

210
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,217
I cannot walk.

211
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:13,898
Goodness.

212
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,457
My noodles taste cold...

213
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,378
because of your cold stare.

214
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:33,217
Did I do something wrong?

215
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:36,658
When did you...

216
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:41,097
start thinking of me as a woman?

217
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,098
What?

218
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:44,857
What is this absurd question?

219
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:45,858
I just wanted to ask...

220
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:47,937
for I suddenly became curious.

221
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,737
There is someone you have always thought of as a woman.

222
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,068
Were you at Buyounggak earlier?

223
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,098
As for you...

224
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,457
I do not wish to say I think of you as a woman.

225
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,496
Then what am I? Am I a nobody to you?

226
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:08,497
A lover.

227
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,497
Lovers.

228
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,138
That is what we are.

229
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,217
Anyway,

230
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:53,697
you are such a smooth talker.

231
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:55,348
I mean it.

232
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:57,588
You do not believe me.

233
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:02,068
How much of your feelings...

234
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:05,418
have you revealed to her?

235
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,588
To Ban Ya.

236
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,588
To her, I have no feelings to reveal.

237
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,378
Or...

238
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:16,418
should I say, your skin.

239
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,178
Dan O,

240
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:21,017
I have told you numerous times,

241
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,737
but my being Ban Ya's first is a misunderstanding.

242
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,737
From head to toe, no contact was ever made.

243
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,828
How can one prove his innocence?

244
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,378
Even your ankle?

245
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,537
You have not shown her that either?

246
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:40,828
My ankle?

247
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:44,017
- That is out of the blue. - Be honest with me.

248
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,457
This is absolutely crucial.

249
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,937
She did once try to take off my socks.

250
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,378
But I was drunk out of my mind that day.

251
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:00,777
You know how it is.

252
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,457
Refusing drinks as a rookie puts you on the outs.

253
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:09,257
Right. I hear you.

254
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,297
Get some rest, then.

255
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,348
It did not seem like she understood.

256
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,737
If Ban Ya saw his red spot,

257
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,138
she would know that San...

258
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,658
is Lee Seol.

259
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,697
Are you going to let Lee Seol be?

260
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:50,618
I am contemplating...

261
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,977
how I should handle this matter.

262
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,697
When playing Go, the weaker player goes first.

263
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:58,697
Striking first...

264
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,418
will give you a better chance at winning this battle.

265
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,818
Are you suggesting that I eliminate my brother?

266
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:08,658
It is worth contemplating.

267
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:12,178
Did he not hold his sword to your neck earlier?

268
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:16,098
He also has the watchman by his side.

269
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,338
If you do not strike first,

270
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,098
you will be the one to see blood.

271
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:24,058
I am aware...

272
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,898
that there can only be one Lee Seol.

273
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,736
Why are you looking for Ban Ya?

274
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:36,418
I have something to ask her.

275
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:37,977
She is not in her chambers.

276
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:40,737
She made her way to Master Jang's residence.

277
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:44,898
To Master Jang's? What business could she have over there?

278
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:47,098
As if there can be another reason.

279
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:50,217
He probably summoned her to adore her some more.

280
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:59,217
So, is there anything new you found out?

281
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:03,457
It can be anything.

282
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:06,178
I believe I have given you ample amount of time.

283
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:09,737
Well...

284
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:14,537
This is not in regard to Lee Seol,

285
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,217
but Madame Hwa Ryung has been acting suspiciously lately.

286
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:23,736
What?

287
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,257
She frequently leaves Buyounggak after sundown,

288
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:28,937
and young scholars...

289
00:23:29,297 --> 00:23:31,937
have been visiting her chamber as if it was theirs.

290
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,297
Why would young scholars want her company?

291
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,937
It did not seem like they were there to drink.

292
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,257
They could be conspiring...

293
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:43,138
judging by all the secrecy.

294
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:47,697
One of them is a scholar who resides at Garden of Flowers.

295
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:50,378
I heard he was the fifth son of Lord Jung Yoon.

296
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,137
As in Jung Yu Ha?

297
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,138
Yes.

298
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:56,216
I am certain...

299
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:59,457
that they are conspiring behind your back.

300
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:03,257
Look into what Hwa Ryung is up to.

301
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,737
Yes, I will do just that.

302
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:19,217
Ban Ya.

303
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:25,178
Did you...

304
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:28,418
tell him the truth?

305
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,497
To Master Jang, I mean.

306
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,618
You were also...

307
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:34,697
aware of it.

308
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:40,058
You know Scholar Kang's true identity.

309
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,578
You agreed to discuss it with me first.

310
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:48,058
- You should have... - Do not fret...

311
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:49,898
for I did not say anything.

312
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:58,378
What do you recommend for a silk garment?

313
00:24:58,737 --> 00:25:01,216
The options for men's wear are inside.

314
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:02,338
Please come on in.

315
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,858
It is for a lady.

316
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,777
You said you wished to live as Yoon Hong Ju.

317
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:16,138
There will come a day for you...

318
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:18,418
to explore the world in your new outfit.

319
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,457
(Hyun of the Indong Jang Clan)

320
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:06,658
My dear fiancé.

321
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:08,858
My dear fiancé.

322
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,737
Please open your eyes.

323
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:17,537
No, you cannot leave me all by myself.

324
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,138
That is enough.

325
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:29,898
Crying will not solve anything.

326
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,457
Vowing to be chaste...

327
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,297
is the most appropriate way for a woman to mourn her man.

328
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,537
If your father was alive,

329
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:42,977
he would have said it himself.

330
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:47,497
Hong Ju.

331
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:52,858
Give it much thought.

332
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,418
I am clouded by suspicion to let this slide.

333
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,618
It should be confirmed.

334
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,497
Of course, my lord.

335
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:33,137
My goodness. I was capable of carrying it myself.

336
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:34,577
Are they not heavy?

337
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,658
They are light as a feather.

338
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,577
Do you want them in the kitchen?

339
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:42,217
Sure. I hope to make a refreshing batch of dongchimi.

340
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:45,217
This will be our side dish all throughout winter.

341
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:50,776
Hold on. Are you saying you will make it yourself?

342
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:51,818
That is correct.

343
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:55,257
I hope to lessen Lady Dan O's burden.

344
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:59,178
When one's heart dances to the breeze,

345
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,658
it is difficult to focus on work.

346
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:04,418
Wait. When one's heart dances to the breeze?

347
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,457
Then,

348
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:11,297
I doubt you have been able to focus on work lately.

349
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,138
Gosh.

350
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:17,777
My goodness!

351
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:19,658
My gosh.

352
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:25,898
I guess we will not have any dongchimi this winter.

353
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:34,297
Is Dan O not inside?

354
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:37,097
She left early this morning...

355
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:38,618
and has not returned.

356
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:40,737
I am sure she will be back soon.

357
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:43,658
You are wondering about her the second you are home.

358
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,217
Gosh.

359
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:02,217
I have something to tell you.

360
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,378
Meet me at Jungnimwon.

361
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,737
Please do not be too alarmed.

362
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:34,138
Ban Ya knows everything.

363
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,378
She knows about you.

364
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:40,898
What do you mean she knows?

365
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:47,737
I will leave you to talk and wait outside.

366
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,697
Please do not worry.

367
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,497
I will not report you, Your Highness.

368
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:08,497
I appreciate your words.

369
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,457
And do not get me wrong.

370
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:14,697
My romantic feelings for you is not why I am keeping your secret.

371
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,217
My father.

372
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:21,537
He died trying to protect you.

373
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,017
No child...

374
00:30:25,138 --> 00:30:28,217
should make their father's death be in vain.

375
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:33,257
I am sorry your father died.

376
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,138
I should have asked for forgiveness sooner.

377
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:41,777
It was not your fault.

378
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:44,217
I will rectify everything.

379
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,217
When I do,

380
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:49,217
your father's reputation will be restored.

381
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:58,016
(Garden of Flowers)

382
00:30:58,017 --> 00:30:59,257
I had no idea...

383
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,537
Ban Ya suffered so much.

384
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,338
It was my fault.

385
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,937
She lost her family because of me.

386
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,777
I ruined her whole life.

387
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:18,858
You said you have a duty...

388
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:21,578
as heir to the throne.

389
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,618
That many lost their lives,

390
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:30,497
and you cannot ignore them.

391
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:34,257
I think...

392
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:38,378
I understand that a bit now.

393
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,737
If I do not bring down the King,

394
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,898
their sacrifices will be for nothing.

395
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:53,898
I will not let that happen.

396
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,178
You are back early today.

397
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:20,418
- Did you have dinner? - Yes.

398
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:22,977
Can we talk?

399
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:27,818
I will...

400
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:30,457
let you chat, then.

401
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:37,777
Go on.

402
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:40,017
What will you do now?

403
00:32:41,138 --> 00:32:42,338
See you at the gathering.

404
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:44,537
Tomorrow, at 4pm.

405
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:46,537
Very well.

406
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,217
I will be there.

407
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,977
What did you say?

408
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:02,098
Who met whom?

409
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,977
Lee Seol and Lee Gyeom.

410
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,138
They met each other.

411
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:09,578
And how...

412
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:12,818
do you know that?

413
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:14,937
Lee Seol came to me.

414
00:33:15,217 --> 00:33:16,418
He suddenly appeared...

415
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:18,937
and asked about Lee Gyeom.

416
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:21,818
He was aware that...

417
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:25,736
Lee Gyeom is leading Mokinhoe in his name.

418
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,617
He knows that much already?

419
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:31,098
We will yet again have two brothers...

420
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,017
fighting over the throne.

421
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:35,457
Do you think those two...

422
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,257
would be any different from the other royals?

423
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,178
I do not know who will live and who will die,

424
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,257
but I need you...

425
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:46,937
to make a decision.

426
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:49,658
As I promised,

427
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,257
I will turn...

428
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,658
the man of your choice into Lee Seol.

429
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,658
(Capital District Office)

430
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,497
The Chief Eunuch...

431
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:07,338
visited Lord Sin last night?

432
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:08,858
Not the watchman?

433
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:12,658
Yes. He was in the mansion for a long time.

434
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:15,297
Well done.

435
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:16,987
Keep watching him.

436
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:18,217
Yes, sir.

437
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,538
You asked for me?

438
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:39,538
Do you have anything new on First Vice-premier Sin?

439
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,737
I do not have anything worth reporting.

440
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,697
You do not?

441
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:49,257
No.

442
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:51,058
I will report right away...

443
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:53,058
if I notice anything suspicious.

444
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,018
You are excused.

445
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,618
Did Lee Gyeom send you?

446
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:48,658
Attack!

447
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:21,618
Tell me.

448
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:23,377
Who sent you?

449
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,697
Was his name Kim Chi Woon?

450
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:12,537
Do you still...

451
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:15,297
have nothing on Lee Pyeong's bodyguard Yoon Dan O spoke of?

452
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:16,618
I sent men...

453
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,018
not just to Kaesong but to all the provinces to look.

454
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,777
I have something else to report to you.

455
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:26,377
The inspector who was executed for high treason.

456
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,178
The fool...

457
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:32,466
who spoke nonsense and called it advice?

458
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,467
Yes, Your Majesty.

459
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:36,947
I heard from the Department of Justice...

460
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:40,217
that his elderly mother was bought and freed from slavery...

461
00:37:40,737 --> 00:37:43,257
by none other than Lord Sin Won Ho.

462
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:48,817
Is it treason?

463
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,377
Is the First Vice-premier...

464
00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:56,417
plotting treason?

465
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:02,138
Kim Si Yeol.

466
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:04,417
Why on earth would you...

467
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:05,737
What shall I do?

468
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:07,947
Put away...

469
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:09,618
your sword.

470
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,777
Are you sure?

471
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,178
I will hear an explanation.

472
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,507
I thought we shared a goal,

473
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:29,058
and that perhaps we could work together.

474
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:34,467
That trust was just shattered.

475
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:37,737
You will not believe me,

476
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:40,376
but this was not my idea.

477
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,947
Whose was it, then?

478
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,416
Who else would do this?

479
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,946
Why are you here so early?

480
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:47,257
I said 4pm.

481
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:49,217
You asked me to come an hour early.

482
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,817
You sent me a letter.

483
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:03,018
(From Jung Yu Ha)

484
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,987
If you do not strike first,

485
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,947
you will be the one to see blood.

486
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:12,697
I am aware...

487
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,507
that there can only be one Lee Seol.

488
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:17,947
So...

489
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,018
I must step back.

490
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,058
You will give up after all this?

491
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,466
What about the aftermath?

492
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,538
I will meet Lee Seol at the gathering tomorrow...

493
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:29,217
and tell him of my intentions.

494
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:55,658
I think I know...

495
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:57,697
who set this up.

496
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:03,856
I will take care of it.

497
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:05,058
I started it.

498
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,578
I will correct it all.

499
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:10,538
I mean it.

500
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:14,417
It was not the throne I could not give up.

501
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:17,336
Mokinhoe's members signed a pledge...

502
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:19,377
to give up their lives to depose the King.

503
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,737
I did not want them to be discouraged.

504
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:24,507
That was what I feared the most.

505
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:28,138
Like you said,

506
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:30,658
we share the same goal.

507
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:33,217
So do me a favour.

508
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,897
(Pyeong)

509
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,817
(Pyeong)

510
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:49,658
Your Highness, now that you have revealed yourself,

511
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,337
you should be the one leading Mokinhoe.

512
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,257
The Lee Seol whom Mokinhoe supports...

513
00:40:57,578 --> 00:40:58,817
is not I.

514
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:04,697
Lee Gyeom.

515
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:07,377
It is you.

516
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,857
If I appear before them, they will be confused.

517
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,138
So continue to be their leader for the time being.

518
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:18,987
I will think about what we should do...

519
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:22,058
moving forward.

520
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:31,217
And this too.

521
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:40,138
I do not have the right to take it from you.

522
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:44,058
Father left it behind for you after all.

523
00:41:58,377 --> 00:41:59,507
Let us drink.

524
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:14,138
The two of you have been working very hard...

525
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:17,466
to track Lee Seol down for over a decade.

526
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,578
I am still not able to help you put your worries to rest, Your Majesty.

527
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:23,138
I feel awful.

528
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,098
Do not say that, First Vice-premier.

529
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,947
Without you,

530
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:31,946
I would not have been able to protect my throne.

531
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,947
Thank you for embracing me despite my shortcomings.

532
00:42:35,897 --> 00:42:38,507
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

533
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:46,578
Have you found anything else about Lee Seol?

534
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,857
We did detect something suspicious.

535
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:54,467
I will find evidence and let Your Majesty know soon.

536
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:56,817
Your Majesty.

537
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,467
Do not let Lee Seol concern you.

538
00:43:02,618 --> 00:43:04,657
I have sent a spy to Mokinhoe...

539
00:43:04,658 --> 00:43:06,578
to gather Intel.

540
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,776
You arranged it yourself?

541
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,138
At their most recent meeting,

542
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:14,467
Lee Seol finally revealed himself...

543
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,337
and became their official leader.

544
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,467
I am trying to find out when their next meeting is.

545
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:24,857
I will raid Mokinhoe with our soldiers.

546
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:27,538
So when that happens,

547
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,777
we can finally capture Lee Seol?

548
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:34,507
Yes, Your Majesty. We certainly can.

549
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,947
This time,

550
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:40,138
I will be sure to capture him and bring him to Your Majesty.

551
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:57,137
You two came back together?

552
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:59,138
Yes, we ran into each other out front.

553
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:08,217
Your hands must be cold. Hand it over. I will finish it.

554
00:44:09,018 --> 00:44:10,737
It is fine. I got this.

555
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:12,978
Come on. Hand it over and get some rest.

556
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:15,857
Hey, San.

557
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:18,897
Do you really think Dan O is here to sweep the yard?

558
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:20,897
I can tell at a glance that she was waiting for you.

559
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,658
Are you hurt?

560
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:44,978
Was it you?

561
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:47,297
Did you try to get Snowflake killed?

562
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:50,857
I am deeply disappointed in you.

563
00:44:51,337 --> 00:44:52,856
I said I would concede.

564
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,377
- Why did you do such a thing... - I...

565
00:44:55,978 --> 00:44:58,178
did not wish to witness another cruel sight.

566
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:00,897
Those who fall prey to political conflicts...

567
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,377
are always honest and upright people like you.

568
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:08,138
The same goes for the Crown Prince.

569
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,458
How do you know so much...

570
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,737
about the Crown Prince?

571
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,697
I have always been curious.

572
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:22,978
There is something about you that I do not know.

573
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:27,938
Are you...

574
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:29,737
Words about his immaculate reputation...

575
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:32,018
even reached this lowly woman...

576
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,978
for he was incredibly kind and intelligent.

577
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:41,138
I do not want you to be involved in this any longer.

578
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:55,897
Who is my mother?

579
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:59,737
My father's written will did not mention her.

580
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:02,897
I heard she was of low birth.

581
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:07,417
It would be better for you to not wonder.

582
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:35,897
What is it?

583
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:38,498
Is there something bothering you?

584
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,458
No.

585
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:45,777
It is cold. What are you doing out here?

586
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:50,458
Is Scholar Kim not back yet?

587
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:53,417
It is getting late.

588
00:46:53,658 --> 00:46:55,018
He is already back.

589
00:46:56,618 --> 00:46:58,217
I see. He is already home.

590
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:02,417
I wish he could have told me.

591
00:47:02,618 --> 00:47:04,578
But he is a little hurt.

592
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,138
- He should rest up... - What? He is hurt?

593
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:12,297
Yes. He said he got into a fight with some scoundrels... My gosh.

594
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:40,538
Scholar Kim.

595
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:57,297
Lady Hong Ju.

596
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,498
Why are you here?

597
00:48:04,377 --> 00:48:06,217
This is my room.

598
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,337
Why were you asleep...

599
00:48:11,377 --> 00:48:12,737
as if you were dead?

600
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:29,098
Were you worried that I would die?

601
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:31,458
Is that why you ran here?

602
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:34,217
I heard you were hurt.

603
00:48:34,857 --> 00:48:35,938
Let me see.

604
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:39,256
It is nothing serious. It is just a minor injury.

605
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:42,256
What happened that you got into a fight?

606
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:44,257
I am very well-spoken, you know.

607
00:48:44,578 --> 00:48:47,297
They could not beat me with their words, so they used their fists.

608
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,578
I am tired of such jokes that you tell!

609
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:54,257
You truly are...

610
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:58,018
You are so unpredictable.

611
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:05,737
I am sorry.

612
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:08,217
But it truly is a minor injury.

613
00:49:26,978 --> 00:49:28,217
How about a duel?

614
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:34,097
You drastically improve when your competitive juices are flowing.

615
00:49:34,098 --> 00:49:37,138
A duel? I cannot beat you.

616
00:49:37,618 --> 00:49:40,058
I will hit the bull's-eye with all three shots.

617
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:42,058
If you hit it once, you win.

618
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,018
Deal.

619
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:47,657
But there should be a penalty for the one who loses.

620
00:49:47,658 --> 00:49:50,138
You decide. I do not care.

621
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,458
Gosh.

622
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,098
Please...

623
00:50:49,098 --> 00:50:51,297
Gosh, I almost had it. You saw that.

624
00:50:52,178 --> 00:50:54,577
You are right. You almost won.

625
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:55,857
You never know.

626
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:58,257
You could miss your last shot.

627
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:00,297
Here.

628
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:24,978
You are a strict mentor for sure.

629
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:28,297
You just had to beat me.

630
00:51:32,098 --> 00:51:33,417
We are meant to win bets.

631
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:42,538
And I said I would not go easy on you.

632
00:51:42,777 --> 00:51:45,817
Sure. I do not want you to go easy on me either.

633
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:51,737
Make it quick, will you?

634
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:16,058
What is this?

635
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:20,098
A five-coloured patch pouch symbolizes health and longevity.

636
00:52:20,697 --> 00:52:23,138
I made it myself, so have it on you at all times.

637
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,658
I did not take you as superstitious.

638
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,817
One should find reassurance somewhere.

639
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:33,018
There is nothing one cannot achieve when desperate enough.

640
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:35,377
All right.

641
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:39,098
I will keep it on me...

642
00:52:39,737 --> 00:52:40,737
until after my hair turns Gray.

643
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:47,777
If...

644
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:54,578
Even if...

645
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:59,018
this pouch does not prove to be effective...

646
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:03,337
and nothing happens as wished,

647
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,138
do not...

648
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:13,458
let yourself crumble.

649
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,138
(Garden of Flowers)

650
00:53:38,217 --> 00:53:41,417
Are you sure I can leave in this attire?

651
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:42,777
It is just for the day.

652
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:44,737
I have found a good place for you.

653
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,457
Only those recognizing you...

654
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,458
will be the migratory birds that have come to rest.

655
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:24,498
(Tavern)

656
00:54:38,217 --> 00:54:39,217
Gosh.

657
00:54:42,257 --> 00:54:43,257
Goodness.

658
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,578
It is all right.

659
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:53,058
The handkerchief seems more valuable than my shoes.

660
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:56,018
Let me.

661
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:57,138
Save it.

662
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:05,377
(Tavern)

663
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,857
What brings you by the tavern?

664
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:10,817
I came to see you.

665
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:12,737
Are you almost done?

666
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:19,578
Dan O.

667
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:21,897
Do you remember...

668
00:55:22,978 --> 00:55:25,538
how I once asked to meet you at Gwangtong Bridge?

669
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:27,897
Yes.

670
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:32,377
We were not able to converse that day, though.

671
00:55:33,337 --> 00:55:34,777
It is long overdue,

672
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,938
but I will say what I wished to say that day.

673
00:55:53,618 --> 00:55:54,618
Try them on.

674
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,417
I was never comfortable seeing you taking hurried steps.

675
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,458
Yu Ha, I...

676
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:04,897
I know.

677
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:09,058
You are not likely to head my way in them.

678
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:12,737
Still...

679
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:15,978
Still,

680
00:56:17,978 --> 00:56:20,857
I liked you a great deal, Dan O.

681
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:25,817
You have no idea...

682
00:56:27,058 --> 00:56:29,458
how much comfort you brought me.

683
00:56:31,777 --> 00:56:32,978
It is how...

684
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:38,498
I was able to hold on.

685
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:48,896
So that was the reason...

686
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:50,578
she held on to Garden of Flowers as if it were her life.

687
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:52,138
Yoon Hong Ju.

688
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:55,578
She has been alive all this time.

689
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:08,337
How is it?

690
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:10,178
Do you feel better?

691
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:13,417
They say that happiness is like a fleeting moment.

692
00:57:14,618 --> 00:57:16,777
This must be it.

693
00:57:37,817 --> 00:57:38,817
Lady Hong Ju.

694
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:44,458
I...

695
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,257
am not...

696
00:57:49,578 --> 00:57:50,578
who you think I am.

697
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,737
The Kim Si Yeol you know...

698
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:02,897
might not even exist.

699
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,257
But please know this.

700
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:19,658
I may not be who I say I am,

701
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:23,938
but my feelings...

702
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:28,777
are nothing but genuine.

703
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:35,938
I am enamoured of you.

704
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:34,737
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

705
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:54,776
Do not leave me all alone again.

706
00:59:54,777 --> 00:59:56,416
If she truly is alive,

707
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,336
I will make sure she takes her last breath.

708
00:59:58,337 --> 01:00:00,376
My lady, you are a brave woman.

709
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:01,856
You are braver than most.

710
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:03,216
Perhaps you fear...

711
01:00:03,217 --> 01:00:04,736
the possibility of having your brother's blood...

712
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:06,216
- on your hands. - I am afraid.

713
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:08,537
I will be by your side,

714
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,736
so safely take your seat on the throne.

715
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:14,457
Deposed heir Lee Seol will die within this month.

716
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:15,657
If he lives past this month,

717
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:17,657
will you pay with your own life?

718
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:19,336
Do you wish to execute His Majesty?

719
01:00:19,337 --> 01:00:20,577
That day will present an opportunity.

720
01:00:20,578 --> 01:00:21,978
An opportunity to eliminate the King.
