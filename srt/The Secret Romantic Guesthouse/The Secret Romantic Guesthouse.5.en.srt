(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,920
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,920
I will give you one month.

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,199
If you cannot find Lee Seol by then,

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,879
Garden of Flowers will be mine forever.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,358
Wherever he may be,

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
I will find him.

13
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,758
You will find the deposed heir?

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,688
If you were to tell me anything...

15
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,439
I heard a servant of the deposed crown princess' family...

16
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,958
lives in Gwacheon-hyeon.

17
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,078
If there is anything you know,

18
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,438
please tell me.

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,689
It is his ankle.

20
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,798
Think long and hard.

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,958
It is a red spot.

22
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,438
Dan O is searching for Snowflake?

23
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,279
Then we should all look together.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,639
Good idea. It sounds like fun.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,158
So how will you find him?

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,318
Do you have anything to go on?

27
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,039
The late Prince Geumryeong...

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,279
had a close relationship with the deposed Crown Prince.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,598
One of the maids...

30
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,958
From what I have heard, she runs an inn now.

31
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,959
Hwa Ryung?

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,358
There is a precious treasure.

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,559
The Crown Prince left it behind for his heir.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,798
Leave Hanyang. This is your last chance.

35
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,318
Does Yoon Dan O truly not know...

36
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,798
who you are?

37
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,239
San, wait up.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,518
You were taking forever, Your Majesty.

39
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,000
I told you not to call me that.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,199
- San! - Ransack every clinic...

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,479
in Jungchon if you must. He must be found.

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,959
Please help him.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
Halt.

44
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,960
Open the palanquin door.

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,120
Why would you ask to see inside...

46
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,039
a noble's palanquin?

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960
I am after a traitor.

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
Lower the palanquin.

49
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,360
- He goes that way. Chase him! - Yes, sir!

50
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,639
He has gone.

51
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,120
He has gone.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,158
(Episode 5)

53
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,360
Hurry.

54
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,719
Lay him down.

55
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,879
Oh, dear.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
My gosh.

57
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,240
Here, give him a pillow.

58
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,680
My goodness. We need wet towels.

59
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,199
We must have some medicine.

60
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,680
No. I will go.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,319
You stay with him. He might expire.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
What?

63
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,610
You need to be treated.

64
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,319
Do not get the wrong idea.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,079
I am not...

66
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,120
Dan O.

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,839
Yoon Dan O.

68
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,050
It was you again.

69
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,120
This time again,

70
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,480
it was you.

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,199
(Garden of Flowers)

72
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,199
Oh, dear.

73
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,879
Goodness.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Is something wrong?

75
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,319
Well...

76
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,199
San!

77
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,919
What a mess.

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,959
How did you of all people get shot?

79
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,799
News traveled fast.

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
Do not cause such a fuss.

81
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,759
I must call a physician.

82
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,399
That will take too long.

83
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,720
Do you have licorice root or ginger?

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,839
Yes, we do.

85
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,639
It all depends on tonight.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,519
Let us hope he pulls through.

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
Do not worry.

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,480
San is strong and healthy, and he will survive.

89
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,959
How did he get so badly hurt?

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,519
I do not know.

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Ms. Naju said you came in together.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,279
- What... - Well...

93
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,519
I found him passed out in the street,

94
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,639
so I brought him home.

95
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,360
I see.

96
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
I guess something did happen.

97
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,000
He was carrying his real sword.

98
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,639
You do not need a new deal?

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,639
A deal?

100
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,680
With the likes of you?

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
Very well.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
I was told not to look for her.

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
- What? - Yoon Dan O.

104
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,519
That girl.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,600
He made it clear that I was not to approach her.

106
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,090
(Garden of Flowers)

107
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,399
Hey.

108
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,330
Do not exert yourself.

109
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,450
You cannot move yet.

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,639
Last night.

111
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,720
What happened?

112
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,399
Dan O found you passed out and brought you back.

113
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,360
You would be in a coffin now if not for her.

114
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,919
How did you get shot by a poisoned arrow?

115
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,559
Did you come across a sworn enemy?

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Why would I even ask? You survived, and that is enough.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,240
Did Dan O not say anything else?

118
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,399
"Anything else?"

119
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,159
She said she found you on the street.

120
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,120
She did not say anything else.

121
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,840
Why? Did something happen between you two?

122
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,330
No. Nothing like that.

123
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,329
Get some rest. I will get you something to drink.

124
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,330
I would rather...

125
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,519
speak with Dan O.

126
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,919
She is not in.

127
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,559
Master Jang called and she left early.

128
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,759
So, are you making progress in finding Snowflake?

129
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,399
If you have something to say, just say it.

130
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,759
While searching for Snowflake,

131
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,720
were you endangered in any way?

132
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,159
By whom?

133
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,720
By the watchman.

134
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,240
Do you know anything about him?

135
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,799
Yes. I know of him.

136
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,039
That Snowflake...

137
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,759
has a shadow warrior that protects him.

138
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,240
Did you know that the warrior was a slayer?

139
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,559
Just how many lives he took.

140
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,600
I cannot even keep count.

141
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
So you must be careful.

142
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
If he finds out about you,

143
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,720
he will kill you before anybody else.

144
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Will my turn ever come?

145
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,639
Even you...

146
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,679
are still alive.

147
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,159
- What did you say? - If you are done talking,

148
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,320
I shall be leaving then.

149
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,360
If the watchman shows up, you must let me know.

150
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,558
The watchman is not the one I must find.

151
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,000
Do not forget that you do not have much time left.

152
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
You have five days.

153
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,639
So what if...

154
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,120
I manage to find him?

155
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,279
The watchman.

156
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,240
What will happen if I manage to find him?

157
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,720
If you bring the watchman to me,

158
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,720
I will write off your debt.

159
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,679
You mean...

160
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,639
you will hand over Garden of Flowers?

161
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,559
If we find him, we can find Snowflake too.

162
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,679
The watchman is...

163
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,639
always by Snowflake's side.

164
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,519
Hello? Are you inside?

165
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,519
No way.

166
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,279
He recognized me?

167
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
For the past few days,

168
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,159
you have been stuck in the room.

169
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,240
Is it because of me?

170
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,000
Rumor has it that...

171
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
a young female ghost lives in this house.

172
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,039
There must be a reason...

173
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,919
you are hiding here while putting up with such rumors.

174
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,919
Goodness.

175
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,159
I did not come here to interrogate you.

176
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,320
I came here to tell you this.

177
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
No one knows...

178
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,039
that I saw you.

179
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Everyone...

180
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,639
will just think that I saw the female ghost.

181
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,480
I did not want you to worry.

182
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
The moon is very bright tonight.

183
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Come out from time to time...

184
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,320
and walk around the yard at least.

185
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
San.

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Are you there?

187
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,120
Where did he go?

188
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,600
He should not be moving around yet.

189
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,679
If we find him, we can find Snowflake too.

190
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,440
The watchman is always by Snowflake's side.

191
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,399
What are you doing?

192
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,000
My gosh, this drawer is...

193
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,039
Is this broken?

194
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,889
Yu Ha, what you saw just now...

195
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,919
Are you asking me to feign ignorance?

196
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,679
Yes, precisely.

197
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,720
As they say, nothing in life is free.

198
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,279
Then how about this?

199
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,558
I know of something you truly need.

200
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,720
Something I need?

201
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,919
What could it be?

202
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,679
You know, that thing. A while back,

203
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,719
I saw you reading it in secret on the porch.

204
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,239
Hold on. Do not tell me...

205
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,650
I heard the erotic drawing art by Soe Dol was very impressive.

206
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,960
Those at Buyounggak told me.

207
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,999
You were mistaken back then, and you cannot be more wrong about this.

208
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
I swear, I have never read such a book.

209
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,039
Where should I begin if I were to explain myself...

210
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,410
Finally, you woke up.

211
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,440
How is your wound? Any better?

212
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,890
You and your temper.

213
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,559
Fine, I will leave you alone.

214
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,200
You woke up, so eat something.

215
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,799
Do not make Dan O worry.

216
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,960
Well, you must have your reasons.

217
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,359
So you will not tell him?

218
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,039
Well...

219
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,680
We are accomplices anyway.

220
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,169
Then what about the erotic art book?

221
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,170
I told you. I do not read such books.

222
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,279
You are sure, right?

223
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,719
You had better not have a sudden change of heart.

224
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,480
- My heart will forever be set. - Fine.

225
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,959
Such an honest, upright man as yourself...

226
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,170
would never read such books.

227
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,039
Dan O.

228
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,039
You seem to forget this from time to time.

229
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,680
I told you...

230
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,480
- that I would always help you. - Right.

231
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,920
- I appreciate your kind words. - So...

232
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,519
just tell me whenever you need to unburden yourself, okay?

233
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,170
Just keep it a secret, please.

234
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,119
That will be enough.

235
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
All right.

236
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,720
"With her body,"

237
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,119
"Yeon Yi gently..."

238
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Hey, no!

239
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,650
"Yeon Yi gently embraced the guard's shoulders."

240
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,240
"Even though he was a warrior who had fought in wars,"

241
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,559
"he felt helpless when he saw Yeon Yi's tears."

242
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,890
Give it back! You brat.

243
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
So this was it?

244
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,119
So you have been immersed in this romance novel.

245
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,559
Hey, look.

246
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,359
It is not one of those mediocre romance novels.

247
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,799
This love story between a warrior...

248
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,759
and a female physician transcends social class, and...

249
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,720
Gosh, forget it.

250
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,240
What would an inexperienced kid like you even know?

251
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,650
"Inexperienced?"

252
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,358
The tears that the ladies have shed because of me...

253
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,650
would certainly fill a well.

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,680
A deep well. It is so deep that it never dries.

255
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,440
Oh, my.

256
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
I suppose I still do not know you well yet.

257
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,279
Right.

258
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,480
Even skilled physicians struggle when they have to cure poison,

259
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,170
but you managed to bring San back to life.

260
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,039
How did you do it?

261
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,000
I learned a thing or two through overhearing.

262
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,519
Well, I will let you get back to your book.

263
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,279
He picked it up somewhere?

264
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
I hear His Majesty welcomed a son.

265
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,410
The royal bloodline could have been severed,

266
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,598
so what a joy this is.

267
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,358
Every son...

268
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,439
the former Crown Prince had died before their time.

269
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,999
Heirs are that valuable.

270
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,078
Why else do you think the former king...

271
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,119
urgently crowned his young grandson?

272
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,519
Although he did end up being deposed.

273
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,440
- Let us drink. - Sure.

274
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,599
Welcome.

275
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,640
Is something the matter?

276
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,559
Run a new background check...

277
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,119
on all the scholars at Garden of Flowers.

278
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,519
But nothing was out of the ordinary.

279
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,119
Snowflake has stayed hidden most of his life.

280
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,480
Faking his identity would not be a challenge for him.

281
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,000
If the watchman shows up, you must let me know.

282
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,519
You should not be here...

283
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,440
when you almost died last night.

284
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,720
Why are you here anyway...

285
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,240
when you must be busy?

286
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,359
I knew it. You still have a fever.

287
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,200
Here you go. Drink every single drop.

288
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,319
Dan O.

289
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,559
I am grateful...

290
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,119
for that night.

291
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,400
However,

292
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,440
that is where I draw the line.

293
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,880
This will only make us both uncomfortable.

294
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,799
But...

295
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,039
I just...

296
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,279
I was worried.

297
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,319
You were gravely wounded.

298
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,400
Stop. Do not be concerned since it is a nuisance.

299
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,599
I bet it is a first for you.

300
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,519
No one has ever nursed you back to health before.

301
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,559
You would let your wounds fester before receiving any help.

302
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,880
No wonder you kept masking your pain...

303
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,640
even when you were at death's door.

304
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,920
As if you know everything.

305
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,440
What do you know about me anyway?

306
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,960
Did you know that the warrior was a slayer?

307
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,440
Tell me, then.

308
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,720
How much do you know about me?

309
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,680
Are you...

310
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,319
the watchman?

311
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,960
Are you truly...

312
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
a man one must fear?

313
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,640
What happens...

314
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
to those who know you?

315
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,440
What?

316
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,759
Is there a reason...

317
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,480
I must not know you?

318
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,440
You seem to be curious about me.

319
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,799
It is not common...

320
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,160
for someone taking the military service exam...

321
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,640
to be attacked by a poisoned arrow.

322
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
Maybe I am not the average warrior.

323
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,519
You only carry around a wooden sword,

324
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,079
but you had a metal sword that night.

325
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
Did you not understand me?

326
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,959
I am telling you to mind your own business.

327
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,039
Have you ever...

328
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,920
hurt a person with a real sword before?

329
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,119
I have injured countless men.

330
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,759
So...

331
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,799
if you ever find yourself in that situation again,

332
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,400
run.

333
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
Run from me.

334
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,839
As far away as possible.

335
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Goodness.

336
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,319
My gosh.

337
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,799
Hand it over and get some shut-eye.

338
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,240
I will do the rest.

339
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,479
It is a task for the lowly.

340
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,400
Nonsense. Anyone can do this.

341
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,200
Please stop that.

342
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,000
Why are you even here at this late hour?

343
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,000
I thought I would look at the moon...

344
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,880
that was shining outside my window.

345
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,279
- Pardon? - But it was not the moon.

346
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,000
It was you, Ms. Naju.

347
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,119
My gosh.

348
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,200
Rather than joking around like this,

349
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,680
I suggest you read more books.

350
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,798
Unbelievable.

351
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,000
It is about time you knew.

352
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,798
Know what?

353
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,240
Just like that moon that becomes fuller,

354
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,480
my feelings for you have been growing.

355
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,119
Goodness me.

356
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
How is that appropriate when I am beneath you?

357
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,799
Beneath me?

358
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,720
I have never thought of you that way.

359
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,920
To me, you are a woman.

360
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,960
My goodness!

361
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,920
Goodness.

362
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,559
There you go.

363
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,599
My gosh.

364
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
First Vice-premier ordered you to bring Lee Seol to him alive?

365
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,000
You will speak with nothing but candor.

367
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,039
Lie to me, and you will pay with more than just your life.

368
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,160
I would not dare to lie to His Majesty.

369
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,599
Recently, the Palace Guards were attacked...

370
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,279
by the watchman protecting Lee Seol.

371
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,920
Will he not be a problem for you?

372
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,799
In construction,

373
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,240
lacking one batch of soil could bring the whole thing down.

374
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,480
At your command that can move mountains,

375
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,519
I will not allow anything to fall through my fingers.

376
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,879
From here on out, report to me personally...

377
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,079
regarding Lee Seol.

378
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,319
I will humbly oblige, Your Majesty.

379
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,880
I dare to ask though.

380
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,319
In the case...

381
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,640
of an impossible situation,

382
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,960
will I have your permission...

383
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,039
to kill him?

384
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,720
Did he give you his orders?

385
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Yes.

386
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,160
He instructed me to report directly to him.

387
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
It is your opportunity.

388
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,119
If this goes well,

389
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,319
His Majesty will greatly appreciate your efforts.

390
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,599
I owe that favor to you, Royal Consort Park.

391
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,079
Then now...

392
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,839
it is your turn to keep your word.

393
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,039
Give me your command.

394
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,480
I will serve you as your weapon.

395
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Even if...

396
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,240
you must attack Lord Sin Won Ho?

397
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,480
There is no exception.

398
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,400
I look forward to it.

399
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,839
Your blade must be sharp and well-aimed.

400
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,798
What is it at this hour?

401
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,559
I have something urgent to report.

402
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,799
About Kim Si Yeol who resides at Garden of Flowers.

403
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,279
When will we have a meeting?

404
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,279
A meeting? For what?

405
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,839
For the Find Seol Gang.

406
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,920
Since San got injured,

407
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,799
we have not discussed Snowflake.

408
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,160
What has happened so far,

409
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,359
I cannot stand being curious...

410
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,839
What?

411
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
What?

412
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,279
Later.

413
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,519
Now is not a good time.

414
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,798
Must you always be so dull-witted?

415
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,519
Wit cannot be learned.

416
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,279
He never reads.

417
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,759
That is harsh.

418
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,558
You were a shriveled cabbage leaf, and I revived you.

419
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,640
Sorry. I am hard to kill.

420
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,079
I said I would carry the table.

421
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,880
A man should be as fit as he is well-learned.

422
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,759
Oh, my...

423
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Here we go.

424
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,880
I did not go on a walk today.

425
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:56,759
My gosh...

426
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
You spilled most of it.

427
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Let me see.

428
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,920
Meat is a rare treat.

429
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Thank you.

430
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,199
It is so hot.

431
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,559
I will go to my room and rest.

432
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,159
Why...

433
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,679
It is suspicious.

434
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,719
There is something between them.

435
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,199
What?

436
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,559
Look.

437
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,289
I can see through people with one eye.

438
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,639
I can read minds.

439
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,199
Did you not see it?

440
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,360
Dan O's fiery gaze.

441
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,159
I think...

442
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,879
Dan O's feelings for San are fiery...

443
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,960
Why would she like him?

444
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,079
That is nonsense.

445
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,329
Oh, my gosh.

446
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,519
You are helpless.

447
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,840
How do you know so little about a woman's heart?

448
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,400
But this, no book explains this.

449
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,039
You seem so excited about it.

450
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,199
So what?

451
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,559
Do you want me to educate you?

452
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:01,079
Shall I fire your heart up too?

453
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,329
I should stop hanging out with you.

454
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,360
Think about it.

455
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:11,159
If this were a state exam topic, you would have failed.

456
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
No pass.

457
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Zero points.

458
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,000
He is not here to see Snowflake.

459
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,079
Thank you.

460
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,559
Come by again.

461
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,519
Pretty, is it not?

462
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,960
It is the best we have these days.

463
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,599
What are you doing over there?

464
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,480
I revised it like this. What do you think?

465
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,159
It should be fine.

466
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,159
How much funds do we have left?

467
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,880
Do not worry about that.

468
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,440
I sent our master a message.

469
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,480
I meant to ask.

470
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,239
Who is this master?

471
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,479
He must be quite influential if he secured us this space.

472
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,329
I have never met him myself.

473
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,960
Our only contact is through a messenger.

474
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,360
I must see the master myself.

475
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,079
Even a small fleck can affect matters of great importance.

476
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,329
What is it this time?

477
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,809
Were you hurt,

478
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,289
or do you plan to get hurt?

479
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,719
Both...

480
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,239
I hope to avoid this time.

481
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,599
I need you to look into someone for me.

482
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Who is it?

483
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,769
Jang Tae Hwa, head of the Capital District Office.

484
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,880
Every detail including his personal life.

485
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,480
Garden of Flowers has a pond. Reach me that way.

486
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:28,809
Young master.

487
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,039
We meet again.

488
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,519
Thank you for helping me last time.

489
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,639
I heard you stay at Garden of Flowers.

490
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,000
Did you find out about me?

491
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,329
I spent my first night with you.

492
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,769
You are my first man.

493
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,119
I do not know how to handle the attention.

494
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,039
Do not mind me.

495
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,960
Whether it was a favor or revenge,

496
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,329
I have always paid it back.

497
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,238
So to you too...

498
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,639
Am I your enemy now?

499
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,119
If so, I apologize.

500
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,289
I am Ban Ya.

501
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,400
Ask for me whenever you need.

502
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,159
I would like to return the favor.

503
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,239
How do you feel?

504
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,519
Any better?

505
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,599
So-so.

506
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:49,599
You move about freely enough, so I guess you have recovered.

507
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,440
You said you would find a way to win without cutting down.

508
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,960
Did you fail to accomplish that?

509
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,599
What you said...

510
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,880
was quite to my liking.

511
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,000
It is rash but ideal.

512
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,960
Are all scholars like this?

513
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,960
Cut out the flowery language and get to the point.

514
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,400
How I got hurt.

515
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,328
Is that what you wish to know?

516
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,329
No.

517
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,840
That is of no importance to me.

518
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,559
And I do not care.

519
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:28,769
However,

520
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,329
if Dan O were to get hurt because of you,

521
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,719
then...

522
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,079
I would become very curious.

523
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,039
About who you truly are.

524
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,880
That sounds like a warning.

525
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,719
You understand things quickly. Of course, you would.

526
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,199
San, I am coming in.

527
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:12,519
My gosh. Well...

528
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,960
Si Yeol told me to make sure you applied the ointment.

529
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,289
You can just leave it there.

530
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,718
It will be hard to apply it on your own.

531
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,039
Just leave it there.

532
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,329
Go ahead and apply it, then.

533
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,400
The wound is deeper than I thought.

534
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,880
Until it fully heals, I will...

535
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,559
Well, what I mean is...

536
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,840
I should take care of you as the innkeeper.

537
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,039
I cannot just ignore you, knowing that you are hurt. So I...

538
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,678
If you are going to tell me once again that I should stop here,

539
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:06,440
I do not know what to say.

540
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,639
Just apply the ointment, will you?

541
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:17,679
Ouch, it hurts.

542
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:25,559
My gosh.

543
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,119
I said I would patch that hole but totally forgot.

544
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,320
I have been all over the place.

545
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,158
It is fine.

546
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,280
I will fix it quickly. Eat first.

547
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,559
Just leave it.

548
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,480
Does it not get chilly at night?

549
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,239
It is still summer.

550
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,039
All right, then.

551
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:50,960
Something is up with you, right?

552
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,639
No, not at all.

553
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,960
Ms. Naju told me about the situation.

554
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,679
She said we might have to leave Garden of Flowers.

555
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,480
Do not worry about anything.

556
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,719
I will get it all sorted out.

557
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,280
You do not have to do this anymore.

558
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,920
- Hong Ju. - Just to protect me...

559
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,880
I do not want you to endanger yourself.

560
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,359
It is not like that. This is...

561
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,840
If you keep doing whatever you want,

562
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,800
I know what I will do.

563
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,079
I will go meet Master Jang.

564
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,198
Telling him that I am still alive like this...

565
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,800
Hong Ju, how could you say such a thing?

566
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,959
After everything we have done to protect you from him...

567
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,199
As if I asked you to save me.

568
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,440
I never wanted this.

569
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,159
My love, you walk with soft steps

570
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,679
Toward me

571
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,999
With each gentle step you take

572
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,039
I smell your beautiful scent

573
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,159
Why are you so late?

574
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:34,079
You got all dolled up to go see flowers with me?

575
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,079
I wanted to give you this.

576
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,639
"Longevity?"

577
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,239
This will keep you safe, my darling.

578
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,000
So do not get hurt.

579
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,519
"My darling?"

580
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,079
We will get married soon,

581
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,039
so I should get used to it.

582
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,480
(Longevity)

583
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,920
This is only a security deposit.

584
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,840
Once the ship sails off, you will have to pay twice the amount.

585
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,480
I will, for sure.

586
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:17,440
Since we met like this,

587
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,519
let us have some rice wine together.

588
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,960
Sure thing.

589
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,599
What are you planning to do?

590
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,800
Will you actually go to Qing?

591
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,719
Yes, so I can run away if things go south.

592
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,679
I do not want anyone to get hurt.

593
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,880
This time, I truly wish...

594
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:52,679
to make sure no one gets hurt.

595
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,118
Is the master a monk or something? Why bring us to this temple?

596
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,760
Like I said, I do not know what they look like.

597
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,920
We will meet them and find out. Come along. Let us hurry.

598
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,400
The scholars are here.

599
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,920
We apologize for contacting you out of the blue.

600
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,400
No, it is fine.

601
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,519
I assume it means things are going well.

602
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
You may contact me whenever you need me.

603
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:46,360
I will be off, then.

604
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,119
May I ask your name?

605
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,239
My goodness, this is...

606
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,559
Take this back.

607
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,519
We cannot accept this money.

608
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,920
Are you not in need of money?

609
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,880
As they say, money causes problems.

610
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,639
How can I accept money from someone who will not identify herself?

611
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,400
You act hastily for someone who has great work to do.

612
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:11,880
Have some patience.

613
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,239
Soon,

614
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:15,760
the master will ask to see you.

615
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,800
Move along.

616
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
You are back.

617
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,559
Good job. Head inside, then.

618
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,519
Do you have something to say?

619
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,599
No, my lord.

("The Secret Records of Samhan")

622
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,880
How about a drink to quench our thirst?

623
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,239
I have somewhere to be, so head on without me.

624
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Scholar Jung!

625
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,639
Goodness. What has him running?

626
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,559
I do not think I have ever seen him run before.

627
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:28,280
- Look how pretty it is. - It is the only one left.

628
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,039
She said it was the last one.

629
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:31,159
Then it is mine.

630
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,599
I had my eyes on this for quite some time.

631
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,518
Could you perhaps allow me to buy it?

632
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,959
Goodness. Are you not the scholar staying at Garden of Flowers?

633
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,920
What a shame.

634
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,159
How would you like to stay at Buyounggak instead?

635
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Here you go.

636
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:59,719
I would gladly let you buy them instead.

637
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
I highly appreciate it.

638
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,039
Young master,

639
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,678
could one ask for your name?

640
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:13,760
I wish you a good day.

641
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:19,360
What the...

642
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,760
- Unbelievable. - He just left.

643
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,119
I see there is a day where the cards do not favor you.

644
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
Let us play again.

645
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,280
We are here to enforce legal gambling.

646
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Hands above your heads!

647
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,440
Are you certain the watchman will come?

648
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,920
He will...

649
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,639
if it is Snowflake we have in custody.

650
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,119
Did something happen?

651
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,718
It is as if a tornado swept through here.

652
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,440
The Capital District Office was here on a raid...

653
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,599
which is a first.

654
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,760
The Capital District Office?

655
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,399
Did they arrest people?

656
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,118
They did, and it left us startled.

657
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,198
Were some of them young scholars?

658
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,558
Everyone here was arrested.

659
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,559
Why else would it be a ghost town in here?

660
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:28,320
I heard there was a raid at the tujeon den.

661
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,719
Was a young scholar arrested at Buyounggak?

662
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:34,360
A raid? That is news to me.

663
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,960
Could you ask around?

664
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,639
His name is San of the Kang family.

665
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,319
I heard he was dragged here.

666
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,719
And we said it was news to us.

667
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,800
Check with the Police Bureau instead.

668
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,880
We are busy here, so run along.

669
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,280
But she said it was the Capital District Office.

670
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Leave him be.

671
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,360
Who is he anyway?

672
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:15,840
Is he the long-lost deposed heir?

673
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Do not be curious.

674
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,599
We will just do as ordered.

675
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,360
Tell me your real name.

676
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:13,638
Who knows?

677
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:17,239
We might end up stumbling upon him.

678
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:19,679
The deposed heir Lee Seol.

679
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,239
Was it you all along?

680
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,960
You had us form FSG...

681
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,360
to keep your identity hidden.

he will die.

685

Do not put too much faith in Master Jang.

686
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,439
He is not one to keep your secrets.

687
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,440
Hold on.

688
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,558
Do you think I am Lee Seol?

689
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:26,959
Can you make time for me sometime?

690
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,039
I have something to tell you.

691
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:30,959
Who do you believe will be King?

692
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,400
Who will sit on the throne?

693
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,639
Do you not fear me?

694
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:35,999
You do not even know who I truly am.

695
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,280
I do know. I know you are the watchman.

696
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,880
So I ask...

697
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,519
that you stay unharmed.
