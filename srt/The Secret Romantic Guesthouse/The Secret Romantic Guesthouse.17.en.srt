(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,012
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,571
You are here for me, are you not?

9
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,412
Go ahead and arrest me!

10
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:03,571
Drop your sword first!

11
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,692
What are you waiting for? We must go.

12
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,332
- Return to the palace. - Yes, sir.

13
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,892
We must get the rest.

14
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:46,931
Among those that got away is the watchman.

15
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,651
We cannot delay. His Majesty awaits.

16
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,052
My lord.

17
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,532
We got Lee Seol.

18
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,851
We can go after the rest another time.

19
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,172
- Come along. - Yes, sir.

20
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:22,812
(Episode 17)

21
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,532
My goodness. Oh, dear.

22
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,972
Are you all right?

23
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:39,132
I was so worried something terrible would happen.

24
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,451
I am sorry.

25
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,092
I always make you worry.

26
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,011
Hong Ju looks shaken up.

27
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,132
My gosh.

28
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,972
Lay down the body in one of the rooms.

29
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,652
We must bury Hwa Ryung first.

30
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:33,972
I will get a coffin and grave site.

31
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,932
I will help with that.

32
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,571
Yu Ha was taken?

33
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,412
What on earth happened in the woods?

34
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,291
Master Jang got the Department of Justice involved.

35
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,771
If not for Yu Ha,

36
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:52,652
none of us would have gotten out safely.

37
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,092
I see.

38
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,851
What should we do now?

39
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,492
I will rescue him.

40
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,652
I should,

41
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,891
at any cost.

42
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,052
How despicable.

43
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,132
How little did you think of me...

44
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,571
that you deceived me?

45
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,492
My lady.

46
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,771
You should...

47
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,612
not have smiled and joked with me.

48
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,052
I had no idea you had killed my fiancé.

49
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,411
I laughed...

50
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,302
at your jokes.

51
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:29,252
You disgust me.

52
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:32,492
How many lives did you take...

53
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,891
with the hands that once held mine?

54
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,172
I apologize.

55
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,411
None of my words will be enough...

56
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,492
to wash away your broken heart...

57
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,852
Why must only the innocent lose their lives?

58
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,771
When others deserve to die?

59
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,451
(Pyeong)

60
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,331
What is this?

61
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,011
We found it while searching Garden of Flowers.

62
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,692
I see my nephew has grown up.

63
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,211
I see why I did not recognize you.

64
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:01,451
That is because you do not have a good eye.

65
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,372
How shall I kill you?

66
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,011
The thought excites me already.

67
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,451
Enjoy it while you can.

68
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,531
All good things do not last,

69
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,011
and neither will your reign.

70
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:26,052
Blabber all you want.

71
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:30,411
But know that your voice will never be heard.

72
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,531
I will pluck your flesh from your bone bit by bit...

73
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,172
until not even the soul is left.

74
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:44,132
My poor brother...

75
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:48,531
will not see his son's face even in the afterlife.

76
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:09,451
Why is the interrogation lasting so long?

77
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,091
Is the heir to the throne being tortured?

78
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:44,252
Lord Sin, you were here?

79
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,972
Your Highness.

80
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:54,462
I cannot stand the grief and disappointment.

81
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,291
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

82
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,531
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

83
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:04,691
My gosh.

84
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,462
What on earth happened?

85
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,011
Do not worry.

86
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:17,462
Kang San is safe and well.

87
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:20,732
You mean to say...

88
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,691
I bought him time. Now we wait.

89
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,011
Accept a drink.

90
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,092
You played a great role in Lee Seol's capture.

91
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:43,011
I will have you promoted soon.

92
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:45,092
I am honoured, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,691
So...

94
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,732
how did you know...

95
00:09:58,252 --> 00:09:59,691
Jung Yu Ha is the deposed heir?

96
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:02,011
The chief eunuch confessed.

97
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,171
Who the deposed heir is.

98
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,222
Then...

99
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,372
all that is left is to execute him.

100
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,092
Poison is too light a sentence...

101
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,222
and decapitation too simple.

102
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:24,411
I cannot gift my only nephew such a boring death.

103
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,011
Do you have...

104
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:29,092
an idea in mind?

105
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,651
I heard you told His Majesty who the deposed heir is.

106
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,771
Were you always aware?

107
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,462
Do not be too offended.

108
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:58,651
Were you not...

109
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,011
promised a promotion?

110
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,572
Is His Majesty aware that...

111
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,212
the Lee Seol you found...

112
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,011
is a fake?

113
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:11,891
He is a fake?

114
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:17,852
What nonsense is that?

115
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:23,572
Can I inform His Majesty this nonsense?

116
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:30,531
That Kang San...

117
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,291
is the Lee Seol he is looking for?

118
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:41,252
What is it you want?

119
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,452
Tell me.

120
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,411
I wish to know only one thing.

121
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,411
The watchman.

122
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:54,691
Where he is.

123
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:59,092
I truly do not know where the watchman is.

124
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,411
You are testing my patience.

125
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:03,852
I do not know his location,

126
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:07,492
but I do know the temple that trains the watchmen.

127
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:10,612
But...

128
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,732
how did you know that...

129
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:17,332
Jung Yu Ha is an impostor?

130
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:23,891
The watchman never leaves his master to escape.

131
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,612
That is impossible.

132
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,931
Where are you going this late at night?

133
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,732
To see the first vice-premier.

134
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,572
Do you think he would be safe and sound?

135
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:43,092
Once the day dawns, check the situation...

136
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,972
No one knows when he will be executed.

137
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,092
This is the moment the king has been waiting for.

138
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,531
- Your Highness. - I cannot...

139
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,011
let Yu Ha suffer in my place.

140
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,531
I could not forgive myself for it.

141
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:08,651
However hurried you may be,

142
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,092
you should not forget your sword.

143
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:15,691
Go ahead.

144
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,051
I will wait for your return.

145
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:20,572
Okay.

146
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:22,372
I will not be long.

147
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,011
Will you stand there all night?

148
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:49,771
I thought it best...

149
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,531
that I stay away.

150
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,931
It would make me a hypocrite...

151
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,252
to say I understand how you feel.

152
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:02,972
Are you going somewhere?

153
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,691
I will come with you.

154
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,852
You do not have to.

155
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:09,852
I am sorry I was not able to...

156
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,972
release you sooner.

157
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,811
Your Highness.

158
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,092
You can follow your heart now.

159
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,891
Choose to stay...

160
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:22,372
or to leave.

161
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,691
If I were to fail to protect you too,

162
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,651
would my life be of any worth?

163
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,612
You can save Yu Ha.

164
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,252
I must protect you as you do so.

165
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:53,931
Tonight, you should stay here.

166
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,651
Assistant Magistrate Jang might return,

167
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:00,691
and knowing you are here...

168
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:04,092
will put me at ease.

169
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:09,452
Stay safe.

170
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,891
I waited for you here...

171
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:53,891
in case you came.

172
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,171
Garden of Flowers was empty.

173
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:04,132
Where is Lord Sin?

174
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:05,931
He is in prison.

175
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,531
I heard...

176
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,011
Lee Seol was captured.

177
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,252
The longer we take, the worse our chances become.

178
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,972
We must raise men to attack the palace soon.

179
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:18,771
I was told...

180
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,332
Lord Sin had things arranged.

181
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:23,132
The head of the Military Training Command...

182
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,931
agreed to join the coup.

183
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,612
But a lot has happened since.

184
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,332
Arrange a meeting.

185
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,212
I will persuade him.

186
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:36,092
Very well.

187
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:45,732
- Master! - Master!

188
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,171
Who are you?

189
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,572
Where is the deposed heir's watchman?

190
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,852
"Watchman?"

191
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,572
I have no idea what you are talking about.

192
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:17,971
Tell me...

193
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,691
before I kill everyone.

194
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,022
How can the answer change...

195
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,542
if the question remains the same?

196
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,251
No.

197
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:03,971
This place is not safe either.

198
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,022
- If they find you... - So what?

199
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,171
I should save my skin?

200
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,332
When Yu Ha could be executed at any time...

201
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,302
and everyone's life hangs in the balance?

202
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,372
You have others to care of.

203
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,092
In order to keep them safe, you must leave Hanyang.

204
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:20,931
You are family to me too.

205
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:23,931
I cannot do that.

206
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,731
Dan O, please.

207
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,852
I will not be a nuisance,

208
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,022
so please...

209
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,691
do not tell me to leave.

210
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:46,971
I will crumble.

211
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:53,852
If I were...

212
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,891
to lose you too.

213
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:02,332
- San. - I barely clung on until now.

214
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,731
I will not be able to take another step.

215
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,211
I can...

216
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,891
protect myself.

217
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,211
I did so far,

218
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,332
and I will keep doing so.

219
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:16,782
I know that.

220
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,451
You are stronger than anyone.

221
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,092
Whatever crisis you face, you will get through it.

222
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,251
Yes.

223
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:28,971
So trust me and...

224
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:29,971
But Dan O.

225
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:33,302
Even people like that...

226
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,022
break and disappear without a trace.

227
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,691
That...

228
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,411
is what a coup is like.

229
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,731
They have captured His Highness.

230
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,931
I need your help to rescue His Highness.

231
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,971
Even if I gather those who are sick of the King's tyranny,

232
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,411
it will be difficult for us to get past the palace walls.

233
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,092
I used to be in the Palace Guards,

234
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,132
so I know their system very well.

235
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,052
I will help, so...

236
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,931
If they seal the palace gates and fight back,

237
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:57,731
the King will buy time to get the Five Military Camps involved.

238
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,612
What if someone on the inside lets us in?

239
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:04,651
Do you think we could win?

240
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:08,542
If that is possible, we should be able...

241
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,891
to take down the King's bodyguards and make him surrender.

242
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:11,891
(Geumgun: Royal bodyguards)

243
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:21,171
Perhaps, you should tell them that you are the deposed heir.

244
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:24,211
I do not think I deserve the title.

245
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,931
After all, Yu Ha is the one...

246
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:30,782
who is putting his life on the line to bear the weight of the title.

247
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,171
Your Highness.

248
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,302
The head of the Military Training Command...

249
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:38,542
will mobilize his army to protect the deposed heir.

250
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,132
Their determination to fight will save Yu Ha.

251
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:45,971
So for now,

252
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,171
Yu Ha should remain Lee Seol.

253
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,812
Because of them, our customers will not want to drink.

254
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,891
Why are they all here?

255
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:02,532
They are soldiers from the Capital District Office, right?

256
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,532
Why is Madame not here today?

257
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,012
I wonder if something happened.

258
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,372
I saw them going through Madame's room earlier.

259
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:19,092
Did Master Jang not say anything to you?

260
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:24,852
Ban Ya.

261
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,292
Someone is here to see you.

262
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,532
Come out for a moment.

263
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:31,411
Me?

264
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:34,931
Who could it be?

265
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,572
(Buyounggak)

266
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:49,211
- What? - Just follow me.

267
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,211
You are alive.

268
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:02,691
I was so worried when I saw...

269
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,891
that everyone at Garden of Flowers was gone.

270
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,332
You were at Garden of Flowers?

271
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:09,372
Yes. I went there to check because I was worried.

272
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,971
I heard the deposed heir had been captured.

273
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:15,251
Does that mean...

274
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,812
Come with me. I will tell you on the way.

275
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,411
On the way? Where?

276
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:22,651
The truth is...

277
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,332
Madame is...

278
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,372
I am glad you are here.

279
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:44,852
I was hoping someone from Buyounggak would be here.

280
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:47,891
I cannot believe this.

281
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,491
Pour her a drink first.

282
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,012
I will...

283
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,532
put my everything on the line to save Yu Ha.

284
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:55,491
So please...

285
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,092
rest in peace.

286
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,092
A banquet, did you say?

287
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,372
Yes. The civil service examination will take place at the palace.

288
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:19,572
Those who pass the exam...

289
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:21,691
will be invited to a grand banquet.

290
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:26,092
Many of the kisaengs at Buyounggak will be invited too.

291
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,612
They are hosting a banquet?

292
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:32,731
But it is strange.

293
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:35,852
I thought the state exams would be postponed.

294
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:38,891
Perhaps...

295
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,612
that is the day...

296
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:44,691
Yu Ha would be executed.

297
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,372
What brings you here?

298
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:13,971
I saw the signal kite.

299
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:15,292
The signal kite?

300
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:19,532
Something happened at the temple?

301
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,372
Venerable Sir.

302
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:44,411
It was Assistant Magistrate Jang.

303
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,132
The children are gone.

304
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:54,092
He took them to the Capital District Office.

305
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:58,731
He said if you did not show up,

306
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,171
the children would be...

307
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,372
Please take him inside.

308
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:22,211
Will you go to the Capital District Office?

309
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:24,532
I cannot let that scoundrel kill the children.

310
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:30,572
You must not forget your duty as the watchman.

311
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:31,612
Master!

312
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,491
If the watchman risks his life in this manner,

313
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:35,731
who will protect our king?

314
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,211
They are young children.

315
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,691
They did nothing wrong.

316
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:03,132
(Capital District Office)

317
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:11,132
Who is it?

318
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:19,052
You did not see his face?

319
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:21,092
No, he was already gone.

320
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:30,812
I will go to the Capital District Office.

321
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:33,772
Just give me three days.

322
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,211
Pack light.

323
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:43,931
We will find most things we need at my brother's house.

324
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:45,651
Gosh.

325
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:48,971
We should not show up empty-handed and inconvenience him.

326
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,572
As for the upcoming state exam...

327
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,372
You will not be able to take it, right?

328
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,171
The family's safety is my top priority now.

329
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:06,132
I was very surprised when you passed the exam.

330
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:11,211
I suppose you are not destined to pass the state exam.

331
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,012
You never sugarcoat anything, Ms. Naju.

332
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:16,092
- You are very honest. - Oh, dear.

333
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,812
My ladies. You are ready, right?

334
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:47,812
Wait for me.

335
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,812
- When I finish my job... - I know.

336
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,612
You will not be too long.

337
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,891
And about Si Yeol...

338
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:02,171
Oh, about that...

339
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,132
He and my sister should talk it out amongst themselves.

340
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,451
I should not step in.

341
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:10,332
I am not saying you should.

342
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:12,931
Your sister must be heartbroken too.

343
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:14,812
Do your best to comfort her.

344
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,812
I bet she resents him and is feeling deeply betrayed.

345
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,451
Although...

346
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:24,971
Si Yeol must be devastated too.

347
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:28,171
Do not resent Si Yeol too much.

348
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:31,891
At least you should not resent him.

349
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:35,931
It all started with me.

350
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:41,292
It is my fault that Si Yeol is in such a rut...

351
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:45,651
and that Yu Ha got caught. It is all my fault.

352
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:46,812
No.

353
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,052
It all happened...

354
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:52,251
because of the tyrant king who stole the throne.

355
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,411
Do not...

356
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,132
ever forget that, San.

357
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:40,132
Do not look back.

358
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,651
Let us get going.

359
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:53,532
I am sorry, Ms. Naju.

360
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,332
I truly...

361
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,211
cannot leave like this.

362
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,612
Do not say that.

363
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,012
I cannot let you throw yourself into such danger too.

364
00:32:05,012 --> 00:32:06,292
Over my dead body!

365
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:08,491
Knowing they are in such a precarious situation,

366
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:09,971
I must do something.

367
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:11,931
Lady Dan O, please.

368
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:13,891
Go.

369
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:17,532
I will take good care of Ms. Naju and Hong Ju.

370
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,971
Do not do this!

371
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,931
You need to help me dissuade her.

372
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:24,092
It is not like she will listen to us.

373
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:28,372
She has already made up her mind.

374
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,012
Must you go?

375
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:37,532
Yes.

376
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:42,812
I am sorry, Hong Ju.

377
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:30,211
So you are alive.

378
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,691
I thought you dropped dead somewhere.

379
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:35,931
Thankfully, I am not dead.

380
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,171
I was right.

381
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:45,772
The banquet is where...

382
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:47,931
the execution will take place.

383
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,532
He wishes to execute the deposed heir in front of everyone...

384
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:52,612
as a deterrent measure.

385
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,251
I will...

386
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,852
save His Highness no matter what.

387
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,332
When I first set my mind to do this,

388
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,411
the first person that came to my mind...

389
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,461
was you.

390
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,461
Me?

391
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:16,092
The King has crossed the line.

392
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,331
After killing the deposed heir, he will go on to hurt countless people.

393
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:24,251
If you are hesitant,

394
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,291
you may leave.

395
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:28,371
I will not blame you.

396
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,572
Do you trust me that much?

397
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:32,851
What if...

398
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:35,211
I report you to the Palace Guards?

399
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:42,052
Trying to gain something without giving up something in return...

400
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:43,651
is just greed.

401
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:49,092
Perhaps, we were already on the same path.

402
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,291
To tell you the truth,

403
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:54,691
I thought the tyrant got what he deserved...

404
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,811
when you shot him with an arrow.

405
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:12,811
On the day of the banquet,

406
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,851
we will go to the palace.

407
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:21,532
We must stop the banquet to save His Highness.

408
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,211
However, the King will not cancel the banquet...

409
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:26,612
just because he hears of some traitors.

410
00:35:26,612 --> 00:35:27,612
Gosh.

411
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,771
Can we truly pull this off? It is just the five of us.

412
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,771
If everything goes according to the plan,

413
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,972
it will stir up the King too.

414
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:42,012
During all those years when the deposed heir was on the loose,

415
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:45,331
the King was haunted by the fear...

416
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:49,092
of losing the throne.

417
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:51,651
Listen.

418
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,851
Even if we manage to enter the palace and deceive the King,

419
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:58,132
he will quickly realize he has been deceived.

420
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,171
We just need to hold out until sunset.

421
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:02,492
Then the head of the Military Training Command...

422
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,941
will arrive with his soldiers.

423
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:08,771
But...

424
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,771
did you not say someone on the inside would let them in?

425
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:15,421
We will go to the Queen Dowager and get her appointment notice.

426
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,012
With that,

427
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:20,492
we can make the guards at the gates surrender.

428
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,691
Gosh. We cannot enter the Queen Dowager's residence.

429
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,532
Well...

430
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,371
I suppose we could ask the court maids to deliver our letter to her.

431
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,811
You have been quiet, immersed in thought.

432
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:40,371
I think someone is outside.

433
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:00,251
What are you doing here?

434
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:02,612
I told you to leave.

435
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,691
I just could not take my feet off the ground,

436
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:19,012
so I could not force myself to leave.

437
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:20,012
Dan O.

438
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,492
How about I go there and pick up the notice?

439
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,901
Nonsense.

440
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,092
Let me escort you. Get ready to leave.

441
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,851
Why is it nonsense?

442
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,691
I am the only one here who can actually look like a court maid.

443
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:43,092
Well, she should be able to enter the Queen Dowager's residence.

444
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,371
Let us entrust Dan O with the job.

445
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,291
We do not have much time.

446
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,651
You know...

447
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,941
that Dan O has been inside the palace.

448
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:53,211
What if someone recognizes her?

449
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:56,532
All will be fine if I manage not to run into the King.

450
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,771
You see, on the day of the banquet...

451
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:23,052
As soon as the job is done,

452
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,731
I plan to leave right away.

453
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:31,691
You will leave?

454
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:37,691
Even if I leave without saying goodbye,

455
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:40,941
please understand.

456
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:00,651
Gyeom.

457
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:03,371
My son.

458
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:06,251
Find...

459
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:09,291
happiness.

460
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:14,492
I am sorry,

461
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:16,572
Mother.

462
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:31,532
The banquet is just around the corner.

463
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:37,691
There is no way for us to find out what is going on.

464
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:40,291
Even if things go wrong,

465
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,771
I will die as Lee Seol.

466
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:47,461
It is the price I have to pay for living as Lee Seol.

467
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:49,572
Your Highness.

468
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,771
You must stay strong.

469
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,331
I may die, but my brother lives.

470
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:04,901
And he will bring down His Majesty.

471
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:57,461
What are you hoping to achieve at the palace?

472
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,461
I am not complaining since it gained me an ornament, but still.

473
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,461
A banquet will take place.

474
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,092
Imagine how splendid and beautiful it will be.

475
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:11,052
I take it you are adamant about attending it.

476
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,572
Your Majesty!

477
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:26,972
The honours banquet will soon take place,

478
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:28,461
and I would love for you...

479
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,651
to grace us with your presence.

480
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:34,492
It will truly be grand.

481
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:37,461
No... Not Seol...

482
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,851
You should witness the body of your beloved grandson...

483
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:43,012
be vainly torn to pieces.

484
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:48,901
What will you do to him?

485
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:51,532
Attend the banquet, and see for yourself.

486
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:41,572
I have already sent word, so head to Queen Dowager right away.

487
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,092
Of course. You have said it many times.

488
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:46,691
Please do not fret.

489
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,771
I share your sentiment.

490
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:53,972
If I lose you,

491
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,012
I will not be able to take another step forward.

492
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,251
So from this moment on,

493
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:04,291
you will put yourself first.

494
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,052
That Gu Nam or whoever he is should be here by now.

495
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,731
Maybe we should wait some more.

496
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,371
The banquet will begin soon.

497
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,532
Falling behind on schedule could endanger Yu Ha.

498
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:30,691
Enter.

499
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:34,691
Goodness.

500
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,811
We are the troupe from Namsan Village...

501
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,532
and are here per His Majesty's order.

502
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,851
Hold on. You look oddly familiar.

503
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:53,691
I highly doubt we crossed paths when I am of lowly origin.

504
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:55,052
No.

505
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:57,811
I definitely recognize you.

506
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,211
Allow them to enter.

507
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,771
What brings a palace guard out here?

508
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,211
If they are the reason the banquet is delayed,

509
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:23,771
His Majesty will breathe fire.

510
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,452
Enter, then.

511
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:29,851
Sure.

512
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:32,771
Go on.

513
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,651
(Capital District Office)

514
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:44,371
Do not let your guard down, not even for a second.

515
00:44:44,572 --> 00:44:45,691
- Yes, Master Jang! - Yes, Master Jang!

516
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:54,811
What does this concern?

517
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,132
The deposed heir...

518
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:02,851
will be executed during the honours banquet?

519
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:04,651
Yes, Master Jang.

520
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:07,291
Come and rescue me.

521
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:09,291
I will be waiting.

522
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:12,612
How is that?

523
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:18,092
That was it.

524
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:21,171
That was why you asked for three days.

525
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:58,452
Let us move out.

526
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:22,092
It is the sword you had me keep safe.

527
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:48,012
Are you Innkeeper Yoon from Garden of Flowers?

528
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:50,851
Yes, are you one of Queen Dowager's court ladies?

529
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:53,251
This way, please.

530
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,651
Stay hidden in here...

531
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,492
and leave as the banquet comes to an end.

532
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,211
Yes, Your Highness.

533
00:47:31,612 --> 00:47:34,731
There is one more thing Seol requested.

534
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:47,331
He said you were to protect yourself.

535
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,012
Are you skilled in archery?

536
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,092
Yes, His Highness taught me himself.

537
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:57,892
- Your Highness, you cannot. - Your Highness, you cannot do this.

538
00:47:59,731 --> 00:48:03,211
Royal Consort Park, you cannot barge in like this.

539
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,532
What is the meaning of this?

540
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:12,251
His Majesty asked that I escort you myself.

541
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,371
Shall we?

542
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:29,412
Goodness, I am experiencing vertigo.

543
00:48:30,132 --> 00:48:32,132
Help me walk, will you?

544
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:26,851
Are you that entertained by their dancing?

545
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:29,251
Does it not lift your spirits?

546
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,052
But the grand finale...

547
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:37,012
will be crimson in colour and even more splendid.

548
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:47,612
That is right.

549
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,811
Assistant Magistrate Jang has requested an audience.

550
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:55,932
Master Jang?

551
00:49:56,132 --> 00:49:57,932
Yes, he says that time is of the essence.

552
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:02,932
Please inform His Majesty...

553
00:50:03,572 --> 00:50:06,371
that those loyal to the deposed heir might have infiltrated the palace.

554
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,612
How sure are you?

555
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:13,452
My lord, we are having trouble...

556
00:50:13,452 --> 00:50:15,492
locating a few of the palace guards that are on patrol.

557
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:18,171
This could be their doing.

558
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,291
Locate them while I inform His Majesty.

559
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:23,932
My men will be at your disposal.

560
00:50:24,572 --> 00:50:25,572
Of course, my lord.

561
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:17,492
Your Majesty.

562
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:20,572
Lee Seol's men have infiltrated the palace.

563
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:22,371
I am sure they can be captured.

564
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,811
In fact, they could join him out there.

565
00:51:28,012 --> 00:51:29,171
Maybe you should end the banquet...

566
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:30,972
while we handle the situation.

567
00:51:30,972 --> 00:51:32,371
That is all you will say.

568
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,171
I am just about to have some fun.

569
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:45,092
How can it not bring joy to the royal family...

570
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:46,851
when the traitor who has been eluding authorities for decades...

571
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:49,331
has been caught?

572
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:53,092
It is why I will execute deposed heir Lee Seol...

573
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,892
as the banquet's grand finale.

574
00:51:58,092 --> 00:51:59,092
Execute him!

575
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:00,331
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:52:21,092 --> 00:52:22,092
This cannot be.

577
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:25,731
Has he ordered a dismemberment within palace walls?

578
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:27,371
What madness is this?

579
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:28,691
He is the Crown Prince's son.

580
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:30,251
(Geoyeolhyeong: A punishment where one's limbs were torn off)

581
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:31,331
You wait and see.

582
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:35,851
My fresh blood will remain...

583
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:38,651
and continue to smother you.

584
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,452
The officials and people of this nation...

585
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:47,211
are strong enough to stand up to fear.

586
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:51,731
What are you waiting for?

587
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:55,052
Tear off his limbs this instant!

588
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,052
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

589
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:32,171
The watchman.

590
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,052
So here is where we meet.

591
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:37,251
Keep moving.

592
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:40,012
Leave them to me.

593
00:53:40,691 --> 00:53:41,691
Are you sure?

594
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:45,052
There is no time.

595
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:48,211
Now, go.

596
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,371
The children.

597
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:41,851
Are they alive?

598
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:45,771
Who knew...

599
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:48,211
you had compassion?

600
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:54,251
I will take your life at all costs...

601
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,171
and appease the soul of my late son.

602
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:15,092
This...

603
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:20,412
This is what you will remember.

604
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:28,092
This side of you...

605
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:31,691
is who you...

606
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,691
truly are.

607
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:45,412
Watchman,

608
00:57:48,771 --> 00:57:50,211
you are nothing...

609
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,851
but a bloodthirsty ghoul...

610
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:59,092
who will always be hungry for the next kill.

611
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:03,892
You disgust me.

612
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:07,731
How many lives did you take...

613
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:12,412
with the hands that once held mine?

614
00:58:24,412 --> 00:58:25,412
I knew...

615
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,691
I would die at your hands,

616
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:34,492
but I still had to find you.

617
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:41,972
That was...

618
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,771
the commitment of a father...

619
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:51,092
who had lost his son.

620
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:22,532
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

621
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,932
Even if I do leave, I will only do so after he is dead.

622
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:43,932
Answer me this instant!

623
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:45,412
What are you plotting?

624
00:59:45,412 --> 00:59:46,932
I am here to take my rightful place.

625
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:49,052
I am Lee Seol.

626
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,892
Find Lee Seol and tell him this.

627
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:54,691
That I will wait for him at his execution site.

628
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,651
For as long as I live, I will resent and loathe you.

629
00:59:58,651 --> 01:00:00,972
A new king has been crowned, so accept his order.

630
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,371
Surrender willingly, and you will keep your life.

631
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:05,291
This nation is mine.

632
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:08,532
It is my Joseon that I secured with my bloodied hands!
