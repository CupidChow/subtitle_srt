00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,033
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,074
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:58,154 --> 00:00:59,194
Go!

9
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,473
Lee Seol, the deposed heir, has escaped!

10
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:06,113
(Deposed heir: Crown Prince's eldest son that was deposed)

11
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,883
Do not just stand there! We must execute him before dawn.

12
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:11,712
That will conclude our great mission!

13
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:12,754
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

14
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:14,273
Giddy-up!

15
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:17,883
Giddy-up!

16
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,913
(In mourning)

17
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,993
Who are you?

18
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:51,953
Are you asking for my name?

19
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,234
Of course.

20
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,793
You sneaked into a house of mourning.

21
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,474
You are the first person...

22
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:02,793
to ask for my name.

23
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:06,034
You do not want to tell me, do you?

24
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:10,553
Were you hurt?

25
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,194
Can you come out?

26
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:25,793
Bok Sil.

27
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,113
Take your time.

28
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:33,353
There is a lot more.

29
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,353
Did a little boy on the run come here to hide?

30
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:56,793
I did not see him.

31
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,154
Do not come closer.

32
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,512
Our dog Bok Sil is fierce,

33
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,874
and she even bites people when she is eating.

34
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,393
It is true.

35
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,274
It is not my fault if you get bitten.

36
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:48,913
They left.

37
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,353
Why did you save me?

38
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,474
You do not even know my name.

39
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:12,073
You are...

40
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:14,594
the first visitor.

41
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,073
I am glad...

42
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,393
at least one person came by.

43
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,473
To see my father.

44
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:36,473
Did you...

45
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,833
lose someone too?

46
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,754
Yes.

47
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:43,953
Your father?

48
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,754
Or your mother?

49
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,314
Both.

50
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,924
I have no one now.

51
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:35,914
If we meet again,

52
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:39,153
I will tell you then.

53
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:41,754
Tell me what?

54
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,114
My name.

55
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:06,234
(13 years later)

56
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:08,753
Five nyang.

57
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,674
(Episode 1)

58
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,314
It is a nice and cool day.

59
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,633
- Did you hear that story? - About what?

60
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:21,234
About the haunted inn.

61
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,434
A haunted inn?

62
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,433
A handsome young nobleman from the Yeongnam area...

63
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,513
stayed there and got possessed.

64
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,994
Before he could take the state exam...

65
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:33,114
He died?

66
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,513
The lonely girl ghost...

67
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,153
took him as her companion to the afterlife.

68
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,713
Darn you.

69
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,073
Welcome.

70
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:45,674
Five nyang.

71
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,513
Five nyang.

72
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,314
Where are you headed?

73
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:57,033
You could reach the afterlife before you reach the exam hall.

74
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:03,633
This is Namtaeryeong Pass, famous for its tigers.

75
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,354
Go alone...

76
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,794
and you will never make it.

77
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:14,994
Five nyang, please.

78
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,633
This is daylight robbery.

79
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,554
They charge us five nyang just to cross a pass?

80
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,393
Are you going to Jungcheon?

81
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,354
You and I should both be careful.

82
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:44,674
The ghosts tend to prefer handsome young men.

83
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,914
- What was that? - My gosh.

84
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,434
We are district guards!

85
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,873
Make way, or we will fire!

86
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,032
(District guards: Served the local governor)

87
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,434
He is the tiger I told you about.

88
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,994
If you hand over all your belongings,

89
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,712
I will let you pass.

90
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:07,234
Just hand it over.

91
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,354
We got one!

92
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,633
We will lose everything.

93
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,433
- Oh, dear! - My gosh.

94
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,914
Get me down.

95
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:40,752
Get him! Do something!

96
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,644
- Get him! - You get him!

97
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:05,674
Hey!

98
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:27,404
Boss!

99
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,154
You. Get lost.

100
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,434
Bong Sik!

101
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:34,794
Hurry.

102
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,072
- Get up. - Move it!

103
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,314
Come along.

104
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,314
Darn it!

105
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,753
Oh, gosh.

106
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:54,113
If only I had not walked into the trap...

107
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:00,644
Hand it out.

108
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:05,154
- Wait. - Thank you.

109
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,644
Thank you.

110
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,794
Gather round.

111
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,644
Hello, welcome.

112
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:24,913
Come to Garden of Flowers if you wish to pass the state exam.

113
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:28,713
Calling all young men to Garden of Flowers.

114
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:31,644
Oh, hello, young noblemen.

115
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,833
Garden of Flowers guarantees a pass.

116
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,914
Come and stay at Garden of Flowers.

117
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,523
- "Garden of Flowers?" - Yes.

118
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,034
(Five scholars in a row passed)

119
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,523
Five successful scholars in a row is huge.

120
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,753
You and your lies.

121
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,034
Have you not heard the story?

122
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,914
The haunted house at the edge of Jungcheon.

123
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:56,153
Oh, this house?

124
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,154
Yes!

125
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,872
We must compete fair and square. Fair play!

126
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:02,592
We are all on our own.

127
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:03,674
Fair play, my foot.

128
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:09,833
Do not get the wrong idea.

129
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:12,634
All patrons who stays at Garden of Flowers passes the state exam.

130
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:15,433
We only host a select few, whom we provide with room and board.

131
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,913
Everything is customized to your needs.

132
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,154
It sounds like a waste of time and energy.

133
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:25,914
Goodness.

134
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,073
Wait!

135
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:35,434
My lady.

136
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,753
Why would you struggle like this?

137
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,514
Marry me, and you will live a comfortable life.

138
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,993
What is this barking dog saying?

139
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,593
How much would you like? Tell me.

140
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:49,794
How much would be enough...

141
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,274
for you to take me as your husband?

142
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,233
My goodness.

143
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,274
My lady.

144
00:11:58,914 --> 00:11:59,914
My lady.

145
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,752
- Oh, my. Welcome. - Good to see you.

146
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,433
Make way. Coming through!

147
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,992
- Come this way. - Come and have a look!

148
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,793
- Oh, hold on. - You are here.

149
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,314
- What is it? - Come and have a look!

150
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:15,873
Young Master.

151
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,233
It is almost high noon.

152
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:19,953
Are you not going home?

153
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,394
You look so pretty even in the morning.

154
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,674
You look like a beautiful peony.

155
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,833
Oh, please.

156
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:34,753
I shall see you again soon.

157
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,153
Pay for your drinks before you leave.

158
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,233
Oh, my apologies.

159
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:58,073
I left home in such a rush.

160
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,394
Put it on my tab, please.

161
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,833
Settle up if you wish to go home in one piece.

162
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,314
Cut me some slack, will you?

163
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,593
Hey, you.

164
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,194
Hey.

165
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,514
Must you be so difficult?

166
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:37,793
My lady, how many times must I ask you out...

167
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:39,072
Stop trying.

168
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:41,713
I will never fall for you, no matter how hard you try.

169
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:43,713
I did not want to lay a finger on you...

170
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:45,553
before we got married.

171
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,514
I cannot stand...

172
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,194
your obnoxious nonsense.

173
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:55,993
You will not even look at me,

174
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:57,634
so I have no choice.

175
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:04,154
My gosh!

176
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,472
Hold my hand while you still can.

177
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,554
You will not find a better man.

178
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:15,394
Are you out of your mind?

179
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,514
I do hear that from time to time.

180
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:19,992
However, I am not crazy.

181
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:20,993
You little...

182
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,473
Look at you.

183
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,794
You dodged my punch?

184
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,434
You rat!

185
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:33,993
Hey.

186
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,914
You are dead meat.

187
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,593
- No! - My gosh!

188
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,394
- Sir! - Sir!

189
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:59,233
I thought he was a beast. I nearly beat him to a pulp.

190
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,233
I understand.

191
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:08,034
Do you not think they look like three pig brothers?

192
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:13,953
Fine. Let us put an end to this once and for all.

193
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,353
We will show you how vicious pigs can be.

194
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,713
Fine. Let us settle this matter once and for all.

195
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:24,953
Go!

196
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,313
- Come on. - Hey!

197
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,154
- Get them! Go! - Hey!

198
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:32,072
- Get them! - Those rats!

199
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,712
- Catch them! - Hey!

200
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:36,193
Hey, stop right there! Get them!

201
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,913
- Catch them! - Hey!

202
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,233
- Hey, move! - Come on, hurry!

203
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,113
Do not look at me like that.

204
00:15:57,713 --> 00:15:59,394
I am fine. This was all...

205
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,873
part of my strategy to save you.

206
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,753
Does your strategy include how I saved you too?

207
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,554
I expected that too.

208
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:10,634
Do you not have to see a physician?

209
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,473
I did not even feel the punch.

210
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:14,953
The throbbing will go away in no time.

211
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,073
Are you hurt?

212
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:33,314
No, I am okay.

213
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,993
Oh, I suppose someone reported them.

214
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,073
You should have come sooner.

215
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,434
They are gone. They all went that way.

216
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,154
You drank at the kisaeng house, did you not?

217
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,073
Yes, I did.

218
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,274
No!

219
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:56,433
He did not do anything. He saved me.

220
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,073
Someone reported him for dining and dashing.

221
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,353
What?

222
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:05,394
I am fine! There must have been some misunderstanding.

223
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,513
Get home safely, my lady. Get going!

224
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:13,993
Hello.

225
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:15,993
Hello. You can sit over here.

226
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,033
Big fish spotted.

227
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,713
He could have held me.

228
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:52,674
Preparing for the military exam?

229
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,154
Are you a leech?

230
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:58,634
Have you decided where to stay?

231
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,953
Excuse me. I would like a bowl of gukbap.

232
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,313
Sure.

233
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,113
If you have not decided yet...

234
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,272
A bowl of rice wine too.

235
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,273
Sure.

236
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,604
Let me take you to my house.

237
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:16,513
Tonight.

238
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,154
You have no shame.

239
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:22,313
Are all women in Hanyang like this?

240
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,312
You seem like a man of noble birth.

241
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,513
If you stayed at this shabby tavern,

242
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:30,313
would you not be uncomfortable?

243
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:35,154
Wait, where are you going?

244
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,634
Are you going to the outhouse?

245
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:38,753
Come on in.

246
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:21,434
"When a crow caws on the pine tree at the Jongmyo Shrine..."

247
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,312
"and when the rain brings black clouds..."

248
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:25,844
(When the rain brings black clouds)

249
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,673
"A new dynasty begins."

250
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:33,154
(A new dynasty begins.)

251
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:39,434
You are back.

252
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:40,953
Oh.

253
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:42,713
Yu Ha.

254
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:46,713
Our eyes met earlier, did they not?

255
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:50,633
Yu Ha, could you not read what my eyes were telling you?

256
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,913
What were your eyes trying to tell me, Dan O?

257
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:54,153
"Do not bother a dog when he is eating..."

258
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,154
"or a scholar when he is reading."

259
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:58,084
With my eyes full of conviction.

260
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,084
What? A dog?

261
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,753
No. My point was, "a scholar who is reading."

262
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,753
Anyway, what were you reading?

263
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,434
"The Analects."

264
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:11,273
Where did you have to go so early in the morning?

265
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,913
I was feeling a little cooped up,

266
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,154
so I went out for a walk.

267
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,114
A walk?

268
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,154
Dan O.

269
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:23,433
You see, I do not want you to struggle...

270
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:24,953
- Yu Ha. - Yes?

271
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:26,364
You see,

272
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,753
I am truly curious what that book is about,

273
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,434
but I never ask you stuff like that.

274
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,634
So let us respect each other's boundaries.

275
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,154
All right.

276
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:40,273
I understand everything.

277
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,993
I mean, you are an adult too.

278
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,113
Hold on. What do you understand?

279
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,434
Well...

280
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:52,084
Men's...

281
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,674
curiosity?

282
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:56,753
Hey.

283
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,084
Dan O, let me explain before you go.

284
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:03,033
Dan O!

285
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:14,993
Excuse me. Did you see my bag? It was over there.

286
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:17,313
Oh, what happened was...

287
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:21,113
(Garden of Flowers)

288
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,153
There is an inn called Garden of Flowers.

289
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:26,084
The owner took your bag, saying you should stay at her inn.

290
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:40,194
Hello?

291
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:42,993
Is no one here?

292
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,992
It was you. You are the thief.

293
00:22:01,993 --> 00:22:02,993
What...

294
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,674
Are women in Hanyang always this forward?

295
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,233
Sorry?

296
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:37,313
Taking my belongings will not bind me as your mate.

297
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:39,434
That only happens in folk tales.

298
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,233
Your mate? As in what kind?

299
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:45,113
Classmate? Teammate?

300
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,313
Cut the jokes...

301
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:48,273
and hand over my bag.

302
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,513
Hold on.

303
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,513
So you are the fairy in this tale...

304
00:22:58,273 --> 00:22:59,914
while I am the woodcutter who stole your clothes?

305
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:03,593
Must I have the owner hand over my belongings?

306
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:04,634
Gosh.

307
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:06,634
Well,

308
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,874
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

309
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,553
- I am... - My lady!

310
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:16,272
My goodness. My lady!

311
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:18,712
I said I would get to that, but you lost your patience.

312
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,634
It is all fixed now. It will not leak.

313
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:28,313
My goodness. Goodness me.

314
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,194
Thank goodness.

315
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:34,913
We have not had a patron in so long.

316
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,552
My goodness.

317
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:38,114
- What are you... - Stop.

318
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:42,313
No?

319
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:44,553
Goodness.

320
00:23:58,154 --> 00:23:59,512
"We are an inn that welcomes those..."

321
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,593
"who are studying for the state exam."

322
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,272
"This is Garden of Flowers."

323
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:03,312
(Bohaeng gaekju: an inn for common wayfarers)

324
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:05,433
"All patrons pass the state exam, but we only host a few,"

325
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,074
"whom we provide with room and board."

326
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,074
I was only looking for someone to accommodate,

327
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,913
but you made me out to be a thief.

328
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:17,153
It does not change the fact that you stole my bag.

329
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,273
I did not run off with it. I was only keeping it safe.

330
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,273
Had it not been for me, it would have been lost.

331
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:23,594
How shameless of you.

332
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,953
Be grateful for not being arrested.

333
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,834
(Garden of Flowers)

334
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:32,553
- It is one nyang a night. - What?

335
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,393
The night has already deepened, so stay the night.

336
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:37,753
Who could sleep among a bunch of thieves?

337
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:41,914
You will not find a vacant room anywhere else.

338
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,193
The curfew bell will ring soon.

339
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:45,593
(Ingyeong: the bell that was rung...)

340
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:47,233
(to announce the beginning and end of curfew)

341
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,874
You should come in.

342
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:04,194
It is 1 nyang and 5 jeon a night.

343
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,433
You just said it was one nyang.

344
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:09,233
But then the curfew bell rang.

345
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:11,074
You have nowhere to go,

346
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,713
and this is the only place you can stay the night.

347
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:17,874
You know how to do business.

348
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:19,993
I hear that often.

349
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:21,993
Shall we?

350
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:26,313
Darn it.

351
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,074
My lady!

352
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:30,594
We meet again.

353
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:32,753
Hold on. You are...

354
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,834
I suffered bruises everywhere while trying to help the lady.

355
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:46,154
It seems as though I am in need of recuperation.

356
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:48,553
I was worried about you.

357
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:52,433
The curfew is in effect, and we cannot go to a clinic.

358
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,473
Goodness. That is not necessary.

359
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:59,273
A good night's sleep is all the remedy I need.

360
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:02,394
It is why I ask...

361
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:04,713
that you accommodate me for a few days.

362
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,593
I do not have any money on me,

363
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:10,993
but I will pay for the room when I can.

364
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,194
Young master,

365
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,674
the distinguished Garden of Flowers...

366
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:18,033
has a long-time tradition.

367
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:20,473
And what would that be?

368
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,154
We...

369
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:26,394
do not let anyone run a tab.

370
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:29,993
Did something happen during the day?

371
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:32,553
It was not a big deal.

372
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,953
It was big.

373
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,153
I am hurt to hear you do not agree.

374
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:37,953
I was also hurt by your suggestion.

375
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:40,273
How could you ask to run a tab just because you are injured?

376
00:26:40,953 --> 00:26:42,394
But look.

377
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:44,513
My cheek is still swollen.

378
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:48,553
It will only be for the night.

379
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,674
If you do not have the money, at least do some chores.

380
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,674
By the way, I have a request to make.

381
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,194
You are free to roam the grounds,

382
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:01,273
but do not enter the annex.

383
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,434
That is the one and only rule.

384
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,674
Do you have something hidden there?

385
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:08,273
Red ginseng? Wild ginseng? If not...

386
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,233
Young master,

387
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,752
would you rather sleep on the street?

388
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:14,992
I will not look for any wild ginseng here.

389
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:15,993
You can have it all.

390
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:20,553
Promise me that as well.

391
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,074
I hear you.

392
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,914
Goodness.

393
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,354
Oh, my. Look at those broad shoulders.

394
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:02,793
It must be because you are a swordsman.

395
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,713
I am Yuk Yuk Ho, the guest in the adjacent room.

396
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,033
As a senior scholar,

397
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,874
I figured I should share some knowledge.

398
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,793
As you can see, I am a swordsman.

399
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:16,953
Also, I will only be staying the night.

400
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,673
Breakfast is at 8am, lunch is at noon,

401
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:19,833
dinner is at 6pm, and curfew is at 10pm.

402
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:20,952
The owner prefers peace and quiet,

403
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:21,953
the main building is in the back, and the annex is off-limits.

404
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:22,953
But most importantly,

405
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:24,553
it is 3 nyang a month and you must pay 3 months' worth in advance.

406
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:27,914
Does the state exam test you on that?

407
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:30,553
You have it perfectly memorized.

408
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,633
You should know that...

409
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:36,154
I would have the highest score if memorization were a subject.

410
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:39,312
But whenever I take the exam, my stomach rumbles...

411
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:40,354
Hold on.

412
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:42,993
You said it was three nyang a month.

413
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,394
It is cheap compared to other inns in Jungcheon.

414
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:49,354
It is 1 nyang and 5 jeon a night.

415
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:52,914
You had me pay 15 days' worth?

416
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,232
That hustler.

417
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,793
Who are you calling a hustler?

418
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,154
What...

419
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:02,553
Do you like your room?

420
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:09,553
I bet you do...

421
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,753
seeing how it is way larger than mine.

422
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:15,194
It is a good thing you came over here.

423
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,273
I have some knowledge I would like to share.

424
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:19,594
You are him.

425
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:22,752
- Him? - The living legend...

426
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:25,194
who has been taking the state exam for decades.

427
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,634
Decades? A legend?

428
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:31,793
I thought you were a myth, but you actually exist.

429
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:33,553
I am utterly amazed.

430
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:40,114
(Garden of Flowers)

431
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,874
Please enjoy.

432
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:47,674
Let us eat.

433
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:50,874
By the way,

434
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,633
I heard that many of your guests successfully passed the exam.

435
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:54,634
Is it true?

436
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,753
I saw the huge poster out front.

437
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,473
One did pass the exam.

438
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,834
And who would that be?

439
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,312
My father.

440
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:03,793
Of course.

441
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:07,074
Just like you, your father was also marvelous.

442
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,394
Who else?

443
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,553
Well...

444
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:16,434
There are not enough side dishes.

445
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:18,833
We have enough soup though, so if you want more...

446
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:22,793
Forget about the soup. Which other guest passed the exam?

447
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:27,473
There is no need to address me that formally.

448
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,194
Please speak casually.

449
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:31,834
You all seem to be around Yu Ha's age,

450
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,993
so I will address you by your names as well.

451
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:35,434
Our names?

452
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:39,154
I do not mean to be rude or anything.

453
00:30:39,394 --> 00:30:41,952
Since we are housemates, we should comfortably...

454
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:45,033
You suddenly being friendly only makes it suspicious.

455
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:50,154
Let me serve you some more soup.

456
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:52,074
Sure.

457
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:00,753
Can I share a secret with you?

458
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,473
There is none. Her father was the only one.

459
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,753
You were all fooled by Dan O.

460
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,273
When Dan O's father was still alive,

461
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,634
scholars came by often.

462
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,074
I was one of them.

463
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:28,033
That was before she opened the inn.

464
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:30,953
How did she come to running an inn?

465
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:33,154
It is surprising...

466
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,793
to see a noblewoman run an inn.

467
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:38,194
She needed to put food on the table,

468
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,953
and the house was all that her father left her.

469
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:13,753
Young master, are you in your room?

470
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:38,513
Why does he not use a real sword?

471
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,194
Can you train properly with a wooden sword?

472
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:01,993
I was...

473
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,233
This...

474
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:24,953
You should just say so.

475
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:26,834
What?

476
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:29,874
If you wanted my sword that badly.

477
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:31,513
What if I did?

478
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:33,834
Would you let me have it?

479
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,074
I would hide it.

480
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,673
Do not worry. I am not here because I want it.

481
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,674
You are not a thief?

482
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:44,674
No.

483
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:47,353
- What makes you think... - Then are you a hustler?

484
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:48,473
What?

485
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,753
I heard how much you charge per room.

486
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,154
How can two weeks become one night?

487
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:58,513
You are welcome to stay for two weeks.

488
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,753
Then you will see the true merit of Garden of Flowers.

489
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:02,993
What?

490
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,712
Get out. I dislike it greatly when my space is intruded upon.

491
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,713
I apologize.

492
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:12,154
I have a lot to do here.

493
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,634
Including cleaning.

494
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:16,154
You have a terrible eye.

495
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:18,233
I doubt you are a good cleaner.

496
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:22,353
Oh, dear. I see you have not heard.

497
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,233
This is my specialty.

498
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,273
Shall I show you...

499
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:28,273
how snapping good I am?

500
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,674
- What? - At cleaning.

501
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,963
Shall I wipe that down for you?

502
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:36,002
Do you always want to have the last word?

503
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:37,433
I do tend to win.

504
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:50,154
Are you not pleased?

505
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,634
We got lucky last night.

506
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:53,793
We got lucky?

507
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,594
Young master Kang San.

508
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:59,313
He looks so noble and rich.

509
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:01,393
I bet he will pay rent on time.

510
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:05,193
He does not look noble or rich. He just looks ordinary.

511
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:06,963
He is handsome enough.

512
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:10,074
Women would talk about him to no end.

513
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,482
Ms. Naju, you lost your sense of taste...

514
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:14,353
and now your taste in men.

515
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,674
I have to deliver two packs of eggs to Buyounggak.

516
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:23,034
They got even more lodgers.

517
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:29,523
I guess the other inns are full to the brim.

518
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,273
Slowly and gently.

519
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,353
Be careful.

520
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:42,832
Your Highness, be careful.

521
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:43,833
Be careful.

522
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:00,154
You are not showing signs of labor.

523
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,003
Did you not hear what the monk said?

524
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,074
I must give birth within the month if it is to be a son.

525
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:11,913
But we cannot take the baby out of you by force.

526
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,483
I must and will...

527
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:17,713
give birth to a son.

528
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:20,233
His Majesty wishes for an heir,

529
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,594
and I cannot disappoint him.

530
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:24,963
Do not worry.

531
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:27,753
Your child will be a son.

532
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:37,273
I must be prepared.

533
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,154
Just in case.

534
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,034
I understand.

535
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:12,154
A child will be born soon.

536
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:14,233
Will I have an heir?

537
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:16,154
No.

538
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:20,393
Is there no way?

539
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:36,674
I do not see a son...

540
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:38,523
in your future.

541
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:41,034
How dare you?

542
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:42,873
- Watch your manners. - Leave it.

543
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:44,393
We shall leave.

544
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,154
There is something more important.

545
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:53,074
Your being.

546
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:58,353
It is in great danger.

547
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:01,793
What?

548
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,483
Do not look for...

549
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:07,963
the person you have in mind.

550
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,074
The one who makes you tremble in your dreams.

551
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:19,114
He will swallow you up.

552
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,793
Your geomungo sang so sadly,

553
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,913
I almost burst into tears.

554
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,873
Your Majesty.

555
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:38,523
You blessed my ears with music from paradise.

556
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:47,913
How about I bless you in another way?

557
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:54,034
Your Majesty, First Vice-premier Sin Won Ho requests an audience.

558
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:57,393
I had just cheered myself up.

559
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:05,674
(Lee Chang)

560
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:13,233
Is there still no news on the deposed heir Lee Seol?

561
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:17,594
I apologize, Your Majesty.

562
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:20,753
You have aged also.

563
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:24,233
You still cannot find that young punk?

564
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:27,033
I apologize for being dull and short-witted.

565
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,074
I beseech you to scold me severely.

566
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,633
Three months ago, on the death anniversary...

567
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:41,273
of deposed heir Lee Pyeong, a young man visited his grave.

568
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:44,393
I thought it was Lee Seol and hastily gave chase.

569
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:49,002
I lost him in Jungcheon.

570
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:50,674
Lee Seol is in Hanyang?

571
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:52,674
Yes.

572
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,832
Nobles from all over are flocking...

573
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,154
to Hanyang for the state exam.

574
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:01,313
He took that as an opportunity.

575
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:12,634
(Sin Won Ho, First Vice-premier)

576
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:36,753
Lee Seol.

577
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,074
Are you looking for him?

578
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:41,114
We are searching all the inns,

579
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:43,913
taverns, and kisaeng houses in Jungcheon.

580
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,433
There cannot be another mistake.

581
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,313
If you lose him again like before...

582
00:41:52,753 --> 00:41:54,833
That will not happen.

583
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:56,833
I will hope so.

584
00:41:57,523 --> 00:42:00,074
You must have learned a lesson that day.

585
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:10,232
(Capital District Office)

586
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,233
My lord.

587
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:12,674
It is Jong Soo.

588
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,833
Come in.

589
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:20,634
He is here.

590
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,872
You made the long trip, Chief Eunuch.

591
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:41,154
"Chief Eunuch?"

592
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,873
I left the palace over ten years ago.

593
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:46,273
You may address me casually.

594
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,034
(Buyounggak)

595
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:18,963
Welcome, my lord.

596
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:22,674
The list?

597
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:24,353
It is ready.

598
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:39,232
Here, I recorded detailed information...

599
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,713
about the scholars staying at Buyounggak.

600
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,194
What about him?

601
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:04,873
No.

602
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:07,554
From his eyes to his lips,

603
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:09,913
he looks nothing like him.

604
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:23,674
Yes, there must be a reason why we were told not to go in there.

605
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:50,712
Sir, I just saw...

606
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:52,393
I told you not to go anywhere near the annex!

607
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:53,753
Return to your room at once!

608
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:09,154
Come on, sir.

609
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,232
If you wish to know the future,

610
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,674
you should visit a shaman instead of coming to a bookstore.

611
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:16,593
Is it truly not here?

612
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:18,074
- No. - It is not here.

613
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:23,593
It would not be called a prophetic book if it were easy to obtain.

614
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:27,313
(Chamwiseo: A book of shamanic prophecies)

615
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:30,594
- Do you know about the book? - Of course, I do.

616
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:32,994
What are you curious about?

617
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,474
The future of Joseon? Or...

618
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:37,913
your own future?

619
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:42,673
A man living on Joseon's soil cannot be unaffected...

620
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,074
by Joseon's future.

621
00:45:48,074 --> 00:45:51,233
Your sword appears to be a little too shabby for your big aspirations.

622
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,392
- Come again? - Can you pass the military exam...

623
00:45:55,393 --> 00:45:56,713
with that sword?

624
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,954
I am trying to find a way to win without slashing anyone.

625
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:03,873
Winning without slashing anyone?

626
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:09,753
Is there a way? No. Is there such a world?

627
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:14,594
No, there is not.

628
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,074
Hence,

629
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:19,954
I wish to live in such a world.

630
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:34,353
Anyway, why are you looking for the prophetic book?

631
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:37,273
I heard the commoners suffering under the tyranny...

632
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,594
were finding solace in such vulgar books.

633
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:45,154
If you truly wish to read it, I can get it for you.

634
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,674
Would you do that for me?

635
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:54,113
Please let me go! My baby is in there!

636
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:55,514
A baby in a kisaeng house? Nonsense!

637
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:57,954
They said they would let me in.

638
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:00,154
Please allow me to breastfeed my child.

639
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:03,353
I know nothing about it. Get lost at once.

640
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:04,833
Come on.

641
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:11,433
(Buyounggak)

642
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:13,393
Get up.

643
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:18,753
What are you doing here?

644
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:20,793
Young Master.

645
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:22,154
Do you know her?

646
00:47:22,393 --> 00:47:24,713
She was my family's servant. I emancipated her from her status.

647
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,114
Anyway, what is the matter?

648
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,913
My husband racked up gambling debts at Buyounggak.

649
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,954
And he took my newborn baby.

650
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:36,753
He took the baby? What for?

651
00:47:37,474 --> 00:47:38,554
Young Master.

652
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:42,194
Please help me.

653
00:47:55,313 --> 00:47:57,674
I suppose it is my lucky day.

654
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:00,074
I am sorry.

655
00:48:03,273 --> 00:48:05,554
I shall deduct this amount from your rent.

656
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:07,033
I did not expect you to be like this.

657
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:09,313
Why? Are you moving out?

658
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:11,273
No, I just meant...

659
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:13,514
You look even more beautiful from this angle.

660
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:26,154
Oh!

661
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:29,554
You lads. It is you.

662
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:32,074
What are you two doing here?

663
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:33,954
The truth is, we...

664
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,313
We are here to play tujeon. Why else would we come to Buyounggak?

665
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:49,753
I thought all the lights were gone. But look, there they are.

666
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,034
They are brightening up the whole room!

667
00:48:53,913 --> 00:48:54,954
I like the one on the right.

668
00:48:56,273 --> 00:48:57,353
I want to be knocked down...

669
00:48:57,753 --> 00:48:59,074
by his sharp nose.

670
00:49:01,194 --> 00:49:02,474
I like the one in the middle.

671
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,793
I wish to dive into his beautiful eyes.

672
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:20,393
Nice to meet you.

673
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,353
My name is Mae Wol.

674
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:25,474
We do not need another player.

675
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,034
We are sorry.

676
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,873
It would be more fun if we all played together.

677
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:48,034
We do not have time for this. We must find the child first.

678
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,994
Do you want everyone to find out? Be quiet.

679
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,194
Hey, Kang San. It is your turn.

680
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,154
You are talking even more casually now.

681
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:06,034
We are all friends while playing tujeon.

682
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,034
I will sneak out first.

683
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:17,353
Stay here for now.

684
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:18,514
I will come with you.

685
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:20,994
Hold on.

686
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:23,313
You two.

687
00:50:24,793 --> 00:50:26,154
What are you cooking up?

688
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:27,634
What do you mean?

689
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:31,074
- We are not cooking up anything. - Come on.

690
00:50:31,474 --> 00:50:33,034
If you do not tell us the truth,

691
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,393
you cannot leave this room.

692
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:52,034
Someone brought a baby here to pay his debt.

693
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:01,994
Are you inside?

694
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,273
Look after the child for just a few days.

695
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:10,913
Thanks for your help.

696
00:52:32,393 --> 00:52:33,393
What?

697
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:37,114
- What is going on? - Who are you? What is this about?

698
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:38,873
(Garden of Flowers)

699
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,554
It looks like you need a new sign!

700
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,674
What are you doing here?

701
00:52:51,273 --> 00:52:52,313
I...

702
00:52:53,514 --> 00:52:56,713
I came here as a guest but got lost.

703
00:53:03,873 --> 00:53:07,514
Guests are not allowed to come in here.

704
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:11,833
Please leave.

705
00:53:12,474 --> 00:53:13,554
I apologize.

706
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:10,273
What?

707
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,313
My gosh.

708
00:54:32,713 --> 00:54:33,713
Gosh.

709
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:45,793
The baby is gone.

710
00:54:59,954 --> 00:55:01,554
Do you not know how much the baby's worth?

711
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:04,313
Lose it, and you are dead.

712
00:55:04,353 --> 00:55:05,353
Darn.

713
00:55:26,674 --> 00:55:27,674
Identify yourself.

714
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:12,313
Seriously?

715
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,474
What a dimwit.

716
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:18,433
Give up the baby if you do not want to die.

717
00:57:06,034 --> 00:57:08,034
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

718
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:12,114
Let us leave, then.

719
00:57:23,034 --> 00:57:25,154
Darn, what did I come here for?

720
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:27,114
It was just a waste of my energy.

721
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:30,872
(Buyounggak)

722
00:57:30,873 --> 00:57:32,554
Has Dan O not come out yet?

723
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:34,474
Neither has San.

724
00:57:35,594 --> 00:57:36,913
Give it a moment.

725
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,674
What if you miss each other?

726
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:45,353
Yu Ha.

727
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:46,433
You found the baby. Let us go.

728
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:48,114
Come on.

729
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:55,634
Halt.

730
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:22,994
Thank you so much.

731
00:58:24,353 --> 00:58:26,194
How could I ever repay you?

732
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:28,634
Get to safety for a few days...

733
00:58:28,913 --> 00:58:29,994
since we had to take the baby by force.

734
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:31,674
Thank you, Young Master Jung.

735
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:35,833
He is a handsome one.

736
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,034
He might leave many heartbroken women in his wake.

737
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:39,713
Like me.

738
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,954
Never did I expect such an event.

739
00:58:55,353 --> 00:58:56,353
We rescued a baby.

740
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,833
You barely did anything to help in the rescue.

741
00:59:01,154 --> 00:59:04,074
He is right. It was me who paid for the horses.

742
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:06,073
You only held the reins.

743
00:59:06,074 --> 00:59:07,913
San may be critical, but you as well?

744
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:11,273
You seem gentle and cheerful, but your words sting.

745
00:59:13,594 --> 00:59:15,913
Your role was not grand, but it was much needed.

746
00:59:18,594 --> 00:59:20,233
San, how about you?

747
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:21,793
Were you injured?

748
00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:23,674
I am not one to get roughed up by others...

749
00:59:24,514 --> 00:59:25,514
unlike someone I know.

750
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:27,833
He is right.

751
00:59:29,074 --> 00:59:30,912
He would probably do the roughing up.

752
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:33,074
I see you have a way of twisting one's words.

753
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,792
Swing and rotate your arms for us. You never know.

754
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:43,034
I already said I was fine.

755
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,433
Do not be late to pay for your stay.

756
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:50,873
Should the inn owner...

757
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,433
have to follow you to the tujeon den that is crawling with men?

758
00:59:54,994 --> 00:59:57,114
The other men are the issue for you.

759
00:59:58,273 --> 00:59:59,353
How long has it been?

760
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,913
What are you talking about?

761
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:03,273
Dan O.

762
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,634
How long have you fancied her?

763
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:13,994
What...

764
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:16,594
But...

765
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:18,233
Why are you doing this to me?

766
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:22,513
My gosh. My goodness.

767
01:00:22,514 --> 01:00:24,594
Okay, let us go. Hey!

768
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:40,194
It does not seem like anyone suspicious was here.

769
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,474
Let us go.

770
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:47,833
Please.

771
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:49,034
My gosh.

772
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:52,913
Goodness.

773
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:56,154
What is the meaning of this?

774
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:57,594
My lady.

775
01:00:58,034 --> 01:00:59,872
Finally, you are back.

776
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,313
I asked what the meaning of this was.

777
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,792
Why else would loan sharks be here?

778
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,193
To collect the debt, of course.

779
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,194
What?

780
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:09,313
A debt cannot suddenly appear out of nowhere.

781
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:11,474
It appeared from the afterlife.

782
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,273
Your father took out a loan before his passing.

783
01:01:14,913 --> 01:01:15,994
A hundred nyang to be exact.

784
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:22,273
Oh, dear.

785
01:01:22,634 --> 01:01:24,074
To pay back that huge debt,

786
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:25,713
you will have to sell the inn.

787
01:01:27,954 --> 01:01:29,594
I think we are done here.

788
01:01:29,873 --> 01:01:31,554
Is the annex that way?

789
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:33,433
Do not go there.

790
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,034
Note that I warned you.

791
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:38,674
If a vindictive spirit haunts you, that will be on you!

792
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:41,633
It is not your average vindictive spirit though.

793
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:44,953
Rumor has it that it only takes the souls of men.

794
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:45,954
Is this the inn...

795
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:48,474
that is rumored to have a spirit haunting it?

796
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:49,833
A spirit, my foot.

797
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:51,833
As if I would believe such nonsense.

798
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:54,233
You cannot be at the annex.

799
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,313
Let me be the judge for you.

800
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,074
I will see if one can step foot in it.

801
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,114
- Move. - How dare you...

802
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:03,954
lay your hand on her?

803
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:08,353
She said it was off-limits. Now, get lost.

804
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,634
That is enough.

805
01:02:10,313 --> 01:02:11,393
You will only regret what is to come.

806
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:13,913
And who may you be?

807
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:16,074
I have not seen you around here.

808
01:02:25,594 --> 01:02:28,034
Will you be able to recognize the boy?

809
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:31,353
I saw him grow up since he was a baby.

810
01:02:31,954 --> 01:02:35,074
How could I possibly forget his face?

811
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:38,074
Leave for the night.

812
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,233
One should not cause a ruckus this late.

813
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:42,913
Not minding your own business...

814
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:45,634
is how you will get a scar on those pretty faces.

815
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:46,793
Then,

816
01:02:48,154 --> 01:02:49,433
go ahead.

817
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:06,594
Garden of Flowers is the last inn on the list.

818
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:08,594
Then,

819
01:03:09,674 --> 01:03:12,674
deposed grand heir Lee Seol might be there.

820
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,074
Have you ever seen Lee Seol yourself?

821
01:03:19,154 --> 01:03:20,233
Just once.

822
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:30,713
And what happened that day...

823
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:32,913
is why I live today.

824
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,993
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

825
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:24,312
It is the promissory note your father wrote.

826
01:04:24,313 --> 01:04:26,593
I will protect Garden of Flowers no matter what.

827
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:28,033
You will have it taken from you...

828
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:31,513
unless you can offer something far more valuable.

829
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:32,514
Do not cry.

830
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:33,674
I told you not to cry.

831
01:04:33,675 --> 01:04:36,352
My lady, please take me in.

832
01:04:36,353 --> 01:04:38,553
Yu Ha, you are the sweetest.

833
01:04:38,554 --> 01:04:41,392
Lee Seol is giving me a warning.

834
01:04:41,393 --> 01:04:44,113
He will soon be coming for the throne.

835
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:46,633
I do not keep those useless by my side.

836
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,392
I will immediately inform you...

837
01:04:48,393 --> 01:04:49,393
of anyone suspicious.

838
01:04:49,394 --> 01:04:51,913
The eunuch is searching for a traitor?
