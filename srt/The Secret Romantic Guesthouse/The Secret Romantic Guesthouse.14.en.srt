00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,922
(Shin Ye Eun)

00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,682
(Ryeo Un)

3
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:31,162
(Kang Hoon)

4
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,482
(Jung Gun Joo)

5
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:44,091
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

6
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,920
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,122
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,122
It is okay if you are an illusion.

9
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:27,962
Even if the man I know...

10
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,521
does not exist.

11
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,721
I never even imagined...

12
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:41,882
I would get to see...

13
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:45,801
these silver ripples again.

14
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,281
My lady.

15
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,482
I changed because I met you.

16
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:58,402
You must have changed also.

17
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,561
You said you wished to forget the past.

18
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:10,842
Then forget it.

19
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,921
I will as well.

20
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,121
I will try to.

21
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:31,482
My lady, you are a brave woman.

22
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,762
You are braver than most.

23
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:45,602
Promise me...

24
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:48,641
one thing.

25
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,882
Whatever happens,

26
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,482
do not leave me all alone again.

27
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,241
What shall I do about Yoon Hong Ju?

28
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:19,841
We must confirm first.

29
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,361
If she truly is alive,

30
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,241
I will make sure she takes her last breath.

31
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,562
I hate winters.

32
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,241
Why are the days so short?

33
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:39,681
You should go.

34
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,921
What if someone were to see us?

35
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,282
You told me not to leave you alone.

36
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:59,801
Very well. I will go now.

37
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,601
I will see you tomorrow,

38
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:22,641
after the long night, Lady Hong Ju.

39
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,401
I am seeing for myself and cannot believe it.

40
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,002
Yoon Hong Ju is alive.

41
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,812
Shall I grab her?

42
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,762
We cannot let the word spread.

43
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,562
I have a plan.

44
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,161
Find a place to bury her.

45
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,161
She is alive,

46
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,442
but she has already died once.

47
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,762
We just have to return her there quietly.

48
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,682
They say Snowflake has a shadow who protects only him.

49
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,081
Was that you?

50
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,521
Are you usually this careless? If someone were to hear...

51
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,242
Things just got awkward between us.

52
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,682
We cannot even speak freely.

53
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,721
We never exactly felt comfortable around each other.

54
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,921
We have too many secrets to speak freely.

55
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,922
I liked your jokes very much.

56
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:57,601
But now I see...

57
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:02,161
your jokes were a tactic you used to hide your true feelings.

58
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,721
Then shall I tell you this also?

59
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,242
The watchman always cuts down anyone who threatens...

60
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,242
his master's safety.

61
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,562
So do not place yourself where my blade can reach.

62
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,682
You still...

63
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,281
do not trust me.

64
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,721
Hwa Ryung sent the assassins?

65
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,922
Why would she wish me dead?

66
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,721
Because she wishes someone else to take the throne.

67
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,882
What happened in the yard was our mistake.

68
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,762
My carelessness was to blame.

69
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,122
Should you not explain first...

70
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,361
who sent those men?

71
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,481
I warned the people sternly so it will not happen again.

72
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,281
Do you believe everything he says?

73
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,521
I do not.

74
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,922
But someone said...

75
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,882
there is nothing one cannot achieve when desperate enough.

76
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,481
You must want to remove the beast on the throne as badly as I.

77
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:26,481
I put my trust...

78
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,242
in that desperation.

79
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,161
Would two not be better than one?

80
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,242
What are you doing?

81
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,801
Why did you all jump?

82
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,160
Were you plotting something?

83
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,281
Dan O, why are you...

84
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,720
out here this morning?

85
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:50,922
What do you think?

86
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:54,002
Do you not want breakfast?

87
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,721
Yes, let us eat.

88
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,961
I told Dan O.

89
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:11,682
About what?

90
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,762
That I like her a lot.

91
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,322
You do not have to tell me...

92
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,161
how you feel about her.

93
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,641
I am telling you that I have not given up on her too.

94
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,882
What?

95
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,002
Once you replace the King,

96
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,292
what will you do with Dan O?

97
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,240
Of course, she will come with me...

98
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,682
Do you think she will want that?

99
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,081
She would stop at nothing to preserve...

100
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,241
her sister and Garden of Flowers.

101
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,562
Do you think...

102
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:50,481
the palace in which she can barely breathe suits her?

103
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,162
Burdened by incredible responsibility,

104
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,652
she will be locked up forever.

105
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,292
Is that not too selfish?

106
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:16,322
You will work together?

107
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:21,241
You suffered for so many years, and you are still so naive.

108
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,652
Gyeom and I want the same thing.

109
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,240
We will fight for it together.

110
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,922
You may share a goal now.

111
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,081
But once you replace the current King,

112
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,961
who will be next?

113
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:38,601
Your Highness, no one in the world voluntarily gives up...

114
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,652
the power they obtained.

115
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:44,481
Perhaps you fear the possibility of having...

116
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,081
your brother's blood on your hands.

117
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,922
Yes.

118
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:53,841
I am afraid.

119
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,081
That eventually we will...

120
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,361
target each other.

121
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:06,442
However,

122
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,361
I will not surrender to my fear.

123
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,412
I will...

124
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,442
march forward.

125
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:17,961
Wait and see...

126
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,322
how I open a new world.

127
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,652
They seemed to be discussing a personal matter...

128
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,081
in secret.

129
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,841
What did the Chief Eunuch have to talk about...

130
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:58,761
with a bottom-ranking palace guard?

131
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,682
I heard you asked for me, Chief.

132
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,081
You are to keep a watchful eye on Kang San from now on.

133
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,642
I must know what he is up to...

134
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,162
outside the palace walls.

135
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:18,841
Yes, Chief.

136
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,202
What brings Your Highness here?

137
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:32,442
What do you think?

138
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,802
I am here to speak with His Majesty. Please let him know.

139
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,522
Are you here to tell him that I am in league with the Queen Dowager?

140
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:51,042
It is true, is it not?

141
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,121
I know some things too.

142
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,241
Care to listen?

143
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,241
I heard the Heir Apparent...

144
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:05,322
was not your child.

145
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,361
His Majesty already knows all about it.

146
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:16,881
It is no big deal.

147
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:21,000
If the ministers find out, both the Heir Apparent...

148
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,121
and even His Majesty will be put at risk.

149
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,001
Could you truly brush it off...

150
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:29,481
as if it is no problem at all?

151
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,042
Must you do this, Your Majesty?

152
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,241
If words get out about this shamanic ritual,

153
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,801
the ministers will fly into a rage again.

154
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,682
My life would be endangered if we did not perform the ritual.

155
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,001
Kang San.

156
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,562
Come with us.

157
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,881
I will show you something interesting.

158
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:38,121
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:40,961
First Vice-premier.

160
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,481
Thank you for finding Seol.

161
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,522
Thanks to you,

162
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:50,922
my long time wish has come true.

163
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,120
Did you and His Highness have a good conversation?

164
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,121
Yes.

165
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,562
He has grown into a wonderful man,

166
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:03,841
even though life must have been tough for him.

167
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,042
Now, you are the only one...

168
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,802
who can protect His Highness.

169
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,761
As long as His Majesty is sitting on the throne,

170
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,321
His Highness cannot stay alive for long.

171
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,162
To oust the King,

172
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:25,721
we need a justifiable reason.

173
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,361
There is something.

174
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,681
Something huge that would...

175
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,481
turn the royal court upside down if the ministers were to find out.

176
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,241
It is about the legitimacy of the Heir Apparent.

177
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,001
I borrowed a horse.

178
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,761
Where do you wish to go? Just tell me.

179
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,922
Anywhere. Where we go does not matter...

180
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,721
for I am with you.

181
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,401
You little rat!

182
00:15:58,402 --> 00:15:59,881
I told you not to go anywhere near the annex.

183
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,681
You seduced Hong Ju!

184
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,401
No, Yuk Ho. Let me explain...

185
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:04,840
Explain what? You rat!

186
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,481
My gosh. Why are you so worked up?

187
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:09,760
You two can talk it out.

188
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,761
Talk it out?

189
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:14,360
If he listened to me, he would not be here now!

190
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,922
I cannot believe this.

191
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,802
Why him, of all scholars at Garden of Flowers...

192
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,601
- Oh, dear. - Why? What is wrong with him?

193
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,922
He is handsome and...

194
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:25,961
And...

195
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, he is handsome.

196
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,322
- Oh, dear. - Gosh.

197
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,442
Why him, of all people?

198
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:35,042
He failed the exam. He is unemployed, lazy, and useless.

199
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,121
I am truly hurt.

200
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:40,601
I admit that I am unemployed and lazy,

201
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,880
but "useless?" That is mean.

202
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,402
Ms. Naju is right!

203
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:45,761
You rat, come here.

204
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:48,761
Get out at once. Do not come anywhere near this house!

205
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:50,961
- Come here. - Yuk Ho, let me explain...

206
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,322
I do not want to live without him!

207
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,522
For years, I lived quietly in hiding...

208
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,042
like an old tree in the annex.

209
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,001
Finally...

210
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,241
Finally, I feel like I can breathe a little.

211
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,041
Thanks to Scholar Kim, who came to me like the sunshine.

212
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,281
Lady Hong Ju.

213
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,922
Then this is what we will do.

214
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,402
Do tell.

215
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:30,161
I can and will do anything to get your permission.

216
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,481
Pass the state exam.

217
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:36,041
If you pass the state exam,

218
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,481
then I will approve of your relationship.

219
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,852
Pass the state exam?

220
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,521
Me?

221
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:42,882
Why? Do you not want to do it?

222
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,561
You need to earn a living if you wish to marry her.

223
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,321
Gosh, marry me?

224
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,280
We are not there yet...

225
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,001
I will pass the exam and become successful.

226
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,372
I will be sure...

227
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:57,162
to make it happen.

228
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,321
Very well.

229
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,442
If you do your very best,

230
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,642
you can make it happen.

231
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,092
I heard you were staying at Garden of Flowers.

232
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:17,882
Yes.

233
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,481
Does Dan O take good care of you?

234
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,761
She always makes sure that I am comfortable.

235
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,001
We should return to the palace now. It is getting late.

236
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,372
The shaman said not to return home immediately...

237
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:35,721
if I wished to ward off the evil spirits for good.

238
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:45,852
Yes, coming!

239
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,281
Why are you so nervous?

240
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:16,642
Are you afraid I would bite you or something?

241
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,041
I did not have anything decent to serve to Your Majesty...

242
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:22,321
for I was not expecting you today.

243
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,041
A shaman told me...

244
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,851
that Lee Seol was waiting for the right moment,

245
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:39,561
holding his sword to my throat.

246
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,162
Dan O, do you think so too?

247
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:03,162
If Your Majesty believes it to be true,

248
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:05,761
it will happen.

249
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,241
What did you say?

250
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,641
"The wise are free from perplexities,"

251
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,721
"and the bold from fear."

252
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,682
The wise does not worry,

253
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,481
and the brave does not fear.

254
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,561
The audacity!

255
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,561
How dare you speak such words to His Majesty?

256
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,162
Are you saying I fear Lee Seol?

257
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,922
You are already shivering...

258
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,682
when the cold is not nigh.

259
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,041
Then watch closely.

260
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,761
Just like the snow melts,

261
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,092
Lee Seol will perish and disappear.

262
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,882
And that day draws near.

263
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,162
Is someone here?

264
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,442
What are you looking at?

265
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:04,521
Well,

266
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,001
His Majesty is visiting.

267
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:12,041
The palace would have better liquor,

268
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,402
so why choose to visit Garden of Flowers?

269
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:39,442
And who may you be?

270
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:41,922
What is your name?

271
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,852
This is His Majesty. Address him with respect.

272
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,682
I am Jung Yu Ha, a scholar residing at Garden of Flowers.

273
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,842
I thought it was only an inn by name,

274
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:59,082
but you have actual guests.

275
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,961
You should also rest since the night has deepened.

276
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,602
I did not expect him to suggest that we come to Garden of Flowers.

277
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,642
It must have startled you dearly.

278
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,162
It was all right.

279
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,402
Actually, his visit reassured me.

280
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:40,442
It made me think...

281
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:44,362
that maybe the roles have changed.

282
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:47,241
Changed as in how?

283
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,162
The one being haunted by fear is His Majesty,

284
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,442
not you.

285
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,761
Never have I ever...

286
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:00,402
received encouragement this bold before.

287
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:04,041
Rather than encouragement,

288
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,362
they are words of belief.

289
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:10,642
I believe...

290
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:13,882
you will accomplish your honourable goal.

291
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:18,561
So please...

292
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,402
safely take your seat on the throne.

293
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:32,162
By the way, what will you do...

294
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,842
when you become King?

295
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:39,682
What is it?

296
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:43,321
Have you not thought about it?

297
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,801
You will be the father to your people,

298
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,961
so take your time and give it some thought.

299
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:52,961
What about you?

300
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,082
What will you do once I am King?

301
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,281
You should also take your time...

302
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,001
and consider your options.

303
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,761
Do not let last night's visit concern you.

304
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:22,521
He suddenly suggested the visit while on his secret outing.

305
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:25,001
I know. Dan O told me.

306
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,642
Then what could you be so hesitant to talk to me about?

307
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,281
Well...

308
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:36,321
I was wondering if you knew.

309
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,761
About what?

310
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:41,281
About my birth mother.

311
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:44,521
- Could it be... - No.

312
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:47,362
I do not know anything about her.

313
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,082
Any minor detail would do.

314
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:51,842
Is there nothing you know?

315
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:53,761
There is someone.

316
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:57,922
I may not know anything, but this person might.

317
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:00,721
Could you make an introduction?

318
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:04,841
(Inner Military Office)

319
00:25:04,842 --> 00:25:07,520
Three days from now, the royal hunting will take place.

320
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,040
(Tawui: A hunting event enjoyed by the King)

321
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,281
Where will the hunting event take place?

322
00:25:12,402 --> 00:25:13,561
Mount Eungbong.

323
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,480
First Vice-premier will also attend the event,

324
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,560
so let there be no weak points during the escort.

325
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:18,642
- Yes, my lord! - Yes, my lord!

326
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:25,961
The hunting event.

327
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,162
That day will present an opportunity.

328
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:30,721
An opportunity to eliminate the King.

329
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:41,162
I will always be by your side.

330
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:45,521
What are you gazing at?

331
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,162
It is nothing.

332
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,882
(Buyounggak)

333
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,761
You... How are you here?

334
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,402
You had someone spy on me.

335
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:14,761
I needed information on Mokinhoe.

336
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:17,362
Do not get the wrong idea.

337
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:25,602
I was under the impression that you knew who your mother was.

338
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:28,521
What do you mean by that?

339
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:32,082
It is why you chose to meet with Mokinhoe scholars here.

340
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,001
Is Hwa Ryung,

341
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,442
the madame of Buyounggak,

342
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,801
my birth mother?

343
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:51,682
Were you truly not aware of it?

344
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,961
Could you be idling away?

345
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:20,402
Talk about being evil during our busiest hour.

346
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,481
What if the madame finds out?

347
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:25,081
If you cause trouble...

348
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:26,642
All will be well as long as I do not.

349
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,642
- What? - Keep your mouths shut.

350
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,162
If the madame finds out, I will know you told her.

351
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:42,642
Why on earth did you nod?

352
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,561
Mae Wol, were you intimidated?

353
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:45,761
Intimidated?

354
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:49,442
She has Master Jang looking out for her.

355
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:52,001
Provoking her will do me no good!

356
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:57,122
- I think she was intimidated. - Why is she taking it out on me?

357
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:40,682
Excuse me. Do you know who resides here?

358
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,162
I see you are not from around here.

359
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:46,082
Here resides the great first vice-premier.

360
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:51,162
I see. I appreciate it.

361
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,442
I am disappointed in you.

362
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:03,202
Have you been leading Mokinhoe just to helplessly abandon it?

363
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:05,281
I have no excuse whatsoever,

364
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:09,402
but I came to a decision that would benefit us all.

365
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,481
I will meet Queen Dowager and beg for her forgiveness.

366
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,000
Set up a meeting for us.

367
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:18,362
- I cannot! - Lord Sin...

368
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,761
I must first meet Snowflake.

369
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,761
After meeting him,

370
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,321
I will come to my own decision.

371
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,362
I hope the conversation went well.

372
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,041
I made...

373
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:01,162
some harsh remarks the other day.

374
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:05,721
- For that, I apologize. - That is not necessary.

375
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:09,442
I should have been considerate of your intentions.

376
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:13,281
Stay out of my business from now on.

377
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:17,801
That includes setting up meetings of this nature.

378
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:19,682
Do you...

379
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,162
still...

380
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,602
not trust me?

381
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:27,521
I may back down now,

382
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,281
but I am still Lee Gyeom.

383
00:30:30,882 --> 00:30:33,362
I am a legitimate heir that threatens the King.

384
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,001
That does not change.

385
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,362
The King does not know about you.

386
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:42,162
- So... - I could get found out at any time.

387
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,801
Anyone close to me...

388
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,761
could be in danger.

389
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:54,882
I do not...

390
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,082
wish to...

391
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,122
lose you also.

392
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:20,041
(Garden of Flowers)

393
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:24,041
First Vice-premier Sin Won Ho backed Mokinhoe?

394
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:26,682
I never imagined that.

395
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:30,922
He asked me to arrange a meeting...

396
00:31:31,162 --> 00:31:32,202
with you.

397
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:35,362
He will attend today's gathering.

398
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,721
I can arrange a meeting if you wish.

399
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:46,321
Why would you bother to accompany us?

400
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,001
We all know who the other is.

401
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:52,402
Would you not prefer me here than as a shadow?

402
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,001
Let him be.

403
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:57,561
He still does not trust me.

404
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,082
Also,

405
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,402
three is better than two.

406
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:06,241
What do you mean?

407
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,561
I am desperate too.

408
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,801
The master must take the throne...

409
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,561
for the watchman to go free.

410
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:22,281
Do not take it to heart.

411
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:26,721
Suspecting everything...

412
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:29,442
is part of my duty.

413
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:42,682
We must bring the revolt forward.

414
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:45,602
The bitter cold added to the tyranny,

415
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:49,521
and the people's cries ring from all corners of the nation.

416
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:51,561
When spring comes,

417
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:55,720
they might have to build huts on top of numerous graves.

418
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,801
The ministers only care about power.

419
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,442
Would replacing the King improve everything overnight?

420
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,521
Are you saying we must replace the corrupt officials first?

421
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,481
Should we not start with the Three Offices that lost...

422
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,361
their will to debate and advise?

423
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,721
(The Three Offices handled PR.)

424
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,521
The more the nation suffers,

425
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:22,682
the more a King yearns for wise subjects.

426
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:27,162
Men like you with strong wills and bright minds...

427
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,561
should work for the government.

428
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:35,442
Yu Ha was already drawing a plan.

429
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:39,882
What do you mean?

430
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:44,602
How to build a new house on top of the crumbled castle of sand.

431
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:50,961
What will you do when you become King?

432
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,602
You will be the father to your people,

433
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,842
so take your time and give it some thought.

434
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,761
I never thought of that.

435
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,241
My goal was always...

436
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,122
to take down the King.

437
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:11,041
It remained at that.

438
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:13,881
The castle of sand must come down first.

439
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,122
The rock on Mount Eungbong.

440
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,082
Think only of that right now.

441
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,721
If you are distracted,

442
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,321
so will your arrow.

443
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,491
Is that not him?

444
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:39,562
First Vice-premier Sin Won Ho.

445
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:49,761
(Capital District Office)

446
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:01,562
Ban Ya.

447
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,011
What brings you here?

448
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,531
Is Assistant Magistrate Jang here?

449
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:10,721
What is it?

450
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,082
I followed Hwa Ryung last night.

451
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:18,011
She went into Lord Sin's residence.

452
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:28,162
Very well. Inform me if you find out anything else.

453
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:30,602
Yes, my lord.

454
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:41,321
Keep an eye on him.

455
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:44,602
It looks like Lord Sin is up to something.

456
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,241
Yes, my lord.

457
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,361
I was caught off guard.

458
00:35:59,202 --> 00:36:00,971
I did not think you had entered the palace.

459
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:02,841
I was surprised also...

460
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:06,321
to hear you support Mokinhoe.

461
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:08,361
My only master...

462
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,562
is Joseon, my nation.

463
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:14,010
I borrowed your name,

464
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:16,321
but please consider it an act of loyalty...

465
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,562
to save the nation from misery.

466
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,531
The method was unjust,

467
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:23,122
but the intention was loyal?

468
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:26,760
Did you ask to see me to make an excuse?

469
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:28,801
I wished to ask you in person...

470
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:31,042
what your intention is.

471
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:33,721
Do you...

472
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,721
wish to execute His Majesty?

473
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:44,881
Lord Sin.

474
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,162
Do your will with Mokinhoe.

475
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,602
I will do what I wish.

476
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,761
Oh, do you know this?

477
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,681
I am four years older than you both.

478
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,881
I expected as much.

479
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:09,042
Even the watchman cannot hide his age.

480
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:11,491
I found it most suspicious that we were the same age.

481
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,840
Then which of you is older?

482
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,162
I believe I was born sooner.

483
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:19,841
I was born in the spring.

484
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,721
In the very early spring.

485
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:24,401
Then San is the older brother.

486
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,642
Who cares who is older if we are the same age?

487
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,122
Brothers of all people must care.

488
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,122
Even twins care.

489
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:34,841
You held a sword to my throat

490
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:37,971
Now are you acknowledging me as a brother?

491
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:39,642
What an honour.

492
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:41,321
What...

493
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:44,602
What were you...

494
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:46,921
Why are you over there?

495
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:48,602
I was cleaning the flowerbed.

496
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,401
Who...

497
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,082
is brothers with whom?

498
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,881
You do not look at all alike.

499
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,491
Then...

500
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,682
are you a royal also?

501
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:40,642
Then...

502
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,360
that thing about a sword to the throat...

503
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,682
About that, Dan O...

504
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,011
I was leading Mokinhoe.

505
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,401
I tried to take the throne in Lee Seol's name.

506
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,361
That was when he did not know who I was.

507
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,491
We talked it out since.

508
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:14,281
Wait.

509
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,682
Then Si Yeol.

510
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,241
You knew all this?

511
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:24,441
Well, everyone knows...

512
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,761
I am quick to notice things.

513
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:40,881
Hey, do not...

514
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,361
Lady Hong Ju, come outside.

515
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,161
Why are you here this late?

516
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,162
I have something to show just you.

517
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:02,162
Now is the only time.

518
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,082
Do you see that red star?

519
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:31,801
I have never seen it so close to the full moon.

520
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,491
It is a rare sight indeed.

521
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,361
They look so beautiful together.

522
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,441
But it will disappear soon, right?

523
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,241
Hurry up and make a wish.

524
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:46,721
That rare star will grant your wish and a lot more.

525
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,491
What did you wish for?

526
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:01,011
Do not ask. You should hurry up and make a wish too.

527
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,682
Something you must achieve. Can you not think of anything?

528
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,281
Something I must achieve?

529
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,011
Becoming successful?

530
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:14,241
Stop it, will you?

531
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:23,642
Oh, there you are.

532
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,841
It is your day off tomorrow, right?

533
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:39,921
Yes, I am so glad.

534
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:42,400
I hate hunting.

535
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:44,921
But having to hike... Gosh, I hate it even more.

536
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:47,971
Well... I was wondering...

537
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,761
if I could ask you to switch shifts with me tomorrow.

538
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:54,441
Switch shifts?

539
00:41:55,321 --> 00:41:56,491
Does it have to be me?

540
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,562
I just said I hated hiking. Did you not hear it?

541
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:02,122
Tomorrow is the anniversary of my father's passing.

542
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:03,881
Could you not help me out?

543
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:07,440
Well, you see...

544
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,530
I truly hate hiking...

545
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:11,041
I cleaned the plates for the memorial ceremony.

546
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:13,042
As for food, is there anything else you need?

547
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:14,921
I can pick it up when I go to the market later.

548
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,011
No, I think we have enough food.

549
00:42:20,642 --> 00:42:23,760
Since I could not do it last year, I truly wish to do it this year...

550
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:24,971
Gosh, that is enough.

551
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:27,361
Okay, fine.

552
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:31,010
However, you have to do the same for me when I need to switch shifts.

553
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,082
Yes, anytime. I will gladly switch shifts with you twice...

554
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,162
No, even three times.

555
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,971
What? Three times?

556
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:40,361
You must keep your promise.

557
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:41,721
Yes, you have my word.

558
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,161
A meeting will take place on the 15th of the month.

559
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,281
That day, Lee Seol will reveal himself.

560
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:06,321
That is still a long time away.

561
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:09,281
The situation could change before that.

562
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:14,321
Your Majesty, our soldiers are already fully ready.

563
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:17,642
The deposed heir, Lee Seol, will face his demise...

564
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:20,361
before the month ends.

565
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:22,361
But if he...

566
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:25,441
manages to survive,

567
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,682
will you let me slay you instead?

568
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:32,042
Yes, Your Majesty. I will gladly...

569
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:36,042
let you behead me.

570
00:43:38,122 --> 00:43:39,971
I am counting on you, First Vice-premier.

571
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:50,002
So you believe Assistant Magistrate Jang has caught on?

572
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:51,162
Yes, my lord.

573
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,002
Someone saw Hwa Ryung visiting your residence.

574
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:58,162
Understood. You are dismissed.

575
00:44:25,682 --> 00:44:29,202
You are no longer useful to me.

576
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:49,562
Mokinhoe...

577
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:52,081
What did you say?

578
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:55,721
The First Vice-premier is the one behind Mokinhoe.

579
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:59,121
If you are saying this just to get out of here...

580
00:44:59,122 --> 00:45:02,241
He is using Mokinhoe...

581
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:06,441
to enthrone Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

582
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:10,361
Then...

583
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:13,042
are the Chief Eunuch and Hwa Ryung...

584
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,562
helping him?

585
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:17,841
Yes.

586
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,921
I had bought this house just in case,

587
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:42,642
to prepare for emergencies.

588
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,241
Emergencies?

589
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:48,321
I figured you would need a safe place where you could hide.

590
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:53,202
Those close to me are always exposed to danger.

591
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:55,602
I suppose...

592
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:00,642
it is happening soon.

593
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,522
The big day must be...

594
00:46:07,562 --> 00:46:09,162
right around the corner.

595
00:46:21,202 --> 00:46:22,761
What you are worried about...

596
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,002
If that were to happen,

597
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:35,241
you would not be here.

598
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,602
That is why you prepared all of this in advance.

599
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:46,962
I will be here.

600
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:49,962
Right by your side, just like now.

601
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,761
I did not know that day would come so fast.

602
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:05,721
Is it...

603
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:10,321
happening tomorrow?

604
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:27,082
I figured...

605
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:31,721
you would be so worried if I just disappeared.

606
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,162
Come back before sunset.

607
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:45,721
Let us spend the night together.

608
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:49,401
I will.

609
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,241
I will be back before the moon shines in the sky.

610
00:48:03,202 --> 00:48:04,202
Oh, right.

611
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:08,082
The other day, you asked me...

612
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:10,921
what I wanted to do.

613
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,721
Yes. Have you thought about it?

614
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:17,482
Yes.

615
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:20,522
There is one thing I have always wanted to do...

616
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:23,721
but have not achieved yet.

617
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,241
What is this thing that you have yet to achieve?

618
00:48:29,721 --> 00:48:31,921
Going someplace far...

619
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,522
Going far away.

620
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,281
Far away?

621
00:48:41,602 --> 00:48:42,841
From time to time,

622
00:48:44,082 --> 00:48:46,801
I felt burdened and smothered by Garden of Flowers.

623
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:49,682
No.

624
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,801
Because of my family.

625
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,602
Maybe it was because I was trying so hard with all my might...

626
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:02,042
when I could not even protect them properly.

627
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,522
You see, Si Yeol...

628
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,241
made my sister smile right away.

629
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:12,962
That was when I realized...

630
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:17,962
that my anxiety was the reason my sister got sick...

631
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:22,241
and that living in hiding...

632
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:24,881
is no better than being dead.

633
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,801
Because you anxiously tried to protect her, she's alive now...

634
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:33,761
and could meet Si Yeol too.

635
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,122
Do you truly think so?

636
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,682
Who took him in when he tried to dine and dash?

637
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:46,602
So you wish to go someplace far away.

638
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:49,761
Where do you wish to go?

639
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,921
Well...

640
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,202
It could be anywhere.

641
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:58,841
It would be nice to travel around the country.

642
00:50:00,202 --> 00:50:02,401
And I would happily visit a faraway seaside town.

643
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,002
I see.

644
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,522
I did not know.

645
00:50:12,562 --> 00:50:13,642
I had no idea...

646
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:17,162
how you felt.

647
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:25,881
With you by my side,

648
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,122
the trip will be more enjoyable.

649
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:34,361
But...

650
00:50:37,841 --> 00:50:39,321
being here is just as nice.

651
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:32,881
I will return...

652
00:52:34,522 --> 00:52:35,522
safe and sound.

653
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:22,002
(Garden of Flowers)

654
00:53:28,562 --> 00:53:29,562
Lady Hong Ju.

655
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:32,002
May I enter?

656
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:35,881
Yes, come in.

657
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:54,281
A troupe will be at the marketplace today.

658
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:56,602
I am already excited.

659
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,401
Well, my lady...

660
00:54:00,122 --> 00:54:01,761
What is the matter?

661
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,401
I have been called to an urgent engagement...

662
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:09,562
and must ask that we see the troupe some other time.

663
00:54:10,162 --> 00:54:11,602
How could one argue...

664
00:54:12,562 --> 00:54:13,881
when the engagement is important?

665
00:54:15,482 --> 00:54:16,562
Be on your way, then.

666
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:19,482
I am deeply relieved though.

667
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:29,082
If I had not seen how pretty you look today,

668
00:54:31,162 --> 00:54:32,642
I would have been missing out.

669
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:08,721
I am deeply concerned for your health, Your Majesty.

670
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:21,082
Lower your weapons.

671
00:55:29,562 --> 00:55:30,761
I, Assistant Magistrate Jang Tae Hwa,

672
00:55:31,082 --> 00:55:32,682
approach you with an urgent report.

673
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,602
Hand it here.

674
00:55:41,122 --> 00:55:42,761
As the information concerns Lee Seol,

675
00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:45,841
I would rather pass it along directly.

676
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,721
Since a letter could easily be intercepted,

677
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:01,082
I chose not to write anything.

678
00:56:01,482 --> 00:56:02,841
Intercepted by whom?

679
00:56:04,401 --> 00:56:05,642
First Vice-premier Sin Won Ho.

680
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:09,361
He has been supporting Mokinhoe.

681
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:15,321
Sin Won Ho...

682
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:18,921
hopes to have Lee Seol take the throne.

683
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,522
Chief Eunuch...

684
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:24,682
as well as Queen Dowager also support him,

685
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:28,841
and thus the palace could be crawling with traitors.

686
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:41,761
Could you prove your accusation?

687
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:44,841
I have captured a witness...

688
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,602
whom you can question back at the palace.

689
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:53,162
Your Majesty,

690
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:55,800
I believe information regarding Lee Seol...

691
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:58,122
should also reach my ears.

692
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,721
First Vice-premier.

693
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:05,482
You promised to pay with your life, did you not?

694
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:09,041
That is what I promised...

695
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,562
should I fail to capture Lee Seol within the month.

696
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,401
That is all I needed to hear.

697
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:25,122
Let us return to the palace.

698
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:44,361
They wish to eliminate me...

699
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:47,281
and crown Lee Seol as King?

700
00:57:50,122 --> 00:57:51,721
- Your Majesty! - Go!

701
00:57:52,642 --> 00:57:53,760
Escort His Majesty!

702
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,761
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

703
00:58:04,962 --> 00:58:05,962
You should get going.

704
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,042
I will walk you to the front gate.

705
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:12,682
You show yourself at last, Lee Seol.

706
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,440
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

707
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:57,720
From beginning to end, I am the one to blame.

708
00:59:57,721 --> 00:59:59,800
You murdered my son...

709
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:01,840
and frolicked with his fiancée?

710
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:03,121
Do not forgive me.

711
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:04,880
Resent and loathe me.

712
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,641
If you wish to stay as the innkeeper of Garden of Flowers,

713
01:00:07,642 --> 01:00:09,161
your relationship will come to an end.

714
01:00:09,162 --> 01:00:12,001
Could you live your life not seeing San ever again?

715
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:14,201
Lee Seol, once you eliminate him,

716
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:16,481
I will no longer have a reason to stand here.

717
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:19,440
I promise to be back before sundown.

718
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:21,321
I will not let myself break...

719
01:00:21,642 --> 01:00:23,281
and return to you safe and sound.
