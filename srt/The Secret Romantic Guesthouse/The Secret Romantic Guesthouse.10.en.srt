(Pyeong)

9
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,017
You gasping in shock must mean...

10
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:57,097
that Assistant Magistrate Jang spoke the truth.

11
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:02,658
You dared...

12
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,457
to save the life of the deposed heir Lee Seol.

13
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:24,257
He was just a poor trembling boy?

14
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,617
What? You arrogant broad.

15
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,498
I will charge you with high treason.

16
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:37,337
I was taught that pity...

17
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:39,778
is the root of benevolence.

18
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,698
Even if I had known he was the deposed heir,

19
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,257
I could not have turned him away.

20
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,858
You are a lot like your dead father.

21
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,817
You also refuse to give in.

22
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,218
Did you know...

23
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,578
my father?

24
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,298
Sungkyunkwan scholar Yoon Won.

25
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,897
He was my long-time tutor.

26
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,657
He just saved your life.

27
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:15,578
I cannot punish his daughter...

28
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,978
over something you barely remember.

29
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:22,388
I heard you run an inn in Jungchon.

30
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,298
Yes, I do, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,108
Compared to women who are shut away with their embroidery,

32
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:32,217
you must know how the world works.

33
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:38,388
Come to the palace sometimes and tell me about the world you see.

34
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:41,578
That will do for me.

35
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:55,018
(Episode 10)

36
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:07,177
Her Highness Royal Noble Consort Park.

37
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,897
His Majesty gave you something already.

38
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,978
You must have more skill than a kisaeng.

39
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,098
What is your name?

40
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,057
I am Yoon Dan O.

41
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:22,657
Yoon Dan O.

42
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,897
You do not want me to remember you.

43
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,258
(Pyeong)

44
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,177
This top-knot pin.

45
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:50,378
I recognize it.

46
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,978
Other than Lee Seol, the deposed heir,

47
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,657
the Crown Prince had another son born in secret.

48
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,978
Later, on his return to the palace,

49
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:04,937
he wished to use this to prove his bloodline.

50
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,138
That is correct.

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,138
He is that son.

52
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,777
Do you wish for the same thing?

53
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,578
Are you hoping to...

54
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,258
take the throne as Lee Seol?

55
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:21,097
While I hesitated,

56
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,698
many lost their lives.

57
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,777
If it will bring a stop to the tyranny,

58
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:30,138
I will willingly shoulder the burden.

59
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:32,777
Chief Eunuch.

60
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,417
The choice is yours.

61
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,748
Will you die in the hands of Lee Chang?

62
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,748
Or will you open the door to a new world?

63
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:55,977
Sit.

64
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,938
I will send word through her.

65
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:07,097
Hwa Ryung, I thought you worked for Jang Tae Hwa.

66
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,258
You were backing Mokinhoe?

67
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:13,337
With the hopes that perhaps a kisaeng could one day...

68
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:15,498
have ambitions.

69
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,897
Now I see you look a lot like your mother.

70
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:26,698
You know about my mother?

71
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:30,297
Your father the Crown Prince loved her greatly.

72
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,258
This is the best quality silk.

73
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:51,337
Why would His Majesty give you this?

74
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:55,058
I do not know what he wants either.

75
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,417
We need to talk.

76
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,657
What...

77
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,178
I apologize.

78
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:22,897
I did not want you to worry.

79
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:28,417
Tell me. Why did the King ask to see you?

80
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,776
Well...

81
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:32,178
Do not lie.

82
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,977
I heard you are trying to buy a ticket to Qing.

83
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:39,857
Something serious is going on.

84
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:45,657
Years ago.

85
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,578
My father's funeral. Do you remember the day?

86
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,618
How could I forget?

87
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:56,777
A revolt had happened,

88
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,097
and I was unable to pay my respects.

89
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,777
That night,

90
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,857
a little boy hid into Garden of Flowers.

91
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,977
He hid in the kennel, trembling,

92
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:13,178
and I let him stay the night.

93
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:16,417
The boy said...

94
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,738
his parents had died that day.

95
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:33,498
By chance, was that boy...

96
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:36,977
He was the deposed heir.

97
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:47,297
Does the king know about this?

98
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:51,457
That is why he asked to see you.

99
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,897
To ask who the deposed heir is.

100
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,738
No. He did not ask anything else.

101
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:00,498
He had you come in but did not ask you?

102
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,058
No. He just told me...

103
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,296
to come to the palace again.

104
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,777
To come back again?

105
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,058
That sounds even worse.

106
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,138
The King...

107
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,378
could take your life and those of everyone here at once.

108
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:21,818
Do you know...

109
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,738
who the deposed heir is?

110
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,177
Well...

111
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,467
- I cannot tell you. - Dan O.

112
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,577
I do not want to lie just to escape.

113
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,138
Right now,

114
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,258
could you not just trust me?

115
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,057
My goodness.

116
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:00,577
Oh, dear...

117
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,978
I must find Lee Seol.

118
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:14,468
I need to know if he is dead or alive.

119
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,498
If he is alive,

120
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,777
what will you do?

121
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,978
He is my only family,

122
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,348
since I do not know my birth mother.

123
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:24,978
Right.

124
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,177
You are half-brothers.

125
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,138
But you cannot meet.

126
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:36,577
You could end up fighting him for the throne.

127
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,378
If so, Snowflake would become your enemy,

128
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,378
- and eventually... - I am...

129
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:46,057
not like the King who killed his siblings to come to power.

130
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:50,107
Even if I meet Snowflake, I will not use force.

131
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,498
Then will you meet him and ask him for permission...

132
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,177
to use his name?

133
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,618
Would it not be worse...

134
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,657
if Lee Seol were to appear after I became king?

135
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:04,258
Do not look into what has not yet surfaced.

136
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:06,858
Keep it hidden.

137
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,657
Think about it.

138
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,858
When the real Snowflake appears,

139
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,297
who will be abandoned?

140
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,817
Had I feared being abandoned,

141
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,537
I would not have gotten involved in the first place.

142
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:40,297
Dan O.

143
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:42,537
Dan O!

144
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,777
I am totally fine.

145
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,577
You saw the whole thing.

146
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:09,378
I thought the King might have hurt you...

147
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,777
the moment I took my eyes off you.

148
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:17,297
You are the one who is always right by His Majesty's side,

149
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:19,858
which means you are...

150
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,337
most exposed to danger.

151
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:23,978
It is nothing new to me.

152
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,978
But for you, it is different.

153
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:28,697
Is that why...

154
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,417
you ran here to check in on me?

155
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:35,897
Do you know what I fear more than death?

156
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,657
Losing...

157
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:44,697
another loved one.

158
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:54,817
Do not look at me like that...

159
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,098
and call me a "loved one."

160
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,378
I have been curious.

161
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,817
Do not tell me that you truly do not know.

162
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:10,098
What do you mean?

163
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:12,777
The way you look at me and the things you say.

164
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:15,897
It...

165
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:17,657
makes my heart...

166
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:19,897
Your heart? What?

167
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:27,057
Tell me. Does it make you that uncomfortable?

168
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,617
If I made a mistake...

169
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,098
It makes my heart flutter.

170
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,577
It makes her heart flutter?

171
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,777
My lady.

172
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,458
Are you busy now?

173
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,777
I have a favor to ask of you.

174
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:16,738
My goodness.

175
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:20,098
What a pretty apple.

176
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:22,738
It is pretty, is it not?

177
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,576
I did my best to pick out the prettiest ones.

178
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:29,737
It should have some blemishes if it had to withstand storms.

179
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,377
Look at this shiny, flawless apple.

180
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,777
How could this be?

181
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,417
This is disturbing to look at.

182
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,817
Who is it?

183
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:46,258
The man who disturbed you like this. Who is it, Lady Dan O?

184
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:52,738
You said you had a favor to ask.

185
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,897
Well, it is this.

186
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:03,577
(The Tale of Yeon Yi)

187
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,817
"The Tale of Yeon Yi?"

188
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,937
Yuk Ho gave it to me and said I should read it.

189
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,697
He said it was a fun book.

190
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,498
The thing is, I could not bring myself to tell him...

191
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:17,057
that I could only read a few words.

192
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,978
So you did not tell him that you could not read.

193
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,697
You should have learned to read when I offered to teach you.

194
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,498
My goodness.

195
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:28,817

199
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:40,937
"Even though Yeon Yi..."

200
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:45,057
"tried to push his hand away..."

201
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,577
Please do not do this.

202
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,897
Do you dislike me?

203
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,338
You should not do this.

204
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,138
No...

205
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:10,338
Do not...

206
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,537

209
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:23,417
"to kiss his sweet lips."

210
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:24,817
- That is where you stopped. - What?

211
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,257
Lips... What?

212
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:30,378
My gosh. Did you have to pause at such an important moment?

213
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:34,457
Please. Go on and read the rest to me.

214
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,777
Gosh, I cannot do this. Read it all by yourself.

215
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,137
My gosh, how obscene!

216
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,057
Lady Dan O, what about the kiss?

217
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:41,577
Did they kiss?

218
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,777
Just tell me that before you go, my lady!

00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,057
By the way, Scholar Jung is not in his room.

221
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:54,536
Did he leave early in the morning?

222
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,776
I do not think he came home last night.

223
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,098
Yu Ha did not come home?

224
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:02,176
My gosh. He has never done this before.

225
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,577
I guess he went to the kisaeng house now that the exam is over.

226
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,137
It is about time he had some fun.

227
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:09,977
No way. Yu Ha never visits the kisaeng house.

228
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,258
You never know.

229
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,057
After all, Yu Ha is a man too.

230
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:20,377
- He may look like a softie, but... - Not every man is like you.

231
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:21,378
What?

232
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,138
You are talking as though...

233
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,057
I practically live in the kisaeng house.

234
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,498
Is it not true?

235
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:30,657
You even spent a night with a virgin kisaeng at Buyounggak.

236
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,057
- Hush. - My gosh.

237
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:33,777
San.

238
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,498
You have earned my respect.

239
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,217
Dan O, I told you that it was...

240
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:41,697
My goodness.

241
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,258
I told you that I was just doing a good deed...

242
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:47,537
I explained everything already.

243
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,577
Handsome men are all womanizers.

244
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,338
You see, I was rooting for you, not Yu Ha.

245
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,977
But I should perhaps change sides.

246
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,858
- What... - I am still rooting for you.

247
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,378
I could tell, the moment I met you.

248
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:07,188
You are cool. You are my inspiration.

249
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:08,458
That is not what happened!

251
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,698
What are you doing in my room?

252
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:41,857
How is it, working for the Palace Guards?

253
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,668
Why? Are you going to nag me to quit too?

254
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,056
Dealing with Dan O is stressful enough.

255
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,937
You will not listen to me, so why should I bother?

256
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:49,938
I will not waste my breath.

257
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,188
Get out, will you? I wish to get changed.

258
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,258
You see...

259
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,668
I must say, the uniform does not suit you.

260
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,938
This color is too dull.

261
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,337
It does not complement your good looks.

262
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:09,908
Enough gibberish.

263
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,498
If you have nothing to do, go take a nap.

264
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,777
Do not say you must sleep next to me because you are scared.

265
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,057
What?

266
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,258
I suppose you were disappointed...

267
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,337
that we could not spend the night together.

268
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,057
Right, too bad.

269
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,908
I should have pulled out one of the swords.

270
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,577
I see that your wound has almost healed.

271
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,668
You recover very quickly.

272
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,018
Here.

273
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,907
Are you headed to the gambling den in broad daylight?

274
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,428
Look who is talking.

275
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:45,137
You even slept with a kisaeng.

276
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:47,297
Hey!

277
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:49,908
It has been a while. You are looking great.

278
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,188
I heard you joined the Palace Guards.

279
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,738
Why are you still in Hanyang?

280
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:57,857
You did not return to your hometown?

281
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,297
- Who is he? - I am his childhood friend.

282
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,738
We were best friends.

283
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,097
"Best friends?"

284
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,668
San is socially inept.

285
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,097
I am surprised he has such a friend.

286
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,258
Shut it. Just get going already.

287
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,188
All right.

288
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,908
I shall get going so that you can improve your social skills.

289
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,777
I am busy.

290
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:32,218

292
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,188
I wish to make a glorious return to my hometown,

293
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,908
so I cannot go back empty-handed.

294
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,977
Oh, about what you gave me the last time...

295
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:43,137
I put it to good use.

296
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,427
I will be in touch, so wait to hear from me.

297
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:48,428
I can give you three days.

298
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,908

303

If that was a blade, he would have cut you.

304

306
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,857

Your Majesty, I am concerned for your safety.

308
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:49,218
Would you not be interested in knowing...

309
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:53,738
whether his swordsmanship is comparable to mine?

310
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:56,258
Pick it up.

(Inner Military Office)

312
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:02,178
If we were not training, you would have been cut.

313
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:08,377
Lower your sword this instant.

314
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:27,178
From now on, I ought to train with you.

315
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:32,777
The others always let me win, which is no fun at all.

316
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,498
Allow me.

317
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:56,577
Your demonstration earlier was inspiring.

318
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:00,178
I hope I did not do anything to upset you recently.

319
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,777
How dare a new recruit leave so soon?

320
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:11,377
You should clean the weapons first.

321
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,978
Make sure they are well-polished.

322
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:15,856
There will be an inspection tomorrow.

323
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:18,537
Do you expect us to clean them all?

324
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:19,898
Quiet.

325
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:44,857
What rotten luck.

326
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:47,536
I thought I would get off early,

327
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,537
so I booked an appointment with my real estate agent.

328
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,978
Head home, then. I can handle the rest.

329
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:54,938
Are you sure?

330
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:57,898
But there are so many more to polish.

331
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,057
I am probably the reason we were given this chore.

332
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,738
You should meet with your real estate agent.

333
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:02,978
I appreciate this.

334
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,857

just like other women of this land.

348

it turns out that my father used to be his tutor.

Yes.

359
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:57,857
He must have been upset to hear that the daughter of his tutor...

360
00:26:58,057 --> 00:26:59,337
was running an inn.

361
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:04,018
Could he have summoned you to show you his affection?

362
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:05,978
I doubt it.

00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,458

00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:26,698
and tell me about the world you see.

371
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,577
Every night, he beds a different woman.

372
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,337
You could be next, so be careful.

373
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,218
I see you are here.

374
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,537
Scholar Jung, what prompted this urgent meeting?

375
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:58,977
Could there be an issue with our next gathering?

376
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:01,257
Not at all, but there is something I wish to discuss with you...

377
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:03,137
before the upcoming gathering.

378
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,978
You said we would be discussing Mokinhoe's future plans.

379
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,617
Could it be that you have another strategy in mind?

380
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:12,577
I have a way to overcome this crisis.

381
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:19,577
(Pyeong)

382
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:25,898
I, myself, am the plan of action.

383
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:43,977
(In the Year of Muja, the awakened one will appear.)

384
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:46,218
(He will become a man of virtue and bring peace to the world.)

385
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:54,658
Posters are everywhere in the capital.

386
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:59,137
Everyone is talking about the awakened one and who he may be.

387
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:03,337
"In the Year of Muja, the awakened one will appear."

388
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,258
Lee Seol must soon be making his appearance.

389
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:17,738
Are you all set to leave?

390
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,738
Are you sure about this?

391
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:24,498
What if someone recognizes me?

392
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,178
While you hid away in the annex,

393
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:33,258
the world kept changing.

394
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:38,537
Others will only see you as a scholar with a pretty face.

395
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:43,178
Besides, did you not say that you wanted to help Dan O?

396
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,617
I did.

397
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,458
What will it be, then?

398
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,658
I will only do as you say.

399
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,898
A scholar cannot go back on his word.

400
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,377
I hear that the awakened one is the deposed heir.

401
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,056
Is he still alive?

402
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:06,938
You see, the deposed heir...

403
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:12,617
Your nose will touch the soup any time soon.

404
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:14,377
You should look up.

405
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,458
It is busier than I thought.

406
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,137
It is not even market day.

407
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,577
We are here to tout.

408
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,576
This is the Jungchon entrance,

409
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:26,938
so it tends to be busy.

410
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,337
We should have some rice wine.

411
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,057
I need to relax.

412
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,377
You drink wine?

413
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:39,777
A cup or so when I feel lonely?

414
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:41,817
Dan O has no idea.

415
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,817
(Liquor)

416
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:06,498
At last, I have left cold Hanyang...

417
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,577
to come to my dear hometown.

418
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:11,938
I heard you rented a room.

419
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,698
You must like it.

420
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,898
They provide breakfast and dinner,

421
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:19,817
and even clean the room for you.

422
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,178
Not to mention the incredibly low rent.

423
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,698
I feel the love of a mother...

424
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,698
who considers a scholar's budget too.

425
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,816
How cheap is the rent?

426
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:35,056
Per month, they charge...

427
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:36,576
- They charge? - They charge?

428
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,577
They charge?

429
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:38,817
Three nyang.

430
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:40,337
Three nyang?

431
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,337
Where is that place?

432
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:46,377
The place that...

433
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:48,377
feels like home.

434
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:59,417
Yes. They provide two meals a day, and it is still just three nyang.

435
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,498
Are you sure it is three nyang?

436
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:03,817
It is at the edge of Jungchon.

437
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:05,977
- Oh. - That is why it is cheaper.

438
00:32:05,978 --> 00:32:06,978
I see.

439
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,258
What is the matter, my lord?

440
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:13,178
Did you see someone suspicious?

441
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:14,337
No.

442
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:16,857
I saw a lookalike.

443
00:32:20,297 --> 00:32:21,297
It cannot be her.

444
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,178
(Liquor)

445
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:25,938
Let us go.

446
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,057
You will not regret the visit.

447
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,537
Thank you.

448
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:33,897
I saw a few places today too,

449
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,856
but the rent is so high.

450
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:38,096
Why not head over there right now?

451
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:39,458
Yes, sure.

452
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:47,617
Are you married?

453
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,698
No, not yet.

454
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:51,978
Do not go there.

455
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:54,458
Unless you wish to marry a ghost.

456
00:32:57,898 --> 00:32:58,898
A ghost?

457
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:00,697
That inn is haunted.

458
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,577
By the ghost of an unwed woman...

459
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:03,978
who preys on men.

460
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,336
Do you believe in such rumors?

461
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:09,457
It is not a rumor. There is talk that the eldest daughter...

462
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,857
Do not speak of someone's precious daughter so flippantly.

463
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:16,777
Forget about it if you wish.

464
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,218
What man is so frail?

465
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:21,537
Come along.

466
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:22,857
One glance tells me...

467
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,057
you are not her type.

468
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:28,297
So do not be scared...

469
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:32,418
Then it is all true.

470
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,458
I will not go.

471
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:53,137
Why do you not ask?

472
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:55,777
Ask what?

473
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:57,978
Why I became a ghost...

474
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,698
and lived in the annex.

475
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:03,857
I do not like to ask...

476
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:06,498
and talk freely about the past...

477
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:09,057
one wishes to keep a secret.

478
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,137
So...

479
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,177
I thought you would feel the same.

480
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,458
Do you have...

481
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,378
a painful past as well?

482
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,217
It is cold out.

483
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,978
You fool.

484
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:29,057
Did you invite Hong Ju here?

485
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,617
She will be your daughter-in-law.

486
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:34,097
Please accept her.

487
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,307
Thank you for the food, Lady Hong Ju.

488
00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:51,978
- Thank you. - Thank you.

489
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:57,418
Meat?

490
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:01,498
Abalone?

491
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:03,097
Did you try this?

492
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,898
Yukinhoe will be called to serve soon.

493
00:36:19,498 --> 00:36:20,787
Have them train hard.

494
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:22,307
Yes, my lord.

495
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:32,217
(Successful Candidates)

496
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,857
(Jung Yu Ha)

497
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:37,858
I found it.

498
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:39,897
Your name.

499
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,978
Right here.

500
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:42,937
Yes, I saw it too.

501
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,177
I am so relieved.

502
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,737
I was worried you had ruined your chances.

503
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:49,577
You had been acting strangely.

504
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:52,458
There is a reason for that.

505
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:55,057
What about you, Yuk Ho?

506
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:02,257
Oh, my goodness.

507
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,897
Do not be too disappointed.

508
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:07,656
It is not the first time you have failed.

509
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:08,657
It is there.

510
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:10,787
My name is there.

511
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:12,617
Gosh.

512
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:13,827
Where?

513
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,177
Are you not seeing things?

514
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:20,978
He is right.

515
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,657
"Yuk Yuk Ho."

516
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,657
- Right here. - My gosh.

517
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:30,577
Here.

518
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,177
Right here.

519
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:36,378
Yuk Yuk Ho...

520
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,418
- Oh, dear. - Yuk Ho.

521
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,257
Not now.

522
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,176
You cannot die until you are in office.

523
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,898
You studied for years for this.

524
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:48,978
Oh, you are awake.

525
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,137
Get up.

526
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,897
Now you can do anything you want.

527
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:57,978
You said...

528
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,978
I could do anything.

529
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:02,057
Thank you.

530
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,498
I owe this to you!

531
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:09,418
My gosh.

532
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,498
Oh, dear.

533
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:15,378
I made it!

534
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,938
We should cook up a feast tonight.

535
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:21,257
This is such a great day.

536
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:23,857
I would be much happier...

537
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:25,577
if Si Yeol would come around.

538
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,257
Me too.

539
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:29,577
I wonder what he is up to today.

540
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,787
Will he be gambling?

541
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,898
(Garden of Flowers)

542
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:43,577
Who are you?

543
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:49,898
(Gwang Pavilion)

544
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,307
I can tell by your face.

545
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:32,418
Pardon?

546
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:34,498
This is boring because we bet nothing.

547
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,137
Betting something on a game...

548
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:39,827
makes it worth playing.

549
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,097
I have very many things.

550
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,137
What will you bet?

551
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:49,347
Will you bet Garden of Flowers?

552
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:01,978
I was joking.

553
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:04,577
Try and beat me,

554
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:06,217
and I will reward you greatly.

555
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:12,177
In that case,

556
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:18,858
I will bet my life on this stone.

557
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:21,418
You are in too deep.

558
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:23,826
You should be careful.

559
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:25,697
You must enter deeply into your enemy's territory,

560
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,097
or you will never win.

561
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,787
I lost.

562
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:42,347
It was fun though.

563
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,097
Why is she smiling like that?

564
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:59,657
The Palace Guards should take her home today.

565
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,097
Yes, Your Majesty.

566
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,787
We will do this again soon.

567
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:13,617
San, you take her home.

568
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,346
You may leave early today.

569
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,978
Yes, sir.

570
00:41:27,978 --> 00:41:31,697
Your Majesty, a poster has been put up in the capital district.

571
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:35,177
The deposed heir is closing in on us.

572
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:38,137
Why are you just watching Yoon Dan O?

573
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:41,057
She is not one to easily give in to threats.

574
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:45,257
She said she did not regret saving the deposed heir's life.

575
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,307
How dare she say such a thing in front of me?

576
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:51,536
However, I am certain that...

577
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:53,826
she knows something about Snowflake.

578
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:55,137
Hence, he must be afraid.

579
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:59,257
His fear will grow as Yoon Dan O and I become closer.

580
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:01,858
Wait for now.

581
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:06,177
Lee Seol will have no choice but to find that girl himself.

582
00:42:06,898 --> 00:42:08,827
The watchman might step in.

583
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:12,617
And if he kills Yoon Dan O,

584
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,577
Snowflake will slip away yet again.

585
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:21,938
The watchman will not be able to go ahead and take her life.

586
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:25,217
After all, he gave her his father's keepsake.

587
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,537
That is how much he cherishes her.

588
00:42:32,418 --> 00:42:34,378
(Capital District Office)

589
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:50,018
You.

590
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:52,827
You are Kang San's friend.

591
00:42:54,257 --> 00:42:55,347
Why are you here?

592
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:03,616
How did you buy the position?

593
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:04,858
Where did you get the money?

594
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,938
Forgive me. I must have been out of my mind.

595
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:10,097
I have failed every state exam that I took...

596
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:12,257
Just answer my question.

597
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:14,536
Please spare me.

598
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:16,737
You were Kang San's reference.

599
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,307
Did it have something to do with him?

600
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:22,858
That is...

601
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,347
Yes, Kang San!

602
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,657
He was the one who gave me the money.

603
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:29,306
He gave me the money in return for hiding the fact...

604
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,827
that he was adopted.

605
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:32,257
Please spare me!

606
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:46,097
Were you not afraid?

607
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:49,257
His Majesty could change his mind at any time.

608
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:53,537
He did not, thankfully.

609
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:55,577
That much, I could tell.

610
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:59,418
What did you say to him that he gave you all these things?

611
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:03,378
I am just good at playing Go, that is all.

612
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:06,498
That is not all. You also smiled a lot at him.

613
00:44:07,257 --> 00:44:08,298
Pardon me?

614
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:12,137
You kept smiling at him nonstop.

615
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:14,338
I saw it.

616
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:17,858
I did not smile that much.

617
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:22,858
With those eyes...

618
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:26,978
Do not smile at every man you see.

619
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:37,257
Where are you going again? It is late.

620
00:44:39,818 --> 00:44:42,257
Nothing happened at the palace, right?

621
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:43,858
Yes, nothing happened.

622
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:45,938
I kept a watchful eye on them all day.

623
00:44:47,057 --> 00:44:49,498
I am relieved that she has you by her side.

624
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:50,697
You know...

625
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:53,458
Remember the book you took?

626
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:56,498
Did you throw it out?

627
00:44:57,018 --> 00:44:58,018
Yes.

628
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:00,177
I told you I would.

629
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,817
I threw it into the furnace.

630
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:05,177
No way. You actually burned it? All of it?

631
00:45:05,418 --> 00:45:08,778
Why? Was there something precious in it?

632
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,338
Did you...

633
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,577
open it?

634
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:15,338
Did you see what was inside?

635
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:17,737
No, I did not.

636
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:19,898
Why bother? I knew what it was about.

637
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,458
I burned it to ashes right away.

638
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:32,137
(Garden of Flowers)

639
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:45,498
Hong Ju.

640
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:49,137
There is a female physician named Yeon Yi.

641
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:52,216
Who is Yeon Yi? Is she your new friend?

642
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,778
No, she is a character in a romance novel.

643
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:57,097
It is not my story.

644
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,537
You see, Yeon Yi is...

645
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:03,577
in love with a military officer.

646
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,338
A female physician and a military officer?

647
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:08,898
He is certainly out of her league.

648
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:13,537
And he lives a dangerous life.

649
00:46:14,577 --> 00:46:16,938
He could die in war anytime.

650
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,298
If they lose the war,

651
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,177
Yeon Yi and even her family could be dragged away as prisoners.

652
00:46:27,338 --> 00:46:29,737
They should not be together, right?

653
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:33,378
They will just end up hurting each other.

654
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:38,137
Regardless of whom she fancies,

655
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:41,778
she will regret it later if she gives up without even trying.

656
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:44,137
That is true.

657
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:48,137
She will regret it, indeed.

658
00:46:57,697 --> 00:46:58,778
This will not do.

659
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:04,978
I should drink this today.

660
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:07,898
You knew there was wine in that bottle?

661
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:10,617
I know everything about you.

662
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:16,097
Fine. Drink up and forget everything.

663
00:47:16,898 --> 00:47:18,378
Stop thinking about the family too.

664
00:47:21,737 --> 00:47:23,378
Focus only on your heart.

665
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:26,818
Only think about yourself.

666
00:47:28,217 --> 00:47:29,338
Only myself?

667
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:45,577
Here is the fund you asked for.

668
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:49,537
Your Highness.

669
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:53,778
Rumors say that the deposed heir is the awakened one.

670
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:57,057
They say Mokinhoe is backing him.

671
00:47:57,978 --> 00:47:59,217
Mokinhoe?

672
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,898
See if you can find out who is leading Mokinhoe.

673
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:05,177
Yes, Your Highness.

674
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:08,657
Anyway,

675
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,137
what were you thinking about?

676
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:16,177
What is the King really thinking?

677
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,857
He keeps calling Dan O to the palace...

678
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,497
but would not ask her anything.

679
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,617
Lady Dan O knows who you are.

680
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,298
- If she tells him... - No, she will not.

681
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:28,778
Dan O would never do that.

682
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,257
We must expedite things.

683
00:48:41,137 --> 00:48:42,898
I have a question for you.

684
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:46,617
Are there times when the King is not escorted by the Palace Guards?

685
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:49,418
According to the Palace Guards Log Book,

686
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:51,818
it was for about half a day.

687
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:55,696
For top-secret undercover inspections,

688
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:57,737
the Chief of the Palace Guards would be the only one accompanying him.

689
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:01,137
Such undercover inspections are not recorded.

690
00:49:01,217 --> 00:49:03,818
It was the last day of December and the 15th day of June.

691
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,697
The exorcism ritual takes place on the last day of December.

692
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:08,938
And the harvest ritual on the 15th day of June.

693
00:49:09,818 --> 00:49:12,697
He could not have left the palace for the rituals.

694
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:15,136
Then why...

695
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:16,257
I heard...

696
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:20,177
the King was obsessed with shamanism.

697
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:24,298
Do you think he leaves the palace in disguise to see a shaman?

698
00:49:24,617 --> 00:49:25,657
In disguise...

699
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:27,737
That is our chance.

700
00:49:29,498 --> 00:49:30,938
Kim Hwan, the Chief of the Palace Guards.

701
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:33,378
If we take him down,

702
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:35,898
we can reach the King.

703
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:50,378
What are you doing, sitting in front of my room?

704
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:57,537
Hi, San.

705
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:03,378
I smell alcohol.

706
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,818
How much did you drink?

707
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:11,418
Well, I had a glass of wine.

708
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:15,537
I was worried...

709
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:18,177
and I had a lot on my mind.

710
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:29,978
I know.

711
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:32,217
My existence alone...

712
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:35,978
is a huge burden you have to carry.

713
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,457
Yu Ha...

714
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:43,737
I have no idea where he goes every night.

715
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,458
As for Yuk Ho,

716
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:50,096
I worry about him...

717
00:50:50,097 --> 00:50:51,697
receiving a government position at the age of 60.

718
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,978
And Si Yeol...

719
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:56,818
Gosh.

720
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:58,657
I worry about...

721
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:01,898
every aspect of his life.

722
00:51:03,818 --> 00:51:05,737
And what about Hong Ju?

723
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,577
Have you ever seen a ghost that lively before?

724
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:13,938
She is forced to stay in the annex all day.

725
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:18,498
My poor sister.

726
00:51:23,257 --> 00:51:24,418
And Ms. Naju...

727
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:28,498
is a terrible cook.

728
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:29,938
She cannot cook,

729
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:31,737
but she keeps cooking.

730
00:51:33,097 --> 00:51:34,818
What is the matter with her?

731
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:42,057
You seem highly intoxicated.

732
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:43,617
In you go.

733
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:47,097
And then...

734
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:55,257
there is you.

735
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:03,617
This face of yours...

736
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:06,657
is the worst.

737
00:52:08,898 --> 00:52:10,577
Do you dislike me that much?

738
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,498
Do you dislike me?

739
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,457
You grew up...

740
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,617
leading a sorrowful life among the public.

741
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:19,978
I believe in that sorrow.

742
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:21,616
A world where the poor and the lowly...

743
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:23,657
can also aspire and reach their goals.

744
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:26,617
Is that not the world Mokinhoe aims for?

745
00:53:34,498 --> 00:53:36,057
(Pyeong)

746
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:44,056
If you choose to stand at today's gathering,

747
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:45,938
you will have to live your life as Lee Seol forever.

748
00:53:47,498 --> 00:53:49,097
Here is your last chance.

749
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:51,737
If you have doubts,

750
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,257
this is where you pull out.

751
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,898
I will not regret this.

752
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:19,256
Who sent this?

753
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,497
He said you would know...

754
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:21,697
if I told you it was from an old friend.

755
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,897
By 4pm today, come to...

756
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:46,978
the west riverside reed field with my money.

757
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:48,777
Keep your promise,

758
00:54:48,778 --> 00:54:50,338
and I will head back home immediately.

759
00:55:45,737 --> 00:55:47,338
Are you here to meet someone?

760
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,217
Could it be your friend from Jecheon?

761
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:08,778
San of the Jinju Kang clan.

762
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,697
You have been living a lie.

763
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:14,577
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

764
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,298
How could I have joined the Palace Guards...

765
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:19,577
if I was not who I said I was?

766
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,977
My friend must have been mistaken...

767
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,298
He confessed.

768
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,257
So what is your real name?

769
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:35,537
Every man here...

770
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:38,498
will die.

771
00:56:39,177 --> 00:56:40,177
What?

772
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:43,498
Once you hear who I am, that is.

773
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:46,858
Do you still...

774
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,458
want to hear the name?

775
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:49,858
Such audacity.

776
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:51,577
The only one who will die here...

777
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:53,616
is you.

778
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:54,617
Stand down.

779
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:57,418
- If you do not... - Answer me.

780
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,177
Are you the deposed heir Lee Seol?

781
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:05,737
You are.

782
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:08,617
You were Lee Seol all along.

783
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:25,657
The watchman.

784
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,378
Attack!

785
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:26,537
Show...

786
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:29,818
your face.

787
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:34,458
That is an order.

788
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:15,338
It is my pleasure...

789
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:17,737
to greet my king.

790
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:32,257
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

791
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:52,417
I have been curious ever since I first met you.

792
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:55,136
I have lived my life shadowing yours.

793
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:57,576
The leader of Mokinhoe called himself Lee Seol...

794
00:59:57,577 --> 00:59:58,897
and stood before the scholars.

795
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,136
I cannot pretend...

796
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:02,217
that nothing ever happened.

797
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:03,978
Write it all down.

798
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:05,857
Everything you have missed out on.

799
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:07,577
Why is that? Will you make them happen for me?

800
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:11,217
There is no way of knowing how Lee Seol will approach me.

801
01:00:11,418 --> 01:00:12,418
Your task is to identify him.

802
01:00:12,419 --> 01:00:14,858
Did you just say that Seol has been captured?

803
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:17,177
Protect everyone at Garden of Flowers.

804
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:19,057
That includes you.
