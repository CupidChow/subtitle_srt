(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,839
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,960
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,398
He is here. The watchman.

9
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,038
I waited to see you...

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,279
There were two swordsmen.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,758
The slayer has stopped dropping bodies?

12
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,239
Or was he not the watchman?

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,559
I heard one of the scholars at Garden of Flowers...

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,798
was preparing for the military exam.

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,999
His name is Kang San.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,959
I wish to know where he was born and raised. Find out everything.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,769
Are you still asleep?

18
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,279
I have a gift before I leave.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,048
Next time, we should walk together.

20
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,079
No.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,719
Do not bring things like this again.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,598
Thanks to your care of the Mokinhoe scholars,

23
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,599
everyone is well.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,158
What could he possibly want with me?

25
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,839
Ask him yourself.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,158
I only serve one entity...

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,798
and that is this nation.

28
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,639
I urge you to serve the noble cause.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,798
It seems as though...

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,318
- Dan O was taken - What did you say?

31
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,999
- What is it? - A compass.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,919
This belonged to the deposed crown prince.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,759
Did you dare to toy with me?

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,959
Just kill me.

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,839
I will pay her debt. Release Dan O.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,919
Do you still believe that I am the watchman?

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,279
The day I pass the exam and receive the flower hat,

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,318
I will tell you everything.

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,279
Split them into teams and let them have group matches.

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,559
You managed to relieve my boredom.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,878
For that, I will grant your request.

42
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,399
I wish to serve you in close proximity.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,199
As a member of the Palace Guards?

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,078
I will serve you with sincerity.

45
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,359
You finished in first place.

46
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,119
You passed the exam in the first place,

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
so it is time to keep your promise.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,560
This. What am I seeing?

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,439
Back then,

50
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,810
I said I would tell you who I am...

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,530
when we met again.

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
More than a decade ago,

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
the terrified boy who hid in that kennel...

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,000
was me.

55
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,199
I...

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,719
I am Lee Seol.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,719
(Pyeong)

58
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,560
What...

59
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,240
did you just say?

60
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,439
You are...

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,199
Lee Seol?

62
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,039
The reason...

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,840
I was unable to tell you until now...

64
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,639
Who is this?

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,479
My gosh. That is a flower hat.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,159
You came in first place.

67
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,039
My goodness.

68
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,919
Gosh.

69
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,360
(Episode 9)

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Gosh.

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,799
You do not look too well, Young Master Kang.

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,960
He is still on a high after the exam.

73
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,560
His Majesty himself attended.

74
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
You are the pride of this inn.

75
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,078
It has been years since anyone passed.

76
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,360
Am I wrong, Dan O?

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,959
No, you are not.

78
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,359
May I try on that flower hat?

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,610
I can feel the good energy.

80
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,680
- Try it on. - Thanks.

81
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,000
Then...

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
How do I look? Does it suit me?

83
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,239
We have another successful scholar.

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
It suits you tremendously.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,078
I have a good feeling this time.

86
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,198
I wrote my answer without pause.

87
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,680
Should I contact my family and have them slaughter a pig?

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,729
Please, just pass the exam...

89
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,050
and I will bring home a wild boar for you.

90
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,519
Oh, dear. Here, take it back.

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,919
Scholar Jung, I am sure you did well in the exam also?

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,759
I think I did reasonably well.

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,119
Did you not return with Si Yeol?

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Do not even ask.

95
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,120
- That fool... - What about me?

96
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,360
Hey, you.

97
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,959
Why did you run off halfway through the exam?

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,559
I did not run off.

99
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,438
The topic bored me, so I turned in my answer early.

100
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,479
Your sheet was blank, with not a single drop of ink on it.

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,079
The blank sheet was my answer.

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,519
There is more to life than correct answers.

103
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
You are helpless.

104
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,319
San, you have decided to dress more flamboyantly since we last met.

105
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,160
As if you came first.

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,519
- May I be excused? - Yes.

107
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Goodness.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,279
My gosh.

109
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,399
We are alone here. You can speak freely.

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
I still...

111
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
cannot believe it.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,079
That you are Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

113
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,879
It is a great relief...

114
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,439
that you are alive and well.

115
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,279
What...

116
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,920
Did you...

117
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,279
keep it inside all your life?

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
How did you manage, all alone, all this while?

119
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,519
Dan O.

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,680
I wished so badly that...

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
you would no longer be chased.

122
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,450
I get it now.

123
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,000
How foolish what I did was.

124
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,090
I brought you to Garden of Flowers...

125
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,210
only to put a noose around your neck.

126
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,120
Even if you had not run off with my bag,

127
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,000
we would have met again.

128
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,519
At the tavern that day,

129
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,519
we did not meet by chance.

130
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,090
I had missed you for a long time,

131
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
and had come to find you.

132
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,840
Please tell me...

133
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,600
what your plan for the future is.

134
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,159
There must be a reason you want a title.

135
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,840
You promised that...

136
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,519
you would tell me everything the day you passed the exam.

137
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,519
My path leads to the palace.

138
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,159
Why did you suddenly...

139
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,639
I was on the run my whole life,

140
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,399
but I am heir to the throne.

141
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,480
I will join the Palace Guards and condemn the King myself.

142
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,519
What if doing that exposes your identity?

143
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,518
You will lose the life you fought so hard to preserve.

144
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,679
You risked your life to preserve Garden of Flowers.

145
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,759
I am doing the same.

146
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
I want to protect my home, the palace.

147
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,120
From a traitor blinded by greed.

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,330
You will be surrounded by enemies in the palace.

149
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,158
Could you please change your mind?

150
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,559
Both my father and mother are dead,

151
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,279
and my father's followers...

152
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,000
had their families wiped out.

153
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,759
I cannot turn away from them...

154
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
just to save my own skin.

155
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
That is why I have stayed alive,

156
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,039
and it is also...

157
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,600
my duty as heir.

158
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,080
Even so,

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
it is too dangerous.

160
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,679
You saved my life.

161
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,039
I will not waste it in vain.

162
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,720
Do not worry.

163
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
Bring your heirloom.

164
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,039
The proof of your bloodline...

165
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,200
the Crown Prince left you.

166
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,120
(Crown Prince Lee Pyeong)

167
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,960
This is Crown Prince Lee Pyeong's request to his son...

168
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,480
and the proof of your bloodline.

169
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,639
Once I ascend the throne and stabilize the political situation,

170
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,320
I will call you back to the palace.

171
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,399
Stay strong and survive until then.

172
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,840
The only thing I can give you now is the name, nothing else.

173
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,079
My son, Gyeom.

174
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,519
(Lee Pyeong)

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,039
(Pyeong)

176
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,960
(Buyounggak)

177
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
You are Jang, the merchant.

178
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Yes, I am.

179
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,320
I am looking for a ship going to Qing.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
I was wondering if you had a vacant spot on yours.

181
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,399
A vacant spot?

182
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,599
What is this for?

183
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
I will pay you handsomely.

184
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,600
If there is, please contact me at Garden of Flowers in Jungchon.

185
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Sure, I will.

186
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,559
She asked Jang to look for a ship for her.

187
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,440
Yoon Dan O is trying to go to Qing?

188
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Thank you for letting me know.

189
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,960
Continue to keep a watchful eye on her.

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,240
Yes, my lord.

191
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,320
At this rate, you will soon lose your lowly status and level up.

192
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,759
You just need to find Lee Seol.

193
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,039
Lee Seol?

194
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,200
You mean, the deposed heir?

195
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,279
So you have heard of his name before too.

196
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,240
I have heard some rumors.

197
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,159
I did hear that the deposed heir has not been caught yet.

198
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,200
If you change your mind,

199
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
come back anytime.

200
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,719
You are hiding for you do not want to be a burden.

201
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,079
You are being such a coward.

202
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,999
A coward? I am doing it for Dan O's sake...

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
No, it is not for her sake.

204
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,398
You are guilt-tripping her...

205
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,279
just so that you could feel better.

206
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,080
Dan O will beat herself up for not being able to protect her sister.

207
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,240
If I were Dan O,

208
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,320
my one and only sister...

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
would never be a burden to me.

210
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,919
She would give me the strength to carry on.

211
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,120
Knowing that you wish to return to the palace...

212
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,039
I am concerned.

213
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,679
Since we both survived,

214
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,559
we ought to do our duty.

215
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,759
As...

216
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
the Crown Prince's bodyguard,

217
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,840
I did not take my own life when my master passed away...

218
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,120
because the Crown Prince ordered me to protect you, Your Highness.

219
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Please...

220
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,480
stay safe.

221
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I will.

222
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Once you enter the palace, you are on your own.

223
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,000
The watchman is highly capable,

224
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,679
but he will struggle to beat the royal guards and enter the palace.

225
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,440
I must meet the watchman. Can you find him?

226
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,839
But why? The watchman is...

227
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Dan O has figured out...

228
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,559
who I am.

229
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,279
If the watchman finds out,

230
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
he will think it could pose a threat to my safety,

231
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,599
so he might try to hurt her.

232
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
I do not know where the watchman is now.

233
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,158
I cannot track him down either.

234
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,159
Then...

235
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,440
what should I do about Dan O?

236
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,678
No one is more endangered than you are now, Your Highness.

237
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,039
I am used to it.

238
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
However,

239
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,879
Dan O is not.

240
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
(Garden of Flowers)

241
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,720
Why are you running?

242
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,759
It was you.

243
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,559
I thought someone was following me.

244
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,920
Why are you out and about so late at night?

245
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,119
Let us go inside.

246
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,359
Okay.

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,240
Were you that anxious?

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
You started running, looking terrified.

249
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Master Jang...

250
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,039
might still have some people tailing me.

251
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,519
Dan O.

252
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,960
What if I give in to his threats...

253
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,000
and expose everything?

254
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,119
- If that happens... - Even if that happens,

255
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,118
I will not resent you.

256
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,920
You absolutely should not join the Palace Guards.

257
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,000
I implore you to think about it again.

258
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,720
Once your real identity is exposed,

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,079
you will not be the only one getting hurt.

260
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,920
The others at Garden of Flowers too...

261
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,440
Everyone will die.

262
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,359
Just leave and go somewhere far away.

263
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,038
I am looking for a ship going to Qing.

264
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,200
If anyone in the family is put in danger,

265
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,759
I will leave without looking back once.

266
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,319
Trust me.

267
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,890
I will never do anything to endanger you or the family.

268
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,599
But you should still be very careful for the time being.

269
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,559
And do not go out by yourself at night like you did today.

270
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,650
If possible, refrain from going out altogether.

271
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,359
It is not like your house will never be broken into if you lock the door.

272
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Thieves...

273
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,680
will jump over the wall if they must.

274
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,279
I wish I could build a tall wall that reaches the sky...

275
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,839
so that no one can dare to jump over it.

276
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,650
Who are you? You cannot enter this area.

277
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Lady Hong Ju.

278
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,410
What is going on?

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I...

280
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,680
I am back.

281
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Truly?

282
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,279
Then can we be together now?

283
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,960
You were right.

284
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,799
I wanted to run away from everything...

285
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,680
because I hated myself for not being able to help anyone.

286
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
You helped me, just now.

287
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,410
Sorry?

288
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,839
Seeing your face...

289
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,119
melted all my worries away.

290
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,559
In any case,

291
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,920
you have gotten quite manly.

292
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,650
I came here disguised as a man for I did not want to get caught.

293
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,279
It must look awkward.

294
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,650
It suits you.

295
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,839
You look like you are my best friend of ten years.

296
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,519
How about we have some rice wine at the tavern?

297
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,359
I have not even seen Dan O and Ms. Naju yet.

298
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,920
When I got here, there was nobody here.

299
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,650
Oh, then I should not be standing around.

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,079
I will go find them now.

301
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,119
My lady.

302
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,170
You are back.

303
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,359
Let us sit down.

304
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,920
You came all the way here by yourself?

305
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,038
Gosh. Why did you not ask me to come and get you?

306
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,839
I would have run over to where you were.

307
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,680
I got here safe and sound.

308
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,000
I dressed as a man just in case.

309
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,359
My gosh, Young Master.

310
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,519
You must have made a few women cry on your way here.

311
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,920
You are truly back, right?

312
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,319
You are not going to suddenly disappear, are you?

313
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,440
No, I am not going anywhere.

314
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,319
I will find what I can do around here.

315
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,838
No longer will I be a burden to you.

316
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,519
I have said this numerous times, but you have never been a burden.

317
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,000
I am thrilled to have you back.

318
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,919
Come here. Allow me to give you a hug.

319
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,759
My gosh.

320
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,358
How about we sleep together in the annex tonight?

321
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,440
Why not?

322
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,920
Sit tight, then. I will grab our comforters.

323
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,759
So that compass was given to you by the deposed heir?

324
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,559
No wonder.

325
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,240
You seemed odd during Dad's funeral,

326
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,680
but I brushed it off thinking you were still in denial.

327
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,160
But that was not the case.

328
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,640
What should I do?

329
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,359
I should probably do something,

330
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,599
but there is nothing I can do.

331
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,720
All I can do is wish for him to be safe.

332
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,799
He has been on the run all his life.

333
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,799
When it comes to surviving, no one will be more capable.

334
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,599
Do you really think so?

335
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,759
Of course.

336
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,119
I am sure of it.

337
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,239
Why are you looking at me like that?

338
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,960
We are proud to see you as a member of the Palace Guards.

339
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,839
Who knew that a man of talent was here at Garden of Flowers?

340
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,440
Won would have been so proud.

341
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,759
Could he have wanted you as his son-in-law?

342
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,039
Yuk Ho, you and your jokes.

343
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,200
Gosh.

344
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,639
Si Yeol, it is not like you to be this quiet.

345
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,759
I do not even know where to start.

346
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,720
Maybe I should start with this.

347
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,319
His Majesty is highly strung and can be violent.

348
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,839
It is why rookie palace guards quit within three months.

349
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,160
San is not like the average man, so I am sure he will stay strong.

350
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,079
Is that a compliment or a curse in disguise?

351
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,799
- A compliment. - He must be encouraging me...

352
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,200
in his own way. Am I right?

353
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,518
You will be late on your first day at this rate.

354
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,798
Off you go.

355
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
I will get going, then.

356
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,599
You are serious about going to the palace.

357
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,839
I will return home safely.

358
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,720
Your Majesty, please shut down the risky expansion of the palace.

359
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,720
You have recruited farmers during farming season.

360
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,319
And to cover the necessary cost,

361
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,118
you even raised the interest rate on the grain we lend.

362
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,119
First Vice-premier.

363
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,598
(Hwangok: Grains are lent and then returned with interest)

364
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,680
Do tell me.

365
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,119
Must I terminate this project?

366
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,559
The purpose of this project is to uphold royal authority.

367
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,240
The people must comply as it is their duty.

368
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,119
Driving the people to poverty and draining their assets...

369
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,039
will result in a disaster.

370
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,078
I fear that the people might protest...

371
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,119
and start a rebellion.

372
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,960
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,160
"The Secret Records of Samhan."

374
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,680
In it, it is written like so.

375
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
"When the people rebel like burning flames,"

376
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,480
"a wise man from the east will be crowned as king."

377
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,519
By the looks of it,

378
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,640
you must also be a member of Mokinhoe.

379
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,039
How else could you have the audacity...

380
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,358
to speak such ludicrous words?

381
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,480
Your Majesty, you have me wrong.

382
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,439
I was only advising you as a member...

383
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,039
of the Office of the Inspector General.

384
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,839
I am not with Mokinhoe.

385
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,440
You have me wrong.

386
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,960
Lord Sin, please say something.

387
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,838
You of all people know...

388
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,960
that I am not a part of Mokinhoe.

389
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,279
Come hither!

390
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,200
Take him away this instant.

391
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,078
On grounds of treason, annihilate his family and in-laws.

392
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,160
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,640
Your Majesty, please.

394
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,278
Your Majesty.

395
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,279
Lord Sin.

396
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,920
Lord Sin!

397
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,480
It has you suspicious, does it not?

398
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,720
You saw the way Dan O looked at Scholar Kang.

399
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,799
There seemed to be a strong bond between them.

400
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,159
We should prepare for a wedding that is soon to come.

401
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,960
Well, I stand by what I have always said.

402
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,838
Rather than swordsmen,

403
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,759
I prefer scholars who write their battles.

404
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,959
And Scholar Jung...

405
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,558
will move on to do great things.

406
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,078
I am also a scholar who writes my battles.

407
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,440
Why you only mentioned Yu Ha is beyond me.

408
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,240
I mentioned him as a suitor for Dan O.

409
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,000
I must say I am curious as to how you think of me.

410
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Goodness.

411
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,559
You failed to pass the state exam,

412
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,079
and the years have not been kind to you.

413
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,039
For that, I feel sorry.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,279
What... My gosh.

415
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,598
I will pass the state exam in first place...

416
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,599
and become the bachelor everyone wants to court.

417
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,200
Master Jang has asked to see you.

418
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,759
Me? What for?

419
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,119
Shall we?

420
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,720
I heard the first literary exam took place recently.

421
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,480
You must hope to serve this time around.

422
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,519
I doubt you summoned me out of concern for my career.

423
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
What did you want to say to me?

424
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,839
Yuk Ho,

425
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,000
you are the elder to those at Garden of Flowers.

426
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,038
Are you aware that Dan O looked for the deposed heir...

427
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,559
in hopes of keeping Garden of Flowers?

428
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,319
I heard she did not find him.

429
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,000
She found him,

430
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,319
and she knows who Lee Seol is.

431
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,519
It is why she wishes to flee to Qing.

432
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,558
That is preposterous. How could Dan O have...

433
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,759
If Dan O flees...

434
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,359
to protect the identity of Lee Seol,

435
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,479
she...

436
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,240
and her entire family will be executed.

437
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,640
You also studied under Yoon Won.

438
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,278
Will you sit idly by...

439
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,920
and watch your mentor's daughter be executed for treason...

440
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,440
and her family be annihilated?

441
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,839
Inform me the second you learn of Lee Seol's identity.

442
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,079
Do so, and I will provide you...

443
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,079
with a government position.

444
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,559
Grandmother awaits us. Please hurry.

445
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,118
Do not run.

446
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,960
You do not wish to get hurt.

447
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
Here.

448
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,119
How heavy he weighs tells me that our son is all grown up.

449
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
(Palace Guards Log Book)

450
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,200
It was you as I thought.

451
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,000
It is nice to see you here.

452
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,319
It is me, Yoon Gu Nam.

453
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,319
We met during the exam.

454
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,159
I am the one who threw the pole to you.

455
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,039
Right. I remember now.

456
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,319
Of course.

457
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,960
Did you also join the Palace Guards?

458
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,440
It happened that way.

459
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,160
The two of us showed great teamwork during the exam.

460
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,680
Although, I must take 80 percent of the credit.

461
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,839
This is the layout of the palace.

462
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,839
Memorize it by tomorrow.

463
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,919
(Palace Layout)

464
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,880
Are we supposed to memorize all the buildings in one day?

465
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,440
You are here to protect and serve His Majesty.

466
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,880
One cannot afford even a single mistake.

467
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,839
For each mistake,

468
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,920
you will be beaten once.

469
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,680
Follow me to the Royal Office.

470
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,119
I wondered why things were going so smoothly.

471
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,558
I will get sores on my first day.

472
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,959
Follow me quietly.

473
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Yes, sir.

474
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
You.

475
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
That glare.

476
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,839
I like it very much.

477
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,599
It looks familiar, as if I saw it for years.

478
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,839
How dare you?

479
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,599
Lower your gaze.

480
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,400
So, where is your family from?

481
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,119
I am a Kang from Jinju.

482
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,039
Did the wound you sustain heal up?

483
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
It is much better.

484
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,599
Good.

485
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
This is...

486
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,160
my older brother's compass.

487
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,680
I got it from Yoon Dan O,

488
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,920
The innkeeper of Garden of Flowers in Jungchon.

489
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Yoon Dan O?

490
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,079
Who is she and why did she have this?

491
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,480
Over ten years ago, during Yoon Won's funeral,

492
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,759
deposed heir Lee Seol hid into Garden of Flowers,

493
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,720
and she let him stay the night. She confessed to me...

494
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,839
that she received it...

495
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,599
as a token of gratitude.

496
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Wait.

497
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,440
Yoon Won's funeral?

498
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,000
It was the day I revolted.

499
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Yes.

500
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,880
That is so.

501
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,799
How interesting.

502
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,680
Yoon Won's daughter is acquainted with the deposed heir.

503
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,440
(Pyeong)

504
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,000
How much do you know about my father, Hwa Ryung?

505
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:14,360
I do not know much.

506
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,769
You have not...

507
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,769
met His Highness,

508
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,519
have you?

509
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,289
I have.

510
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,719
I thought I had not,

511
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,559
but I had.

512
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Get up.

513
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,000
I apologize.

514
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,079
Who are you?

515
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Take care.

516
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,840
From now on, you must protect yourself.

517
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:14,769
Do you understand?

518
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,719
That was the day I was sent to Lord Jung Yoon.

519
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,079
A boy servant who carried manure at Prince Geumryeong's residence...

520
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,289
became a noble's illegitimate son.

521
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,599
It was a joyful day for me.

522
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,519
But...

523
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,769
that man had such sad eyes.

524
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
He was...

525
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,289
the Crown Prince.

526
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,960
You do resent him?

527
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,639
Shortly after I was adopted,

528
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,329
the revolt happened,

529
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,239
and Prince Geumryeong's family was wiped out.

530
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,329
If it had not been for His Highness,

531
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,719
I would also have lost my life.

532
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,400
If he were able to see you now,

533
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,809
he would be pleased.

534
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,239
My life was full of lies.

535
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:22,000
I was born Prince Geumryeong's slave,

536
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,360
I grew up as Lord Jung Yoon's illegitimate son,

537
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,079
and now...

538
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,289
I am the Crown Prince's long-lost son.

539
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,079
Who am I really?

540
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,289
I do not know anymore.

541
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,840
I would like to know something.

542
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,159
Sure. Please, ask away.

543
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,039
Who is my mother?

544
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,679
My father's written will did not mention her.

545
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,289
I heard she was of low birth.

546
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,078
It would be better for you to not wonder.

547
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,679
I do not care of her status.

548
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:12,559
She gave me life.

549
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,840
Lord Sin is waiting.

550
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,679
We should hurry.

551
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,519
I have decided what to do.

552
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,719
I will take the throne.

553
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,768
(Pyeong)

554
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:57,769
So,

555
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,329
what must I do now?

556
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,840
I will take this...

557
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,840
and alert the Mokinhoe members.

558
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
I will tell them Mokinhoe's secret leader was in fact...

559
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,840
the deposed heir Lee Seol.

560
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,639
You will take the throne as Lee Seol.

561
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,480
As Lee Seol?

562
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,360
What are you saying?

563
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,719
Must I come to power as the brother...

564
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,638
I have never met?

565
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,329
I am sorry to inform you,

566
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,558
but you were hidden away young,

567
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,400
and were never given a princely title.

568
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,599
You may be the late Crown Prince's son,

569
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,239
but you may as well be a love child born from an unknown woman.

570
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,159
If we were to make you king,

571
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,808
no one would support us.

572
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:52,440
But as a deposed heir, Lee Seol's case would be different.

573
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,559
Mokinhoe would follow you naturally.

574
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,559
A fake claim to the throne?

575
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,440
That would be deceiving...

576
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,199
not only Mokinhoe but the people.

577
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,808
I will take no part in that.

578
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,289
Instead, find the real Lee Seol and crown him.

579
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,919
We could not find him anywhere.

580
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,920
He never truly showed himself in over ten years.

581
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,400
To spend even more time to find him,

582
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,960
the current Joseon is in too big of a crisis.

583
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,719
Thousands of people are dying at his hands,

584
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,038
and subjects who appeal to His Majesty...

585
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,960
have their families annihilated.

586
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,519
Are you willing to...

587
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,119
keep letting this happen?

588
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Why are you out here?

589
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,839
(Garden of Flowers)

590
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Just because.

591
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,559
Do the Palace Guards...

592
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,159
make you work hard on the first day?

593
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,719
Yes. I worked half to death...

594
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,159
and got back safely.

595
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,959
That day, I saw a lantern of mourning hanging up there.

596
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,079
(Jodeung: A lantern that signifies a house holding a funeral.)

597
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,400
That is what drew me in.

598
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,039
Yes.

599
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,400
On each and every death anniversary,

600
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,679
I thought of...

601
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,840
the little boy that hid,

602
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:33,809
shuddering in the kennel.

603
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,920
"How is he doing now?"

604
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,440
"Is he safe?"

605
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:46,559
You would not know,

606
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,159
but I have changed a lot.

607
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,480
The endlessly vulnerable...

608
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,440
and hopelessly spiritless boy...

609
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:03,159
you saw in the kennel is no more.

610
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,480
Dan O, you are...

611
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,289
the last memory that does not hurt...

612
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
to remember.

613
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,039
I was grateful for a long time.

614
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I never got to...

615
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,960
tell you so for a long time.

616
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,159
(Onyang Temporary Palace)

617
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,289
Have you made up your mind?

618
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,199
I need your answer now.

619
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,679
Your Highness.

620
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,000
What is the reason you are asking me to be...

621
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,639
the watchman's financial backer?

622
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,559
Many years ago, you betrayed the Crown Prince's eldest son.

623
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,999
But thanks to it, the watchman was able to get rid of Yukinhoe,

624
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,769
who was after the Crown Prince's eldest son.

625
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,960
Hence, no one would be able to imagine...

626
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,639
that you are the one backing the watchman.

627
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,719
While you are at it,

628
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,039
you will also cross paths with Lee Seol's watchman.

629
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,289
I must find out...

630
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,239
how Seol is doing.

631
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,920
Please wait just a little longer.

632
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,000
His Highness will soon come to the palace.

633
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,769
He will come to the palace?

634
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,920
Is he in some kind of danger?

635
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,000
Did the King arrest him or something?

636
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,519
He will return to the palace in the near future...

637
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,119
for that is where he belongs.

638
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,718
(Buyounggak)

639
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,559
Let us begin the initiation.

640
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,769
Welcome to the Palace Guards.

641
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,639
Today, your task is to drink from this.

642
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,439
Do not spill a single drop,

643
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,920
and prove that you are indeed qualified to join us.

644
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:40,809
What are you doing? Let me pour you one too.

645
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,078
Gosh, how could I drink from this...

646
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,800
Goodness. It is leaking.

647
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,320
They are literally pouring wine into a bottomless jar, are they not?

648
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,959
Drink up.

649
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,079
The poor scholars cannot go home today.

650
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,959
I heard the Palace Guards had the toughest initiation ritual.

651
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
It was indeed true.

652
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,440
Hey!

653
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,920
Please pass on my thanks to the Queen Dowager.

654
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,400
Will those boys...

655
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,599
work as watchmen when they grow up?

656
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,840
Yes.

657
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,400
If they manage to survive until then, that is.

658
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,639
I have a question for you.

659
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,599
The deposed heir's watchman. What is he like?

660
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,159
Even the watchmen...

661
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:01,719
do not know...

662
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:03,679
who is protecting whom.

663
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,360
However,

664
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,639
they are always right by their masters' side.

665
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,280
Day...

666
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,920
and night.

667
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,400
Right by the master's side...

668
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,679
My gosh!

669
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,719
Gosh, Young Master. Try to walk.

670
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,599
Sober up, please!

671
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,480
- No. - No, Young Master. Please, no!

672
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,078
Oh, boy.

673
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,920
San, I can see that you drank a lot.

674
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,879
Did you have your initiation?

675
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,599
Hey, what brings you here?

676
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,158
I came to this gambling den to gamble, of course.

677
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,519
I am not here to see you.

678
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,280
Get out of my way. I must get home before this gets cold.

679
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,039
Dan O likes this.

680
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,840
You stole this? To give it to Dan O?

681
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,559
San.

682
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,480
How many fingers do you see?

683
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,039
Do you think I am an idiot?

684
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,159
Three, clearly.

685
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,199
Clearly, you are so drunk now.

686
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:20,840
If Dan O sees you now, she will call you a drunkard.

687
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,719
You should let him take a nap. There are many empty rooms here.

688
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:26,800
There is no need. I can carry him home in no time.

689
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,960
He is a strong man and is drunk now. You cannot carry him by yourself.

690
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,599
I am incredibly strong, but I simply hide it.

691
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,159
Let me show you.

692
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,880
- Give me a hand. - Pardon me?

693
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,440
He is too heavy.

694
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,519
Then get some rest.

695
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,840
I apologize.

696
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,839
I wanted you to sleep comfortably.

697
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,000
Forget it. Get out at once.

698
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,000
I have never seen such a red spot on the skin before.

699
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,320
About earlier...

700
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,960
I was rude to you.

701
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,199
I was on edge for I was still half-asleep.

702
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:33,639
No, it is okay.

703
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,440
It is my fault for making you uncomfortable.

704
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,639
You did nothing wrong.

705
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,559
How are things here? Do you like it here?

706
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,960
No, I do not.

707
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,039
Even here, I rarely feel like I can breathe.

708
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,440
If you ever encounter a problem you cannot solve on your own,

709
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,559
come to me.

710
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,719
Can I really do that?

711
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:27,400
You are the only one who has seen Snowflake as an adult.

712
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,239
And that is why His Majesty has spared you so far.

713
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,760
Confirming the rightful heir.

714
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,519
That will be...

715
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,760
my last duty.

716
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,999
So if you say someone is Lee Seol, that person becomes Lee Seol.

717
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,800
If you say it is not him, we will have to believe you.

718
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,840
I will put Lee Seol on the throne.

719
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,959
Have you found him?

720
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
I did find someone.

721
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,800
Turn him into Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

722
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,319
Are you suggesting that we put a fake Lee Seol on the throne?

723
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,399
The King's mercy toward you will expire...

724
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,119
the moment Lee Seol is found.

725
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,000
But if you decide to join hands with me,

726
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,239
I promise I will keep you safe.

727
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,079
I...

728
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,199
do not trust you.

729
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,920
Lowly nobodies like me are always the first to be sacrificed...

730
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,360
to achieve big goals.

731
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,039
What can I do to earn your trust?

732
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,800
Next time, let me meet the man who will be Snowflake.

733
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,800
I would like to speak with him too.

734
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,719
Sure, that is no problem.

("Book of Documents")

736
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,760
You still have that book?

737
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,279
If you read it openly like that, you will be arrested.

738
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,679
There is no one here now.

739
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,800
Yuk Ho went out with Ms. Naju,

740
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,158
and the boys are not in their rooms.

741
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,119
You should not read it even when no one is around.

742
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,199
Birds and mice are watching.

743
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,759
So is the chicken walking by.

744
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,599
Do you not trust me at all?

745
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,439
That is not what I meant...

746
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,799
Fine, I will throw it away...

747
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,280
so that no one can see it.

748
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,038
Give it to me. I will burn it to ashes.

749
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,799
No, this book is dangerous.

750
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,719
I cannot let anyone see it. I will throw it away myself.

751
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,119
Why are you suddenly being so stubborn like a little child?

752
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,559
What? A little child?

753
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,760
Have you ever seen such a strong child?

754
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,639
Yes, I am looking at one right now.

755
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
Give it here.

756
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,960
What if someone sees this?

757
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,960
- I will throw it out for you. - Yu Ha.

758
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,999
When did you get back?

759
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,159
I got this for San,

760
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,079
so it should be me who gets rid of it.

761
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:00,239
I thought I could trust you to always be unswerving.

762
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,039
Come to think of it,

763
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:04,000
this must be what you read in secret.

764
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,119
Had I known...

765
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:08,840
I never lied to you.

766
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,679
I said these were not licentious drawings,

767
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:13,239
but you did not believe me.

768
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:15,840
I am sure he read it out of curiosity.

769
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,158
I begged him to get me this book.

770
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:19,760
Swing by the marketplace sometime...

771
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,440
and see how many people died because of this book.

772
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,159
How can you all be this reckless?

773
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,760
It is only my heart that blackens out of concern.

774
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,599
Exactly.

775
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:31,679
You should have only read it once,

776
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,279
not kept it around.

777
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,879
If you had not given me this book,

778
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,238
I would not have read it in the first place.

779
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,400
The pot is calling the kettle black.

780
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,280
(Book of Documents)

781
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,199
Me visiting you at the home only for women paid off.

782
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,400
I was worried you would not come back.

783
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,440
You did not prompt my return.

784
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,839
Like I said before, my concern for Dan O...

785
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,039
Who cares why you came back?

786
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,280
I am not why you came home,

787
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,840
but you still brought back what I gave you.

788
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:45,599
Well,

789
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,719
it was not like I could throw it away.

790
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:52,960
Sure. I will take your word for it.

791
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,320
I wish to be someone Dan O can rely on,

792
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,960
but I cannot think of a way.

793
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,400
How can a maiden who hides away in the annex...

794
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,760
be of any help?

795
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,599
Let us find a way, then.

796
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,599
I am sure there will be something you can do.

797
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,840
Why are you always so nice to me?

798
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,400
Because I see myself in you.

799
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,280
We are similar in a way.

800
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,000
We are similar?

801
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,559
All my life,

802
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,599
I have never been able to live freely.

803
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Pardon?

804
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,360
Until you fall asleep,

805
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,800
you should think about what makes us alike.

806
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,320
Delivering eggs is not as easy as I thought.

807
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,639
I do not think I have walked around Jungchon this much before.

808
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:24,199
You should not have come with me.

809
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,639
It was unnecessary.

810
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,159
I had to keep track of my debtor.

811
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,199
I mean,

812
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,559
the debt is 100 nyang of silver.

813
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:34,360
Did you not decline my offer to pay it back?

814
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:37,960
Still, I am glad you have accepted it.

815
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
By the way,

816
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,999
you and San seem to have gotten closer.

817
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,119
What? San and I?

818
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,038
You two have been talking a lot these days.

819
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:50,039
Gosh.

820
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:52,519
Did it seem that way?

821
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,679
One thing leads to another when we converse, I guess.

822
00:55:58,119 --> 00:55:59,360
The more you like someone,

823
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,679
the more you wish to say to them.

824
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Meanwhile,

825
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,000
you seem glummer than usual.

826
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,440
There seems to be a lot on your mind as well.

827
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,000
You can talk to me about what is troubling you.

828
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,800
I am all ears.

829
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
Would you really listen...

830
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,039
if something was troubling me?

831
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,039
Of course. It is not like it costs me any money.

832
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,960
Lay it on me.

833
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,119
Wherever I am or whatever I am doing,

834
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,039
if I use the 100 nyang as an excuse,

835
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,519
would you converse with me?

836
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,320
It does not have to be often.

837
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:42,719
Maybe occasionally...

838
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:44,159
like today.

839
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:11,079
This is he.

840
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,360
He will take the throne as the deposed heir Lee Seol.

841
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,639
Please sit comfortably, Your Highness.

842
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,440
The deposed heir Lee Seol,

843
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,320
the impostor backed by First Vice-premier,

844
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,440
and Lee Chang who usurped the throne.

845
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,280
Only one can sit on the throne,

846
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,360
but there are three kings.

847
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,639
This is Dan O.

848
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,079
Yuk Ho, what is this about?

849
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Your Majesty, the girl you summoned is here as ordered.

850
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,039
He first brought in a girl from the Institute of Performing Arts...

851
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,039
and now a girl living outside palace walls.

852
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,158
I heard she was a woman of noble birth...

853
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,599
who runs an inn in Jungchon.

854
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,199
His Majesty is speaking to her privately in the back garden.

855
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:25,559
How odd.

856
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,039
A woman of noble birth is running an inn?

857
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,440
Look into it.

858
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,039
Yes, Your Highness.

859
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,159
Are you Yoon Won's daughter?

860
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

861
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,639
I have something for you.

862
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,159
Come and receive it.

863
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,519
You gasping in shock must mean...

864
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,360
that Assistant Magistrate Jang spoke the truth.

865
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,239
You dared...

866
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,440
to save the life of the deposed heir Lee Seol.

867
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,759
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

868
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,839
Yoon Dan O. You do not want me to remember you.

869
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,118
Do you know what I fear more than death?

870
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:16,038
Losing those in my life once again.

871
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,800
Are you sure about this?

872
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,759
While you hid away in the annex,

873
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,638
the world kept changing.

874
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:24,078
In the Year of Muja, the awakened one will appear.

875
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,678
Lee Seol must soon be making his appearance.

876
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,638
Do not look into...

877
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:30,198
what has not yet surfaced.

878
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:33,198
Are you hoping to take the throne as Lee Seol?

879
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:35,119
Will you die in the hands of Lee Chang?

880
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,999
Or will you open the door to a new world?

881
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
The choice is yours.
