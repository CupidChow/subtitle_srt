(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

6
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,233
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,154
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:00,393
Of all the places we could meet...

9
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:12,643
Are you him?

10
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:16,673
Are you Snowflake?

11
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,234
Do not look for Snowflake...

12
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:25,434
unless you wish to die.

13
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,313
I cannot do that.

14
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,914
I could slit your throat right now.

15
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:35,514
Even if you were to do so,

16
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,794
my answer would not change.

17
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:53,193
See? I said there would be no point.

18
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:00,953
What...

19
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:06,593
What are you all doing here?

20
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:14,234
If you wish to find Snowflake,

21
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,473
come to the deserted house by the tree of the guardian spirit...

22
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,713
in Namsan Village.

23
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,764
You made a deal with Master Jang?

24
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:26,833
He will forgo the debt in return for finding Lee Seol?

25
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,153
Yes.

26
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:33,764
My gosh. Dan O, you have more guts than most men.

27
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,764
They say that First Vice-premier Sin Won Ho is behind Master Jang,

28
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:42,273
A Junior Fifth Rank official would not have much power otherwise.

29
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,273
He trusts in his staunch backer.

30
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,764
He would not look for Snowflake as a jest.

31
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,514
He must have the King's order.

32
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,474
Does that mean our Dan O is serving the King?

33
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:55,113
You might advance before we do.

34
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:57,754
It is too dangerous.

35
00:02:58,153 --> 00:02:59,832
You should try to find the money.

36
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,273
That is easy for you to say, son of a rich nobleman.

37
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,713
- What? - To a penniless girl,

38
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,393
finding money is the hardest of all tasks.

39
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:11,833
Just give up.

40
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,794
Do not lose your life trying to find Lee Seol.

41
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:16,914
That is just foolish.

42
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:20,754
There is a reason...

43
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,034
I must keep Garden of Flowers.

44
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:32,553
Whatever you all say,

45
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,993
I will find Lee Seol.

46
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,393
Then we should all look together.

47
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:44,794
Good idea. It sounds like fun.

48
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,433
You are all insane.

49
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,993
It should be entertaining, watching you causing a ruckus.

50
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:52,474
Who knows?

51
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:56,153
We might end up stumbling upon him.

52
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:58,754
The deposed heir Lee Seol.

53
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,034
No.

54
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,273
You stay out of it.

55
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,113
- Dan O. - Yoon Dan O.

56
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,594
What can you do on your own?

57
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:10,673
I do not want to drag you into something dangerous.

58
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,354
We should go home.

59
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,553
(Garden of Flowers)

60
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,034
Why are you still up?

61
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,914
I could not sleep.

62
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,113
I am not surprised.

63
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,354
You got yourself into something huge.

64
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:02,914
I realized...

65
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,914
you were the first.

66
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,283
The first what?

67
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,034
The first to hold a blade to my throat.

68
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,964
An actual sword.

69
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:15,964
Nothing scares you. Is that a specialty?

70
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:18,474
I am scared too.

71
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,154
I also know you are worried about me.

72
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:24,714
If you do,

73
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,354
then give up even now.

74
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,274
But...

75
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:34,474
however scared I am, I must protect my family.

76
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,673
Not even Buddha or the King will protect us.

77
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:41,274
"Family?"

78
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,633
You have family other than Ms. Naju?

79
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:49,394
Well, no, but...

80
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:54,354
Us all. We are a family.

81
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:55,794
We live and eat together.

82
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:02,553
I am surprised.

83
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:06,073
What are you going to say this time?

84
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,594
The most indifferent of the guys...

85
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,794
worries about me the most.

86
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,873
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

87
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:32,394
Now I get it.

88
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:38,914
The truth is,

89
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,193
you are very interested in the world.

90
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,034
You pretend not to be.

91
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:47,354
What?

92
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,992
I knew it the moment you took out a wooden sword...

93
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,274
to save a baby.

94
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,154
It is not that you fail to notice things.

95
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:01,354
You fail to understand.

96
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:16,513
(Jagyeongjeon Hall)

97
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:21,313
(Jagyeongjeon Hall)

98
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,553
Royal Consort Park must be here.

99
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,834
Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,753
Your Majesty.

101
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,193
Did you visit the Queen Dowager?

102
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:31,354
Yes. She refused to see me yet again.

103
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,113
Why is she so cold to our prince?

104
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:45,354
Are you that anxious?

105
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:48,913
Pardon?

106
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:54,444
Are you afraid that the child will not be made crown prince?

107
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,194
That impostor you brought in.

108
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,234
Your Majesty.

109
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,683
What do you mean?

110
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,153
Did you think I would not notice?

111
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,753
That boy looks nothing like me.

112
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:21,393
Your Majesty!

113
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,033
Back when my older brother was alive,

114
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,753
when you were a court maid that served the crown prince,

115
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,074
you did something for me.

116
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,074
Why are you...

117
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:40,594
suddenly bringing that up?

118
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,393
That is when I noticed...

119
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,714
your ambition that makes you stop at nothing.

120
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:49,954
Then...

121
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,993
you will not punish me?

122
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,513
What I needed...

123
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:03,714
was an heir.

124
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,753
To silence the court.

125
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,753
Only then can my Joseon prosper for a long time.

126
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,833
I stayed up and waited for you all night!

127
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:31,473
Could you not have let me know that you would be home late?

128
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:34,564
I am sorry. I returned with the guests last night.

129
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:38,444
Oh, Ms. Naju! You must have been truly worried.

130
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,323
You know what? Yesterday, Dan O...

131
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:44,633
Gosh, Si Yeol.

132
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,834
You keep rejecting help.

133
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,193
Ms. Naju should know what is going on...

134
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,753
I do not want to endanger you scholars.

135
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,474
What about you though?

136
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,074
You do not care about endangering yourself?

137
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,834
My goodness.

138
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,873
Is Lady Dan O in big trouble?

139
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:17,513
Well, you could say it is big.

140
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,233
- But it could also seem small. - Gosh.

141
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,473
It is very important and trifling at the same time...

142
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:22,474
Fine, I heard you.

143
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,153
What?

144
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:27,074
I said, I heard you.

145
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,714
We will do it together.

146
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,873
You must keep it from Ms. Naju and Yuk Ho, no matter what.

147
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,314
Okay?

148
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,273
Sure thing. We should not worry them for no reason.

149
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,392
What about you, San? What will you do?

150
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,473
Forget it. I would be glad if he did not try to talk us out of it.

151
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:00,474
We will do it.

152
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,113
Let us find him. Lee Seol or whatever his name is.

153
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,513
You will not listen to me even if I try to dissuade you.

154
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:13,674
While looking for him, you will realize...

155
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,273
how preposterous all of this is.

156
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,354
Then we will talk again tomorrow.

157
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:28,354
But you know...

158
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,793
If one of us were Lee Seol,

159
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,434
things would get very interesting.

160
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:35,873
Goodness.

161
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,633
That was a bit too harsh.

162
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,513
I know that being rude is your specialty,

163
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,793
but Dan O is already having a hard time.

164
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:47,714
Do not be so harsh on her.

165
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,194
Is being nosy your specialty?

166
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,594
You like to stick your nose in other people's business.

167
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,033
What?

168
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,113
You two are practically strangers.

169
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:58,674
You and Dan O.

170
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,513
- I cherish Dan O as... - As a sister?

171
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:06,913
That is such a cliche.

172
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,513
I cherish her as a woman.

173
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:14,194
That was what I meant to say.

174
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,194
Come and have a look!

175
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,353
Feel free to browse around.

176
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,633
- How much is this? - This one?

177
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,633
(Liquor)

178
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:53,393
Here, have a look.

179
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:59,434
Take a look at this. This one is...

180
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,153
Not bad.

181
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,594
Incredible.

182
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,993
A secret room like this in the middle of Jungchon?

183
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:37,273
It is the perfect place to discuss our great plans.

184
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,913
All thanks to my discerning eye and taste.

185
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,513
Should we not thank the one who is financially backing you?

186
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,314
Hello? Anybody inside?

187
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,474
What is this?

188
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,113
So...

189
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,554
Dan O's elder sister died?

190
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,753
Yes.

191
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,594
You heard what I said.

192
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,793
The annex houses the memorial tablets...

193
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,273
that honor Hong Ju and Dan O's father.

194
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,793
So in a way, it is like a family shrine.

195
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,912
Did you say "shrine?"

196
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:49,554
(Gamyo: A family shrine)

197
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:51,513
Why?

198
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,434
Did you see something?

199
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:59,954
Is there something I am not allowed to see?

200
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:04,113
A number of people have said that they saw a female ghost there,

201
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,834
so I was wondering if you saw it too.

202
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,434
I knew it.

203
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:09,884
She was clad in a mourning dress.

204
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,154
Do not go anywhere near the annex.

205
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,273
Young, good-looking men are more likely...

206
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,404
to get bewitched by the ghost.

207
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,273
But she looked so real.

208
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,474
Oh, dear.

209
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:51,234
What are you doing in my room?

210
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,033
This is interesting.

211
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:54,954
Is this one of the prophetic books?

212
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:56,884
Get out, will you?

213
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,674
I did not know you read such books too.

214
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:00,993
I can borrow this, right?

215
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,194
Not a chance.

216
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,124
Must you be so difficult?

217
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,474
Goodness.

218
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,474
What are you doing? Get out.

219
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,194
May I sleep in your room tonight?

220
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,073
Of course, you may not.

221
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:18,474
Get out at once.

222
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,793
No! Tonight, I truly...

223
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,273
cannot sleep alone.

224
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,124
Fine. Just sleep, then.

225
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:30,793
Really?

226
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,674
You will sleep next to me?

227
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,194
San, you are the best...

228
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,914
Hey! Why did you blow it out?

229
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,474
San, wait!

230
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:42,154
(Buyounggak)

231
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,553
I could slit your throat right now.

232
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,313
Even if you were to do so,

233
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,644
my answer would not change.

234
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,273
Yoon Dan O.

235
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,644
You will not give up until the end.

236
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,033
Come here, you wench.

237
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:20,513
Come here!

238
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:25,753
You are in the palm of my hand even if you run away.

239
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:28,714
Look at you.

240
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:31,313
You are a beast.

241
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:32,434
Fine.

242
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,884
I shall play rough with you tonight, like a real beast would.

243
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,884
That is enough.

244
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,073
Be on your way, will you?

245
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,674
How dare a kisaeng try to play hard to get?

246
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,124
You little... Do you know who I am?

247
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:54,753
I do not care who you are.

248
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,914
I am buying her service for tonight.

249
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,993
- Got a problem with that? - No.

250
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,404
I am grateful for what you did today.

251
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,033
Then,

252
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,593
I will turn off the candle.

253
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,753
Young master?

254
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,194
That will symbolize our first time together.

255
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:27,993
I would rather keep things quiet.

256
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:48,914
The court lady took her own life?

257
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,714
Yes, Lord Sin.

258
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:52,914
She hung herself from the crossbeam.

259
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,954
The baby must not be His Majesty's heir.

260
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,033
You seem troubled.

261
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:03,793
There is something I must confirm.

262
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,193
Discreetly look into...

263
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,634
Royal Consort Park's relatives to see if anyone recently adopted...

264
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,394
a girl.

265
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,194
An adopted daughter?

266
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,674
A baby girl who is less than a year old.

267
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,553
You are to look into this yourself.

268
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,634
Yes, my lord.

269
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:48,714
- When did you get here? - Just now.

270
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,593
I saw the list on my way here.

271
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,434
You passed the first exam.

272
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,033
Impressive, I must say.

273
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,753
Maybe a feast is in order.

274
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,194
Do not make a fuss when I still have the final exam.

275
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,634
By the way,

276
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:07,993
when is your birthday?

277
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:10,674
Why would you ask that out of the blue?

278
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:13,593
We are a family now, and I should know.

279
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:17,753
Do not bother.

280
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:20,352
But I throw birthday parties...

281
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:22,273
for everyone staying at Garden of Flowers.

282
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:24,513
I do not care about having a family.

283
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,273
No way. Were you two waiting for me?

284
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,033
I should have come sooner, then.

285
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,353
Yu Ha.

286
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,833
- You seem busy these days. - Pardon?

287
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:47,473
Your hours are usually spent reading books in your room,

288
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:50,033
but you have been more out and about lately.

289
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,593
- I was enjoying the fine weather. - I see.

290
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:58,634
Is it the weather you fancy, or is it Dan O?

291
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,154
That is nonsense.

292
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:03,593
Young Master Jung!

293
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,033
- What is the matter? - The lady...

294
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,513
The lady is in grave condition.

295
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:48,434
Gil Jun, is that you?

296
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:49,993
Have you come to?

297
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:52,273
It is I, Yu Ha.

298
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:56,954
Where is Gil Jun?

299
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:00,634
Where is my Gil Jun?

300
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:05,194
Bring me my Gil Jun.

301
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,793
Impressive, is it not?

302
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:21,714
I would have done well hosting shell games.

303
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,833
It is killer.

304
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:26,873
Why does it sound like you want to off me?

305
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,993
Finally, we are on the same page.

306
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:34,633
Is Yu Ha still not here?

307
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,194
No, and he is not one to stand people up.

308
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:39,553
Maybe we should head home.

309
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,513
I doubt anything happened.

310
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:42,874
Let us discuss it without him.

311
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,954
The excitement kept me up last night.

312
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:50,993
So how will you find him?

313
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:52,634
Do you have anything to go on?

314
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:58,273
From what I heard, the late Prince Geumryeong...

315
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,593
had a close relationship with the deposed Crown Prince.

316
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:02,154
Prince Geumryeong?

317
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,513
His family was also probably ruined,

318
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:05,993
so who will you seek out?

319
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,033
The others who used to live there.

320
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:10,433
They must be slaves and servants of the government now.

321
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,072
They would have been sent to other cities...

322
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:13,434
in addition to Hanyang.

323
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,154
I hear...

324
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:21,833
that a registry is kept at the Slave Administration Office.

325
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:26,032
Getting a glimpse of it might give us a lead.

326
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,234
Slaves and servants are government assets,

327
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:30,434
which makes the office a safe.

328
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:34,194
Could there be a way?

329
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,154
How can one crack open the safe?

330
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,194
Wait. I have an idea.

331
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,353
Someone like San who only thinks he is clever...

332
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,114
would have never thought of this.

333
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:58,353
(Buyounggak)

334
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,033
You wish to step foot into the Slave Administration Office?

335
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:04,833
Can you allow it...

336
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:06,752
during your night shift later on?

337
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:09,833
But one must adhere to the law.

338
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:12,874
Letting outsiders in could be risky at night.

339
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:19,434
For some reason, I am not in luck today.

340
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,474
I lose.

341
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:31,674
I will do what I can.

342
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:36,553
Call it a token of the friendship we formed at the tujeon den.

343
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,714
We are all set.

344
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,114
I appreciate this.

345
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:08,513
Give me 100 nyang more.

346
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:13,513
As you know,

347
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:16,833
I charge an interest rate of 30 percent.

348
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,273
Madame, have a seat.

349
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,833
Watch how I make money today.

350
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:36,114
Darn. I have suddenly lost my appetite.

351
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,874
Is this the bastard son you mentioned?

352
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:41,353
Are you sure you have the same father?

353
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,352
His blood may be lowly, but his looks...

354
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:44,714
You will follow me out.

355
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,474
I am being summoned...

356
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:53,634
by the bastard son.

357
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,033
You should head home.

358
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:58,793
Now is not the time for this.

359
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:03,833
Would this cleanse your lowly blood?

360
00:29:04,914 --> 00:29:07,234
The stench of his lowly blood...

361
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:09,833
gives me a headache.

362
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,874
Do not bother. Even buckets of liquor...

363
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,993
would not cleanse his lowly blood.

364
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:20,914
I appreciate the drink.

365
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:22,993
Next time,

366
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:25,553
allow me to pour you a glass.

367
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:27,993
How dare you?

368
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,914
Head home this instant.

369
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,312
How could you be gambling when your mother is sick?

370
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:36,394
Let go.

371
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,874
How dare a lowly blood like you...

372
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,033
Goodness.

373
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:46,033
If Lord Jung Yoon could see you,

374
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:48,954
he would be heartbroken.

375
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:06,114
You should not leave in that state.

376
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:15,194
Please follow me.

377
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:31,593
Wipe yourself dry.

378
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:36,474
I will do it myself.

379
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:48,674
I did not know...

380
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:54,154
you were Lord Jung Yoon's son.

381
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:10,513
Thank you.

382
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,993
I owed you one.

383
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:34,153
(Slave Administration Office)

384
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:35,474
It is good to see you again.

385
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:37,553
Let us through.

386
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,714
Come on.

387
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,312
I paid handsomely.

388
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:45,194
You paid me handsomely.

389
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:47,114
You have not yet paid them.

390
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,073
- Then... - Will this do?

391
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:00,394
Let them through.

392
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:02,634
The shift changes in 30 minutes.

393
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,273
You must leave before then.

394
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:06,954
Go on inside.

395
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,353
My gosh...

396
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:11,954
Do not stay too long.

(Slave Register)

398
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:32,874
I will hold up the light so you can read.

399
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,273
Do not stare at my face.

400
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,033
Stare at the pages.

401
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,073
It is not here either.

402
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:19,993
Oh, dear.

403
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:46,194

(Slave Register)

407
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,313
Get up. We are out of time.

408
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:29,393
Already?

409
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:38,793
Oh, dear.

410
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,634
(Slaves: Ok Boon)

411
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,353
I found it.

412
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:52,353
What?

413
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:55,113
They were sent to the Capital District Office.

414
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,793
Nice. You found it eventually.

415
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,872
I have been wanting to ask.

416
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:14,634
Do not ask, whatever it is.

417
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:16,473
You two.

418
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,793
I sense something odd.

419
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:20,753
Like what?

420
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,523
There is something between you.

421
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:28,433
Your flushed faces...

422
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,472
and gazes that sway as if lost...

423
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:33,593
How are you always so full...

424
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:34,953
of nonsense?

425
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:38,563
I owe you both tonight.

426
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,233
Tomorrow, the Capital District Office...

427
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:42,352
Why not go together...

428
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:43,353
"Together?"

429
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:45,074
Do you have something to do?

430
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:47,674
Just two of you?

431
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:52,114
I meant "all together."

432
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:53,913
You too.

433
00:35:57,563 --> 00:35:59,634
(Garden of Flowers)

434
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:23,114
What is it you want to say?

435
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:26,793
You were not asleep?

436
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,873
Not anymore.

437
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:31,753
You woke me.

438
00:36:43,353 --> 00:36:44,873
You must be dead curious.

439
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,594
FSG's first excursion...

440
00:36:49,594 --> 00:36:51,313
happened without you.

441
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:54,634
What-G?

442
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:56,714
The Find Seol Gang.

443
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:58,313
FSG.

444
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,953
I just named us. Are you not impressed?

445
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:05,194
Were there any dangerous circumstances?

446
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,393
Why would there be, with us two men there?

447
00:37:08,674 --> 00:37:09,833
No, wait.

448
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:12,194
Was there?

449
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:14,594
What do you mean?

450
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:18,634
My unusually sensitive hunch and gut tell me...

451
00:37:22,563 --> 00:37:24,523
Something dangerous did happen.

452
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:26,673
If you are going to talk nonsense...

453
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,792
All it takes is a shared gaze for romance...

454
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,714
to bloom between a man and a woman.

455
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:32,594
I think I saw that gaze...

456
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,953
in the Slave Administration Office.

457
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:46,154
(Garden of Flowers)

458
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:55,714
You went to the Slave Administration Office yesterday?

459
00:37:56,234 --> 00:38:00,042
Yes. Si Yeol said he would help,

460
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,312
but he slept...

461
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,313
And San?

462
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:03,953
What?

463
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:06,953
San is always so gruff and mean.

464
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:08,393
Was he...

465
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:11,674
No. He was nice to me. Very nice.

466
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,562
All it takes is a shared gaze for romance...

467
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:17,194
to bloom between a man and a woman.

468
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,194
"Very nice?"

469
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:25,913
Very slightly. You know how he usually is.

470
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:32,473
Good. I wonder why he was nice.

471
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:37,312
Which way are you going?

472
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:39,872
I can walk you to the Capital District Office on the way.

473
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:43,562
You do not have to. You said you must go to study.

474
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:44,634
I can spare some time.

475
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,003
Come along.

476
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:53,523
(Capital District Office)

477
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:04,873
Excuse me.

478
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:10,154
I heard there is a slave here called Ok Boon.

479
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:11,752
Can you call her for me?

480
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,753
I apologize.

481
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:16,313
We get scolded if we stand to chat and not work.

482
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:18,194
Ok Boon...

483
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,523
served this young lady as a child.

484
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:25,312
She is to marry soon and wants to...

485
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:26,753
see Ok Boon one last time.

486
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,523
How odd.

487
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:32,594
I was told her master's family all died or became slaves.

488
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:35,833
I see.

489
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:37,714
It explains your dress.

490
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:44,714
Please wait.

491
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,234
You are more resourceful than you seem.

492
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,114
Quick-witted as well.

493
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:54,833
I just wanted to help.

494
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:56,313
Are you disappointed?

495
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,313
No. I approve.

496
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,473
It was rude of me to ask.

497
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:20,194
The memories of that day must still pain you as well.

498
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:23,793
Your family is all scattered now.

499
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:25,674
You must be very lonely.

500
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,594
I truly do not know anything.

501
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:32,393
The Crown Prince visited us from time to time,

502
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,074
but they always spoke in private.

503
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:39,473
I heard the two princes...

504
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:41,353
were very close.

505
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:43,873
Tell me what you know. It could be anything.

506
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,272
One of the maids...

507
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:48,154
was quite brazen and sly.

508
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,833
She might know something.

509
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:52,872
Do you think I can meet her?

510
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:55,832
Yes. She left before the incident took place.

511
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,154
From what I have heard, she runs an inn now.

512
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:01,273
What was it called? Bu...

513
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,043
It is an inn in Jungchon. Its name starts with "Bu."

514
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:10,674
- Buyounggak? - Yes, that is the one.

515
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,353
If it is Buyounggak...

516
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:17,393
Hwa Ryung?

517
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,523
Gosh.

518
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,913
If Lord Jung Yoon saw this,

519
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:41,873
he would be deeply saddened.

520
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,043
I did not know...

521
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:48,563
you were somewhere so close.

522
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:55,353
("The Secret Records of Samhan")

523
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,833
Is this truly the right thing to do?

524
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,562
Translating this into the vernacular language.

525
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,073
(The Korean alphabet was denounced by the educated class as eonmun.)

526
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:08,833
If you are complaining because your arm is getting tired, you may quit.

527
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:11,793
Scholar Jung and I will finish the rest.

528
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,873
The commoners are busy making ends meet.

529
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:17,043
They will not have time to read this translated version.

530
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:20,393
Even beggars have dreams.

531
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:23,833
Just because you are poor, it does not mean you have no dreams.

532
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:25,393
You are absolutely right.

533
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:28,953
If the poor commoners can read this with ease...

534
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:35,234
We can amass the power to change the world.

535
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:43,194
Gosh! My goodness.

536
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,793
Watch where you are going!

537
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,634
Oh, no. Are you all right?

538
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:39,042
(The temple in Mount Inwang at sulsi)

539
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:40,753
(Sulsi: Between 7pm and 9pm)

540
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:58,873
Which one should I move to get ahead?

541
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:02,514
(Soldier)

542
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:15,913
You are late.

543
00:45:20,793 --> 00:45:21,953
Leave Hanyang.

544
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:23,753
This is your last chance.

545
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:27,953
As you can see, all my limbs are tied.

546
00:45:28,594 --> 00:45:30,793
If you wish to be spared, you should decide...

547
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:33,714
whose side you are on.

548
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:37,234
But that young lady had already joined hands with the others.

549
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,833
What was her name? Dan O?

550
00:45:49,634 --> 00:45:51,273
How much do you know?

551
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:53,393
About Snowflake.

552
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,154
You ran here to ask me this question?

553
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:01,154
I visited the Capital District Office earlier.

554
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,753
I met Prince Geumryeong's family.

555
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:07,873
I did not hide it from you on purpose.

556
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,074
I simply did not have a reason to tell you.

557
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,194
How come...

558
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:16,234
you told me not to look for Snowflake?

559
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:19,554
After all, you were the one who told the scholars too.

560
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,194
He came to you, did he not?

561
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,074
Who?

562
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:25,393
The watchman.

563
00:46:26,273 --> 00:46:27,674
The one who protects Lee Seol.

564
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:32,872
With his sword,

565
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,594
he ruthlessly slays those who are after Lee Seol.

566
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,994
Very soon,

567
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:40,353
his sword may pierce your heart too.

568
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,953
That is why I told the scholars.

569
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,873
I was hoping they could stop you.

570
00:46:51,154 --> 00:46:54,873
If you have nothing more to say, please leave.

571
00:47:06,913 --> 00:47:10,074
I cannot stop.

572
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:13,114
Not like this.

573
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:15,913
I will not give up.

574
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:21,514
What is the reason you must protect Garden of Flowers?

575
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,674
Is there a reason you cannot share with me?

576
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:27,793
I cannot tell you the details,

577
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,114
but someone's life depends on it.

578
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:37,514
So please. If you know anything, please tell me.

579
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:47,714
I implore you. Please help me, for old times' sake...

580
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,113
There is a precious treasure.

581
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:56,953
(Gwibo: A precious treasure)

582
00:47:57,514 --> 00:47:58,833
A precious treasure?

583
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:03,393
The Crown Prince left it behind for his heir.

584
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:09,273
I heard it was only passed down to the true heirs...

585
00:48:10,194 --> 00:48:11,554
to the throne.

586
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:14,194
Do you know what it looks like?

587
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,913
There is a dragon engraved on it.

588
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,553
The Palace Guards were after him?

589
00:48:28,554 --> 00:48:31,353
Yes, sir. What does the Chief Eunuch know?

590
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,433
I wonder why His Majesty decided to spare him.

591
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:34,793
We shall find out.

592
00:48:35,554 --> 00:48:38,074
What does he know that he walked out of there in one piece?

593
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:53,674
The watchman.

594
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:10,594
She is the reason you are here despite the risks. Am I wrong?

595
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:16,514
Does Yoon Dan O truly not know...

596
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:19,353
who you are?

597
00:49:20,393 --> 00:49:21,514
Shut your mouth.

598
00:49:22,674 --> 00:49:26,752
I suppose we have no choice but to kill that girl.

599
00:49:26,753 --> 00:49:27,753
I told you...

600
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:30,313
to shut your mouth.

601
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:33,594
Sparing her now will create problems for us later.

602
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:35,673
Do not mention Dan O's name again...

603
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:38,473
Do you have feelings for her?

604
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,594
If that is not the case, why...

605
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:51,273
Either way, I only have one goal.

606
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:52,634
Confirming the rightful heir.

607
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:56,034
I must either get Lee Seol executed for high treason...

608
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,594
or make him ascend the throne.

609
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,753
I am the only one who has seen Snowflake...

610
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,714
as an adult.

611
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,074
Stay away from Dan O.

612
00:50:17,273 --> 00:50:18,313
Go anywhere near her,

613
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,273
and I will slay you.

614
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:32,273
- Go after him! - Yes, sir!

615
00:51:55,514 --> 00:51:57,832
- What... - Who just left your residence?

616
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,193
Was someone here?

617
00:51:59,194 --> 00:52:00,594
Do you have a death wish?

618
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:02,953
After my nightcap,

619
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:05,193
I happened to doze off.

620
00:52:05,194 --> 00:52:06,433
Speak the truth.

621
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:09,553
Who was the man you were with just now?

622
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:12,273
In no way could I possibly lie to you.

623
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,912
The relentless questioning at the palace...

624
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,034
wore me down,

625
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:18,832
and I slept like a log.

626
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,913
Was it the watchman?

627
00:52:21,674 --> 00:52:22,674
Tell me...

628
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:25,154
before I rip you into pieces.

629
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:30,273
Was it the watchman?

630
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:34,714
It is not Lee Seol you have been after.

631
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:36,994
It is the watchman.

632
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:39,913
Goodness.

633
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:43,913
Then it seems as though we must renew our deal,

634
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:45,594
Master Jang.

635
00:53:16,873 --> 00:53:17,873
He went this way.

636
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:03,674
Let us look that way.

637
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:56,873
Does Yoon Dan O truly not know...

638
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:58,953
who you are?

639
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:26,753
- That hurts. - It was you?

640
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:29,393
Who knew I had to risk my life to call for you?

641
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,514
I react first when ambushed.

642
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:34,353
You should have been more careful.

643
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:37,634
Of course. Whatever you say.

644
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:40,994
Where were you this late at night anyway?

645
00:55:41,514 --> 00:55:42,953
I was at Buyounggak.

646
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:45,634
The madame...

647
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,554
turned out to be Prince Geumryeong's former maid.

648
00:55:48,994 --> 00:55:49,994
The madame?

649
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:50,994
That is correct.

650
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:53,753
So...

651
00:55:55,554 --> 00:55:56,873
what else did you find out?

652
00:55:58,674 --> 00:56:00,234
Something that belonged to the deposed Crown Prince...

653
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:01,714
is in Snowflake's possession.

654
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:04,634
Sparing her now...

655
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,753
will create problems for us later.

656
00:56:08,634 --> 00:56:10,873
It is said to have a dragon engraved on it.

657
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,234
Could he still have it?

658
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:17,514
How would I know?

659
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:02,594
Why meet me here...

660
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:04,514
when I was on my way to you?

661
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:07,793
You were taking forever, Your Majesty.

662
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:10,393
I told you not to call me that.

663
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:13,114
How else would I address you...

664
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,273
when that is who you are?

665
00:57:18,793 --> 00:57:19,994
You silly old man.

666
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,194
Why did you ask for...

667
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:24,273
what you had entrusted me with?

668
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:32,873
I have my reasons.

669
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:36,913
San, wait up.

670
00:57:44,873 --> 00:57:45,873
San!

671
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:47,714
San?

672
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:50,074
My gosh.

673
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:03,234
We could not find him.

674
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:04,273
He is nowhere to be seen.

675
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:07,594
Ransack every clinic in Jungchon if you must.

676
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:10,113
He must be found. Do you hear me?

677
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:11,114
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

678
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:26,634
I am in need of assistance.

679
00:58:27,234 --> 00:58:29,074
There is an urgent patient that must be moved.

680
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:42,074
Please help him.

681
00:58:51,873 --> 00:58:52,873
Halt.

682
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:12,953
Open the palanquin door.

683
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:48,952
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

684
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,353
I was told not to look for him.

685
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:55,233
He made it clear that I was not to approach Yoon Dan O.

686
00:59:55,234 --> 00:59:57,952
Did you know that the warrior was a slayer?

687
00:59:57,953 --> 01:00:00,073
Tell me how much you know.

688
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:03,792
Do not tell me you will suddenly change your mind.

689
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:05,912
My heart will forever be set.

690
01:00:05,913 --> 01:00:07,952
I do not wish for anyone to get hurt.

691
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:09,952
That is what I want this time around.

692
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:12,073
If push comes to shove,

693
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:13,272
do I have permission to kill?

694
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:15,073
If you are ever in that situation again,

695
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:16,153
just run.

696
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,634
Are you the watchman?
