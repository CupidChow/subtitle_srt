It just...

9
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,954
melted away.

10
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:45,715
The thoughts that filled my mind.

11
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,754
What was filling your mind?

12
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,795
What to do if you get caught?

13
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,394
All I can do...

14
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,754
is worry and that upsets me.

15
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:02,394
And now?

16
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,355
I think everything will be fine.

17
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,715
Yes.

18
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,555
Everything will be fine.

19
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:22,715
So...

20
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,395
trust me and wait.

(Episode 12)

22
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,074
You two!

23
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,115
You, follow me.

24
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,155
What do I do now?

25
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:20,354
Inform the King that the watchman tried to hurt you.

26
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:22,754
And then?

27
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,034
Dan O, you have to side with His Majesty.

28
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,395
What? What do you mean by that?

29
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,715
The Queen Dowager herself is here?

30
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,354
Yes. She heard the deposed heir had been found,

31
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,754
so she left the palace with the excuse...

32
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,395
of visiting the Temporary Palace.

33
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,194
She has many fond memories of the deposed heir.

34
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,275
You cannot spend much time with her today,

35
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,074
but do not say much.

36
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,354
I will keep that in mind.

37
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,235
Go on inside.

38
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,754
I will wait out here.

39
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:24,715
Your Highness.

40
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,635
Seol, is that you?

41
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:46,205
Allow your grandson to greet you.

42
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,275
You had small, frail hands.

43
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,554
My Seol...

44
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:24,275
has grown into a tall, nice young man.

45
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:33,315
May I hold you close?

46
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:38,234
Yes, Grandmother.

47
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:18,755
Gyeom.

48
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,515
My son.

49
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,835
Go on your way.

50
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,395
I will support you.

51
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,114
Madame, it is Ban Ya. I will come in.

52
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:46,554
Is that not a newborn baby's shirt?

53
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,955
What do you want?

54
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,794
I wish to ask you something.

55
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,275
May I attend the next palace party?

56
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,155
You may.

57
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,635
You are now a decent kisaeng.

58
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:10,794
Madame.

59
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,114
Lee Seol, the deposed heir.

60
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:18,315
What would happen if he were to be caught?

61
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,553
Would he be exiled or...

62
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:24,114
Why would you wish to know?

63
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,914
Let us say it is mere curiosity.

64
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,434
He would be beheaded.

65
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:34,395
He will not be allowed to live.

66
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:43,034
Are you well?

67
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,554
You must have suffered so much over the years.

68
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,554
How long have you been in Hanyang?

69
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,474
Do you have shelter?

70
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,955
Please, slow down.

71
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:56,755
I am doing well.

72
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,835
I do not believe this.

73
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,354
That you are before me, Seol.

74
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,114
I apologize.

75
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,914
Why would you say that?

76
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,515
You did nothing wrong.

77
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,034
I committed a grave crime.

78
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,395
I failed to come to you sooner,

79
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,114
causing you such concern.

80
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:31,594
But we met today.

81
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:37,834
That is good enough for me.

82
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,515
(Buyounggak)

83
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,515
Did the meeting with the Queen Dowager go well?

84
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,034
It went smoothly.

85
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,515
Is that why you were pacing?

86
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,635
I am relieved.

87
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:14,554
Why do you look so downcast?

88
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,755
Her Highness cried a great deal.

89
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,554
I felt uncomfortable lying to her.

90
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,515
You are also her grandson.

91
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,485
Had you met her as yourself,

92
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,875
she would still have cried.

93
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:31,875
Would she have?

94
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:39,115
I meant to tell you something else.

95
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:45,115
Lee Seol showed himself at last.

96
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:51,515
Jang Tae Hwa's men chased him along the river,

97
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,074
and the watchman killed them all.

98
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,914
We might soon meet the real Lee Seol.

99
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,074
I thought you should be aware.

100
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,605
Thank you. You always seem to be looking out for me.

101
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,514
Thank goodness the Palace Guards were there to protect you.

102
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,875
Otherwise, you would have been slain by the watchman.

103
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,674
Thanks to Your Majesty, my life was spared.

104
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,995
What do you know about Lee Seol...

105
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,434
that even the watchman is getting involved?

106
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,074
Your Majesty.

107
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,155
To tell you the truth...

108
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:40,605
I am terrified.

109
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,714
If I reveal the truth about Lee Seol,

110
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,394
the watchman will kill me.

111
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,515
And if I keep it to myself,

112
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,395
Your Majesty will take my life. Hence...

113
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,554
I truly do not know what to do anymore.

114
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,194
As you already know,

115
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:06,275
your fate as well as your family's rests in my hands.

116
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,115
I met...

117
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,755
the deposed heir's bodyguard.

118
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,875
The deposed heir's bodyguard?

119
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:43,794
You are aware that I looked for Lee Seol...

120
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,115
as per Master Jang's order, right?

121
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,074
Yes, I am aware.

122
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:49,314
One day,

123
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:53,355
he appeared before me and threatened me.

124
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,794
He said he would spare me once for saving Lee Seol's life in the past.

125
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:01,115
Then he warned me...

126
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:03,395
that he would slay me...

127
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,275
as well as everyone in my family if I looked for Lee Seol again.

128
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,194
Chief Kim.

129
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:11,434
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:15,515
All of Lee Pyeong's guards died years ago. Am I wrong?

131
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,794
That was what I was told,

132
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:22,635
but I will look into it and find out if any of them is still alive.

133
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,235
Is that all you know?

134
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,674
He got a completely new identity.

135
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,914
I believe he is a merchant in Kaesong now.

136
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,554
He told me...

137
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,033
to come and find him at his shop if I wished to leave Hanyang.

138
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:44,275
(Songbang: A fabric shop owned by a Kaesong merchant in Hanyang)

139
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:54,115
- Make way! - Move aside!

140
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,875
Make way!

(Fabric Shop)

142
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,755
May we help you?

143
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,554
We are looking for someone. It is urgent.

144
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:18,235
- Get him! - Go!

145
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:22,674
Stop right there!

146
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,314
Go!

147
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,714
- Search the area. - Yes, sir.

148
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:33,635
- Come along! - Yes, sir!

149
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:38,755
Who is the man that just ran away?

150
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,713
He works for the shop as a clerk.

151
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:42,714
What is his name?

152
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,275
His name is Kim Chi Woon.

153
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,235
What is this about?

154
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,115
He is late today.

155
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:56,995
I wonder if he is very busy.

156
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,115
Oh, my. I suppose I was the one...

157
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:27,635
you were desperately waiting for.

158
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,115
You did not arrive at the usual time,

159
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:33,034
so I just stepped out to see if everything was okay.

160
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:36,194
Normally, you are confined to the annex all day.

161
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,434
I made you come out of the house and wait by the door?

162
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:42,475
Yes. Well done.

163
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:48,714
Were you truly waiting for me?

164
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:54,995
What have you been up to, all by yourself?

165
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,834
Well, you know. I made some ornaments...

166
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,434
and cleaned.

167
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,515
And you put on some rouge too.

168
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,554
Your beauty is surely an issue.

169
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,635
Gosh, what happened to your hand?

170
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,914
Did you get into a fight or something?

171
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,355
Oh, this.

172
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:43,034
I saw a cat walking by over there and tried to pet it.

173
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,875
It must have been...

174
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:54,194
a vicious cat.

175
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,235
I will tell the cat not to be...

176
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,355
so vicious.

177
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,074
I told him exactly what you told me to say.

178
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:12,794
Will he be all right? The Crown Prince's former bodyguard.

179
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,995
I already made all the necessary arrangements,

180
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:16,635
so do not worry.

181
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,954
It is all because you did such a great job of deceiving the King.

182
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,115
I knew what you were capable of when you lied to me about the rent...

183
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:26,355
What?

184

(Garden of Flowers)

185
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,434
You did well,

186
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:37,714
Dan O.

187
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,034
I am afraid someone will see us.

188
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,595
You cannot do this when we are at Garden of Flowers.

189
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,355
Then what do I do when I wish to hold you?

190
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,674
We should come up with a secret sign.

191
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,595
A sign?

192
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,805
Very well. I will do so.

193
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:12,835
Right, Dan O.

194
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,395
There is something you should know.

195
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,115
What is it?

196
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,514
The thing is...

197
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,395
Yuk Ho...

198
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,565
He knows.

199
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,914
Are you planning a coup?

200
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:45,835
That is the only plausible explanation...

201
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,875
for your decision to join the Palace Guards, Your Highness.

202
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,914
Yes, that is correct.

203
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:56,714
Dan O.

204
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:59,355
You asked for more time when you knew everything?

205
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,875
Yuk Ho, that is...

206
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,514
Do you mind stepping out for a moment?

207
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:11,355
I need a word with Dan O.

208
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,674
All of this happened because of me.

209
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:15,595
I wish to stay.

210
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,234
You see,

211
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,914
I was always so proud of you.

212
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:49,635
Even though you lost your parents at a young age, you grew up...

213
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,045
to be such a righteous, good person.

214
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:55,835
So I thought I would never be ashamed to meet your father again,

215
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,875
but I do not feel that way anymore.

216
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,154
"Succeed, and you will become King. Fail, and you are a traitor."

217
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,273
(If you start a coup and fail, you are bound to become a traitor.)

218
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,875
His Highness will surely become one of the two.

219
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,835
Are you sure this is a path you can handle?

220
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,714
I...

221
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,474
thought long and hard.

222
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,994
If it does not go well, awful things will happen.

223
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,194
It terrified me,

224
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,635
so I tried to keep my distance from him.

225
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,045
However, my heart...

226
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,234
It keeps making me turn around.

227
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,565
Of course I am aware of Yuk Ho's concern.

228
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,514
I will talk to him.

229
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,274
Sure.

230
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:32,994
Shall we?

231
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:43,565
Yu Ha, why were you out this late?

232
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:45,914
You frustrate me.

233
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,713
Dan O's heart now gravitates toward another,

234
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,674
but you are too slow to stop it from happening.

235
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,045
Does it seem that way to you as well?

236
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,045
There is no need to take me seriously.

237
00:20:57,994 --> 00:20:59,355
It seems as though...

238
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,754
they harbour a secret I am not aware of.

239
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,875
Si Yeol, I am coming in.

240
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,115
Sure, come in.

241
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,115
What the... What has gotten into you?

242
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:31,835
Were you injured?

243
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,194
Here and there.

244
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:35,805
Not me, but the palace guards.

245
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,595
I know it was to deceive His Majesty,

246
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:46,514
but running off with Dan O's hand in yours...

247
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,234
was a risky move.

248
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:51,155
I could not let the palace guards take her.

249
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:53,075
When Dan O is in danger,

250
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:56,474
will you always choose to act hastily?

251
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,474
I will try harder to be careful.

252
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,315
Yet, you are not saying you will not get involved.

253
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:08,474
Go ahead and turn in.

254
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,474
(Garden of Flowers)

255
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,234
My lady, allow me to go after him.

256
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:09,754
"The Secret Records of Samhan."

257
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,555
This must be about the drawing in it.

258
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:17,754
What does it imply that has Yuk Ho this upset?

259
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,595
Our San...

260
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:23,035
drew something with this unskilled hand?

261
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,035
You said you had burned the book.

262
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:29,635
Surprisingly enough, you are quite a skilled liar.

263
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:33,635
Look at you...

264
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:35,754
dodging the question.

265
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,595
I can say the same about you.

266
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,395
Or maybe I should ask about Mokinhoe.

267
00:23:41,914 --> 00:23:45,314
If you all throw out questions, who will do the answering?

268
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,075
Are you not going to eat?

269
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:50,035
If you are done, I will clear the table.

270
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:55,953
The soup is delicious.

271
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:59,875
Our Dan O can be fierce at times.

272
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:03,835
Quite fierce.

273
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:16,395
Dan O...

274
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:21,395
is the reason I managed to stay alive.

275
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:25,754
Every time I lost the will to live,

276
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,315
I pictured her.

277
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:32,634
I fled Garden of Flowers...

278
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:35,274
without being able to express my gratitude,

279
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:39,075
and that ate away at me.

280
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,473
It is why I do not intend to achieve the great cause...

281
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:46,635
while betraying her generosity.

282
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,115
I understand your determination,

283
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:55,635
but how will you guarantee Dan O's safety?

284
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,354
What if His Majesty chooses to torture her...

285
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,274
If Dan O is ever in danger,

286
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:05,355
reveal...

287
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,875
my identity.

288
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,513
Dan O will not be able to...

289
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,075
which is why I am asking you instead.

290
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:16,355
That is how...

291
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,635
we can protect everyone at Garden of Flowers.

292
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:37,075
You know, I have not been able to sleep properly...

293
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,274
because I am so curious about the story that follows.

294
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:44,474
My lady, are you listening to me?

295
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,875
Gosh. What did you just say?

296
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:55,555
She must have kissed his sweet lips. Do you not agree?

297
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,315
No, nothing like that happened.

298
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,954
Why not put those lips to good use?

299
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:02,395
Goodness.

300
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,394
Well, it...

301
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:10,595
Yeon Yi and the assistant officer are head over heels for one another.

302
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:14,555
How could their story be this dismal?

303
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:20,994
Actually, they kissed. Quite delicately.

304
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,355
Right?

305
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,354
They kissed!

306
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:27,194
Gosh, I was almost disappointed.

307
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,434
Meow.

308
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,434
Was that a cat I heard?

309
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:37,634
Goodness, it will eat all our groceries.

310
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:38,754
- Darn cat... - No, wait!

311
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:42,115
Let me see what it is up to.

312
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,514
Gosh.

313
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:49,794
("The Tale of Yeon Yi")

314
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:50,875
Goodness me.

315
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:54,875
They kissed for sure.

316
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:58,835
Meow.

317
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:11,674
I almost thought it was a real cat.

318
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:13,395
Practicing every time you came to mind...

319
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:16,474
had me greeting the morning sun.

320
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,674
What do I do?

321
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,115
I will think of you every time I hear a cat.

322
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:42,674
How is that a problem when I will always be here for you?

323
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,993
My lady, did you chase the cat away?

324
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:48,155
Ms. Naju, stop!

325
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:49,914
Do not come any closer.

326
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,674
The cat is affectionate...

327
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:56,194
and keeps rubbing up against your face.

328
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:58,115
It was not easy to chase away.

329
00:27:58,315 --> 00:27:59,355
Is that so?

330
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,795
What an odd cat that is.

331
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,474
Kitty, run along now.

332
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,514
- Get going. - Meow.

333
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:09,395
It is cold outside.

334
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,315
You should head back inside.

335
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,075
Sure.

336
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,194
Get going. You do not want to be late for work.

337
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:30,115
Come closer for a second.

338
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:44,274
A longer kiss will be reserved for later.

339
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:51,315
A later moment in time when we will be free of concern.

340
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,474
What brings you to this place?

341
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,835
I am here to see Lady Dan O.

342
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,595
Head inside, then.

343
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:23,914
Scholar Kang.

344
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,595
Could you be...

345
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,914
Are you the deposed heir Lee Seol?

346
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,315
Did you have something to say to me?

347
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:42,714
No.

348
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:45,514
Have a good day.

349
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:58,514
Here.

350
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,194
- Dan O. - Yes?

351
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,673
I heard...

352
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:10,555
that you once looked for a man with a red spot on his ankle.

353
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:12,395
Who did you hear it from?

354
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,714
Madame Hwa Ryung.

355
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,795
He is the deposed heir, is he not?

356
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,875
Why would you ask about that?

357
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,714
A noblewoman like you rarely gets to see a man's ankles,

358
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,555
but it is easy for a kisaeng like me.

359
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,115
I thought I could help.

360
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:37,514
Assistant Magistrate Jang made me look.

361
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:41,274
I have repaid my debt and have nothing to do with it now.

362
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:43,555
I see.

363
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:47,234
Dan O.

364
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:52,674
If he were someone who was very close to you,

365
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,914
what would you do?

366
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,234
Do you...

367
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:00,115
know something?

368
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:02,795
No.

369
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:11,914
(Garden of Flowers)

370
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:14,795
- Ban Ya. - Yes?

371
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,875
If you hear something about the deposed heir,

372
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,754
will you come to me first?

373
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:23,075
It is too big an issue for you to handle alone.

374
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,115
Okay.

375
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:26,595
Do you promise?

376
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:29,234
Bye.

377
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:43,274
What are you doing?

378
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:47,714
It is cold. We need lots of firewood.

379
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:49,514
Give me that. I will help.

380
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,074
There is something you cannot do?

381
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:00,234
That was a mistake.

382
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,074
My hand slipped. I will try again.

383
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:04,754
Okay. Take your time and hold on tight.

384
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:09,795
Why did this...

385
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,914
You should break the firewood,

386
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,635
not the poor axe.

387
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:19,835
Give it to me.

388
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:24,595
You came to talk, did you not?

389
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:27,714
It has been a while since I checked on you.

390
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,274
I think...

391
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,035
a lot happened to you while I was distracted.

392
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:36,595
Is it...

393
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:39,514
related to San?

394
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,115
Well...

395
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:46,315
Can you not tell me anything at all?

396
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:51,115
My lady, what about the delivery?

397
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,115
Come with me.

398
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,514
We must buy groceries too.

399
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:01,555
I have to go.

400
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:03,754
Okay. Go ahead.

401
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:09,395
Come along.

402
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,913
How did it go?

403
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:29,233
I managed to get everyone who worked there to safety.

404
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,234
Well done.

405
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,115
You should be careful for a while.

406
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:34,835
I will do that.

407
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:36,714
If you must send word,

408
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,954
leave a note in the pond like before.

409
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:41,834
Most of us are out at around noon,

410
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:43,274
so come around then.

411
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,075
Yes, Your Highness.

412
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:48,954
No records in the palace remain...

413
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,035
on Lee Pyeong's bodyguards.

414
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,795
You commanded we burn everything related to the coup.

415
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:56,674
Chief Eunuch.

416
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,395
Do you know nothing of him?

417
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:01,954
He was from Kaesong.

418
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,795
His father traded ginseng.

419
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:08,194
His name was...

420
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:10,114
Do you remember?

421
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,754
I am not sure,

422
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,964
but his family name was Kim.

423
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:17,444
Was his name Kim Chi Woon?

424
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:21,115
Yes, I believe it was.

425
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:24,274
Send someone to Kaesong and find him.

426
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,234
Even if he changed his identity, someone must know him.

427
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:30,115
Yes, Your Majesty.

428
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:45,274
This time...

429
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:47,714
it was I who saved you.

430
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:49,444
Thank you.

431
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:52,714
Do not forget your promise.

432
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:55,194
When my life is in danger,

433
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:56,995
then...

434
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:01,555
you must save me.

435
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:04,234
I will. I promise.

436
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:05,995
So,

437
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:08,484
why do you go...

438
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,115
to such lengths for Yoon Dan O?

439
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:17,515
I should not tell His Majesty about the Chief Eunuch?

440
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,314
If you do,

441
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,314
he will interrogate the Chief Eunuch.

442
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:25,035
That will make it impossible to investigate him.

443
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,194
We must find the watchman...

444
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:30,444
and use him to get to Lee Seol.

445
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:36,115
You can take the credit for apprehending Lee Seol.

446
00:35:36,274 --> 00:35:39,444
So for now, you must keep quiet.

447
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:42,354
Very well.

448
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,274
I will do that.

449
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:44,234
You are being followed. Come with me.

450
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:03,634
(Garden of Flowers)

451
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,635
Is anyone in?

452
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:09,714
Good day.

453
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:13,155
Hello.

454
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:15,714
I need a place to stay.

455
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:17,274
Do you have a room?

456
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:19,234
Yes.

457
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:27,484
You chose to join us the day we got groceries.

458
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:29,963
Eat all you want.

459
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:30,964
Thank you.

460
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,394
I hope we all get along.

461
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:35,035
Yes. I am Yoon Gu Nam.

462
00:37:35,314 --> 00:37:36,314
Hello.

463
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:37,635
Wait.

464
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:39,794
You look familiar.

465
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,075
You asked about a room at the tavern.

466
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,873
Were you wandering all this while?

467
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:49,924
I stayed here and there before coming and ending up here.

468
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:53,964
What are you doing here?

469
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:57,233
I have orders from our chief.

470
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:00,035
He wants me to keep an eye on Lady Dan O.

471
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,274
We should eat.

472
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:11,754
Do not follow me today.

473
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,444
Why? Where are you going?

474
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:15,714
Know when to stay away.

475
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:17,234
You said you would.

476
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:18,834
What?

477
00:38:41,674 --> 00:38:43,194
It is our day off.

478
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:44,515
Are you going somewhere?

479
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,484
With that lady?

480
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:54,075
It is fine.

481
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,484
I noticed already.

482
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:57,964
Notice...

483
00:38:58,595 --> 00:38:59,595
what?

484
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:03,484
The moment you ran off with her, hand-in-hand.

485
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,034
If you were just innkeeper and guest,

486
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,484
you would not have held hands so sweetly.

487
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,555
Think whatever you want.

488
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,555
We should go.

489
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:43,995
You said it would be just us.

490
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,635
Why did I bother with a mirror?

491
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,354
Pull harder.

492
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:51,075
Harder.

493
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:52,924
Keep your arm still.

494
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:54,515
Right.

495
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:58,484
There are so many other things a couple could do.

496
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:00,834
Why shoot arrows?

497
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:02,354
What?

498
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,515
I was just saying.

499
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:09,995
Gosh.

500
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:20,714
Even when I am not around,

501
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:23,674
I wish you to be safe.

502
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,834
Are you concerned...

503
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:33,834
because I was chased by the Palace Guards?

504
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:39,314
If you learn how to do it, you will find it useful.

505
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:43,674
It takes time...

506
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,555
to learn a new skill.

507
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,754
Take your time and teach me.

508
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:55,075
Tomorrow and the day after too.

509
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:58,394
Right by my side.

510
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,314
You just wanted to go for a walk?

511
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:11,555
It is chilly. Will you not tell me where we are going?

512
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:16,674
When we get there,

513
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:19,234
you will know.

514
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,515
Before we take our relationship to the next step,

515
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,794
I must tell you something.

516
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,595
Many years ago,

517
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:42,115
I was engaged to someone.

518
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:46,394
I deeply loved him.

519
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:50,635
But one day, when the flowers were in full bloom,

520
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,354
he breathed his last.

521
00:41:58,444 --> 00:42:00,515
(Hyun of the Indong Jang Clan)

522
00:42:05,394 --> 00:42:07,484
That is why I hate flowers.

523
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:10,714
You must have been terribly lonely...

524
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,115
and heartbroken for so many years.

525
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:18,555
Go and see him.

526
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,274
Today,

527
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:23,995
you are all his.

528
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:05,595
It has been eight years.

529
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:08,193
(Hyun of the Indong Jang Clan)

530
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,874
And you are...

531
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,274
still here.

532
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:19,274
Over the past years...

533
00:43:22,555 --> 00:43:24,115
Even though I was alive and breathing,

534
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,444
my heart was dead.

535
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,515
I missed you so much...

536
00:43:39,794 --> 00:43:42,714
that I completely shut myself off from the world.

537
00:43:55,915 --> 00:43:57,674
There is someone...

538
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:03,115
who got me out of the rut and pulled me back into the world.

539
00:44:07,234 --> 00:44:08,874
I am truly sorry...

540
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:11,874
for having to tell you this,

541
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,314
but I now wish to live my life...

542
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:19,754
as Yoon Hong Ju.

543
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:24,354
That is what I wish to do.

544
00:45:21,394 --> 00:45:22,754
It is called Garden of Flowers.

545
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,874
The innkeeper is an amazing cook.

546
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:27,435
Forget it.

547
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:31,754
She really is a great cook...

548
00:45:32,595 --> 00:45:33,674
Hong Ju!

549
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:37,995
- Dan O. - What are you doing here?

550
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:42,075
With Si Yeol, of all people.

551
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:45,754
Dan O, let us go inside. We should talk inside.

552
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:48,874
By the way, why are you two together?

553
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:52,834
Must you ask? Is it not obvious?

554
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,873
(Liquor)

555
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:59,274
So it was you.

556
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:02,915
The one who turned Dan O into a drunkard.

557
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:08,874
She is never like that. I bet you totally broke her heart.

558
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:12,155
That was... I have no excuse.

559
00:46:12,274 --> 00:46:14,793
My goodness. That was your wine.

560
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:16,194
You had hidden it in your room.

561
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,074
And we drank together.

562
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,115
Dan O.

563
00:46:19,794 --> 00:46:22,874
Think about how lonely she had to be to hide wine in her room.

564
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:26,314
Is that why you are keeping her company?

565
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:28,115
You lured my sister out of the house.

566
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:30,515
No, he did not!

567
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:32,794
I asked him to come with me.

568
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:35,115
You know nothing.

569
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,435
Oh, that ornament...

570
00:46:39,754 --> 00:46:41,834
I gave it to you to wear on your wedding day.

571
00:46:42,794 --> 00:46:45,794
Why are you bringing it up now? I put it on because I had it.

572
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:50,314
Dan O looks stunning today, does she not?

573
00:46:52,314 --> 00:46:55,954
She just needs to find a husband now.

574
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:58,035
She is always exquisitely beautiful.

575
00:46:59,354 --> 00:47:02,995
Gosh, stop it. I am not that exquisite.

576
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,234
Am I already hungover?

577
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:08,995
I feel so nauseated.

578
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:13,915
Let us do this.

579
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:16,673
What happened today will stay between us.

580
00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:19,114
Yes. If Ms. Naju and Yuk Ho find out,

581
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:21,035
things will get complicated. Will you be all right?

582
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:43,115
Meet His Highness.

583
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:47,834
Hello, Your Highness. It is an honour to meet you.

584
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,754
Are you the merchant who often travels to Gyeongsang Province?

585
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:54,754
Yes, please just call me Kim.

586
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:57,435
Could you meet the army commander of Gyeongsang Province...

587
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,714
and deliver my letter to him?

588
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:01,955
Yes, I can certainly do that.

589
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:05,314
However, the commander...

590
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,995
is extremely careful and strict with everything.

591
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:10,915
If he does not know who sent the letter,

592
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:13,595
it is highly likely that he will not read it.

593
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:16,995
How could you say that? It is His Highness' letter.

594
00:48:17,955 --> 00:48:19,555
Then what can I do?

595
00:48:20,035 --> 00:48:21,035
Well...

596
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:25,274
If you show me proof that you truly are the deposed heir,

597
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:29,314
I will check it with my own eyes and let him know.

598
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:41,955
(Pyeong)

599
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:49,955
(Garden of Flowers)

600
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,114
The leader of Mokinhoe is trying to take the throne,

601
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:23,674
impersonating Your Highness.

602
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:25,475
His name is Lee Gyeom.

603
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,595
He is Your Highness' brother.

604
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:30,115
Lee Gyeom?

605
00:50:55,995 --> 00:50:56,995
Dan O,

606
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:00,274
have you known all along?

607
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:03,674
Were you aware of San's identity?

608
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:15,834
What do you suddenly need my clothes for?

609
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:18,234
Yu Ha joined Mokinhoe.

610
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:20,035
I wish to know about it.

611
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:29,115
You truly are a quick study.

612
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:31,475
When did you chop all of these?

613
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:33,674
Dan O.

614
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:36,475
Were you aware of everything?

615
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:38,475
Aware of what?

616
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:40,754
What you have been hiding.

617
00:51:41,555 --> 00:51:43,194
The secret between you two.

618
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:44,874
Is it what I think it is?

619
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:48,873
I have no idea what you are referring to.

620
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:49,874
Kang San.

621
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:53,155
His true identity...

622
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,394
has come to my knowledge.

623
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:01,354
- Yu Ha... - Is San the deposed heir Lee Seol?

624
00:52:04,115 --> 00:52:05,475
I am not pressing for answers.

625
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:08,874
You being summoned to the palace must also be relevant.

626
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:10,995
I...

627
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,915
I cannot tell you anything.

628
00:52:18,354 --> 00:52:20,354
You must care for him dearly...

629
00:52:22,194 --> 00:52:23,915
to keep a secret of this magnitude.

630
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:44,994
- Please turn a blind eye. - Dan O.

631
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,635
You are a member of Mokinhoe.

632
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:50,475
You of all people...

633
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:53,074
wish San to be alive.

634
00:52:53,075 --> 00:52:56,035
No, what I truly want is you.

635
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:00,754
It is your safety, Dan O.

636
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:14,714
Yu Ha.

637
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:17,115
Are you not heading out today?

638
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:20,915
Why do you ask?

639
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,874
No reason. It is my day off today,

640
00:53:24,674 --> 00:53:26,115
and I was wondering what you were up to.

641
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:31,915
Did you two argue?

642
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:33,915
Gosh, no.

643
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,394
It is nothing like that.

644
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:38,155
Really?

645
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:41,274
That is even weirder.

646
00:54:28,354 --> 00:54:31,234
I had no idea Mokinhoe had this many followers.

647
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:37,115
How are you here?

648
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:49,435
A member of Mokinhoe resides at Garden of Flowers.

649
00:54:50,274 --> 00:54:51,794
I followed him here.

650
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,155
Is what you wrote in the message true?

651
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:00,635
Lee Gyeom, is he...

652
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:04,075
truly my brother?

653
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:07,555
Yes, I confirmed it myself.

654
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:10,515
I had no idea...

655
00:55:11,674 --> 00:55:13,435
I had a brother.

656
00:55:15,874 --> 00:55:17,874
Why did you never inform me?

657
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,595
The Crown Prince had him extracted at an early age...

658
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:24,115
and arranged for a non-royal family to raise him.

659
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:26,794
After the tragic incident,

660
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:29,915
I was not able to keep track of him.

661
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:32,193
How did you come across him again?

662
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:33,595
It surprised me as well.

663
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:35,115
The leader of Mokinhoe...

664
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,435
was in possession of the Crown Prince's top-knot pin.

665
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:44,874
- His top-knot pin? - It was given to him...

666
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:46,914
as a reminder that he would be brought to the palace...

667
00:55:46,915 --> 00:55:48,635
once he was of age.

668
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:53,115
Let us stay put for now.

669
00:55:57,435 --> 00:55:59,515
I am sure he will be present at today's gathering.

670
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:10,754
Here comes His Highness.

671
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,115
Do you recognize him?

672
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,394
We will sign our names to confirm our pledge.

673
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:35,794
Those who wish to stand with us...

674
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,995
will step forward and show their faces.

675
00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:47,794
(Park Pil Kwon)

676
00:56:53,674 --> 00:56:56,673
I, Yoon Hee Sung, will serve you as my king.

677
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:57,955
(Yoon Hee Sung)

678
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:02,435
I, Jang Tae Eul, will serve you until my last breath.

679
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:11,155
I, Ko Hoon Ki, will serve you until my last breath.

680
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:15,754
(Depose Lee Chang and crown Lee Seol for a better future.)

681
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:20,194
Depose the evil and ruthless king...

682
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:22,794
and take the throne.

683
00:57:23,394 --> 00:57:25,114
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

684
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:27,274
- Please take the throne. - Please take the throne.

685
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,313
Together, we will write history...

686
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:43,115
as those who fought for the greater cause.

687
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:08,393
Will our good deed still be unknown?

688
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:09,635
You asked for me, Your Highness.

689
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:12,274
Lord Sin,

690
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:14,475
are you aware of Lee Seol's identity?

691
00:58:15,475 --> 00:58:18,354
I have not been able to figure it out.

692
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:22,354
What could have prompted this inquiry though?

693
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:24,435
What will you do...

694
00:58:25,475 --> 00:58:26,754
when you find the real Lee Seol?

695
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:29,394
There cannot...

696
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:33,035
be two suns in the sky.

697
00:59:06,435 --> 00:59:07,435
Jung Yu Ha.

698
00:59:10,274 --> 00:59:12,234
Are you the one impersonating Lee Seol?

699
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:20,115
Are you the leader of Mokinhoe...

700
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,595
by the name of Lee Gyeom?

701
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,353
(The Secret Romantic Guesthouse)

702
01:00:00,354 --> 01:00:02,114
We will yet again...

703
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:04,954
have two brothers fighting over the throne.

704
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:07,713
Answer me. Tell me why you did this.

705
01:00:07,714 --> 01:00:11,034
Do you believe you can take down His Majesty on your own?

706
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:13,753
I would like to live my life as myself.

707
01:00:13,754 --> 01:00:16,233
That day will surely come.

708
01:00:16,234 --> 01:00:18,434
Do not ever crumble.

709
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:19,673
You should watch your back,

710
01:00:19,674 --> 01:00:22,434
or the impostor might take your place for good.

711
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:24,914
You are Lee Seol no matter what others say.

712
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:27,873
I am also aware that only one Lee Seol can exist.

713
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,274
I will never let it happen.
