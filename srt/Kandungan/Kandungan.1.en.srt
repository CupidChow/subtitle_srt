1
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,947
Let’s stop this.

2
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,451
I can’t do this anymore.

3
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,411
It was a one-time thing.

4
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,499
It was never a one-time thing, Louie.

5
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,922
Just pay it tomorrow.

6
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,758
Tomorrow— Here—

7
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,304
Hey girls, here it is!

8
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,974
Go, grab yours.

9
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,644
Here. Okay.

10
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,522
Hey, hey—payment?

11
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,141
- Next week.
- Okay.

12
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,336
- Good morning!
- Here she goes again.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,839
- Did you bring mine?
- Yes! Of course.

14
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,784
- There it is! Good thing you brought it.
- It looks great.

15
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:01,134
- Here it is—
- This is a secret— You—

16
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,466
- I’ll just transfer the payment.
- Okay. Thanks!

17
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,061
- Girl!
- Mm?

18
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,338
What’s up? It’s been a month
since you bought anything.

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,341
Girl, I just don’t have
the budget right now.

20
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,636
- Maybe next time—
- But what about my kids?

21
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,765
Gotta go— sir’s here.

22
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,681
Sir’s here— he’s here.

23
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,978
Sir is here.

24
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,729
Good morning, sir.

25
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,966
Hi, sir.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,238
- Good morning, sir.
- He's here.

27
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,371
Is this yours?

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,331
Uh—

29
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,688
Yes, sir. Sorry.

30
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,500
Thank you.

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,646
Girl, are you almost done?
The ride’s here.

32
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,492
- Just a bit more.
- Come on!

33
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,312
- Finish that tomorrow. Let’s go.
- Five minutes!

34
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,603
- I'm almost done!
- Let’s go with them.

35
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,942
- Girl, we’re heading out.
- Come on already.

36
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,670
- How much longer?
- I’m almost done, I swear.

37
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,281
- Alright, sir, I’m coming down.
- Wait!

38
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,082
Wait!

39
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,469
Sir Louie! You’re early.

40
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,306
Am I?

41
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:45,052
Sir, just chill for a bit,
I’ll have your table fixed.

42
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,410
- Sure, thank you.
- Oh, sir—

43
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,021
- There’s a new one— 19 years old.
- Oh yeah?

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,399
- Sexy, right? I’ll go—
- Nice.

45
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:54,767
Enjoy, sir.

46
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,289
- The usual, sir?
- Yes, boss.

47
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,089
You uh... got a name?

48
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,809
Okay.

49
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,852
Let me guess. Hmm...

50
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:36,300
Can you do a little turn for me?

51
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,994
Long black hair.

52
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,663
Simple but sexy dress.

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,873
Bit of a snob.

54
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,751
I’m gonna say...

55
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,795
Donna?

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,676
No, I'm Alice.

57
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,883
Alice.

58
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,370
Donna, Alice— close enough.

59
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,596
- Uh, Dave?
- Yes, sir?

60
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,603
Can I get a martini for Alice?

61
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,150
Okay. Got it, sir.

62
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,729
You here alone?

63
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:18,156
Wanna join me?

64
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,795
I'm alone.

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,366
Sure, but I’m here with some friends.

66
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,703
That’s fine. Where are they?

67
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,955
Bring them over.

68
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,091
Uh...

69
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,505
My table’s over there.

70
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,093
Okay, I’ll go get them.

71
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,221
Alright. Don’t keep me waiting.

72
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:52,435
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay, sir.

73
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,605
Here’s your martini, ma’am.

74
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,605
Where is it?

75
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:17,236
Hey, you’ve been walking in circles.
What are you looking for?

76
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,953
Nothing— just my pen.

77
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,913
Girl, here’s a pen. Go.

78
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:24,968
- Thank you.
- Sure.

79
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,748
Where is—

80
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,483
Where is it?

81
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,743
Not here...

82
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,914
Chloe?

83
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:21,940
Sir?

84
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:25,931
Read this. Tell me what’s
in that manuscript,

85
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,917
and if it's worth publishing.
Report to me tomorrow morning.

86
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,804
Okay, sir.

87
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,028
You’re not heading home?

88
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,034
Uh, no, sir. I’m still finishing something.

89
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,715
- I can give you a ride home.
- It’s okay, sir. No need.

90
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,491
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye.

91
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,114
What’s going on?

92
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,913
Where is it...

93
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,919
What if Sir Louie found my journal?

94
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,968
It’s not here.

95
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,682
Who owns this?

96
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,338
Chloe.

97
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,796
Sir?

98
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,064
You done with your assignment?

99
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,176
Didn’t I say first thing in the morning?

100
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,055
Sorry, sir. I’ve just
got a lot on my mind.

101
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:36,996
Ah, sir—actually I still have
something to finish.

102
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,452
Cora.

103
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:51,595
- What’s this?
- Just look.

104
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:57,491
Can you check if sir is still watching?

105
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,022
He’s gone.

106
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,220
- You sure? Thanks.
- Go.

107
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,832
It’s a bit late. Overtime?

108
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:23,789
Is that okay with you?

109
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,696
Yes, sir. I just have to finish something.

110
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,203
Hardworking.

111
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,961
How long have you been working
at my company?

112
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,848
About two, or three years now, sir.

113
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,539
Are you done with the
manuscript I gave you?

114
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,889
Almost, sir.

115
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:03,600
Maybe by next week.

116
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,043
Yeah? Okay.

117
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,240
Let me get that for you.

118
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,551
Ms. Castro...

119
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,108
Thank you, sir.

120
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:58,688
Sir?

121
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,632
Can I please have my journal back?

122
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,833
Sir...

123
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:23,550
Yes, Chloe?

124
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,410
Can I get my journal now?

125
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:36,116
Chloe, in my office please.

126
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,118
Sir?

127
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:53,138
Wow.

128
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:56,069
You look good.

129
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:02,457
Anyway, have you ever thought
about publishing your journal as a book?

130
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,759
Not really, sir.

131
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:08,807
Maybe at first. But now…

132
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,548
I don’t think it’s meant for
other people to read.

133
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,587
But your writing is good.

134
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:19,654
We just need to edit some parts
and that will sell.

135
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:22,932
You’re being ridiculous, sir.

136
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:26,979
There are already so many aspiring
writers trying to get published.

137
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,147
Why don’t we just focus on that?

138
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,079
Too bad.

139
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:37,783
Well, if you ever change your mind,
just let me know.

140
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:39,834
Okay, sir.

141
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:45,535
By the way, Chloe,

142
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,664
this wasn’t in your journal, but...

143
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,223
I want to try this.

144
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,276
This time, I want you to be
the dominant one.

145
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,569
Blindfolds?

146
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,616
Chains?

147
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:09,692
Whips?

148
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,851
And all, sir?

149
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,641
Are you sure, sir?

150
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,549
Me? Yeah.

151
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,217
You?

152
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,658
Are you really sure about this?

153
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:46,465
I can't still believe you

154
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:48,981
have these kind of fantasies.

155
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,298
Because I’m shy and clumsy?

156
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,035
I am shy, sir—

157
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,494
—but not in the way you think.

158
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,420
Hi, love! Surprise!

159
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:30,488
Love!

160
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,919
- I brought your favorite.
- What uh—

161
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:35,457
You didn't tell me you were
coming over.

162
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,309
Come on— just wanted to surprise you.

163
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:43,084
Thanks. Yeah— I’ll give
this to the boys.

164
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,307
- You liked it?
- Yeah. How are you?

165
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:48,539
- How are you?
- I’m okay. You?

166
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,759
I’m okay. I just had a meeting
at a coffee shop nearby,

167
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,578
so I thought I’d swing by
and surprise you.

168
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,954
Thank you.

169
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:00,654
One more thing—

170
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:06,751
It’s been a while
since we’ve done this.

171
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,934
Okay...

172
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,839
Mm-hmm, yeah—
We’re— We’re engaged.

173
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,850
Hmm… So when’s the wedding?

174
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:43,133
Probably next year—I don’t know.
Or maybe the year after that.

175
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:54,042
Louie, what if we just stop this?

176
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,383
What if your fiancée catches us?

177
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,378
First of all, call me sir.

178
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:06,618
And don't worry, Abby wouldn't know,
unless you talk.

179
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:08,731
So keep your mouth shut,

180
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,203
so we can keep doing this.

181
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:14,208
Okay, sir.

182
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:30,021
- My gosh, it's been like a year since we—
- So long!

183
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:33,978
- [chattering]
- Hi, guys! Fresh from Japan!

184
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,150
- I actually brought something for you.
- Oh!

185
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,255
- Wow.
- You were there for three weeks, right?

186
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,602
His boss loves him.
Even my boss does.

187
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:44,172
Can you believe it’s been what?
Fifteen? Ten?

188
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:48,013
- It’s fifteen!
- Fifteen, girl!

189
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:50,779
Wow—by the way,
congrats to you both!

190
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,126
Yeah!

191
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,779
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

192
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,288
But I’m more excited about you two.

193
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,118
Wow—it’s been a long time, huh?

194
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:02,311
Exactly. Honestly, I still can’t believe

195
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,296
we made it ten years, right?

196
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,871
We were there for the
hard times, by the way.

197
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,471
But we’re happy for you guys.

198
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:15,110
By the way, how did you guys
make it this far?

199
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,027
Honestly? You wanna know?

200
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:20,399
- Yeah, obviously!
- Of course!

201
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,593
Oh no, Abby might freak out.

202
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:25,676
Why would I freak out?
You know I live for gossip.

203
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,330
As soon as you hear this,
I know you'll regret asking.

204
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:31,540
Impossible! Spill it already!

205
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,855
She can handle it. I'm sure.

206
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,258
There’s nothing wrong
with a little advice, right?

207
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:39,200
Well, if you really wanna know...

208
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:43,491
you need to spice things up a little.

209
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,726
- Spice it up?
- Yep! Like...

210
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:49,141
- What kind of spice?
- Anything goes!

211
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,852
- Anything goes, okay.
- It’s true.

212
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:53,372
You know, at first,

213
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:57,996
- I didn’t agree to those things either.
- Okay.

214
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,563
But it saved our marriage, so now
we do it every now and then.

215
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,672
Wait—what exactly are “those things”?

216
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:05,717
Yeah, what is it?

217
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,494
- A lot! Are you ready?
- Are you ready?

218
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,812
Okay, I’m ready. Go!

219
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:15,360
We started with role-playing,
then it led to...

220
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:16,974
Threesome.

221
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,961
- Threesome?
- Threesome?

222
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:21,516
- Why not?
- No— Are you serious?

223
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,319
We’re not kidding.

224
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,304
- Seriously?
- Wow!

225
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,629
- That’s wild.
- You’re crazy!

226
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,183
I think you should try.

227
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,375
- We uh—
- We—

228
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,246
Okay... glad that worked for you guys,

229
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:39,102
but I don’t think it’s
for us. Right, love?

230
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,360
I, uh...

231
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,440
- Why not?
- It's not for us.

232
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:48,017
- Just no. That’s not for us.
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

233
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:53,728
Anyway, good for you if you don’t
need those kinds of things.

234
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:56,798
But for me and Carlo—

235
00:38:57,222 --> 00:38:59,211
we enjoy the spice.

236
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,631
You’re crazy, you know that?

237
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,821
- Let's have a cheers.
- Okay.

238
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,485
Cheers to the spice!

239
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,806
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

240
00:39:47,195 --> 00:40:06,654
[background chatter]

241
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,528
Hm?

242
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,411
What is it?

243
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:25,721
Love!

244
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,134
- Come here.
- Why?

245
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,467
- I’m still doing something.
- Come on, come on.

246
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,785
What is it?

247
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:37,678
Hm?

248
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:40,669
You always do this—

249
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:46,449
Why do you love
putting me on your lap?

250
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,473
Because it makes me feel powerful.

251
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:53,162
You? Why do you like sitting on my lap?

252
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,822
Because, I feel safe with you.

253
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,955
Okay, I really need to work now.
I have a lot to prepare.

254
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,067
Kiss me.

255
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,154
Next time.

256
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,001
Next time?

257
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,562
- Yeah, next time.
- Come on—

258
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:25,201
Love, I still have so much to do.

259
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:27,208
What about you? Are you done?

260
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,318
Yeah, I’m done.

261
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:32,238
Okay, good. But I still
have a lot to finish.

262
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,717
I’ve got tons to prep, okay?

263
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:36,867
Okay?

264
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:59,103
- Love, I’m heading out for a bit.
- Okay.

265
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:00,550
I'll be at the bar for some drinks.

266
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:43,947
Do you really want a threesome?

267
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:46,801
Oh shit!

268
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:16,763
Shit...

269
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:20,262
Oh yeah, you like it?

270
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,019
[murmuring]

271
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,438
[murmuring]

272
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:29,968
Oh yes.

273
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,861
Oh, yes!

274
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:00,023
Yes!

275
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:16,910
Hello, Louie, where are you?
Our threesome guest is already here.

276
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,637
Excuse me, sorry,
what’s your name again?

277
00:44:21,778 --> 00:44:23,822
- Darren.
- Darren.

278
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:27,482
Yeah, I’m on my way. Just a sec.

279
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:37,656
You’re going out?

280
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:41,180
Uh...

281
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,939
Why are you leaving?

282
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:53,835
I'm not going anywhere.

283
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:48,068
Uh...

284
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,219
So… are we still
doing the threesome?

285
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:01,489
Just the two of us now.

286
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,373
You're crossing a line, Chloe.

287
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,183
You don't knock?

288
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:20,122
But, sir, you stood me up last night.

289
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,746
You need to make it up to me now.

290
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:25,580
I told you—we need to be careful.

291
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,557
I wish Abby was as wild as you.

292
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:43,895
Abby?

293
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:47,566
Abby, wait!

294
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,112
Shit!

295
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,827
Abby!

296
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,376
- You think there’s something between them?
- It’s pretty obvious.

297
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,462
Don’t assume—You guys
don’t know anything.

298
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,759
Just ignore them, Chloe.
They don’t know what really happened.

299
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,308
Even I don’t know the full story.

300
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:23,990
But if you want to talk,
I’m just here.

301
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:26,878
- We are.
- Oh—We’re here.

302
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:30,378
So… What really happened?

303
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,114
To be honest,

304
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:37,225
I didn’t even know he had a fiancée.

305
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,709
Did you guys know?

306
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:44,529
No one here knew either.

307
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,515
But still,

308
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,793
instead of stopping it,

309
00:50:50,532 --> 00:50:51,700
I let it keep going.

310
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:55,441
Damn—so he manipulated you
into continuing it?

311
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:59,108
That guy’s a total jerk.
He lost all my respect.

312
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:02,780
Let it go.
It was my fault too.

313
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:08,117
But you know what, Chloe,
if it were me, I’d never do that to you.

314
00:51:08,687 --> 00:51:11,982
- We’d never.
- Oh, right—We’d never do that.

315
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,443
Abby.

316
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:22,802
Hear me out.

317
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:25,962
Why should I?

318
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:28,151
What are you even going to say?

319
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,800
I saw it. With my own eyes.

320
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:34,600
You don’t know the context—

321
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:38,591
What the hell? What context
are you talking about?

322
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:40,932
I literally saw her giving you a blowjob!

323
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:49,026
So what now?
You're gonna let this ruin us?

324
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:52,490
What you did wasn’t
a small thing, Louie.

325
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:55,316
It's nothing.

326
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:57,237
Alright?

327
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,311
Actually,

328
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:05,343
this is your fault too.

329
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,455
- My fault?
- Yeah.

330
00:52:08,412 --> 00:52:09,496
You wanna know why?

331
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:11,756
You never gave me what I wanted.

332
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:13,302
Right?

333
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:35,111
“I slowly walked over
to where Louie was,

334
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:37,430
with a condom in my mouth,

335
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:42,414
tying my hair back without
breaking eye contact.”

336
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:44,318
Okay, do you really
have to read all that?

337
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:46,012
Shh—Shh.

338
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,081
“When I got to his desk,

339
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,224
I undressed myself right in front of Louie,

340
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,202
and he couldn’t do anything about it.”

341
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,053
“He didn’t even resist—he wanted it too.”

342
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,299
“And then he whispered:”

343
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:05,118
“I wish you were my girlfriend.”

344
00:53:10,516 --> 00:53:13,265
Fine. I won’t leave.

345
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,486
But I want you to publish this book.

346
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:23,106
I want everyone to know
what kind of woman she is.

347
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,586
Publish it as is.

348
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:30,430
Abby, anything but that.

349
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,527
I don't think it's right to
ruin somebody’s life.

350
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:36,820
So it’s okay to ruin mine?

351
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:39,806
Your life's not ruined.
Stop being so dramatic!

352
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:45,022
If you publish that book, you won't just
ruin her life but mine too.

353
00:53:45,942 --> 00:53:48,236
Wow, you’re still defending her?

354
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,394
Maybe this really is my fault.

355
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:54,910
Maybe it’s my fault that I couldn’t
give you those fantasies.

356
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:56,777
Yeah! You’re right.

357
00:53:57,115 --> 00:53:58,617
- Okay.
- It is your fault.

358
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:02,221
If you’d given me what I wanted,
we wouldn’t be in this situation.

359
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,869
So tell me what
you want me to do.

360
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:07,373
Abby!

361
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,810
Stop walking away from me—
Abby—

362
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,743
Abby!

363
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:19,805
Fire her.

364
00:54:20,678 --> 00:54:24,849
I don’t want to see her anywhere, not ever.

365
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,867
I’ll still need time to decide
if I even want to marry you.

366
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,184
Can I get my journal back now?

367
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,940
No, we'll keep it.

368
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,561
And if you ever speak up,

369
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:34,938
I’ll make sure everyone knows
your dirty little secret.

370
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:37,514
Especially what’s written in this journal.

371
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:42,516
I’m really sorry.
I didn’t know...

372
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:43,861
- that he had a fiance.
- Save it.

373
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:09,886
What?

374
00:56:11,092 --> 00:56:14,053
Abby, I’m kind of busy.

375
00:56:16,534 --> 00:56:17,702
You’re so clingy.

376
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,422
Stop it, hey—

377
00:56:32,274 --> 00:56:33,359
What do you want?

378
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:09,045
That was amazing.

379
01:01:10,702 --> 01:01:12,389
If only you'd agree to a threesome.

380
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:24,802
Where are you going?

381
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:27,343
I’ve had enough.

382
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:31,893
I can’t do this anymore.

383
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:44,044
Um, I’m— I’m confused.

384
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:47,635
It was a one-time thing.

385
01:01:49,158 --> 01:01:50,493
You know I don't love her.

386
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:52,845
I love you.

387
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,043
It was never a one time thing, Louie.

388
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:01,404
And I wasn’t just talking about her.

389
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:09,718
It’s this constant craving
for adventure and excitement.

390
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,049
That was your drug.

391
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:18,256
You’re an addict.

392
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:21,502
Abby, wait--

393
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,764
Sir Louie!

394
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,069
Sir Louie!

395
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,395
- Sir Louie.
- Yeah, wait, wait.

396
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:59,977
- Sir Louie!
- I’m coming. Wait.

397
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:03,075
- Ah, shit—
- Sir Louie.

398
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,411
- Sir Louie!
- Yes, yes! Wait, wait.

399
01:03:27,795 --> 01:03:29,590
- Sir—
- What the hell, man?

400
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:31,304
You’ve been gone from
the office for so long, Sir.

401
01:03:31,328 --> 01:03:33,211
Here’s the manuscript
you’ve been waiting for.

402
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:37,340
I don't have time for this.

403
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:39,934
- I don't have time for this, man.
- This is what you've been waiting for.

404
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,532
I’m— I’m busy. Can you not see
that I’m busy?

405
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:45,018
- But—
- Another time, Jasper. Okay?

406
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:47,442
- Get back to work.
- But Sir, this is what you asked for.

407
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:49,510
Sir, wait— Busy doing what?

408
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:52,490
Busy ruining your life?

409
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:55,332
- Busy ruining your company?
- Excuse me?

410
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:58,619
You’re not the victim here, Sir.

411
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,086
Chloe is— And your fiancée.

412
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:05,392
Have the decency to man up... Sir Louie.

413
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:08,904
Oh, you're fired. Today’s your last day.

414
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,166
Your coffee.

415
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,424
Aren’t you going to say anything?

416
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,718
What do you want me to say?

417
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,173
Everything’s already out in the open.

418
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,893
Chloe, we haven't talked
for over a month.

419
01:04:57,637 --> 01:04:59,437
I'm just asking how are you?

420
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,117
The nerve you have to even ask me that.

421
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,152
You knew I had a fiancé, right?

422
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,041
I'm trying to fix things with her.

423
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,573
Exactly.

424
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,105
You never told me.

425
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,704
If she didn’t show up at the office,
I wouldn’t have found out.

426
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,708
It’s always my fault.

427
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,547
Well, uh...

428
01:05:37,509 --> 01:05:40,503
Your first check, for your book.

429
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,629
I still can’t believe
you’re that kind of person.

430
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:51,278
You didn’t even
apologize for what you did.

431
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:54,171
And now you’re just going to
publish that like it’s nothing?

432
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,287
I followed every one of
your conditions, didn’t I?

433
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,457
That book belongs to me.

434
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,961
And no one else should ever read it.

435
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:09,939
This is a beautiful story.
And you should be proud of it.

436
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,677
I'm doing you a favor!

437
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:17,044
I published this book as a way
of saying sorry.

438
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:20,306
Read it,

439
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:22,451
and you’ll understand.

440
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,816
I'm sorry, Chloe.

441
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,068
You didn’t deserve what I did to you.

442
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,611
Goodbye, Louie.

443
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:56,707
Abby, can we meet?
Can we talk?

444
01:06:56,756 --> 01:07:03,598
Louie, if you’re still hoping
we can fix this—please don’t.

445
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:04,738
Don't you still love me?

446
01:07:05,714 --> 01:07:08,632
You know I can’t forget what happened.

447
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:12,926
We can’t go back to
the way things were.

448
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,978
Don’t say that.

449
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:18,265
I don’t feel safe with you anymore.

450
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:22,687
And I know I’m not enough for you.

451
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,332
We’ll only end up
hurting each other again.

452
01:07:26,132 --> 01:07:29,001
You cheating on me. Me hating you.

453
01:07:29,165 --> 01:07:31,429
Let’s not wait until it gets there.

454
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:34,458
Goodbye, Louie.

455
01:07:44,215 --> 01:07:46,639
All because of that book.
