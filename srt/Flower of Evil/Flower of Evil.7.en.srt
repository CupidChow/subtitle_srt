(Summer, 2005)

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,189
What's the matter?

10
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,669
Catch him!

(Flower of Evil)

12
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,189
Why did you do it?

13
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,360
Did you have to live this way?

14
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,069
You had no choice, right?

15
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,470
Please give me just one reason...

16
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,910
why I should forgive you.

17
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,720
What's wrong?

18
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,629
I had a dream.

19
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,560
About what?

20
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,199
It was just a dream.

21
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,439
By the way, why are you up so early?

22
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,569
You're the one who slept in.

23
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,279
What time is it?

24
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,379
It's 8:55am.

25
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,779
What?

26
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,149
- Eun Ha needs to go to school.
- I'll drop her off.

27
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,920
It's unlike you to sleep in.

28
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,160
Ever since I came back home,
I've been so sleepy.

29
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,730
I guess coming home
took the edge off my tension.

30
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,230
A lot had happened.

31
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,040
But everything feels normal...

32
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,540
since nothing changed.

33
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,990
Right, I forgot
to give you this yesterday.

34
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,220
It's a welcome back home gift.

35
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,930
What is it?

36
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,829
I couldn't find your watch.

37
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,529
I even asked the forensics,
but they didn't see it either.

38
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,029
It's not as great
as the previous one,

39
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,870
but I hope you still like it.

40
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,769
I love it.

41
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,379
Make sure you don't lose this one.

42
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,050
I guess one thing has changed.

43
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,319
(Episode 7)

44
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,160
Wait. Drink this before you go.

45
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,300
Here you go.

46
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,939
- Eun Ha, sit down and drink this.
- Okay.

47
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,310
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

48
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,410
By the way,
the lock to the workshop basement...

49
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,350
was broken.

50
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,120
I broke it.

51
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
Didn't I tell you?

52
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,889
No, you didn't.

53
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,829
You know my friend Sun Mi, right?

54
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,829
She needed a baby walker,

55
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,899
and I remembered Eun Ha had one.

56
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,230
But you were hospitalized,

57
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,699
and I had no idea where the key was.

58
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,779
Was the basement messy?

59
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,519
You had cleaned up the area well.

60
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,189
- Are you done with that?
- Yes.

61
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,860
Let's go.

62
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,189
We'll get going now.

63
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,990
- See you later, Eun Ha.
- Okay.

64
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,379
I'd like to see my husband's
family relation certificate.

65
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,579
Is one copy enough?

66
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,379
I've received a tip-off
that there was an accomplice...

67
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,549
to the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

68
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,049
Today, I will reveal...

69
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,220
the accomplice's voice.

70
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,419
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

71
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,860
1.5 million views in half a day?
Is that even possible?

72
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,169
There are
over 2,000 articles already.

73
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,269
Goodness.

74
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,799
What did I tell you?
I said it'd be a huge hit, right?

75
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
Gosh, they're already blowing up
our phones.

76
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,740
Hello?

77
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,809
Yes, Kim Mu Jin speaking.

78
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,649
Right. Thank you.

79
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,120
(Family Relation Certificate)

80
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,950
(Father: Baek Man Woo,
Mother: Gong Mi Ja)

81
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,360
Do Hyun Su lived as Baek Hee Seong
for at least 14 years.

82
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,960
And the latter's parents
cooperated voluntarily.

83
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,629
But why?

84
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,899
No way. This is that serial killer
Do Min Seok's voice?

85
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,669
No, it's his accomplice's voice.

86
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,139
"Accomplice"?

87
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,809
He had one?

88
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:33,879
Yes, but they didn't know
that he had one up until now.

89
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,549
Isn't that creepy?

90
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,779
Let me hear it again.

91
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,019
("Reporter Kim Claims
the Yeonju Case Had an Accomplice")

92
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,360
Lady. Don't meddle.

93
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,360
You're not the only one who saw me.

94
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,360
I saw you too.

95
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,429
You have a small, red car.

96
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,179
(May 12, 2002, 2:30am)

97
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,990
Excuse me.

98
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,259
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,629
It's absolutely my fault.

100
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,340
I heard the witness doesn't remember
the culprit's face at all.

101
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,210
It was late at night,

102
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,409
and his hat was covering his face.

103
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,379
It was difficult for her to see.

104
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,279
There's a slight scratch.

105
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,289
I'd be very grateful
if we could settle this.

106
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,919
The witness had been driving
under the influence.

107
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,990
That's why she was reluctant
to call the insurance company.

108
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,529
The culprit asked for her number
on the pretext of the accident.

109
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,370
(Jang Young Hee)

110
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,029
"Honey, why did you drink so much?"

111
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,629
This is what the culprit said...

112
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,870
as he forced the woman
back into his vehicle.

113
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,440
And that woman was Jung Mi Sook?

114
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,769
That's correct.

115
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,879
(Gyeonggi 58, G 3194)

116
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,450
The witness immediately reported it
to a police station nearby.

117
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,120
The police looked into the vehicle
and Do Min Seok.

118
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,590
However, the latter's alibi
checked out.

119
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,960
This is when Do Hyun Su,
his son, came into the picture.

120
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,200
He testified that he had watched
a movie with his father...

121
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,929
during the time of the incident.

122
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,169
He submitted two movie tickets
as evidence.

123
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,909
On the other hand,
the witness's testimony...

124
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,740
lost credibility due to the fact
that she had been drinking.

125
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,980
Funnily enough,
the witness's driver's license...

126
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,980
was revoked
after she had reported the incident.

127
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,149
But everyone was shocked...

128
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,490
- two weeks later.
- That's right.

129
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,649
Do Min Seok committed suicide.

130
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,490
The police who were investigating
this case...

131
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,590
found right-hand thumbnails
and items...

132
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,929
belonging to his victims...

133
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,399
including the late Jung Mi Sook's
in his own workshop.

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,830
Like so,
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case...

135
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,740
was revealed to the public...

136
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,740
and lost its arraignment right
at the same time.

137
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,740
Soon after, Do Hyun Su murdered...

138
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,679
the village foreman and ran away.

139
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,750
What do you think
would've happened...

140
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,649
if the police considered
the possibility...

141
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,519
of Do Hyun Su and Do Min Seok
being accomplices to each other...

142
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,519
when investigating the kidnapping
of Jung Mi Sook?

143
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,460
What's worse is that...

144
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,059
only after Do Hyun Su
became a murder suspect...

145
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,759
did the police hurriedly visit
the witness.

146
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,769
However, she was already...

147
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,399
Being threatened by the accomplice?

148
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,570
That's right.

149
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,009
The witness changed
all of her past statements...

150
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,639
and the police were caught
in a pickle as well.

151
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,080
Instead of admitting
their poor investigation,

152
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,950
they decided to bury the case.

153
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,419
Then let's listen to
the culprit's voice one more time.

154
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,620
We hope all of you listen carefully.

155
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,360
Lady.

156
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,860
Don't meddle.

157
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,960
You're not the only one who saw me.

158
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,429
I saw you too.

159
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,940
You have a small red car.

160
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,769
I know where you work and live too.

161
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,279
You should watch yourself
when you have kids.

162
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,509
Hey lady,

163
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,850
have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

164
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,850
Do you know why he died?

165
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,889
Because he meddled...

166
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,259
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

167
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,860
It's obvious.

168
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,169
His son is the accomplice.
Don't you think?

169
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,269
Let's wrap it up now. Thank you.

170
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,279
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,980
I changed the lock.

172
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,450
I wanted to leave it open,
but Eun Ha concerns me.

173
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,679
The stairs are too steep.

174
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,690
Reporter Kim Mu Jin announced
an exclusive.

175
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,190
And lost its arraignment right
at the same time.

176
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,559
Soon after, Do Hyun Su murdered...

177
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,629
the village foreman and ran away.

178
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,100
What do you think
would've happened...

179
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,899
if the police considered
the possibility...

180
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,870
- of Do Hyun Su and Do Min Seok...
- Mr. Kim is quite famous.

181
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,299
He's even on TV.

182
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,539
I heard there's an accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

183
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,080
Did you hear his voice?

184
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,350
It's gone viral on the internet
right now.

185
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,320
The accomplice's voice?

186
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,820
Do you want to hear it?

187
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,389
No. That would just creep me out.

188
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,700
Can I watch something else?

189
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,370
- Honey.
- Yes?

190
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,470
What are you doing tomorrow?

191
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,139
The same thing as usual.

192
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,950
Then can you meet me
in the afternoon?

193
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,450
What? For a date?

194
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,250
Something like that.

195
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,389
That sounds great.

196
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,860
I'll go get some rest now.

197
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,460
Okay.

198
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,090
Lady.

199
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,559
Don't meddle.

200
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,460
You're not the only one who saw me.

201
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,259
I saw you too.

202
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,930
- Kim Mu Jin!
- Kim Mu Jin!

203
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,930

206
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,009
You're the best, best, best

207
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,779
You're totally the best

208
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,049
You're the real deal

209
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,529
You're the best, best, best

210
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,960
Kim Mu Jin is the best

211
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm going to love you deeply

212
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,640
Deeply, deeply, deeply

213
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,980
I'm going to love you

- Kim Mu Jin!
- Attention!

218
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,259
I have an important announcement
to make.

219
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:14,230
The number of followers
on my social media...

220
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,329
has just passed 200,000!

221
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,609
- Congratulations!
- 200,000!

222

(Baek Hee Seong)

223
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,509
Hold on, hold on.

224
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,150
Hold on.

225
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,049
What is it? What do you want?

226
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,880
It seemed like you were implying...

227
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,450
Do Hyun Su was the accomplice
on tonight's broadcast.

228
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,759
I have reasonable doubt. So what?

229
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,059
You have to set things straight.

230
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,099
If Do Hyun Su and that witness's
statements turn out to be true,

231
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,799
- it may be another...
- Who are you...

232
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,769
to keep ordering me around?

233
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,799
Am I some servant
working at your house or what?

234
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,910
Why do you keep making orders,
you punk?

235
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,549
Pull yourself together
and listen carefully.

236
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,349
I listened to the accomplice's voice
numerous times,

237
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,049
and there's something that bugs me.

238
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,119
You're the one
who needs to listen carefully.

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
I told you to listen.

240
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm listening.

241
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,470
From now on, this case
isn't about your life...

242
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,670
but mine.

243
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,299
I'll help you.

244
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,440
Cut the nonsense.

245
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,950
You know what?
You're the key suspect.

246
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,089
Hey, Kim Mu Jin.

247
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,190
You have to trust me.

248
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,299
Why? Oh, since you have something
on me?

249
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,069
Or what? Are you going to
lock me up in your basement...

250
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,799
and threaten me again?

251
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,740
Hey. Do as you please.

252
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,779
Hey, let's just go head-on...

253
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,380
and see who breaks first.

254
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,619
I can't trust you.

255
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,269
(Gangsu Police Station)

256
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,000
Some of you may know already,

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,799
but the headquarter was already
considering...

258
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,369
a reinvestigation due to
Park Gyung Chun's case.

259
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,740
I guess you'll need to hurry...

260
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,210
because of that voice
from yesterday.

261
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,079
Which team will take this?

262
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,309
Teams 1 and 2 are already busy
with a voice phishing...

263
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,049
and arson case.

264
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,920
Woo Chul, what is your team doing
right now?

265
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,289
These are pictures of the lettuce...

266
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,019
stolen from Bangjeong-dong
two weeks ago,

267
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,130
and these are the site pictures
of stolen peppers from this week.

268
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,829
Considering the similarity
of the two cases,

269
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,329
it seems like the culprit...

270
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,700
is the same person.

271
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,980
Chief.

272
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,809
Yes, Chief...

273
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,680
You little...

274
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,490
Aren't you going to take care of
the lettuce robbery case?

275
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,950
It's already been two weeks.

277
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,789
- In my opinion...
- Yes?

278
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,329
Man, I'm not curious at all
about this case. My goodness.

279
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,500
What?

280
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,799
- Right.
- What is it?

281
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,539
You realized something?

282
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,079
How about leaf wraps for lunch?

283
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,710
My mouth is drooling.
Ji Won, how about some leaf wraps...

284
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,180
Where did she go?

(Counseling Office,
Children's Consultation center)

286

This is the Consultation center.
We found the video you asked for.

287
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,900
(Do Hyun Su, admitted due to
depression and aggressiveness)

288
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,440
Hyun Su,

289
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,309
did you really throw
your neighbor's dog...

290
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,880
into the well?

291
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,220
Yes.

292
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,309
What do you think trust is?

293
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,980
It's about keeping a promise.

294
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,150
No matter how inefficient and
unreasonable that promise is,

295
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,789
you still need to keep it.

296
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,119
That's what trust is.

297
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,069
The problem resolved without
me having to kill Park Gyung Chun,

298
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,170
so I thought you'd be pleased.

299
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
But...

300
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,470
you're yelling at me.

301
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,609
That's...

302
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,980
a different matter.

303
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,420
Lady. Don't meddle.

304
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,930
You're not the only one who saw me.

I saw you too.

306
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,500
You have a small red car.

307
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,940
I know where you work...

308
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,839
Is this you?

309
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,180
Tell me. Is this you?

310
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,019
- No.
- Well,

311
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,460
that's hard for me to believe.

312
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,299
This is the result of you
breaking our promise.

313
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,599
How can I trust you?

314
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,799
I can't trust you.

315
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,809
Hyun Su.

316
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,740
I want to trust you.

317
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,390
I really thought you'd be happy...

318
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,460
because I didn't kill
Park Gyung Chun.

319
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,829
That's why...

320
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,970
I want us to make a new promise.

321
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,809
If you're ever at the risk...

322
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,950
of being found out again,

323
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,849
leave.

324
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,890
Go somewhere no one can find you.

325
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,289
Do it for everyone.

326
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,990
If you'll do that,

327
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,700
I'll look after
your wife and child forever.

328
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm suggesting we should avoid
the worst scenario.

329
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,740
You must know what the worst is,
don't you?

330
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,240
I understand.

331
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,509
Good.

332
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,319
I'll trust you.

333
00:25:57,829 --> 00:25:59,559
(The Hanjoogan)

334
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,599
Hey. Hey, get up.

335
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,400
This is no time for a nap.

336
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,670
Go away. I hit 200 thousand.

337
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,940
Are you kidding?

338
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,240
Hey, it's another exclusive.
They only want to speak to you.

339
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
Who is it this time?

340
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,279
Hey.

341
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,089
Hey. That's her.

342
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,230
It's Do Hae Su.

343
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,000
- We must be in luck. She came...
- Ms. Kang.

344
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,339
What is it?

345
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,009
Ms. Kang. How do I look right now?

346
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,710
You look like a homeless.

347
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,089
Ms. Kang. I'm really sorry,

348
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,259
but can you go buy me a dress shirt?
Some wet napkins too.

349
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,789
What are you talking about?

350
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,430
Gosh.

351
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,930
Well... Do Hae Su and I were...

352
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,470
You know.

353
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,099
What are you talking about?

354
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,970
- First...
- "First"?

355
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,140
First love.

356
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,549
- Really?
- Yes.

357
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,950
I can't go out
looking like this right now.

358
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,480
When did you last see her?

359
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,150
17 years ago.

360
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,190
Hey. No, this isn't right.

361
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,730
This won't do.

362
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,299
Please save me, Ms. Kang.

363
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,140
It's okay. You can tell me.

364
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,839
The one I wanted to get rid of
was the owner of that dog, Mr. Kim.

365
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,609
He's rude and unpleasant.

366
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,549
But I can't kill a person.

367
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,220
It'd be too difficult
to clean up after a person.

368
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:06,690
Hyun Su.

369
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,599
Can you take a look at this drawing?

370
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,970
How do you think
this child's feeling?

371
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,140
Why do you think she's crying?

372
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,740
I don't know.

373
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,349
- How old was he then?
- He was 13.

374
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,759
Would you say Do Hyun Su...

375
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,690
was born with...

376
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,230
an antisocial personality disorder?

377
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,730
Do you want to watch
this video as well?

378
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:55,869
Try drawing this.

379
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,509
Do you see the cassette tape player?

380
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,420
Yes.

381
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,289
- Hyun Su.
- Let go.

382
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,460
Please calm down.

383
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,859
Teacher!

384
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,029
- Teacher.
- Let go!

385
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,059
He's normally quiet and calm,

386
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,230
but he'd suddenly turn violent
whenever it involved that player.

387
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,200
What is that anyway?

388
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,240
No one knows.

389
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,170
Not even his family.

390
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,109
Ji Won.

391
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,180
- The stolen lettuce was in the bin.
- Let's talk later.

392
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,180
But...

393
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,549
Captain,

394
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,460
why do you think the criminal
threw away the stolen lettuce?

395
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,990
I have a meeting...

396
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,730
because of the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

397
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,430
- At our station?
- Let's talk later.

398
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,099
But...

399
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,700
Why is everyone telling me
we should talk later?

400
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,069
Unbelievable.

401
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,160
- This is Cha Ji Won.
- Yes, Detective Cha.

402
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,970
You gave me Do Hyun Su's bag
last time...

403
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,099
It's hard to hear you.

404
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,170
When you gave me the bag last time,

405
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,940
you said Mr. Nam Soon Gil thought...

406
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,269
Do Hyun Su would one day
return for the bag.

407
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,009
Why is that?

408
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,509
He told me Do Hyun Su...

409
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,049
was extremely attached
to the cassette player in the bag.

410
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,049
You're breaking up.

411
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,160
I'm at a temple right now...

412
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,529
for Soon Gil's ceremony.

413
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,890
Ms. Lee Kang Ok.

414
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,779
Were you in Seoul all this time?

415
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,750
That's amazing. I wonder
why we never ran into each other.

416
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,619
Because 10 million people live here.

417
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,619
Right.

418
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,660
Seoul is a global metropolis.

419
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,490
I'm proud of it.

420
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:09,869
By the way,

421
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,400
you've changed a lot.

422
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,140
- Really?
- Yes.

423
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,509
Back then,
you had so many friends...

424
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,109
and would laugh
at the smallest things.

425
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,809
How do I put this?

426
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,650
You seemed like the star
of an idol group.

427
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,890
My father murdered seven people.

428
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,160
Of course,
my personality's bound to change.

429
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,559
Right.

430
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,700
Gosh.

431
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,069
Right, how's work?

432
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,000
I heard you're a special effect
makeup artist.

433
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,299
I don't know much about it,
but it sounds like fun.

434
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,069
I was fired.

435
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,609
I see.

436
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Mu Jin, should we leave?

437
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,049
Already? Are you busy?

438
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,349
That's not why.

439
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:07,859
Do you see the man
who's reading a book behind me?

440
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,829
Don't make it obvious.

441
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,569
Yes, I see him. Who is he?

442
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,369
He's a reporter.
He believes I'm hiding Hyun Su.

443
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,140
I keep running into him these days.

444
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,910
Isn't this stalking?

445
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,910
I don't want to cause a scene...

446
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,109
and give him something
to write about. Let's just leave.

447
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,319
I think this is a serious matter.

448
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,890
Can we go somewhere private?

449
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,349
I have something important
to tell you.

450
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,890
"Somewhere private"?

451
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,329
Hey lady,

452
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,130
have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

453
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,529
Do you know why he died?

454
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,339
Because he meddled...

455
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:59,480
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

456
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,079
Do you know why he died?

457
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,880
Because he meddled...

458
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,119
when he's...

459
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,429
Do you know why he died?

460
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,159
Because he meddled...

461
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,369
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

462
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,940
Do you recognize this?

463
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:34,409
This is...

464
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,880
Do Hyun Su's belonging.

465
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,079
You're right.

466
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,650
I heard he was obsessive over this.

467
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,449
There's a cassette tape inside.

468
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,860
Do you know what's in it?

469
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
Hyun Su.

470
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,730
It's raining.
Come inside and have a drink.

471
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,210
What is this that
you're listening to all the time?

472
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,880
Let me hear it as well.

473
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,920
Hey! Let me go!

474
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,050
You should let go first.

475
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,719
Hey!

476
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,929
You're a lunatic!

477
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:27,360
If you touch it again,
I'll break your arm.

478
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,269
I was going to fire him,

479
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,940
but he was an excellent worker
for just 300 dollars.

480
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
Whenever he was listening to that,

481
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,079
he looked bewitched.

482
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,219
I could see it in his eyes.

483
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,349
He'd suddenly turn violent
whenever it involved that player.

484
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,360
Sir.

485
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,329
I actually have a favor
to ask of you.

486
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,130
Welcome...

487
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,440
Eun Ha,
you better listen to her, okay?

488
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,539
Okay.

489
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,139
What are you doing?

490
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,039
I have to go somewhere,
so please take care of her.

491
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,750
- No.
- Please feed her dinner.

492
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,320
I'll pick her up by 8pm.

493
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,349
All right, then.

494
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,320
I trust that you'll do your share
of the work, Eun Ha's grandma.

495
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,889
Wait!

496
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,030
How could she do this?

497
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,800
How am I supposed
to take care of you?

498
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,769
Grandma said that the family
will always love each other.

499
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:45,579
She said you'll eventually love me
as well.

500
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:49,179
- What?
- I'll be studying,

501
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,250
so you can keep working.

502
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,929
(Elementary Math)

503
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,500
(Math Grade 3)

504
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,000
What is this?

505
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:13,000
This is too advanced for your age.

506
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,000
I can solve them.

507
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,610
Does your mom force you to do this?

508
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,139
Does she punish or hit you
if you don't do this?

509
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,510
No, I just do it.

510
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,250
Don't.

511
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,420
This will drive you up the wall.

512
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,590
Both you and your mom will go crazy.

513
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
You're scaring me!

514
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,260
I want to go home!

515
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,159
Don't cry. I'm doing this for you.

516
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,269
Please stop crying.

517
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:52,210
What do you want me to do?

518
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,380
I want a tart.

519
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,010
What?

520
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,750
I want an egg tart.

521
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,059
Do you know why he died?

522
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,559
Because he meddled...

523
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,170
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

524
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,320
Do you know why he died?

525
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,329
(The Culprit's Voice
at the Time of the Incident)

526
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,860
Because he meddled...

527
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,500
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

528
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:57,869
Hey.

529
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,380
Sit down.
I have something to tell you.

530
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,690
Sit.

531
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,900
Okay.

532
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:29,869
What is this?

533
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,980
It's Do Hyun Su's bag.

534
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,010
The late Nam Soon Gil had it.

535
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,380
I was lucky to get it.

536
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:46,659
But what does this bag
have to do with you?

537
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,789
I'm going to catch
Do Hyun Su myself.

538
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:58,869
Alone?

539
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,869
Yes. It's not within
my station's jurisdiction.

540
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,480
How will you catch him
with just this bag?

541
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,780
That's exactly why I need your help.

542
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,070
Take a look.

543
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,860
I can be like you too.

544
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,030
I can also deceive you
without blinking an eye.

545
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,440
I believe Do Hyun Su
is still doing metal crafting.

546
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,309
When he was a deliveryman
at a Chinese restaurant,

547
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:16,010
he said he wanted to open a workshop
with the money he earned.

548
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,809
He was often crafting
in the storage...

549
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,719
so that he wouldn't lose his touch.

550
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:23,619
Even a layman could see
that he was very talented.

551
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:27,519
Ask the metal craft association
for help,

552
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,889
and maybe
they could narrow down artisans...

553
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,059
who have similar styles
to those drawings.

554
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:41,940
That's impossible.

555
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,639
It's impossible
to distinguish the style...

556
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,780
without looking at the actual works.

557
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,079
It's impossible to know
whether they specialize...

558
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,880
in big or small works...

559
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,289
or about their habits.

560
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:00,260
We don't even know
what kinds of materials they use.

561
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,860
That's why...

562
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,960
I'd like you to come with me
to Do Min Seok's workshop.

563
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,210
What?

564
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,039
I heard Do Hyun Su shut himself
in the workshop often...

565
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,409
and even ditched school.

566
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,409
I saw on the news last time...

567
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,920
that the workshop was full of
handicraft items.

568
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,119
You have time this afternoon, right?

569
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,530
Yes.

570
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,829
Why don't we consider this a date
and go there?

571
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,599
Sure.

572
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,800
I'll go get the car,
so get ready and come out.

573
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,769
Hurry up and eat.

574
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,010
I can't leave the pharmacy
unattended.

575
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:28,880
Okay.

576
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,190
No, eat slowly.
You'll have an upset stomach.

577
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,090
Okay.

578
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:48,000
You know, when I ripped
your math book earlier...

579
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
I won't tell on you.

580
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,739
I don't want you to be scolded
by Dad.

581
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:55,199
Who is he to scold me?

582
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,739
Why are you trying so hard?

583
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,809
What?

584
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,980
To catch Do Hyun Su.

585
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,519
It's the talk of the town.

586
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,920
They're saying he's the accomplice
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

587
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,750
If I catch him,
I'll receive a special promotion,

588
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,019
and my career as a detective
will bloom.

589
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,599
I'm surprised. I didn't know
you were so ambitious.

590
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,869
Who isn't ambitious?

591
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,199
You need to grasp the opportunity
when you can.

592
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,019
It's here, come on in.

593
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:18,690
You can wear these.

594
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,989
Come in.

595
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,329
The only place I could think of
was my house.

596
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,099
For us to talk privately.

597
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,059
It's fine.

598
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:34,639
Well, you can take a seat here.

599
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:37,239
Make yourself at home.

600
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,780
Are you hungry?

601
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:47,079
- It's almost time for dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

602
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,380
I'll make something quickly.

603
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,889
How about some pasta?

604
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:52,289
- Mu Jin, I'm not hungry...
- I received this wine as a gift.

605
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,719
My uncle owns a big wine factory...

606
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,389
in Argentina.

607
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:01,630
So he sends me wine like this
occasionally.

608
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:04,099
Wine from Argentina...

609
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,940
has a quite bitter taste,

610
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:08,900
but it's very sweet.

611
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,840
You're doing well.

612
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,809
- I'm glad.
- I have to visit my uncle one day.

613
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:21,579
Have a sip of this.

614
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,719
Oh, thank you.

615
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,150
I'll be right back.

616
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,889
How about some music?

617
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,909
To be honest,

618
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,849
I sometimes...

619
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:56,019
No, I often thought of you.

620
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,190
So, I think...
I think you're the biggest victim.

621
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,500
Because of your dad and Do Hyun Su,
you had to...

622
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,429
You're just a normal person.

623
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,570
I have no bias toward you.

624
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:19,070
I didn't mean what I said to you
when we broke up...

625
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,420
That voice isn't Hyun Su's.

626
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,460
- What?
- That accomplice's voice.

627
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,030
It's not Hyun Su.

628
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,349
Do you still want to cover for him?

629
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,150
If you do this,
do you think he'll feel grateful?

630
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,360
No.

631
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,889
Your brother doesn't care about you
at all...

632
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,159
and he's living happily.

633
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,269
Hyun Su would never say that.

634
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,500
Say what?

635
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,849
It's because...

636
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,719
I killed him.

637
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:43,159
What?

638
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:45,690
The real killer of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case...

639
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,900
is me.

640
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,949
(Private Land, No Trespassing)

641
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,650
It feels like
we'll never come back out...

642
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,360
once we go in there.

643
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,219
Come on, follow me. Hurry up.

644
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,719
This way. Stand right here.

645
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,090
If you become this tall,
I'll find your mom.

646
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,559
Look.

647
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,369
What do you have to do
to become this tall?

648
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,670
You need to eat well.

649
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,039
Will you become taller
if you continue to starve like that?

650
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,539
You won't.

651
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,610
Do you understand?

652
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,949
Hae Su, why are you getting angry
at me?

653
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,150
I'm not getting angry,
I'm just worried about you.

654
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,679
Hae Su. Hyun Su!

655
00:50:56,489 --> 00:51:00,630
(Gagyeong-ri)

656
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,840
No matter what Dad says,
just say yes.

657
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:11,010
Unless you want to rewrite
"Myeangsim Bogam" in the basement.

658
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:12,710
Got it?

659
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,210
Let's go.

660
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,460
What are you doing?

661
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:30,960
Coming.

662
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,940
It's locked. We can't go in.

663
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,219
Over here.

664
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,480
I wonder if it's Do Hyun Su
who made this.

665
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,320
Can you tell his signature
from this?

666
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,699
He's too inexperienced.

667
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,570
It looks pretty exquisite to me.

668
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,340
This is a wax carving.

669
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,699
It's not metalware.

670
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:26,309
They used soft wax and carved it...

671
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,940
to create the mold,
then used a casting.

672
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,519
Do you see these fine lines here?

673
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,019
These are marks from the file.

674
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,789
If you look here, it's asymmetrical.

675
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,760
This happened
because they're terrible at filing.

676
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,429
They're just acting smart
with the wax carving.

677
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,530
Yes. This is his signature.

678
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,000
His horrible filing ability.

679
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,469
This has no commercial value.

680
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:57,769
He was still young.

681
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,840
He might be much better now.

682
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,340
I don't know.

683
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,550
No one can tell.

684
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,289
Too bad.

685
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,389
We came all the way here,
but we didn't learn much.

686
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,929
Actually, there's somewhere else
I really want to go.

687
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,369
The scene of the crime.

688
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:34,579
The basement.

689
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,449
Why do you want to go there?

690
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,119
If you feel uncomfortable,
stay in the car.

691
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:45,550
I'll go look at it by myself.

692
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,420
No.

693
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,059
Let's go.

694
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,400
It's the stench of blood.

695
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,800
It won't go away unless you
clean it up with hydrogen peroxide.

696
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,070
How does this voice sound to you?

697
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,440
It sounds sad to me.

698
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,710
I feel like this person is crying.

699
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,150
What is that?

700
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,949
It was inside Do Hyun Su's bag.

701
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,829
Why are you taking it out now?

702
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:41,329
This is the trigger for him.

703
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,929
Do Hyun Su was normally calm,

704
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:49,170
but whenever he heard this tape,
he'd suddenly become violent.

705
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:53,840
But no one knows how he got it...

706
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,780
and what the story is
behind the tape.

707
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,920
This tape was made...

708
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,690
where things no one knew about
was happening.

709
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,960
I think it could be here.

710
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:18,099
Really?

711
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,880
Since when did Do Min Seok
start killing people?

712
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,949
I can't even guess.

713
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,719
Who knows?

714
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:44,159
Maybe Do Min Seok forced
his young son...

715
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:48,000
to serve food and water
to the confined victims here.

716
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:04,250
I want to go out now, Ji Won.

717
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,449
I bet Do Hyun Su reminded himself
of what he did...

718
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,849
while listening to this voice.

719
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,449
Vividly.

720
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,989
It would've been sweet to him.

721
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,599
That's why he lost his temper
whenever he was disturbed.

722
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,530
I said, let's go.

723
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:29,099
Why isn't he here yet?
It's about time.

724
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,909
Is someone coming?

725
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,179
Yes.

726
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,010
The owner of the Chinese restaurant
Do Hyun Su worked for.

727
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,920
He told me he still has some
ornaments at home Do Hyun Su made.

728
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,159
He was nice enough
to offer to bring them here.

729
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,699
Can you meet with him
and check the ornaments?

730
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:57,929
They were made three years after
the one we saw earlier,

731
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,239
so they'll be much closer
to the work Do Hyun Su does now.

732
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,380
He must be here.

733
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,650
Are you here?

734
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,760
Yes, Detective Cha.

735
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,500
I'll arrive in five minutes.
I'm almost there.

736
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,699
When you drive up to the entrance,
you'll see my car.

737
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:30,829
Okay.

738
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,909
Do Hyun Su. Show your true self.

739
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,320
Make your choice.

740
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,719
What happens to us in the future
will be determined by you now.

741
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,510
What's wrong? What is it?

742
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:20,210
I can't...

743
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,210
I can't breathe.

744
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,250
Let's get out of here.

745
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:32,320
- Please.
- Okay.

746
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:43,260
Let's go to the hospital.

747
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,269
I'm fine. Let's just go home.

748
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,909
I think it was because
of the stench.

749
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,010
The smell was revolting,
but I endured it.

750
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,050
Was I too hard on him?

751
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,489
No. He deceived me
for the past 14 years.

752
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,460
I can't go soft on him.

753
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:16,030
By the way,

754
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:19,530
where is he?

755
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,000
(Nam Soon Gil)

756
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,289
Sir.

757
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,429
What brings you here?

758
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,769
I'm here to bid him farewell.

759
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:54,469
Where's Detective Cha?

760
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,809
Why are you looking for her here?

761
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,039
What? We had agreed to meet here.

762
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:09,019
Sir, my husband suddenly got ill,

763
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,590
so I'm going back to Seoul.

764
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,349
Oh, no. I hope it's nothing serious.

765
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,789
I'm driving right now,
so I'll call you again later.

766
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,769
Ji Won, don't do it.

767
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,599
Don't do what?

768
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,500
Chasing after Do Hyun Su.

769
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,809
Why not?

770
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,139
I don't want you to.

771
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,809
You said
he could be a serial killer.

772
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,050
It's dangerous.

773
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,150
That's why I'm doing it.

774
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,219
A dangerous man is at large.

775
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:15,150
If...

776
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:19,789
you're ever at the risk
of being found out again,

777
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:22,289
leave.

778
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,329
Go somewhere no one can find you.

779
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:28,730
Do it for everyone.

780
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,889
I know you were deeply hurt as well.

781
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,690
You loved our family.

782
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,460
You trusted and respected my father.

783
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,400
You were the only friend
Hyun Su had back in school.

784
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,530
And to me...

785
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,039
There was no one else
who loved me unconditionally...

786
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:45,940
like you did.

787
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:48,679
That's enough.

788
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,210
You were 18 as well.

789
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,380
You must've been
greatly confused and hurt.

790
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:58,289
But no one cared about you.

791
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,889
No one apologized to you.

792
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:06,360
I know it's late,
but I'd like to apologize.

793
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,230
I'm sorry.

794
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:13,099
But...

795
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,670
Hyun Su isn't the person
you should hate.

796
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,679
He's innocent. It was all me.

797
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,110
I killed him.

798
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,250
Isn't this an exclusive?

799
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,989
- What?
- So...

800
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:35,090
I beg you.

801
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,989
Stop tormenting my brother,
you scumbag!

802
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,710
Who is it?

803
01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:03,079
Hey.

804
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,820
What's going on?
Why are you here at this hour?

805
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,789
You told me not to call.
That's why I came here.

806
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,600
Ji Won is driving me crazy.

807
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,869
What are you rambling about?

808
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,909
Find my sister for me.
I need to see her.

809
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,680
Your sister? You mean Do Hae Su?

810
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,090
I'm sorry about last time.

811
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:42,560
I apologize
for using this against you.

812
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,140
Why are you suddenly doing this?

813
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,939
Are you happy now? Then help me out.

814
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,470
You...

815
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:02,979
I have...

816
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:06,079
to catch that jerk at all costs.

817
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:33,710
I've altered it by adding a tracker.

818
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,039
You can download the tracking app.

819
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,020
I hope you still like it.

820
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,250
I love it.

821
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:25,430
(Flower of Evil)

822
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,300
The victims all vanished
into thin air,

823
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,399
yet no one bothered
to look for them.

824
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:30,500
Except for Jung Mi Sook.

825
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,229
Do Min Seok only lent his car.

826
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,229
His accomplice was the one
who met her.

827
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,069
After fighting with her husband,
she packed up and left.

828
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:39,539
So why did Park Gyung Chun
report her missing?

829
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:41,579
He approached me on purpose.

830
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,810
I'm certain we'll be able to find
the accomplice here.

831
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,550
You seem extremely motivated.

832
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,979
I truly want to solve this case.

833
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,220
Let's feign ignorance
and go our separate ways...

834
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,850
as Baek Hee Seong and Cha Ji Won.
