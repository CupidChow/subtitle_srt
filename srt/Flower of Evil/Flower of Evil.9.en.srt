8
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,250
What is it?

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,390
What is it?
Why do I have to walk in like this?

10
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,219
Hold on.

11
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,189
- There's a step. Be careful.
- Okay.

12
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,310
There.

13
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,540
- Can I look?
- Yes.

14
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,420
It's so beautiful.

15
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,090
I'm so happy.
When did you decorate all this?

16
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,930
Baby, are you happy too?

17
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,129
She's kicking.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,299
You should feel it.

19
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,879
Can you feel her?

20
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,620
Why do you always get so startled?

21
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,819
It's strange...

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,430
to think that something alive
is inside you.

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,359
Actually, I'm still not used to it.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,030
Say a few words to our baby...

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,069
to commemorate this moment.

26
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,270
Okay.

27
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,090
You don't need to clear your throat.

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,419
This is when
our baby's hearing is developed.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,889
I'm self-conscious.

30
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,259
Okay. Whenever you're ready, sir.

31
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,840
We moved...

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,340
into a new house.

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,840
We decided to use yellow wallpaper
in your room.

34
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,810
I hope you'll like it.

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,889
I'm sure she will.

36
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,300
Let's eat. I've prepared
boiled pork, your favorite.

37
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,000
It's oyster and boiled pork.

38
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,939
Yes, it is.

39
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:23,169
How did you know I was craving this?

40
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,039
You must see through me.

41
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,780
It was about time you craved it.

42
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,620
It feels like
I'm always on the receiving end.

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,550
Is there anything you want from me?

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,090
Yes, there is.

(Episode 9)

47
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,139
Ji Won, what brings you here?

48
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,780
I didn't expect to see you here.

49
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,439
Well...

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,349
I was helping him out.

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,949
He was curious about Do Min Seok
being a metal crafter.

52
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,560
That's funny of you.

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,430
Why did you hide the fact
that you were with my husband?

54
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,730
I would've found out
about it anyway.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Sir, was our rendezvous
supposed to be a secret?

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,800
I had no idea.

57
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,970
Right. I wonder why
I hid it from you.

58
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,810
May I go inside
and talk with you guys?

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,600
Who are you?

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,269
Aren't you Detective Cha Ji Won?

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,970
I didn't expect to see you here.

62
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,410
Have you been well?

63
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,279
Who were you again?

64
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,350
Sorry?

65
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,449
You had visited me
to ask questions...

66
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,149
about Park Gyung Chun.

67
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,459
Do the police investigate
with their imagination lately?

68
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:26,930
Ms. Do Hae Su?

69
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,470
That's me.

70
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,439
You seem very different from then,
so I couldn't recognize you.

71
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,410
You were quite cold toward me.

72
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,279
You refused to cooperate as well.

73
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,279
Back then...

74
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,149
I'm sorry about that.

75
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,920
That's okay.
You don't need to apologize.

76
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,329
You must be writing
a huge exclusive,

77
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,199
seeing how you've invited
my husband and Ms. Do.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,399
Mr. Baek and I met
for the first time today.

79
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,509
You see, Mu...

80
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,180
Reporter Kim and I have known
each other for a while.

81
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,009
We've been friends
since we were little.

82
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,220
I wanted to help him
catch the accomplice.

83
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,829
I'm not here to interrogate you.

84
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,600
Sorry?

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,259
You don't need
to explain yourself.

86
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,269
Right.

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,639
(Jung Mi Sook, Accomplice, Trap)

88
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,040
What is all that?

89
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,120
(Jung Mi Sook, Accomplice, Trap)

90
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,750
Serve her some coffee.

91
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,990
Something sweet like Einspanner
will do.

92
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,779
"Trap"?

93
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,740
(Trap)

94
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,709
What does it mean?

95
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,050
Ji Won.

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,459
Is my helping him a hindrance...

97
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,959
to your investigation?

98
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,459
Not at all. He's just doing his job.

99
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,769
Here, here. Have some coffee.

100
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,639
This one's for you.

101
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,680
How did you know
I was craving sweet coffee?

102
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
Gosh, I'm so sharp-eyed.

103
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,079
This is a talent you're born with.

104
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,779
Scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours.

105
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,750
You're also looking
for the accomplice.

106
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,660
I don't know
if I can be of any help.

107
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,329
This. What does this "trap" mean?

108
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,639
It's nothing.

109
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,209
Apparently, Do Min Seok liked
setting traps.

110
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,180
Perhaps, he used traps...

111
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,279
to kidnap his victims.

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,419
That's what she thought.

113
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,519
Yes, that's what I thought.

114
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,129
Sir, why don't you ask her...

115
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,169
what you had asked me a while ago?

116
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,570
And what was that, Mr. Baek?

117
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,009
The audio file.

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,309
Audio file?

119
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:01,950
That?

120
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,690
Honey.

121
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,190
- Cotton swab.
- What? Right.

122
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,350
Mom...

123
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,529
Mom...

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,870
What are you doing?
Hee Seong's calling your name.

125
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,870
Hee Seong, I'm here.

126
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,879
It's me, your mom. Can you...

127
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,080
recognize me?

128
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,720
It's not...

129
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,419
your fault.

130
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,500
I am.

132
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm truly sorry.

133
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,370
Mom.

134
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,970
Don't cry.

135
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,750
That man...

136
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,789
What?

137
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,029
What happened to him?

138
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,389
What did you say?

139
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,700
That...

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,399
person...

141
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,409
who got hit by my car...

142
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,250
Hey lady,

143
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,889
have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

144
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,529
Do you know why he died?

145
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,360
Because he meddled...

146
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,669
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

147
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,539
Did you hear that strange noise
in the background?

148
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,879
Judging by the lack of pattern,
I don't think it's a machine.

149
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
Then what could it be?

150
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,889
How would I know?

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,559
Right.

152
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,159
If you could recognize
this sound instantly,

153
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,000
that'd mean you're the accomplice.

154
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,730
But...

155
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,370
there's an agency that analyzes
voice recordings for the police.

156
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,769
We were going to request
their service anyway,

157
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,409
so I'll ask if they can analyze
this sound too.

158
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,610
Man, this is why there should be
a detective in every family.

159
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,519
I...

160
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,649
I'm afraid...

161
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,360
I'll have to go.

162
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,029
Good luck, then.

163
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,330
Ms. Do, do you wish
for the accomplice to be caught?

164
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,809
Of course.

165
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,639
Doesn't everyone wish that?

166
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,980
But it might be Do Hyun Su.

167
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,120
No. It isn't Hyun Su.

168
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,860
How could you be so certain?

169
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,960
The Hyun Su I know will never do
something like that.

170
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,529
It seems like the Do Hyun Su
that you and I know...

171
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,230
are very different.

172
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,740
I met a counselor who knew
Do Hyun Su when he was young.

173
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,110
She said although Do Hyun Su
lacked empathetic abilities,

174
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,950
he had exceptional
cognitive abilities.

175
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,149
That's why after he became
an adult,

176
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,950
he became so good at
manipulating others...

177
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,049
for his personal gain.

178
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:44,059
I saw the counseling video myself,

179
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,830
and this is what he actually said.

180
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,769
"Although I wanted to kill
a person,"

181
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,509
"I killed that person's dog
instead..."

182
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,340
"because It'd be too difficult
to clean up after a person."

183
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,279
I said Hyun Su didn't do it.

184
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,450
Then who is it?

185
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,720
It's obvious who would do
such a thing.

186
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,259
Do Min Seok?

187
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,429
Yes.

188
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,600
Why do you think Do Hyun Su is
taking the blame for Do Min Seok?

189
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,570
That's what I want to ask.

190
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,000
Why he did that.

191
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,139
How he could do that.

192
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,450
What he was thinking
to do something like that.

193
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,009
Why would he take the blame...

194
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,649
Ms. Do Hae Su.

195
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Is there something
you want to tell me?

196
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,529
Yes.

197
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,799
There's something you need to know.

198
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,009
About what I did.

199
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,840
About what Hyun Su didn't do.

200
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,639
What do you mean?

201
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,279
To tell you the truth,
the Gagyeong-ri...

202
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,789
- Gosh.
- Hey.

203
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,419
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

204
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,559
Goodness, do you know
how much...

205
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,929
this costs, Mr. Baek?

206
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,769
I'm sorry. It must've slipped
from my hand.

207
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,870
Why are you spilling something
you're supposed to drink, Mr. Baek?

208
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,870
This is one of the most
latest laptops.

209
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,179
I'm so sorry, I sincerely apologize.

210
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:39,980
Whatever.

211
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,250
Can you all leave now?

212
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,980
I want to be alone.

213
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,470
Wait.

214
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,100
Oh.

215
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,240
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

216
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,850
For not telling you about
helping Reporter Kim.

217
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,580
You don't have to tell me everything
just because we're married.

218
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,179
Don't worry about it.

219
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,590
Thank you.

220
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,019
It's not like
I tell you everything either.

221
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,659
Let's go now.
I need to get back to work.

222
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,500
Okay.

223
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,970
Were you really about to tell
Detective Cha?

224
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,250
Mu Jin, I want to receive
hypnotherapy.

225
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,120
- What?
- I'm certain I saw the accomplice.

226
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,750
I want to try remembering
through hypnotherapy.

227
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,519
I want to help Hyun Su
in any way I can.

228
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,359
And after that?

229
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,369
If Hyun Su doesn't need
your help anymore,

230
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,200
what will you then?

231
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,880
Do you want to hang out with me?

232
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,140
Like the old times?

233
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,980
If...

234
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,250
Hyun Su doesn't need me anymore,

235
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,420
I'm going to do
what I was supposed to do.

236
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,799
Something I had to do but couldn't.

237
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,029
What?

238
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,170
See you.

239
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,369
That means Do Min Seok
and the accomplice...

240
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,240
met at least twice...

241
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,039
while handing over the car key.

242
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,309
Then Do Hyun Su must've seen
the accomplice.

243
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,039
If...

244
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,180
If you were Do Min Seok,

245
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,849
how would you give the accomplice
the car key?

246
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,190
What do you mean?

247
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,390
That's been bugging me all along.

248
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,329
Do Hyun Su's role was to prove
Do Min Seok's alibi,

249
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,329
and it only makes sense that
there was an accomplice...

250
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,799
who used Do Min Seok's car
to abduct the victims.

251
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,369
Really?

252
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,910
That's why he must've given
the accomplice the key directly.

253
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,410
That's our conclusion.

254
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Keep going. This is interesting.

255
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,519
According to Do Hyun Su's
handwritten affidavit,

256
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,250
that day, Do Min Seok...

257
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,559
only went to places where he could
meet anyone randomly.

258
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,000
After Do Min Seok and Do Hyun Su
parked at a motel parking lot,

259
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,660
at 3:40pm,

260
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,430
they went to an exhibition...

261
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,369
and enjoyed an unknown artist's
private exhibition.

262
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,740
(7pm, restaurant)

263
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,769
At 7pm, they had dinner...

264
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,109
at a family restaurant
that was popular back then.

265
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,380
- What do you want?
- I'll have...

266
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,720
(8:30pm, bar)

267
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,390
At 8:30pm, they had drinks
at a bar.

268
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,920
(Jung Mi Sook's abduction:
2:30am the next day)

269
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,460
(3:30am: Returned home)

270
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,759
(12:45am, movie theater)

271
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,130
After midnight, they arrived
at a movie theater,

272
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,299
(12:45am, movie theater)

273
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,759
(Jung Mi Sook's abduction:
2:30am the next day)

274
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,200
(3:30am: Returned home)

275
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,799
and after the incident occurred,
they left the movie theater.

276
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,079
That means from the exhibition
to the movie theater,

277
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,910
Do Min Seok had plenty of time
to get in touch with the accomplice.

278
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,849
Do you think Do Hyun Su saw
the accomplice?

279
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,460
Honey!

280
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,970
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yes.

281
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,839
But...where is your ring?

282
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,640
Oh, it's in the office.

283
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,049
I took it off in the bathroom
while washing my hands and forgot.

284
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,549
You never took it off.

285
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,150
You said it felt awkward
and uncomfortable without it.

286
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,049
That's true,

287
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,819
but after taking it off,
I got used to it in no time.

288
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,099
- It's a green light.
- What?

289
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,230
Oh.

290
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,869
By the way, you didn't forget
about tonight, did you?

291
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,970
What?

292
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,279
We promised to throw a party.

293
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,309
Eun Ha is really
looking forward to it.

294
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,279
Don't be late.

295
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,380
Okay.

296
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,059
It's a true miracle!

297
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,190
You don't have to worry about
the accident from that day.

298
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,630
I took care of everything.

299
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,630
That night,

300
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,930
Why didn't you...

301
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,400
pick up your phone?

302
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:15,740
I called you several times.

303
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,809
I was busy.

304
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,990
Was it something...

305
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,559
more important than me?

306
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,400
There's nothing
more important than you.

307
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,539
Will I be able...

308
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,839
to walk again?

309
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,019
You'll not only walk,

310
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,059
but get the job you want...

311
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,589
and marry someone nice.

312
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,299
You should have a lovely daughter...

313
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,500
and live in a beautiful
two-story house...

314
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,369
and proudly live a happy life.

315
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,009
You can live like that too.

316
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,029
Mom!

317
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,559
Mom, hurry and come upstairs.

318
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,579
All right.
Your delicious food is ready.

319
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,049
- Congratulations. Have your fill.
- That looks delicious.

320
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,279
Here, have some too.

321
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,119
It's your favorite. Shrimp.

322
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,630
Did this become too dull? You don't
like it as much as you used to.

323
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,869
No, I like it.

324
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
I like it a lot,

325
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,369
but it just occurred to me that...

326
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,109
you must have gone through
so much trouble.

327
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,450
I only do this because I like it.
It's no trouble for me.

328
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,279
Do you want the shrimp?

329
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,750
Yes.

330
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,750
You're eating so well.

331
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,089
It must have been so much trouble
to only show me...

332
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,430
what I wanted to see.

333
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,039
I'm thankful.

334
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,440
Why are you thanking me
out of nowhere?

335
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,440
Peel another shrimp for me.

336
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,380
You only talk formally
when you need something.

337
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,720
Do you...

338
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,789
love her?

339
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,630
No.

340
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,299
I never thought that way...

341
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,640
even for a moment.

342
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:15,009
(Chief Kim)

343
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,579
Yes, Chief Kim.

344
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,180
Did the result for
the sound source analysis come out?

345
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,849
Yes. I took the static sounds...

346
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,259
and tried amplifying it.

347
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,089
Yes.

348
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,829
Okay.

349
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,529
Once the voiceprint analysis result
comes out,

350
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,930
email it to me.

351
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,039
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,480
Is that what Reporter Kim
asked for earlier?

353
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,210
Yes.

354
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,720
Did they figure out
what kind of sound it is?

355
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,660
No, they can't figure it out.

356
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,759
I see.

357
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,529
But they were able to get rid
of the static,

358
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,500
which uncovered the voice
of another man.

359
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,480
(Voice File)

360
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,549
Do you want...

361
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,859
Can you make out what he's saying?

362
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,700
Do you want...

363
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,230
Do you want...

364
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,109
Do you want...

365
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,410
Do you want an ashtray?

366
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,519
An ashtray.

367
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,789
Give it to me for now.

368
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:03,650
Honey.

369
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,980
Why are you standing there
like that?

370
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,589
It's nothing.

371
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,630
Eun Ha, do you want anything else?

372
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,740
- Shrimp.
- "Shrimp"?

373
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,509
Okay. I'll peel another one for you.

374
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,119
I can tell you're
forcing your smiles these days.

375
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,660
Tell me. What's the matter?

376
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,869
Nothing's the matter.

377
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,839
Why are you acting like this, then?

378
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,549
I guess my feelings for you changed.

379
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,339
What do you mean by that?

380
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,609
It's been 14 years since we met.

381
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,480
It can't always be like
how it was at first.

382
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,819
How can you suddenly change?

383
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,630
What about you?

384
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,730
Are your feelings for me
the same as before?

385
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,809
Yes.

386
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:17,950
Is that so?

387
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,880
I see.

388
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,299
It's because of work.

389
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,099
It's stressing you out too much.

390
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,839
You're always risking yourself
and lacking sleep.

391
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:46,839
In addition, the new case
you're working on has been in a fog.

392
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,880
This question pops
into my mind often these days.

393
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,450
What kind of life would I lead
if we were to break up?

394
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,460
Ji Won.

395
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,599
Don't talk as if you know everything
about me.

396
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm the one who knows myself best,
not you.

397
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,240
Was there a reason why I loved you?

398
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,750
There wasn't.

399
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,250
There doesn't need to be a reason
for falling out of love either.

400
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,319
I don't love you anymore.

401
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,089
I just don't.

402
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,799
There's nothing about you
that I like.

403
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,670
I don't even want to see you
trying hard to treat me well.

404
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,299
Why not?

405
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,609
I guess falling out of love
brought on this hatred.

406
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:01,779
If you hate me,

407
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,890
why are you crying?

408
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,130
Because I hate the fact
that this is all I can say.

409
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,799
I can't wrap my head around this.

410
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,309
I can't seem to understand you.

411
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,309
I'm going to break up with you.

412
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,319
It disgusts me to see you
lying next to me...

413
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,589
or eating.

414
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,660
Ji Won.

415
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,430
What do you want me to do?

416
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,500
Tell me. Well...

417
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,329
Whatever it may be,

418
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,740
I'll fix it.

419
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
I'll do whatever.

420
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,980
Don't.

421
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,480
That's what I want.

422
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,559
(Yeonju Serial Murder Case)

423
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,929
- Ji Won.
- I need to look through these.

424
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,139
Let's take a rain check.

425
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,340
This should be
the most important thing right now.

426
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,780
Do you know what I look at
right away when I go to work?

427
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,750
The faces of Do Min Seok's victims.

428
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,619
Do you know how I feel
when I look at them?

429
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,289
I feel guilty.

430
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,130
Why would you?
You've done nothing wrong.

431
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,099
Because I don't know anything.

432
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,969
I should know it, but I don't.

433
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:02,139
I don't even know
how Do Min Seok chose his victims.

434
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,340
This could be their last chance.

435
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,949
They're all relying on me.

436
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,750
But...

437
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,050
there's nothing that I know.

438
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,420
Ji Won, this is just a part
of your work.

439
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,090
Don't empathize with them so much.

440
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:25,960
I finally realized...

441
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:31,869
how I've endured
all those heinous cases.

442
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,210
Goodness, good work today.

443
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,619
It was because of you.

444
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,449
You helped me forget about them.

445
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,420
Being with you made that possible.

446
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,760
But not anymore.

447
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,210
What? She's sick of you?

448
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,849
I think I misheard you.

449
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,480
Did you just say
that she got sick of you?

450
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,449
Yes, she is.

451
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,389
And...

452
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,130
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

453
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,460
So that's why you woke me up
in the middle of the night?

454
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,929
It's pretty serious.

455
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,170
It's worse than that time
when I ran away...

456
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,099
after Nam Soon Gil had stabbed me.

457
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,070
- I feel helpless.
- Gosh.

458
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,909
Thanks to you,
I'm still dressed like this.

459
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,380
Darn it.

460
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,420
- Where's Hyun Su?
- He's inside.

461
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,699
What is it?
What kind of emergency is it?

462
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,110
I see.

463
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,079
She's sick of you.

464
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,880
That's terrible.

465
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,320
Hey, can you believe him?

466
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,849
Ji Won is in so much pain.

467
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,989
What should I do to make her happy?

468
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,090
Isn't that obvious?

469
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,659
Tell her you love her to death...

470
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,599
and that it has to be her.

471
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,469
Buy a gift, some flowers,
and light some candles.

472
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,099
Love-bomb her with all you've got...

473
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,670
so that she'll be mesmerized by you.

474
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,010
Then she'll become groggy.

475
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,710
"Honey, what is this?"

476
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,110
"It's love."

477
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,449
After some time, she'll ask again,

478
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,050
"Honey, what is this?"

479
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,679
"It's menopause."

480
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,320
That's life.

481
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,449
You're right.

482
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,960
The best gift to make her smile...

483
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,530
is finding the accomplice.

484
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,500
What?

485
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,170
She'll be delighted...

486
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,239
if I brought the accomplice to her.

487
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,840
I can see her smile already.

488
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,210
How could you fix
your relationship...

489
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,280
with a serial killer?

490
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,219
She must be...

491
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,449
a very precious person to you.

492
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,159
Yes. She's very important to me.

493
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,659
No, she's precious to you.

494
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,170
What's the difference?

495
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,940
For something that's important,
you'll realize later on...

496
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:58,510
that it wasn't that important
to begin with.

497
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,010
But when you look back at things
that were precious,

498
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,210
it hurts.

499
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:20,059
- I should get going.
- Where to?

500
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,670
I think I'll be able to find
where the accomplice made his calls.

501
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,309
I finally figured out
what that sound was.

502
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,909
- What?
- Really?

503
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:32,510
And you're only telling us now?

504
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,679
Where is it? How did you find out?
No, what was it?

505
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,210
I'll tell you when I return.

506
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,889
Bye. Don't hang out with him
for too long.

507
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,289
Hey, who are you to say that to her?

508
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,159
We're adults now, you know?

509
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,139
What are you doing today?

510
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,510
I'm not asking you out...

511
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,280
on a big date
or something like that.

512
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,820
We could just eat something tasty
like the good, old days.

513
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,130
Or we can drink too.

514
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,199
- Mu Jin.
- Yes?

515
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,699
Can you drop me home?

516
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,769
What?

517
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,099
(Is there anything you want?)

518
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:05,199
(Should we take up a sport?)

519
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,440
(Did you grab something to eat?)

520
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,239
(How are you feeling?)

521
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,909
(What can you make with that?)

522
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,579
(Grilled pork)

523
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,329
(I'll send a picture too.)

524
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:33,829
(Honey, isn't the sky so beautiful?)

525
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,010
What? A trap?

526
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,750
You want to set a trap?

527
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,519
These are the people who
talked to Jung Mi Sook...

528
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,050
on the phone for three days
after she left her home.

529
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,989
Jung Mi Sook called regarding a job,

530
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,590
and they probably found out...

531
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,960
that she ran away from home
in that process.

532
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,429
Let's see who threw the bait
at Jung Mi Sook.

533
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,500
We should throw a bait too.

534
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,530
What is the bait we can throw?

535
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,269
Me.

536
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,170
What?

537
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,670
I'll become Jung Mi Sook.

538
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,980
A sting operation isn't a
legitimate way of investigating.

539
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,809
It is legitimate if the culprit
is still committing crimes.

540
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:28,650
All right.

541
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,519
I understand what you mean.

542
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,889
Sir, I agree with her.

543
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,119
I don't see a reason
why we shouldn't do it.

544
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,730
We have nothing to lose.

545
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,969
Let's get a prepaid phone first.

546
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:09,429
I'm really okay. I can just go.

547
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:12,489
Really? You want to go?

548
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,730
No.

549
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,630
Are you moving out?

550
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,570
Your house is so empty.

551
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,639
This is how I live.

552
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,909
Oh, minimalism?

553
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,179
No wonder this place
has a refined air to it.

554
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,909
Isn't it a bit dark?

555
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,380
Shall I turn on the lights?

556
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,889
You should change the bulb.

557
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,530
I usually don't turn on the lights.

558
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,730
I didn't even know they were out.

559
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,320
I have insomnia.

560
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,889
I have trouble sleeping.

561
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,730
Sometimes, I cry all night long
like a crazy person.

562
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,230
And sometimes,

563
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,000
I don't even leave this place
for days.

564
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:58,300
Mu Jin.

565
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,199
I'm not the Do Hae Su you know.

566
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,869
My life is a wreck.

567
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,110
We can't go back to before.

568
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,320
You can go now.

569
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,530
(Whiskey Bar)

570
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:35,300
(Whiskey Bar)

571
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,110
Welcome.

572
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,809
Strangely, this place hasn't changed
a bit.

573
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,110
Have you been here before?

574
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,789
Yes. I came with my father
when I was young.

575
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,219
It looks exactly the same as then.

576
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,260
What will you have?

577
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,960
Can you recommend something
on the rocks?

578
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,659
Sure.

579
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,320
When I came with my father before,

580
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:03,289
you carved the ice yourself.

581
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,460
Your father must've been
a special customer.

582
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,159
We carve the ice
for special customers only.

583
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,400
"A special customer"?

584
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,940
You know, like a regular.

585
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,570
Then the person I'm looking for...

586
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,639
must be a special customer too.

587
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,550
Lady. Don't meddle.

588
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,860
You're not the only one who saw me.

589
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,360
I saw you too.

590
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,699
You have a small, red car.

591
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,269
Do you know who this is?

592
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:54,670
I know where you work and live too.

593
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,110
No. I have no idea.

594
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:59,739
You should watch yourself
when you have kids.

595
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,280
If you happen to remember,

596
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,250
can you call me?

597
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,150
Sure.

598
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,550
Can you write down your number here?

599
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,489
Can you lend me a pen?

600
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,900
Okay.

601
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,719
Hyun Su, do you want to choose?

602
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,030
I want to give my friend a gift.

603
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,000
For always getting me
the best ingredients.

604
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,199
You always choose
the ingredients yourself.

605
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,110
Some ingredients tend to be...

606
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,610
dangerous to search by myself.

607
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,280
Like what?

608
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,780
What kind of face will you wear
if I show you?

609
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,420
I'm curious.

610
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,960
Show me.

611
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,230
When your eyes and hands...

612
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,289
mature a bit more?

613
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,500
I'll choose this.

614
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:54,559
(Contact Numbers of Testifiers)

615
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,599
Hello?

616
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:08,300
I called to inquire about
a job opening.

617
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,340
You have the wrong number.

618
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,110
(Hwang Jung Soon, 459-12,
Jaerim-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

619
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,849
"Hwang Jung Soon".

620
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,309
It sounds like a woman's name.
Why don't we skip it?

621
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:24,090
My dad's name is Soon Jin.
Choi Soon Jin.

622
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,250
- Really?
- Be quiet.

623
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,360
Hello?

624
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:31,030
I called to inquire about
a job opening.

625
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,730
I see. Did you see our flyer?

626
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,769
But I have bad credit. Is that okay?

627
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,400
Really?

628
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,340
Don't worry.
It doesn't matter at all.

629
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,550
What is it?

630
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,079
Do you really not recognize...

631
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,119
that voice?

632
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,219
What about Do Min Seok?

633
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,889
Do you not know Do Min Seok either?

634
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,099
I don't.

635
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,409
You have Do Min Seok's work here,

636
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,210
yet you say you don't know him.

637
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,909
You said he's a special customer.

638
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,449
How can you not know him?

639
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,150
I don't know anything.

640
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,590
Then who does?

641
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,989
Who are you?

642
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,889
Do you really only sell drinks here?

643
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,360
Why are you doing this to me?

644
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,789
I don't know anything.

645
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,630
Tell me...

646
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,099
who can resolve this situation.

647
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,800
Where are you right now?

648
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:26,710
I'm at a motel near Yongsan Station.

649
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,639
What's the name of the motel?

650
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:33,079
Just a second.

651
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,150
(Happy World)

652
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,820
It's Happy World.

653
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,320
I'll come to you.

654
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,420
I think it'll take an hour or two.

655
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,590
Are you coming here?

656
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:48,199
It'll be like an interview.
I also want to hear your story.

657
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,369
Sure, please come.

658
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,699
I'll call back at this number.

659
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:55,340
Okay.

660
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,340
She sounds very suspicious.

661
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,909
Her voice got higher every time
you said you have difficulties.

662
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,579
Why is it a woman?

663
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,679
A woman? Is it a woman?

664
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,420
But the accomplice is a man.

665
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,119
Perhaps their way
of luring the victims...

666
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,559
is different.

667
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:16,889
Did we really catch them?

668
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,699
Aren't we too lucky?

669
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,099
Can't we be lucky?
Are you unhappy with that?

670
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,469
No, I'm just nervous.

671
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,670
Let's check first. Let's hurry.

672
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:35,710
We got another one.

673
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,010
(President Yeom Sang Chul)

674
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,579
I feel somewhat nervous.

675
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,219
What are you talking about?

676
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,690
It hasn't been long since we got one
from your area.

677
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,750
The term's too short.

678
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,119
All they talk about on television
these days...

679
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,329
is the reinvestigation
on Do Min Seok.

680
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,659
We'll all get roped in
if we're unlucky.

681
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,860
How embarrassing.

682
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,829
You're such a chicken.

683
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:00,670
Just hurry up and give me my share.

684
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,639
Is this all?

685
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,309
It's not selling.

686
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,420
I'll pay you more later
when we sell.

687
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,849
You always delay it.

688
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,269
- Talk.
- Sir.

689
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,440
Some lunatic came and made a mess.

690
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,639
What is he talking about?

691
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,980
Is it you?
Are you Do Min Seok's accomplice?

692
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,650
Who are you?

693
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,239
Hee Seong!

694
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,679
Why are you on the floor?

695
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,019
Mom.

696
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,349
There's someone...

697
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:29,219
I must see.

698
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:33,360
I remembered.

699
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,699
I was on my way to...

700
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:40,599
meet that person.

701
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,070
What?

702
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:47,210
I have to hurry.

703
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,679
Mom. Please help me up.

704
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,079
Please help me up.

705
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,420
Mom.

706
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,210
(Search by word)

707
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:38,489
(Employment Agency)

708
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,699
I didn't notice during the day,
but it's really high up here.

709
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,699
What are you doing? Open the door.

710
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:27,440
We should replace your bulbs.

711
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:37,349
(Employment Agency)

712
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,590
Did you say
you're Do Min Seok's son?

713
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,559
How can I trust you?

714
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:49,599
How do you think I found that bar?

715
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:53,000
Father took me there.

716
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,139
There's a drink Min Seok
always ordered at the bar.

717
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:03,610
Do you know it?

718
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,190
Father never ordered drinks.

719
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,690
He only said he has a reservation.

720
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,300
You look like him.

721
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,739
Sit down.

722
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,110
What about you?

723
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:44,320
Who are you to know
Father's accomplice?

724
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,659
You crossed the line
with that question.

725
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,329
You.

726
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,500
I hear you're wanted for murder.

727
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,199
I watch the news too, you know.

728
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,639
Then you must know very well...

729
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:05,570
why I'm looking for him.

730
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,480
You said you watched the news.

731
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:11,280
He messed around with me,

732
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,320
so I should give something
in return.

733
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,820
You don't even know
what kind of person it is.

734
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,260
How bold.

735
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,170
Tell that scumbag the same thing.

736
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:37,010
Tell him he was quite bold
for messing around with me.

737
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,880
Look at you.

738
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,019
My gosh.

739
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,719
I'm stuck between two lunatics,
and it's exhausting.

740
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,360
You make it sound like
you're so different.

741
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,130
Me? I'm just a businessman.

742
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,960
I buy, sell, and make some money
out of it.

743
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,570
It's quite simple.

744
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,539
So? What do you buy and sell?

745
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,139
Anything...

746
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:15,239
and everything.

747
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:22,619
So ever since you left home
in middle school,

748
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,949
you've lost touch
with your family members?

749
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:29,289
They probably don't even care
whether I'm alive or dead.

750
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,929
It must've been so tough for you.

751
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:35,199
Are you sure
I can make a lot of money?

752
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,829
If a credit delinquent like you
can make a lot of money,

753
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,500
you should expect it to be illegal.

754
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,739
That's all you need to know for now.

755
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,639
It's something illegal, isn't it?

756
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,579
It's not dangerous, though.

757
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,320
You just need to go somewhere
and hand over the goods.

758
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:58,949
There are two entrances.

759
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,489
There are teams of two
guarding them.

760
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:03,360
Ho Joon is waiting
in front of the room.

761
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,630
Please go on your way.

762
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:09,030
Ji Won is doing well.

763
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,309
Goods? What kind of goods?

764
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,349
Just do it first. You'll know.

765
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,480
Okay.

766
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,590
By the way,
you need to pay a commission.

767
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,920
How much?

768
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,690
How much do you have right now?

769
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,030
Here.

770
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,969
You'll be making a hefty sum soon,

771
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,900
so don't you worry about spending
this chicken feed.

772
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,440
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

773
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,280
- Do you know the law?
- Why do you ask?

774
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,409
Is there something
you want to ask me?

775
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,019
"It is against the law..."

776
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,519
"to meddle
in a third party's employment..."

777
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,690
"and gain profit out of it."

778
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,429
What?

779
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,500
You've infringed
the Labor Standards Act...

780
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,559
and the Employment Security Act.

781
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:22,269
Shall we go to the station
and chat a bit more...

782
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:23,769
about those illegal goods,

783
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:25,769
Ms. Hwang Jung Soon?

784
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,440
- Who in the world are you?
- Me?

785
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,550
I'm Jung Mi Sook.

786
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,949
I'll be back.

787
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,099
The darn fortune teller had told me
that I'd meet someone valuable.

788
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,869
They're quite good.

789
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,579
Hey, Hwang Jung Soon!

790
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,849
Hey, you better not move.

791
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,789
There's nowhere to run anyway.

792
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:16,559
Jung Soon, you're going to fall.

793
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,289
Come here. No, come here.

794
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,900
You're going to be in huge trouble.

795
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,269
You're seriously going to fall.

796
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,369
Gosh. Come here.

797
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,130
Isn't this a good enough deal?

798
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,170
I'm in a dilemma.

799
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,869
Would I make more
out of siding with you...

800
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:07,380
or him?

801
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,679
Which one is better?

802
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,389
I've never seen anyone
live for too long...

803
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,389
after weighing things
against each other.

804
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:21,420
You're correct.

805
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,130
I may be a thug, but I still
shouldn't betray my client.

806
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,159
I'll be dead in no time.

807
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,699
Client?

808
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,300
So...

809
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,210
you sold the same ingredients
you gave to my dad...

810
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,380
to him as well?

811
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,010
Ingredients?

812
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:46,010
Right.

813
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:49,320
That's how Do Min Seok called them.

814
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,989
Some ingredients tend to be...

815
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,730
dangerous to search by myself.

816
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,630
Okay. I've made up my mind.

817
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:08,199
I'm afraid
I'll have to side with him.

818
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:23,150
Ji Won, are you out of your mind?

819
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:25,820
How could you leave her alone
after cuffing her from the front?

820
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:27,789
Does the procedure even mean
anything to you?

821
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,559
Sir, she had only left her alone
for a short while.

822
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,190
Detective Cha followed our plan.

823
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:35,429
It's all my fault.

824
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:39,869
Look at you. Woo Chul, do you think
you alone can fix all this?

825
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:42,869
What will you do
if Hwang Jung Soon dies?

826
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,769
What if she dies
because of your sting?

827
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:48,739
Darn it.

828
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,420
Detective Im, how did it go?

829
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:57,989
She's undergoing emergency surgery.

830
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,889
I'll only know
once the surgery is done.

831
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,019
The doctor couldn't guarantee
anything either.

832
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,179
Honey.

833
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:56,440
(Husband: I wish time flew by.)

834
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:58,909
How are you feeling?

835
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:01,780
You skipped breakfast.

836
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,190
Is there anything you want?

837
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,019
Should we take up a sport?

838
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,530
Did you grab something to eat?

839
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:16,859
Ji Won.

840
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,529
Ji Won.

841
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,470
I feel frustrated.

842
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,640
I want to talk to you.

843
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,279
I wish time flew by.

844
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:34,220
I wish time passed by quickly...

845
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,050
so that our memories
could align with one another.

846
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,760
I wish...

847
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,329
I could think...

848
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,760
and feel like you do.

849
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,770
It feels like
I'm always on the receiving end.

850
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:58,069
Is there anything you want from me?

851
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,109
Yes, there is.

852
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,310
What is it?

853
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,149
Don't ever change.

854
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,460
Just keep your eyes on me
as you do now.

855
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,800
I only need you to trust me.

856
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,569
Come on. That's too easy.

857
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,039
If you do,
I'll dedicate my entire life...

858
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,710
to you.

859
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:43,250
What should I do? I miss him.

860
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,699
Let me go! Let go!

861
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,470
If I think about Do Min Seok,
I shouldn't be doing this,

862
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:11,079
but what choice do I have?
Do Min Seok is dead and he's alive.

863
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:13,909
How can you do this to me?

864
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,279
I feel bad too.

865
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,949
After a good night's sleep,

866
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:22,020
I'll send you to the person
you miss so dearly.

867
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:26,260
Grab him.

868
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,229
No!

869
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:29,529
Hey, open your mouth.

870
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:31,229
No! Don't!

871
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,600
- No.
- Stay still!

872
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,500
- No!
- Open your mouth!

873
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,539
- Hey.
- I can become your customer.

874
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,079
A stable...

875
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:47,680
and long-term customer.

876
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,930
Do you...

877
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,100
know what I sell?

878
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:15,779
People.

879
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:25,550
So you need my stuff too?

880
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:28,489
Didn't my father tell you about me?

881
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,590
He did.

882
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,829
That you were just like him.

883
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,960
But I didn't know this was
what he meant.

884
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,380
(Ji Won)

885
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,119
Answer it.

886
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:15,869
Hey.

887
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,970
I wanted to hear your voice.

888
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,850
The thing is...

889
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,220
I've had a long day.

890
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,050
And all I thought about was you.

891
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:40,789
I'm busy right now.

892
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,430
What?

893
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,729
I'm busy.

894
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:53,770
Oh, okay.

895
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,689
I only need you to trust me.

896
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:14,460
Just answer...

897
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:17,970
yes or no...

898
01:13:18,529 --> 01:13:19,770
from now on.

899
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,869
Can you do that?

900
01:13:27,109 --> 01:13:28,109
Yes.

901
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:30,710
Do you need help?

902
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,050
No.

903
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,020
Can you take care of it on your own?

904
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:41,090
Yes.

905
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,229
I'll give you an hour.

906
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,260
Come to me within an hour.

907
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,270
I miss you.

908
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,479
Yes.

909
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:39,649
(Flower of Evil)

910
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,550
The deal starts tomorrow
at midnight.

911
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,619
Bring 100,000 dollars in cash
for starters.

912
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:45,350
You shouldn't underestimate him.

913
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,560
If he finds out you're awake,
it might be a problem.

914
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,460
We're going to catch
Do Hyun Su too, right?

915
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,390
I need money.
100,000 dollars in cash.

916
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:57,460
I think I can find the accomplice
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

917
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:01,670
I want to become a decent person
to you.

918
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:05,109
I have an important tip regarding
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

919
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:06,670
Can you tell me who you are?
