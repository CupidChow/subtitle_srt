What's so funny?

10

This dress is new,
and so are these shoes.

11

Also,
it took me an hour to do my hair.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,010
I'm so unlucky.

13
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,709
How can our first date go like this?

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,879
"Date"?

15
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,780
If two people who like each other
are out, it's a date.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,250
I'm not interested in you.

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,989
Then why are you out with me?
On such a precious weekend?

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,689
That's because...

19
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,629
If I go out with you once,
you won't bother me for a while.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm heartbroken.

21
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,810
Let's go.

22
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,980
The owner of the chicken restaurant
said to me...

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,780
that you stare at me
whenever I pass by.

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,549
A fifth-grade kid asked me
if I'm dating you...

25
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,549
while buying a popsicle.

26
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,890
Could you be...

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,829
the only one who doesn't know...

28
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,959
that you like me?

29
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,870
How suffocating.

30
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,370
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,340
Loser has to stand in the rain
for 30 seconds.

32
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,250
I'm not playing.
I don't do useless stuff like that.

33
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,250
If you don't play, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors!

34
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:25,949
You lost!

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,949
What are you doing? Go out.

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,340
Hey.

37
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,810
What's wrong?

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
Do you know how weird you are?

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,550
Why do you like me? Why?

40
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,520
I don't get you.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,889
How could you like someone like me?

42
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,259
Forget it.
There's no point in explaining.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,970
I'm leaving.

44
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,850
Why did you insist
on getting married...

45
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,050
and create this mess?

46
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,959
I had told you many times
to live abroad.

47
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,860
"Marriage"?

48
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,860
How dare you try to live
a normal life?

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,959
If you want to die, do it alone.

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,629
If the world finds out about us...

51
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,339
It's such a horrific thought.

52
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,540
Let that happen,

53
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,209
and I'll kill myself
in front of you!

54
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,550
Please calm down.

55
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,389
Nothing has happened yet.

57
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,139
I knew a guy named Nam Soon Gil,

58
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,569
and we had strife.

59
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,209
Because of that,
things got a bit complicated.

60
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,029
I'm sorry for slapping you.

61
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,329
Did it hurt?

62
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm okay.

63
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,870
Why is it so hard
to fix my bad habit?

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,750
If I get worked up again,
bind my hands first.

65
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,449
Your wife doesn't know anything,
does she?

66
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,689
She's in charge of this case.

67
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,759
What?

68
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,759
I told you. I warned you.

69
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,269
I told you she'd cause trouble!

70
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,339
If things go awry,
it'll be easier to fix.

71
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,350
I never liked her.

72
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,310
You better be wary of her.
She's two-faced.

73
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,480
How could you marry
someone like her?

74
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,019
My goodness.

75
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,589
The culprit was caught on CCTV...

76
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,529
and left his blood
at the crime scene.

77
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,759
This will get solved.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You already know...

79
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,500
that chasing after Do Hyun Su
won't lead them to Baek Hee Seong...

80
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,279
as long as you stay by my side
like you've always done.

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
Go.

82
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
Okay.

83
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,589
Our house is too big.

84
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,600
It's too big for just us two.

85
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,670
You should come and have dinner
from time to time.

86
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,709
It's not just you two.

87
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,250
Goodbye.

88
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,670
What about your son's meal?

89
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,110
I'll do it.

and Do Hyun Su's

Do Min Seok had a daughter.

Yes, she's Hyun Su's older sister.

99

She's the same age as you.

100
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,870
You should meet her then.

101
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,710
I met the victim's family.

102
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,440
I'll let you meet
the suspect's family.

103
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm really jealous
of how soft you look.

People avoid me
because of my charisma.

105

Simply put, they don't like you.

106
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:48,649
Stay right there.

107
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,049
Enough with the chatting.

and her home address.

Yes, sir.

110

How do you feel?
You're not in pain anymore, are you?

111
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,929
It's not stinging anymore.

112
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,299
But the smell...

113
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,139
It smells weird.

114
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,639
It's a bit pungent.

115
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,970
Is that okay?

116
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,279
That's from the liquid latex.

117
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,679
It's hardly toxic.

118
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,509

Can you make it seem...

121
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,100
like he just died?

122
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,269
Can he look more like
he just took his last breath?

123
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,610
Have you seen
a murdered victim in real life?

124
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,480
What?

125
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,549
- Give me the blood.
- Here you go.

126

Ms. Do, you have a call.

127
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,470
- Yes?
- Is this Ms. Do Hae Su?

128
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,370
I'm Detective Cha Ji Won...

from Gangsu Police Station's
violent crimes unit.

130

Ms. Do Hae Su?

131
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,769
I'm Detective Cha,
the one who called.

132
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,669
How did you know?

133
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,970
Do I look like Do Min Seok?

134
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,750
No, I was just guessing.

135
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,850
You came quite quickly.

136
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,980
The filming site was nearby.

137
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,720
- Here's my card.
- I don't know.

(Cha Ji Won)

139
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,529
- Sorry?
- I don't know anything.

140
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,000
After Hyun Su disappeared in 2002,
I've never seen him again.

141
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,769
During the past 18 years,

142
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,899
I've met countless detectives
and have said the same thing.

143
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,299
Can I go now?

144
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,179
That wasn't what I was about to ask.

145
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,620
We've confirmed about
900,000 dollars-worth of...

146
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,080
Do Min Seok's properties...

147
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,850
that weren't filed
for a certificate of inheritance.

148
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,190
A house in Paju,
workshop in Gagyeong-ri,

149
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,590
and also a villa in Taean.

150
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,460
Why did you sell the land
but leave the building untouched?

151
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,100
It feels like you left them
as a hideout for Do Hyun Su.

152
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,580
Does the police investigate
based on their imagination lately?

153
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,850
I used the money from the land
to compensate the victims' families.

154
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,490
I'm not interested in any of
that monster's money besides that.

155
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,690
I haven't met my Hyun Su
for 18 years.

156
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,059
How many times
do I have to tell you?

157
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,730
"My Hyun Su"?

158
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,470
If you were bothered by the police
and press for 18 years,

159
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,370
you must resent your brother
quite a lot.

160
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,009
But to me, you seem...

161
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,389
sad.

162
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,559
I'm afraid
I have to get back to work.

163
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,429
It doesn't seem like
I can help you anyway.

- What are you doing?
- My goodness.

177

You surprised me.

178
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,889
It's your fault for not checking
your surroundings.

179

Don't you know the most annoying
type of boss...

180
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,100
is someone who peeks
at one's monitor from behind?

181
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,929

of his monitor.

and this is the case of the son.

184
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,440

- Come on, try it on.

191
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,170
Okay.

192
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,079
What is this for?

193
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,950
It's because of the
Chinese restaurant case.

194
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,490
You came in dressed like that
last night.

So what?

196
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,059
This type of raincoat is common.

197
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,500
Do you think I went out
in the middle of the night...

198
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,970
to kill someone?

00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,640
When you came in like this
last night,

201
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,509
I was surprised
and didn't recognize you at first.

202
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,079
But how did Nam Soon Gil
recognize him instantly?

203
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,619
The killer was even wearing a mask.

204
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,089
What if he was mistaken?

205
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,890
No, the killer has to be Do Hyun Su.

206
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,730
Why?

207
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,859

Do you think
they really didn't know?

217
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,579
Didn't know what?

218
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,279
That their father was
a serial killer.

219
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,819
Did his children really not know?

220
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,420
I think Do Hyun Su especially
received a lot of influence...

221
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,890
from his father for his
antisocial personality.

222

Anyhow, this is a nice case.

Why?

224
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,900
It's great for being referenced
as research material...

to find the genetic cause
of antisocial personality disorder.

So? Do you think you'll catch
the culprit soon?

227
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,339
We have his DNA,

228
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,680
so once we know what he looks like,
it's just a matter of time.

also known as a police sketch.

232
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,079
We do have someone who can confirm
Do Hyun Su's face.

233
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,650
Who is that?

234

The owner of the restaurant
Do Hyun Su used to work at.

235
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,700
I wonder where he disappeared to
since then.

236
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,500
How could he vanish into thin air
like that?

237

reading that and take a break?

That Reporter Kim knows Do Hyun Su?

Yes. When you were getting changed
earlier,

257
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:07,630
you told me they went
to the same school.

there was a brutal murder.

The suspect of this case...

271

is the son of the serial killer

Isn't this when he was too young?

275
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,730
The police is having trouble
confirming Do Hyun Su's...

276
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,299
current appearance, and it's
delaying the investigation process.

No.

Don't you think?

281
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,519
Well... Sure.

282
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,960
But after graduating high school,
I think...

283
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,190
he grew about 20cm suddenly.

284
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,029
That's when his face
started to change a lot.

I have something to do too.

287
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,170
He should have a scar
on his left forehead.

288
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,279
About 3cm long. It was pale.

290
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,980
You must not remember him well.

When you become my age,

292
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,049
you'll see how things change
day by day.

293
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,089
Are you sure?

294
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,019
A scar would be a very
important piece of information.

295
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,589
It's totally clear to me.

296
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,589
I was on a tractor with Do Hyun Su
and he fell off...

297
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,660
when I made a turn.

298
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,500
That's how he hit his head here,

299
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,799
and got about seven stitches.

300
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,039
Can you add a scar there?

301
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,480
The key to sadness lies in the focus
of the eyes.

302
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,819
Let's look at a sad face.

303
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,190
Thinking of lowering
the ends of your mouth.

304
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,589
The eyes should be out of focus.

305
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,599
It must be tough for you.
Thank you so much for agreeing...

306
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,529
to meet with me.

307
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:00,700
I dealt with many cases
as a reporter,

308
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,470
but this one especially
breaks my heart.

309
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
I heard you were the last person...

310
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,509
my husband looked for.

311
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,349
I wish I picked up my phone then.

312
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,490
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,759
Don't be. It's not your fault.

314
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,259
Don't blame yourself.

315
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:36,869
I feel responsible for it.

316
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,609
Thank you for thinking that way.

317
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,920
While we're on that,

318

the tragic event happened
to your husband at 3am.

319

Why was he at the restaurant
at such a late hour?

320
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,599
Has it been two months?

321
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,900
Once a week, he'd work until late...

322
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,440
to develop a new menu.

323
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,109
The criminal knew that too.

324
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,609
Who do you think knew?

325
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm not sure who else knew
aside from me.

326
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:23,920
You need to remember.

327
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm sure there's someone.

328
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,769
I swear I had it.

329
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,710
No, not this.

330
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,849
Not this either.

331
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,519
Yes. Here it is.

332
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:08,970
It's him. I'm sure of it.

333
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,500
Pardon? You have a picture
of Do Hyun Su...

334
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,269
from five years ago?

335
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,480
Pardon? You have a picture
of Do Hyun Su...

336
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,210
from five years ago?

337
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,990
Just a moment, ma'am.

338
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,089
Could you tell me in detail?

339
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,890
At the time,
my daughter who lives in Seoul...

340
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,559
took me around the city.

341
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,000
We toured everywhere and
she took a lot of pictures for me.

342
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,430
Do Hyun Su was caught on camera.

343
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,240
Are you sure it's him?

344
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,910
My neighbor and I debated about it,

345
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,579
and I think it's him.

346
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,049
I watched him grow since his birth.

347
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,180
We have someone here
who can confirm,

348
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
so it would be great
if you could send us the picture.

349
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,319
Of course. Sure thing.

350
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,960
The more I look at him,

351
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,490
the more
he looks like his young dad.

352
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,799
Could you take a picture of it
with your phone right now?

353
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,670
No way.

354
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,269
No, no.
It doesn't look like him at all.

355
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,309
Does he look like him to you,
Mr. Reporter?

356
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,640
Let's see...

357
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,779
They don't look like
identical twins,

358
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,880
but he looks like
they could be half-brothers.

359
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,920
Reporter Kim, are you sure
you remember Do Hyun Su's face?

360
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,289
Of course.

361
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,720
It's crystal clear to me
like I saw him yesterday.

362
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,759
But you said your memory is hazy.

363
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,730
I guess the young man
must know better.

364
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,069
Let's start with this composite
and touch on it later.

365
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,880
(KCSI)

366
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Yes, Captain.

367
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,980
What? Okay, I'll be right there.

368
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,289
Thank you both. You can go home now.

369
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,589
Aren't we going to work on it
a little longer?

370
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,789
No. We don't have to.

371
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,299
I'm sorry I wasn't helpful.

372
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,940
Call me if you remember anything,

373
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,140
even if it's minor.

374
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,880
Okay. I'll do that.

375
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,349
- Take care.
- Thank you.

376
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,190
The taxi.

377
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,220
Reporter Kim. The taxi.

378
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,319
- I'm sorry?
- "Homi Village,"

379
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,430
"Gagyeong-ri, Namchun-myeon,
Yeonju."

380
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,960
"Ms. Oh Bok Ja"?

381
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,900
I'll go to the post office and
send it to you as soon as possible.

382
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,369
Why would you bother
coming all the way here?

383
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,640
We're in a rush.

384
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,940
Don't show anyone that picture
until we arrive.

385
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,609
Don't worry about that.

386
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,980
Thank you.

387
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,319
I'll go with Detective Im.

388
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,859
Is something bothering you?

389
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,160
Pardon?

390
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Your face says this isn't right.

391
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,400
Instead of chasing Do Hyun Su,

392
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,940
I feel like he's dragging us around.

393
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,079
Is the taxi driver
not coming for this?

394
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,519
Mr. Park. Why didn't you come
to get your tumbler?

395
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,859
I'll throw it out
if you don't come today.

396
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,430
I'm so sorry, detective.
Making a living is so hard.

397
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,430
Yes,
I'll make sure to go get it today.

398
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,700
Okay. Please keep it safe for me.

399
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,069
Okay. Okay, thank you. Take care.

400
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,410
(Gangsu Police Station)

401
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,380
Detective Choi, did you get
any dashcam footage...

402
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,119
from the cars that were parked
around New Sun Villa?

403
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,880
I couldn't get much from the footage
I received this morning.

404
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,390
I better go out
and search some more.

405
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,319
Stop frowning.

406
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,490
As soon as
we get Do Hyun Su's picture,

407
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,930
things will sort out easily.

408
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,269
Do Hyun Su.

409
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,539
Hurry, your phone.

410
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,509
I said, pass over your phone.
I need to make a call.

411
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm out of battery.

412
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,880
My wife is waiting. Come on.

413
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,559
Do Hyun Su.

414
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,569
Why are you so pathetic?

415
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,339
Here. You can have this.

416
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,440
You should throw out that junk.

417
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,640
I can't listen to my tape with that.

418
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,019
Do Hyun Su?

419
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,190
It's you, isn't it?

420
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,099
Sir, did you just say "Do Hyun Su"?

421
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,700
I have a bad gut feeling today
for some reason.

422
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,269
Is it because I sent
the kids out alone?

423
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,210
Nothing will happen.
They're only getting a picture.

424
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,029
He'd always use the taxi service
whenever he was late,

425
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,160
and he'd use the same one
every time.

426
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,069
I'm glad you called.
You need to look into something.

427
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,009
- It's called Igang Taxi Service.
- Hey, there's a bigger issue.

428
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,980
I have good news and bad news.
Pick one first.

429
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,509
You have bad news? What is it?

430
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,180
Do you remember Ms. Oh Bok Ja?

431
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,079
She has a photo of you
from five years ago.

432
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,349
Do you want to hear what's worse?

433
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,619
What is it?

434
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,559
The police will visit her soon,
and it'll be Detective Cha herself.

435
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,029
- What?
- Your wife is on her way...

436
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,029
to catch you.

437
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,279
Then what's the good news?

438
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:04,680
That I'm on your side.

439
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,650
Where are you right now?

440
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,420
How did the composite go?

441
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,760
Their memories differed,
so it wasn't easy.

442
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,730
We'll know for sure
once we get the photo. Let's go.

443
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,230
(Gangsu Police Station)

444
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,989
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

445
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,119
Do you think we'll get there first?

446
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,989
I'm certain.

447
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,389
How so?

448
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,030
Because they'll abide
by the traffic laws.

449
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,369
(Turn left on your own risk.)

450
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,909
I can't believe we'll be visiting
a serial murder site.

451
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,480
Me neither.

452
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,550
Seven people
from that small village were buried.

453
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,719
How did none of them know?

454
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,820
Only six of them were dug up.

455
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:23,230
Right.
The last one hasn't been found yet.

456
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,730
Perhaps, he found a new place
to bury the body.

457
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,199
Where could that be?

458
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,030
They should at least find
the victim's body.

459
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,070
Why did he commit suicide?

460
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,940
Had he not committed suicide,

461
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,170
his crimes
wouldn't have been discovered.

462
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,980
The police only found out about this
after investigating his suicide.

463
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,019
Beats me. How could a human
understand a monster?

464
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,289
Did he really kill himself?

465
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,789
I'm sensing
strong conspiracy vibes here.

466
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,389
The police only discovered
the victims' right fingernails...

467
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,789
at his workshop.

468
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,230
Where did the left fingernails go?

469
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,429
Did he share them with someone?

470
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,840
What if...

471
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,309
it was his son?

472
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,949
You're approaching a speed trap.

473
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,760
Please slow down.

474
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,460
It'll be awesome
if we catch the criminal first.

475
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,400
Both the police and the media
are looking for Do Hyun Su.

476
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:38,130
If a mere reporter like me
catches the real killer...

477
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,900
and releases an article...

478
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,170
Wouldn't that be amazing?

479
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,610
You're not listening.

480
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,179
Why do you have
my sister's necklace?

481
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:50,579
What?

482
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,380
My sister's necklace.

483
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:58,920
Oh, that?

484
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,590
That's... Well...

485
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,460
It just happened to...

486
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,030
Hey, that's not hers.

487
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,969
I bought it for her,
so it's actually mine.

488
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,369
She gave it back
when we broke up, okay?

489
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:15,969
I had forgotten about it
then found it in one of the drawers.

490
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,179
I was going to sell it
after fixing it. Is that a problem?

491
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,039
I threw it away.

492
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,610
What?

493
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,750
What gives you the right to...

494
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,280
It was too cheap to sell anyway.

495
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,800
Hyun Su.

496
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,699
I have a question.

497
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,639
How did you become Baek Hee Seong?

498
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,250
Are you interviewing me right now?

499
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,250
Forget about everyone else.
How did you dupe Detective Cha?

500
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,260
- Mu Jin.
- Yes? Go on.

501
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,460
I won't judge.

502
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,260
Ji Won doesn't know anything
about me.

503
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,500
She doesn't know about my past
or that I'm not normal.

504
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:24,539
Do you really have
no affection for her?

505
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,980
They say, having a kid
sparks new feelings.

506
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,619
She's someone I absolutely need.

507
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:39,289
My father...

508
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:43,860
fears her.

509
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,860
If she's by my side,

510
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,969
he can't come close.

511
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,670
What do you mean?

512
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:57,869
You're creeping me out.

513
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,179
Let me make one promise.

514
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,250
What? Hold on.

515
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,719
Why was that in my pocket?

516
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,690
Wait, what are you doing?
I'll do it. Stop.

517
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,489
You can't delete all of them.

518
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,329
I have so many
important interview files in there.

519
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,639
If Ji Won knows about me
as much as you do,

520
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,579
I might really have to kill you.

521
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,619
Gosh, you don't know...

522
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,349
how to make funny jokes.

523
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,019
I'm serious.

524
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:22,159
(Gagyeong-ri)

525
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,739
Now, there are more empty houses
than those that are occupied here.

526
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,980
Come here! I said, come here!

527
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,949
Move aside!

528
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,750
Move!

529
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,309
You're approaching your destination.

530
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,409
Turn right after 300m.

531
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,780
Here. Get ready.

532
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,280
(Oh Bok Ja)

533
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,789
Okay, then. We'll do as we said.

534
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,489
Do you remember everything?

535
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,860
This will be the last time
I explain this, so listen up.

536
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,260
All right.

537
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,900
First, I'll distract her.

538
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,800
- Ms. Oh!
- Goodness.

539
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
- Ms. Bok Ja! It's been ages!
- Oh, my.

540
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,039
- Here.
- Goodness.

541
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,309
Then I'll ask her
to show me your photo...

542
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,440
under the pretense of investigating.

543
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,610
Oh, it was this picture.

544
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,750
After that,

545
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,949
I will send you a text
telling you where the photo is.

546
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:02,349
(In the drawer
under the flower basket)

547
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,920
After that, I will lure her out
of the house,

548
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,989
saying we need to greet
the policemen coming from Seoul.

549
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,960
They're coming from so far away.
We need to go greet them.

550
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:13,159
Of course, we should.

551
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,639
Then you can sneak in
and steal the photo.

552
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,139
I mean, you can gently take it.

553
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:28,739
I'll distract the police.

554
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,079
While I bide time,

555
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,650
you can...

556
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,650
easily get out of there.

557
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,590
Then we'll meet at our hideout.

558
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,000
What do you think? Isn't it simple?

559
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,730
What if she doesn't show you
the photo?

560
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,300
What if you can't lure her outside?

561
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,809
What if you can't distract
the police?

562
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,409
Do you have any other way?

563
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,050
If not, just shut your mouth.

564
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,300
Go hide.

565
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:44,590
Ma'am?

566
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,789
Ms. Oh?

567
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:52,559
I'm Mu Jin, a reporter from Seoul.

568
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:53,860
Kim Mu Jin.

569
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,670
Ma'am, are you inside?

570
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:01,400
Ma'am. Ma'am!

571
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,079
Watch...

572
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,639
- What?
- Watch out.

573
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,179
What did you say?

574
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,010
Watch your back!

575
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:34,099
What is he doing?

576
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,329
Who are you? What do you want?

577
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,699
- Do Hyun Su.
- I don't know you.

578
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,440
Why are you doing this to me?

579
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,070
Although you don't know me,
you probably know Jung Mi Sook well.

580
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,340
What?

581
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,380
Where is Jung Mi Sook?

582
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,280
- "Jung Mi Sook"?
- The police will come soon.

583
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,349
We don't have time to waste
like this.

584
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:59,619
You and I both can't afford
getting caught by the police.

585
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,300
Doesn't that car look familiar?

586
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,130
I think it's Reporter Kim's car.

587
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,230
How did he know this time?

588
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:15,800
Let's leave the police out
and meet secretly.

589
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,880
There's a nice bed and breakfast
beside the fishing spot.

590
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,539
I'll pick you up tonight
with my cab.

591
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:24,280
I've waited so long
for our first date.

592
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,880
Why don't we take time
to get dressed up nicely?

593
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:29,449
Don't you agree?

594
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,119
What on earth do you want?

595
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,630
Ms. Oh Bok Ja, are you inside?

596
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,630
Ms. Oh Bok Ja?

597
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:50,570
Do Hyun Su!

598
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,380
- Reporter Kim!
- Detective Im.

599
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,079
- Reporter Kim.
- Check the lady inside.

600
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,320
Let go!

601
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:49,610
Let go!

602
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,579
I said let go! Let go of me!

603
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,050
Let go!

604
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,389
Let go of me!

605
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:58,889
I said, let go!

606
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,530
Let go.

607
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:06,630
Let go.

608
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,800
Hey, Do Hyun Su! Stop right there!

609
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:13,800
Untie me!

610
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,860
Hello? Hey, where are you?

611
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,960
Hey, I almost died.

612
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,630
What happened?

613
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,300
Jung Mi Sook.
Find out who Jung Mi Sook is.

614
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,199
He mentioned Jung Mi Sook.

615
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:47,739
"Jung Mi Sook"?

616
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,269
"Jung Mi Sook"?
That sounds familiar.

617
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,309
He asked me where she is.

618
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,409
She must be connected to me somehow.

619
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,449
Hello? Hello?

620
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,820
How rude.

621
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:04,420
Jung Mi Sook?

622
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,519
Jung Mi Sook...

623
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:46,929
How can you do this?

624
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,760
Do you know how worried I was?

625
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,170
Hurry up and free me.
I'm so embarrassed.

626
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,500
Are you hurt?

627
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:55,599
No. I'm fine.

628
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,380
But the place is a complete mess.
Are you sure you're okay?

629
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:02,179
Did anything break?

630
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,449
I'm fine.

631
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,380
Hurry up and untie me.

632
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,079
Gosh.

633
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,519
Right. Is Ms. Oh Bok Ja okay?

634
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:13,590
Yes. She was just startled.

635
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:15,619
She wasn't hurt.

636
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,599
But she lost the picture.

637
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,159
We should've caught him.

638
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,800
How did he know about the picture?

639
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,599
Who on earth is Do Hyun Su?

640
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,269
It wasn't Do Hyun Su.

641
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:34,340
What?

642
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,780
Who's Do Hyun Su?

643
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,690
I said, who's Do Hyun Su?

644
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:45,320
He didn't know Do Hyun Su's face?

645
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,590
What's for certain is that
the criminal...

646
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,019
is looking for Do Hyun Su.

647
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,559
Yes. In a radical way at that.

648
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,199
It seems like the criminal
behind this case...

649
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,460
It's not Do Hyun Su.

650
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,360
There's a nice bed and breakfast
beside the fishing spot.

651
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,159
I'll pick you up tonight
with my cab.

652
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,630
Come on in.

653
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:35,269
Let me know if you need anything.

654
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:36,809
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

655
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,019
(Gagyeong-ri Village
Community Center)

656
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,860
Thank you for gathering
at such a late hour.

657
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,320
- Of course.
- It's nothing.

658
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,230
- Of course we should come.
- Yes.

659
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,389
Bok Ja was attacked.

660
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,130
It's so scary. I'm so scared.

661
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,929
Did Do Hyun Su really show up?

662
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,369
See? I was right.

663
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:44,610
He's possessed by a ghost
just like his dad.

664
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,710
- It's so scary.
- We should've...

665
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,539
performed an exorcism back then.

666
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,110
- Yes.
- That's true.

667
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,980
What does Hyun Su have
against this town?

668
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,889
The person we're looking for
isn't Do Hyun Su.

669
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,250
- What is she saying?
- What?

670
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,059
We're looking for the person
who's chasing Do Hyun Su.

671
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,829
Out of all the outsiders
who visited this town,

672
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:05,929
did anyone ask about
Do Hyun Su's whereabouts?

673
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,199
- Gosh.
- There were too many.

674
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,460
Everyone from the city...

675
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,769
ask for Hyun Su.

676
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:14,400
- Yes.
- Specifically what kind of people?

677
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,400
They're directors
from broadcast studios,

678
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,840
- or reporters of newspapers.
- Yes.

679
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,739
Some writers came too.

680
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,809
Also, cops like you too.

681
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:25,579
- Don't call them that.
- I mean, the police.

682
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,519
Please think carefully.

683
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,920
The person we're looking for
has a grudge against Do Hyun Su.

684
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:34,119
- What do we do?
- Gosh.

685
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,360
Could it be that person?

686
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,360
- That person.
- Who?

687
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,500
- You know, that person.
- Who?

688
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,699
- That taxi driver.
- Oh, right.

689
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:45,929
Did you say a taxi driver?

690
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,969
We found it.

691
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:55,110
It was worth it for Detective Oh
to gather the dashcam footage.

692
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,610
You're done now.

693
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,980
What is this? No one got off.

694
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,789
He said he dropped him off
near New Sun Villa.

695

(Im Ho Joon)

696
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,800
- Yes?
- Captain.

697
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,599
It wasn't Do Hyun Su.
We got it wrong.

698
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,300
What? What do you mean?

699
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:23,340
Well, we...

700
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,610
- Is it Captain Lee?
- Yes.

701
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,280
Captain Lee, there's a case
of Do Min Seok's...

702
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,449
where the corpse wasn't found.

703
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,119
Can you look into
that victim's husband?

704
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,219
He'll likely be a taxi driver.

705
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,349
A taxi driver?

706
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,559
(Im Ho Joon)

707
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,119
Can you tell us in detail?

708
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,329
Out of the 7 victims,
1 body was never found...

709
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:47,730
and the case closed.

710
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,699
But the victim's husband
didn't give up and visited...

711
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,769
the town regularly to dig where
the other bodies were found.

712
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:57,610
Mi Sook, I'll find you soon.

713
00:58:57,739 --> 00:59:00,210
Please wait.
Please wait a little longer.

714
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,380
Hey! Mister!

715
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,980
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

716
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,179
Get out!

717
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,389
- They said things looked serious.
- I have to find Mi Sook!

718
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:11,789
He got obsessed and said...

719
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,690
Do Hyun Su is an accomplice
of Do Min Seok.

720
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,929
He believes Do Hyun Su knows
where his wife is buried.

721
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,599
Also, Captain...

722
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:23,460
I don't know how the criminal...

723
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,500
found out about
Ms. Oh Bok Ja's picture.

724
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,099
I think our investigation process...

725
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:30,099
is leaking.

726
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,230
Before Nam Soon Gil died,
he was afraid of Do Hyun Su.

727
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:52,460
By the way,

728
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:54,659
what's with Do Hyun Su's picture?

729
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,230
It's his middle school
graduation picture.

730
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:00,130
In 2002 when Do Hyun Su was 18,

731
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,139
he killed the village foreman
and ran away.

732
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,909
At the time,
he burned down the house.

(Vacant)

743
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,059
Do you mean Do Hyun Su
is an accomplice to serial murder?

744
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,730
On top of that, with his father?

745
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,369
Mi Sook and I made it together
as a couple.

746
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,840
They found Mi Sook's phone...

747
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,070
at Do Min Seok's workshop,
but not this.

748
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,239
If it's as you say,

749
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,809
then Do Hyun Su must have had it.

750
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,420
- Let the police handle...
- The police...

751
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:59,619
has no interest
in catching Do Hyun Su.

752
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,429
Unless he commits a crime...

753
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:08,500
that becomes the talk of the town.

754
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:10,130
Snap out of it, okay?

755
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,570
What's the point in digging up
a dead body?

756
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:15,539
What difference will that make?

757
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:18,639
Thank you for your help today.

758
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,739
What did I do?

759
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,639
You told me about Do Hyun Su,

760
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,179
and it'll help me out greatly.

01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,690
All right, now.

01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:11,030
Stop crying now
since you saw Daddy's face.

766
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:16,929
How could you leave me
while I was sleeping?

767
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,639
Goodness, hurry up
and pick her up.

768
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:29,880
Eun Ha, something suddenly came up.

769
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:31,449
That's why.

770
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:34,619

Yes, I will.

I'll see you soon.

01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:45,949
Ma'am.

779
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,559
Could you take a look at this?

780
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,039
We found this in the storage.

781
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,510
I was wondering if it was yours.

782
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:45,309
This is from me.

783
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,219
I love it. Thank you.

784
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:51,219
I even engraved your initials on it.

I think the abducted victim
is my husband.

787
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,130
You saw how Park Gyung Chun
murdered Nam Soon Gil.

788
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,570
What do I need to do?

789
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,900
Park Gyung Chun
is still around the village.

790
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,500
Drive along the reservoir.

791
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,599
Yes, you can catch up to him.

792
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:47,980
Killing me won't fill up
that empty hole in your imagination.

793
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:50,880
I can't prove something
I don't even know.

794
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,619
Where is my wife, Jung Mi Sook?

795
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,880
Help me!
